 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have a short but sad account of the reigns of two of
 the kings of Judah, Manasseh and Amon. 

 I. Concerning Manasseh, all the account we have of him here is,

 1. That he devoted himself to sin, to all manner of wickedness,
 idolatry, and murder, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:1-9,16">ver. 1-9 and 16</A>.

 2. That therefore God devoted him, and Jerusalem for his sake, to ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:10-18">ver. 10-18</A>.

 In the book of Chronicles we have an account of his troubles, and his
 repentance.

 II. Concerning Amon we are only told that he lived in sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:19-22">ver. 19-22</A>),

 died quickly by the sword, and left good Josiah his successor,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:23-26">ver. 23-26</A>.

 By these two reigns Jerusalem was much debauched and much weakened, and
 so hastened apace towards its destruction, which slumbered not.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Manasseh <I>was</I> twelve years old when he began to reign, and
 reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
 <I>was</I> Hephzibah.
 &nbsp; 2 And he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 after the abominations of the heathen, whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> cast out
 before the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 3 For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his
 father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made
 a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host
 of heaven, and served them.
 &nbsp; 4 And he built altars in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, of which the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.
 &nbsp; 5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two
 courts of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6 And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed
 times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and
 wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to
 provoke <I>him</I> to anger.
 &nbsp; 7 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in
 the house, of which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said to David, and to Solomon his
 son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of
 all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:
 &nbsp; 8 Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of
 the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to
 do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to
 all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.
 &nbsp; 9 But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more
 evil than did the nations whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> destroyed before the
 children of Israel.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 How delightful were our meditations on the last reign! How many 
 pleasing views had we of Sion in its glory (that is, in its purity and 
 in its triumphs), of the king in his beauty! (for 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:17">Isa. xxxiii. 17</A>

 refers to Hezekiah), and (as it follows there,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 Jerusalem was <I>a quiet habitation</I> because <I>a city of
 righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:26">Isa. i. 26</A>.

 But now we have melancholy work upon our hands, unpleasant ground to
 travel, and cannot but drive heavily.  <I>How has the gold become dim 
 and the most fine gold changed!</I> The beauty of Jerusalem is stained, 
 and all her glory, all her joy, sunk and gone. These verses give such 
 an account of this reign as make it, in all respects, the reverse of 
 the last, and, in a manner, the ruin of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Manasseh began young. He was but <I>twelve years old when he began 
 to reign</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 born when his father was about forty-two years old, three years after
 his sickness. If he had sons before, either they were dead, or set by 
 as unpromising. As yet they knew of nothing bad in <I>him,</I> and they 
 hoped he would prove good; but he proved very bad, and perhaps his 
 coming to the crown so young might help to make it so, which yet will 
 by no means excuse him, for his grandson Josiah came to it younger than 
 he and yet acted well. But being young, 

 1. He was puffed up with his honour and proud of it; and thinking
 himself very wise, because he was very great, valued himself upon his 
 undoing what his father had done.  It is too common for novices to be 
 lifted up with pride, and so to <I>fall into the condemnation of the 
 devil.</I> 

 2. He was easily wrought upon and drawn aside by seducers, that lay in
 wait to deceive.  Those that were enemies to Hezekiah's reformation, 
 and retained an affection for the old idolatries, flattered him, and so 
 gained his ear, and used his power at their pleasure. Many have been 
 undone by coming too soon to their honours and estates.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He reigned long, longest of any of the kings of Judah, fifty-five 
 years. This was the only very bad reign that was a long one; Joram's 
 was but eight years, and Ahaz's sixteen; as for Manasseh's, we hope 
 that in the beginning of his reign for some time affairs continued to 
 move in the course that his father left them in, and that in the latter 
 end of his reign, after his repentance, religion got head again; and, 
 no doubt, when things were at the worst God had his remnant that kept 
 their integrity.  Though he reigned long, yet some of this time he was 
 a prisoner in Babylon, which may well be looked upon as a drawback from 
 these years, though they are reckoned in the number because then he 
 repented and began to reform.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He reigned very ill.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In general, 

 (1.) <I>He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord,</I> and
 which, having been well educated, he could not but know was so

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>He wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord,</I> as if on
 purpose to provoke him to anger, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 (2.) <I>He did after the abominations of the heathen</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)
 
 and as did Ahab
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 not taking warning by the destruction both of the nations of Canaan and
 the house of Ahab for their idolatry; nay

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 he <I>did more evil than did the nations whom the Lord destroyed.</I>
 When the holy seed degenerate, they are commonly worse than the worst 
 of the profane.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. More particularly, 

 (1.) He <I>rebuilt the high places which his father had destroyed,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Thus did he trample upon the dust, and affront the memory, of his
 worthy father, though he knew how much he was favoured of God and 
 honoured of men. He concurred, it is probable, with Rabshakeh's 
 sentiments

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:22"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 22</A>),

 that Hezekiah had done ill in destroying those high places, and
 pretended the honour of God, and the edification and convenience of the 
 people, in rebuilding them. This he began with, but proceeded to that 
 which was much worse; for, 

 (2.) He set up other gods, <I>Baal</I> and <I>Ashtaroth</I> (which we
 translate <I>a grove</I>), and all the host of heaven, the sun and 
 moon, the other planets, and the constellations; these he worshipped 
 and served

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 gave their names to the images he made, and then did homage to them and
 prayed for help from them. To these he built altars

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and offered sacrifices, no doubt, on these altars.

 (3.) He <I>made his son pass through the fire,</I> by which he
 dedicated him a votary to Moloch, in contempt of the seal of 
 circumcision by which he had been dedicated to God.

 (4.) He made the devil his oracle, and, in contempt both of urim and
 prophecy, he <I>used enchantments and dealt with familiar spirits</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 like Saul. Conjurers and fortune-tellers (who pretended, by the stars
 or the clouds, lucky and unlucky days, good and bad omens, the flight 
 of birds, or the entrails of beasts, to foretel things to come) were 
 great men with him, his intimates, his confidants; their arts pleased 
 his fancy, and gained his belief, and his counsels were under their 
 direction.

 (5.) We find afterwards
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 that he shed innocent blood very much in gratification of his own
 passion and revenge; some perhaps were secretly murdered, others taken 
 off by colour of law. Probably much of the blood he shed was theirs 
 that opposed idolatry and witnessed against it, that would not bow the 
 knee to Baal. The <I>blood of the prophets</I> is, in a particular 
 manner, charged upon Jerusalem, and it is probable that he put to death 
 many of them. The tradition of the Jews is that he caused the prophet 
 Isaiah to be sawn asunder; and many think the apostle refers to this in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:37">Heb. xi. 37</A>,

 where he speaks of those that had so suffered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Three things are here mentioned as aggravations of Manasseh's 
 idolatry:--

 (1.) That he set up his images and altars <I>in the house of the
 Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 in the two courts of the temple
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 in the very house of which God had said to Solomon, <I>Here will I put
 my name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Thus he defied God to his face, and impudently affronted him with his
 rivals immediately under his eye, as one that was neither afraid of 
 God's wrath nor ashamed of his own folly and wickedness. Thus he 
 desecrated what had been consecrated to God, and did, in effect, turn 
 God out of his own house and put the rebels in possession of it. Thus, 
 when the faithful worshippers of God came to the place he had appointed 
 for the performance of their duty to him, they found, to their great 
 grief and terror, other gods ready to receive their offerings. God had 
 said that here he would record his name, here he would put it for ever, 
 and here it was accordingly preserved, while the idolatrous altars were 
 kept at a distance; but Manasseh, by bringing them into God's house, 
 did what he could to alter the property, and to make the name of the 
 God of Israel to be no more in remembrance.

 (2.) That hereby he put a great slight upon the word of God, and his
 covenant with Israel. Observe the favour he had shown to that people in 
 putting his name among them,--the kindness he intended them, never to 
 <I>make them move out of that good land,</I>--and the reasonableness of 
 his expectations from them, <I>only if they will observe to do 
 according to all that I have commanded them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 Upon these good terms did Israel stand with God, and had as fair a
 prospect of being happy as any people could have; but <I>they hearkened 
 not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 They would not be kept close to God either by his precepts or by his
 promises; both were cast behind their back.

 (3.) That hereby he seduced the people of God, debauched them, and drew
 them into idolatry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 He caused Judah to sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 as Jeroboam had caused <I>Israel to sin.</I> His very example was
 enough to corrupt the generality of unthinking people, who would do as 
 their king did, right or wrong. All that aimed at preferment would do 
 as the court did; and others thought it safest to comply, for fear of 
 making their king their enemy. Thus, one way or other, the holy city 
 became a harlot, and Manasseh made her so. Those will have a great deal 
 to answer for that not only are wicked themselves, but help to make 
 others so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake by his servants the prophets, saying,
 &nbsp; 11 Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations,
 <I>and</I> hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which
 <I>were</I> before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his
 idols:
 &nbsp; 12 Therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, Behold, I <I>am</I>
 bringing <I>such</I> evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever
 heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.
 &nbsp; 13 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and
 the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as <I>a
 man</I> wipeth a dish, wiping <I>it,</I> and turning <I>it</I> upside down.
 &nbsp; 14 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and
 deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall
 become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;
 &nbsp; 15 Because they have done <I>that which was</I> evil in my sight,
 and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came
 forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.
 &nbsp; 16 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had
 filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin
 wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing <I>that which was</I> evil in
 the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 17 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did,
 and his sin that he sinned, <I>are</I> they not written in the book of
 the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
 &nbsp; 18 And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
 garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son
 reigned in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the doom of Judah and Jerusalem read, and it is heavy doom. The 
 prophets were sent, in the first place, to teach them the knowledge of 
 God, to remind them of their duty and direct them in it. If they 
 succeeded not in that, their next work was to reprove them for their 
 sins, and to set them in view before them, that they might repent and 
 reform, and return to their duty. If in this they prevailed not, but 
 sinners went on frowardly, their next work was to foretel the judgments 
 of God, that the terror of them might awaken those to repentance who 
 would not be made sensible of the obligations of his love, or else that 
 the execution of them, in their season, might be a demonstration of the 
 divine mission of the prophets that foretold them. The prophets were 
 deputed judges to those that would not hear and receive them as 
 teachers. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A recital of the crime. The indictment is read upon which the 
 judgment is grounded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Manasseh had done wickedly himself, though he knew better things, had
 even justified the Amorites, whose copy he wrote after, by outdoing 
 them in impieties, and debauched the people of God, whom he had taught 
 to sin and forced to sin; and besides that (though that was bad enough) 
 <I>he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 had multiplied his murders in every corner of the city, and filled the
 measure of Jerusalem's blood-guiltiness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:32">Matt. xxiii. 32</A>)

 up to the brim, and all this against the crown and dignity of the King
 of kings, the peace of his kingdom, and the statutes in these cases 
 made and provided.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A prediction of the judgment God would bring upon them for this: 
 <I>They have done that which was evil,</I> and therefore <I>I am 
 bringing evil upon them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 it will come and it is not far off. The judgment should be, 

 1. Very terrible and amazing; the very report of it should <I>make
 men's ears to tingle</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 that is, their hearts to tremble. It should make a great noise in the
 world and occasion many speculations. 

 2. It should be copied out (as the sins of Jerusalem had been) from
 Samaria and the house of Ahab, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 When God lays righteousness to the line it shall be the line of
 Samaria, measuring out to Jerusalem that which had been the lot of 
 Samaria; when he lays judgment to the plummet it shall be <I>the 
 plummet of the house of Ahab,</I> marking out for the same ruin to 
 which that wretched family was devoted. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:17">Isa. xxviii. 17</A>.

 Note, Those who resemble and imitate others in their sins must expect
 to fare as they fared.

 3. That it should be an utter destruction: <I>I will wipe it as a man
 wipes a dish.</I> This intimates,

 (1.) That every thing should be put into disorder, and their state
 subverted; they should be turned upside down, and all their foundations 
 put out of course.

 (2.) That the city should be emptied of its inhabitants, which had been
 the filth of it, as a dish is emptied when it is wiped: "They shall all 
 be carried captive, the <I>land shall enjoy her sabbaths,</I> and be 
 laid by as a dish when it is wiped." See the comparison of the boiled 
 pot, not much unlike this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+24:1-14">Ezek. xxiv. 1-14</A>.

 (3.) That yet this should be in order to the purifying, not the
 destroying, of Jerusalem. The dish shall not be dropped, not broken to 
 pieces, or melted down, but only wiped. This shall be the fruit, the 
 taking away of the sinners first, and then of the sin. 

 4. That <I>therefore</I> they should be destroyed, because they should
 be deserted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance.</I> Justly are those
 that forsake God forsaken of him; nor does he ever leave any till they 
 have first left him: but, when God has forsaken a people, their defence 
 has departed, and they become a prey, an easy prey, to all their 
 enemies. Sin is spoken of here as the alpha and omega of their 
 miseries.

 (1.) Old guilt came in remembrance, as that which began to fill the
 measure

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>They have provoked me to anger</I> from their conception and birth
 as a people, <I>since the day their fathers came out of Egypt.</I>" The 
 men of this generation, treading in their fathers' steps, are justly 
 reckoned with for their fathers' sins.

 (2.) The guilt of blood was that which filled the measure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Nothing has a louder cry, nor brings a sorer vengeance, than that.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is all we have here of Manasseh; he stands convicted and 
 condemned; but we hope in the book of Chronicles to hear of his 
 repentance, and acceptance with God. Meantime, we must be content, in 
 this place, to have only one intimation of his repentance (for so we 
 are willing to take it), that he was buried, it is likely by his own 
 order, <I>in the garden of his own house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 for, being truly humbled for his sins, he judged himself <I>no more
 worthy to be called a son,</I> a son of David, and therefore not worthy 
 to have even his dead body buried <I>in the sepulchres of his 
 fathers.</I> True penitents take shame to themselves, not honour; yet, 
 having lost the credit of an innocent, the credit of a penitent was the 
 next best he was capable of.  And better it is, and more honourable, 
 for a sinner to die repenting, and be buried in a garden, than to die 
 impenitent, and be buried in the abbey.</P>

 &nbsp; 20 And he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 as his father Manasseh did.
 &nbsp; 21 And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and
 served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:
 &nbsp; 22 And he forsook the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of his fathers, and walked not
 in the way of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 23 And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the
 king in his own house.
 &nbsp; 24 And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
 against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son
 king in his stead.
 &nbsp; 25 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, <I>are</I> they
 not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
 &nbsp; 26 And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza:
 and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.

 Here is a short account of the short and inglorious reign of Amon, the 
 son of Manasseh. Whether Manasseh, in his blind and brutish zeal for 
 his idols, had sacrificed his other sons--or whether, having been
 dedicated to his idols, they were refused by the people--so it was that
 his successor was a son not born till he was forty-five years old. And 
 of him we are here told, 

 1. That his reign was very wicked: <I>He forsook the God of his
 fathers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 disobeyed the commands given to his fathers, and disclaimed the
 covenant made with his fathers, <I>and walked not in the way of the 
 Lord,</I> but <I>in all the way which his father walked in,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 He trod in the steps of his father's idolatry, and revived that which
 he, in the latter end of his days, had put down. Note, Those who set 
 bad examples, though they may repent themselves, yet cannot be sure 
 that those whom they have drawn into sin by their example will repent; 
 it is often otherwise. 

 2. That his end was very tragical. He having rebelled against God, his
 own servants <I>conspired against him and slew him,</I> probably upon 
 some personal disgust, when he had reigned but two years, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 His servants, who should have guarded him, murdered him; his own house,
 that should have been his castle of defence, was the place of his 
 execution. He had profaned God's house with his idols, and now God 
 suffered his own house to be polluted with his blood. How unrighteous 
 soever those were that did it, God was righteous who suffered it to be 
 done. Two things the people of the land did, by their representatives, 
 hereupon:--

 (1.) They did justice on the traitors that had slain the king, and put
 them to death; for, though he was a <I>bad</I> king, he was 
 <I>their</I> king, and it was a part of their allegiance to him to 
 avenge his death. Thus they cleared themselves from having any hand in 
 the crime, and did what was incumbent on them to deter others from the 
 like villainous practices.

 (2.) They did a kindness to themselves in <I>making Josiah his son king
 in his stead,</I> whom probably the conspirators had a design to put 
 by, but the people stood by him and settled him in the throne, 
 encouraged, it may be, by the indications he gave, even in his early 
 days, of a good disposition. Now they made a happy change from one of 
 the worst to one of the best of all the kings of Judah. "Once more," 
 says God, "they shall be tried with a reformation; and, if that 
 succeed, well; if not, then after that I will cut them down." Amon was 
 buried in the same garden where his father was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+21:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 If his father put himself under that humiliation, the people will put
 him under it.</P>
