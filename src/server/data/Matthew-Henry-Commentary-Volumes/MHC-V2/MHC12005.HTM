 Two more of Elisha's miracles are recorded in this chapter. 

 I. The cleansing of Naaman, a Syrian, a stranger, from his leprosy, and
 there,

 1. The badness of his case, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:1">ver. 1</A>.

 2. The providence that brought him to Elisha, the intelligence given
 him by a captive maid, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>.

 A letter from the king of Syria to the king of Israel, to introduce him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 And the invitation Elisha sent him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:8">ver. 8</A>.

 3. The method prescribed for his cure, his submission, with much ado,
 to that method, and his cure thereby, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:9-14">ver. 9-14</A>.

 4. The grateful acknowledgments he made to Elisha hereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:15-19">ver. 15-19</A>.
 
 II. The smiting of Gehazi, his own servant, with that leprosy. 

 1. Gehazi's sins, which were belying his master to Naaman

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:20-24">ver. 20-24</A>),

 and lying to his master when he examined him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:25">ver. 25</A>.

 2.  His punishment for these sins.  Naaman's leprosy was entailed on
 his family, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:26,27">ver. 26, 27</A>.

 And, if Naaman's cure was typical of the calling of the Gentiles, as
 our Saviour seems to make it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:27">Luke iv. 27</A>),

 Gehazi's stroke may be looked upon as typical of the blinding and
 rejecting of the Jews, who envied God's grace to the Gentiles, as 
 Gehazi envied Elisha's favour to Naaman.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a
 great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man
 in valour, <I>but he was</I> a leper.
 &nbsp; 2 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought
 away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she
 waited on Naaman's wife.
 &nbsp; 3 And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord <I>were</I> with
 the prophet that <I>is</I> in Samaria! for he would recover him of his
 leprosy.
 &nbsp; 4 And <I>one</I> went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus
 said the maid that <I>is</I> of the land of Israel.
 &nbsp; 5 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a
 letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with
 him ten talents of silver, and six thousand <I>pieces</I> of gold, and
 ten changes of raiment.
 &nbsp; 6 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now
 when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have <I>therewith</I>
 sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of
 his leprosy.
 &nbsp; 7 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the
 letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, <I>Am</I> I God, to kill
 and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a
 man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how
 he seeketh a quarrel against me.
 &nbsp; 8 And it was <I>so,</I> when Elisha the man of God had heard that
 the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the
 king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come
 now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our saviour's miracles were intended for the lost sheep of the house of 
 Israel, yet one, like a crumb, fell from the table to a woman of 
 Canaan; so this one miracle Elisha wrought for Naaman, a Syrian; for 
 God does good to all, and will have all men to be saved. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The great affliction Naaman was under, in the midst of all his 
 honours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He was a great man, in a great place; not only rich and raised, but
 particularly happy for two things:--

 1. That he had been very serviceable to his country. God made him so:
 <I>By him the Lord had</I> often <I>given deliverance to Syria,</I> 
 success in their wars even with Israel. The preservation and prosperity 
 even of those that do not know God and serve him must be ascribed to 
 him, for <I>he is the Saviour of all men,</I> but <I>especially of 
 those that believe.</I> Let Israel know that when the Syrians prevailed 
 it was from the Lord.  

 2. That he was very acceptable to his prince, was his favourite, and
 prime-minister of state; so great was he, so high, so honourable, and a 
 mighty man of valour; but he was a leper, was under that loathsome 
 disease, which made him a burden to himself.  Note,

 (1.) No man's greatness, or honour, or interest, or valour, or victory,
 can set him out of the reach of the sorest calamities of human life; 
 there is many a sickly crazy body under rich and gay clothing.

 (2.) Every man has some <I>but</I> or other in his character, something
 that blemishes and diminishes him, some allay to his grandeur, some 
 damp to his joy; he may be very happy, very good, yet, in something or 
 other, not so good as he should be nor so happy as he would be. Naaman 
 was a great as the world could make him, and yet (as bishop Hall 
 expresses it) the basest slave in Syria would not change skins with 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The notice that was given him of Elisha's power, by a little maid 
 that waited on his lady, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 This maid was, by birth, an Israelite, providentially carried captive
 into Syria, and there preferred into Naaman's family, where she 
 published Elisha's fame to the honour of Israel and Israel's God. The 
 unhappy dispersing of the people of God has sometimes proved the happy 
 occasion of the diffusion of the knowledge of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:4">Acts viii. 4</A>.

 This little maid,

 1. As became a true-born Israelite, consulted the honour of her
 country, and could give an account, though but a girl, of the famous 
 prophet they had among them. Children should betimes acquaint 
 themselves with the wondrous works of God, that, wherever they go, they 
 may have them to talk of. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:2">Ps. viii. 2</A>.

 2. As became a good servant, she desired the health and welfare of her
 master, though she was a captive, a servant by force; much more should 
 servants of choice seek their masters' good.  The Jews in Babylon were 
 to seek the peace of the land of their captivity. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:7">Jer. xxix. 7</A>.
 
 <I>Elisha</I> had <I>not cleansed any leper in Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:27">Luke iv. 27</A>),

 yet this little maid, from the other miracles he had wrought, inferred
 that he <I>could</I> cure her master, and from his common beneficence 
 inferred that he <I>would</I> do it, though he was a Syrian. Servants 
 may be blessings to the families where they are, by telling what they 
 know of the glory of God and the honour of his prophets.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The application which the king of Syria hereupon made to the king 
 of Israel on Naaman's behalf. Naaman took notice of the intelligence, 
 though given by a simple maid, and did not despise it for the sake of 
 her meanness, when it tended to his bodily health. He did not say, "The
 girl talks like a fool; how can any prophet of Israel do that for me 
 which all the physicians of Syria have attempted in vain?" Though he 
 neither loved nor honoured the Jewish nation, yet, if one of that 
 nation can but cure him of his leprosy, he will thankfully acknowledge 
 the obligation. O that those who are spiritually diseased would hearken 
 thus readily to the tidings brought them of the great Physician! See 
 what Naaman did upon this little hint. 

 1. He would not send for the prophet to come to him, but such honour
 would he pay to one that had so much of a divine power with him as to 
 be able to cure diseases that he would go to him himself, though he 
 himself was sickly, unfit for society, the journey long, and the 
 country an enemy's; princes, he thinks, must stoop to prophets when 
 they need them. 

 2. He would not go <I>incognito--in disguise,</I> though his errand
 proclaimed his loathsome disease, but went in state, and with a great 
 retinue, to do the more honour to the prophet. 

 3. He would not go empty-handed, but took with him gold, silver, and
 raiment, to present to his physician.  Those that have wealth, and want 
 health show which they reckon the more valuable blessing; what will 
 they not give for ease, and strength, and soundness of body? 

 4. He would not go without a letter to the king of Israel from the king
 his master, who did himself earnestly desire his recovery. He knows not 
 where in Samaria to find this wonder-working prophet, but takes it for 
 granted the king knows where to find him; and, to engage the prophet to 
 do his utmost for Naaman, he will go to him supported with the interest 
 of two kings. If the king of Syria must entreat his help, he hopes the 
 king of Israel, being his liege-lord, may command it. The gifts of the 
 subject must all be (he thinks) for the service and honour of the 
 prince, and therefore he desires the king that he would <I>recover the 
 leper</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 taking it for granted that there was a greater intimacy between the
 king and the prophet than really there was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The alarm this gave to the king of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He apprehended there was in this letter,

 1. A great affront upon God, and therefore he rent his clothes,
 according to the custom of the Jews when they heard or read that which 
 they thought blasphemous; and what less could it be than to attribute 
 to him a divine power? "<I>Am I a God, to kill</I> whom I will, and 
 <I>make alive</I> whom I will? No, I pretend not to such an authority." 
 Nebuchadnezzar did, as we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:19">Dan. v. 19</A>.

 "<I>Am I a God, to kill</I> with a word, <I>and make alive</I> with a
 word? No, I pretend not to such a power;" thus this great man, this bad 
 man, is made to own that he is but a man. Why did he not, with this 
 consideration, correct himself for his idolatry, and reason 
 thus:--Shall I worship those as gods that can neither kill nor make 
 alive, can <I>do neither good nor evil?</I>

 2. A bad design upon himself. He appeals to those about him for this:
 "<I>See how he seeketh a quarrel against me;</I> he requires me to 
 recover the leper, and if I do not, though I cannot, he will make that 
 a pretence to wage war with me," which he suspects the rather because 
 Naaman is his general. Had he rightly understood the meaning of the
 letter, that when the king wrote to him to recover the leper he meant 
 that he would take care he might be recovered, he would not have been 
 in this fright. Note, We often create a great deal of uneasiness to 
 ourselves by misinterpreting the words and actions of others that are 
 well intended: it is charity to ourselves to think no evil. If he had 
 bethought himself of Elisha, and his power, he would easily have 
 understood the letter, and have known what he had to do; but he is put 
 into this confusion by making himself a stranger to the prophet: the 
 captive maid had him more in her thoughts than the king had.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The proffer which Elisha made of his services. He was willing to do 
 any thing to make his prince easy, though he was neglected and his 
 former good services were forgotten by him. Hearing on which occasion 
 the king had rent his clothes, he sent to him to let him know that if 
 his patient would come to him he should not lose his labour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):
 
 <I>He shall know that there is a prophet in Israel</I> (and it were sad
 with Israel if there were not), that there is a prophet in Israel who 
 can do that which the king of Israel dares not attempt, which the 
 prophets of Syria cannot pretend to. It was not for his own honour, but 
 for the honour of God, that he coveted to make them all know <I>that 
 there was a prophet in Israel,</I> though obscure and overlooked.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and
 stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
 &nbsp; 10 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in
 Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and
 thou shalt be clean.
 &nbsp; 11 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I
 thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on
 the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God, and strike his hand over the place,
 and recover the leper.
 &nbsp; 12 <I>Are</I> not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than
 all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean?
 So he turned and went away in a rage.
 &nbsp; 13 And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My
 father, <I>if</I> the prophet had bid thee <I>do some</I> great thing,
 wouldest thou not have done <I>it?</I> how much rather then, when he
 saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?
 &nbsp; 14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan,
 according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came
 again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the cure of Naaman's leprosy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The short and plain direction which the prophet gave him, with 
 assurance of success. Naaman designed to do honour to Elisha when he 
 came in his chariot, and with all his retinue, to Elisha's door, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 Those that showed little respect to prophets at other times were very
 complaisant to them when they needed them. He attended at Elisha's door 
 as a beggar for an alms. Those that would be cleansed from the 
 spiritual leprosy must wait at <I>Wisdom's gate, and watch at the posts 
 of her doors.</I> Naaman expected to have his compliment returned, but 
 Elisha gave him his answer without any formality, would not go to the 
 door to him, lest he should seem too much pleased with the honour done 
 him, but sent a messenger to him, saying, <I>Go wash in Jordan seven 
 times,</I> and promising him that if he did so his disease should be 
 cured. The promise was express: <I>Thou shalt be clean.</I> The method 
 prescribed was plain: <I>Go wash in Jordan.</I> This was not intended 
 as any means of the cure; for, though cold bathing is recommended by 
 many as a very wholesome thing, yet some think that in the case of a 
 leprosy it was rather hurtful. But it was intended as a sign of the 
 cure, and a trial of his obedience. Those that will be helped of God 
 must do as they are bidden. But why did Elisha send a messenger to him 
 with these directions? 

 1. Because he had retired, at this time, for devotion, was intent upon
 his prayers for the cure, and would not be diverted; or, 

 2. Because he knew Naaman to be a proud man, and he would let him know
 that before the great God all men stand upon the same level.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Naaman's disgust at the method prescribed, because it was not what 
 he expected. Two things disgusted him:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That Elisha, as he thought, put a slight upon his person, in sending 
 him orders by a servant, and not coming to him himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Being big with the expectation of a cure, he had been fancying how this
 cure would be wrought, and the scheme he had laid was this: "<I>He will 
 surely come out to me,</I> that is the least he can do to me, a peer of 
 Syria, to me that have come to him in all this state, to me that have 
 so often been victorious over Israel. <I>He will stand,</I> and <I>call 
 on the name of his God,</I> and name me in his prayer, and then he will 
 <I>wave his hand over the place,</I> and so effect the cure." And, 
 because the thing was not done just thus, he fell into a passion, 
 forgetting,

 (1.) That he was a leper, and the law of Moses, which Elisha would
 religiously observe, shut lepers out from society--a leper, and 
 therefore he ought not to insist upon the punctilios of honor.  Note, 
 Many have hearts unhumbled under humbling providences; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:14">Num. xii. 14</A>.

 (2.) That he was a petitioner, suing for a favour which he could not
 demand; and beggars must not be choosers, patients must not prescribe 
 to their physicians. See in Naaman the folly of pride. A cure will not 
 content him unless he be cured with ceremony, with a great deal of pomp 
 and parade; he scorns to be healed, unless he be humoured.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That Elisha, as he thought, put a slight upon his country. He took 
 it hard that he must be sent to wash in Jordan, a river of Israel, when 
 he thought <I>Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all 
 the waters of Israel.</I> How magnificently does he speak of these two 
 rivers that watered Damascus, which soon after fell into one, called by 
 geographers <I>Chrysoroas--the golden stream!</I> How scornfully does he
 speak of all the waters of Israel, though God had called the land of 
 Israel <I>the glory of all lands,</I> and particularly for its 
 <I>brooks of water!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:7">Deut. viii. 7</A>.

 So common it is for God and man to differ in their judgments. How
 slightly does he speak of the prophet's directions! <I>May I not wash 
 in them and be clean?</I> He might wash in them and be clean from dirt, 
 but not wash in them and be clean from leprosy. He was angry that the 
 prophet bade him wash and be clean; he thought that the prophet must do 
 all and was not pleased that he was bidden to do any thing,--or he 
 thought this too cheap, too plain, too common a thing for so great a 
 man to be cured by,--or he did not believe it would at all effect the 
 cure, or, if it would, what medicinal virtue was there in Jordan more 
 than in the rivers of Damascus? But he did not consider, 

 (1.) That Jordan belonged to Israel's God, from whom he was to expect
 the cure, and not from the gods of Damascus; it watered the Lord's 
 land, the holy land, and, in a miraculous cure, relation to God was 
 much more considerable than the depth of the channel or the beauty of 
 the stream.

 (2.) That Jordan had more than once before this obeyed the commands of
 omnipotence. It had of old yielded a passage to Israel, and of late to 
 Elijah and Elisha, and therefore was fitter for such a purpose than 
 those rivers which had only observed the common law of their creation, 
 and had never been thus distinguished; but, above all, 

 (3.) Jordan was the river appointed, and, if he expected a cure from
 the divine power, he ought to acquiesce in the divine will, without 
 asking why or wherefore. Note, It is common for those that are wise in 
 their own conceit to look with contempt on the dictates and 
 prescriptions of divine wisdom and to prefer their own fancies before 
 them; those that are for <I>establishing their own righteousness</I> 
 will not <I>submit to the righteousness of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:3">Rom. x. 3</A>.

 Naaman talked himself into such a heat (as passionate men usually do)
 that he turned away from the prophet's door in a rage, ready to swear 
 he would never have any thing more to say to Elisha; and who then would 
 be the loser? Note, <I>Those that observe lying vanities forsake their 
 own mercies.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+2:8">Jonah ii. 8</A>.

 Proud men are the worst enemies to themselves and forego their own
 redemption.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The modest advice which his servants gave him, to observe the 
 prophet's prescriptions, with a tacit reproof of his resentments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Though at other times they kept their distance, and now saw him in a
 passion, yet, knowing him to be a man that would hear reason at any 
 time, and from any body (a good character of great men, and a very rare 
 one), they drew near, and made bold to argue the matter a little with 
 him. They had conceived a great opinion of the prophet (having, 
 perhaps, heard more of him from the common people, whom they had 
 conversed with, than Naaman had heard from the king and courtiers, whom 
 he had conversed with), and therefore begged of him to consider: "<I>If 
 the prophet had bidden thee to do some great thing,</I> had ordered 
 thee into a tedious course of physic, or to submit to some painful 
 operation, blistering, or cupping, or salivating, <I>Wouldst thou not 
 have done it?</I> No doubt thou wouldst. And wilt thou not submit to so 
 easy a method as this, <I>Wash and be clean?" </I> Observe,

 1. His own servants gave him this reproof and counsel, which was no
 more disparagement to him than that he had intelligence of one that 
 could cure him from his wife's maid, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Note, It is a great mercy to have those about us that will be free with
 us, and faithfully tell us of our faults and follies, though they be 
 our inferiors. Masters must be willing to hear reason from their 
 servants, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:13,14">Job xxxi. 13, 14</A>.

 As we should be deaf to the counsel of the ungodly, though given by the
 greatest and most venerable names, so we should have our ear open to 
 good advice, though brought us by those who are much below us: no 
 matter who speaks, if the thing be well said.

 2. The reproof was very modest and respectful. They call him
 <I>Father;</I> for servants must honour and obey their masters with a 
 kind of filial affection. In giving reproof or counsel we must make it 
 appear that it comes from love and true honour, and that we intend, not 
 reproach, but reformation. 

 3. It was very rational and considerate. If the rude and unthinking
 servants had stirred up their master's angry resentment, and offered to 
 avenge his quarrel upon the prophet, who (he thought) affronted him, 
 how mischievous would the consequences have been! Fire from heaven, 
 probably, upon them all! But they, to our great surprise, took the 
 prophet's part. Elisha, though it is likely he perceived that what he 
 had said had put Naaman out of humour, did not care to pacify him: it 
 was at his peril if he persisted in his wrath.  But his servants were 
 made use of by Providence to reduce him to temper. They reasoned with 
 him,

 (1.) From his earnest desire of a cure: <I>Wouldst thou not do</I> any
 thing? Note, When diseased sinners come to this, that they are content 
 to do any thing, to submit to any thing, to part with any thing, for a 
 cure, then, and not till then, there begin to be some hopes of them. 
 Then they will take Christ on his own terms when they are made willing 
 to have Christ upon any terms.

 (2.) From the easiness of the method prescribed: "It is but, <I>Wash
 and be clean.</I> It is but trying; the experiment is cheap and easy, 
 it can do no hurt, but may do good." Note, the methods prescribed for 
 the healing of the leprosy of sin are so plain that we are utterly 
 inexcusable if we do not observe them. It is but, "Believe, and be 
 saved"--"Repent, and be pardoned"--"Wash, and be clean."</P>

 IV. The cure effected, in the use of the means prescribed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 Naaman, upon second thoughts, yielded to make the experiment, yet, it
 should seem, with no great faith and resolution; for, whereas the 
 prophet bade him wash in Jordan seven times, he did but dip himself so 
 many times, as lightly as he could. However God was pleased so far to 
 honour himself and his word as to make that effectual. <I>His flesh 
 came again, like the flesh of a child.</I> to his great surprise and 
 joy. This men get by yielding to the will of God, by attending to his 
 institutions. His being cleansed by washing put an honour on the law 
 for cleansing lepers. God will magnify his word above all his name.</P>

 and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know
 that <I>there is</I> no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now
 therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.
 &nbsp; 16 But he said, <I>As</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth, before whom I stand, I
 will receive none. And he urged him to take <I>it;</I> but he refused.
 &nbsp; 17 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given
 to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will
 henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other
 gods, but unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 18 In this thing the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> pardon thy servant, <I>that</I> when my

 servant in this thing.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Of the ten lepers that our Saviour cleansed, the only one that 
 <I>returned to give thanks</I> was a <I>Samaritan,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:16">Luke xvii. 16</A>.

 This Syrian did so, and here expresses himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Convinced of the power of the God of Israel, not only that he is 
 God, but that he is God alone, and that indeed <I>there is no God in 
 all the earth but in Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)--
 
 a noble confession, but such as intimates the misery of the Gentile
 world; for the nations that had many gods really had no God, but were 
 without God in the world. He had formerly thought the gods of Syria 
 gods indeed, but now experience had rectified his mistake, and he knew 
 Israel's God was God alone, the sovereign Lord of all. Had he seen 
 other lepers cleansed, perhaps the sight would not have convinced him, 
 but the mercy of the cure affected him more than the miracle of it. 
 Those are best able to speak of the power of divine grace who have 
 themselves experienced it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Grateful to Elisha the prophet: "Therefore, for his sake whose 
 servant thou art, I have a present for thee, silver, and gold, and 
 raiment, whatever thou wilt please to accept." He valued the cure, not 
 by the easiness of it to the prophet, but the acceptableness of it to 
 himself, and would gladly pay for it accordingly. But Elisha generously 
 refused the fee, though urged to accept it; and, to prevent further 
 importunity, backed his refusal with an oath: <I>As the Lord liveth, I 
 will receive none</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 not because he did not need it, for he was poor enough, and knew what
 to do with it, and how to bestow it among the sons of the prophets, nor 
 because he thought it unlawful, for he received presents from others; 
 but he would not be beholden to this Syrian, nor should <I>he</I> say, 
 <I>I have made Elisha rich,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:23">Gen. xiv. 23</A>.

 It would be much for the honour of God to show this new convert that
 the servants of the God of Israel were taught to look upon the wealth 
 of this world with a holy contempt, which would confirm him in his 
 belief that <I>there was no God but in Israel.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:18,2Co+11:9">1 Cor. ix. 18; 2 Cor. xi. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Proselyted to the worship of the God of Israel. He will not only 
 offer a sacrifice to the Lord, in thanks for his present cure, but he 
 resolves he will never offer sacrifice to any other gods, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 It was a happy cure of his leprosy which cured him of his idolatry, a
 more dangerous disease. But here are two instances of his weakness and 
 infirmity in his conversion:--

 1. In one instance he over-did it, that he would not only worship the
 God of Israel, but he would have clods of earth out of the prophet's 
 garden, or at least of the prophet's ordering, to <I>make an altar 
 of,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He that awhile ago had spoken very slightly of the waters of Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 now is in another extreme, and over-values the earth of Israel,
 supposing (since God has appointed <I>altars of earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:24">Exod. xx. 24</A>)

 that an altar of that earth would be most acceptable to him, not
 considering that all <I>the earth is the Lord's and the fulness 
 thereof.</I> Or perhaps the transport of his affection and veneration 
 for the prophet, not only upon the account of his power, but of his 
 virtue and generosity, made him, as we say, love the very ground he 
 went upon and desire to have some of it home with him. The modern 
 compliment equivalent to this would be, "Pray, sir, let me have your 
 picture." 

 2. In another instance he under-did it, that he reserved to himself a
 liberty to bow in the house of Rimmon, in complaisance to the king his 
 master, and according to the duty of his place at court

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 <I>in this thing</I> he must be excused. He owns he ought not to do it,
 but that he cannot otherwise not do it, but that he cannot otherwise 
 keep his place,--protests that his bowing is not, nor ever shall be, as 
 it had been, in honour to the idol, but only in honour to the 
 king,--and therefore he hopes God will forgive him. Perhaps, all things 
 considered, this might admit of some apology, though it was not 
 justifiable. But, as to us, I am sure,

 (1.) If, in covenanting with God, we make a reservation for any known
 sin, which we will continue to indulge ourselves in, that reservation 
 is a defeasance of his covenant.  We must cast away all our 
 transgressions and not except any house of Rimmon.

 (2.) Though we are encouraged to pray for the remission of the sins we
 have committed, yet, if we ask for a dispensation to go on in any sin 
 for the future, we mock God, and deceive ourselves.

 (3.) Those that know not how to quit a place at court when they cannot
 keep it without sinning against God, and wronging their consciences, do 
 not rightly value the divine favour.

 (4.) Those that truly hate evil will make conscience of abstaining from
 all appearances of evil. Though Naaman's dissembling his religion 
 cannot be approved, yet because his promise to offer no sacrifice to 
 any god but the God of Israel only was a great point gained with a 
 Syrian, and because, by asking pardon in this matter, he showed such a 
 degree of conviction and ingenuousness as gave hopes of improvement, 
 the prophet took fair leave of him, and bade him <I>Go in peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 Young converts must be tenderly dealt with.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said,
 Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not
 receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, <I>as</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.
 &nbsp; 21 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw <I>him</I>
 running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him,
 and said, <I>Is</I> all well?
 &nbsp; 22 And he said, All <I>is</I> well. My master hath sent me, saying,
 Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young
 men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent
 of silver, and two changes of garments.
 &nbsp; 23 And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged
 him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two
 changes of garments, and laid <I>them</I> upon two of his servants;
 and they bare <I>them</I> before him.
 &nbsp; 24 And when he came to the tower, he took <I>them</I> from their
 hand, and bestowed <I>them</I> in the house: and he let the men go,
 and they departed.
 &nbsp; 25 But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said
 unto him, Whence <I>comest thou,</I> Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant
 went no whither.
 &nbsp; 26 And he said unto him, Went not mine heart <I>with thee,</I> when
 the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? <I>Is it</I> a
 time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards,
 and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
 maidservants?
 &nbsp; 27 The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and
 unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper
 <I>as white</I> as snow.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Naaman, a Syrian, a courtier, a soldier, had many servants, and we read 
 how wise and good they were, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Elisha, a holy prophet, a man of God, has but one servant, and he
 proves a base, lying, naughty fellow.  Those that heard of Elisha at a 
 distance honoured him, and got good by what they heard; but he that 
 stood continually before him, to hear his wisdom, had no good 
 impressions made upon him either by his doctrine or miracles. One would 
 have expected that Elisha's servant should be a saint (even Ahab's 
 servant, Obadiah, was), but even Christ himself had a Judas among his 
 followers. The means of grace cannot give grace. The best men, the best 
 ministers have often had those about them that have been their grief 
 and shame. The nearer the church the further from God.  <I>Many come 
 from the east and west to sit down with Abraham when the children of 
 the kingdom shall be cast out.</I> Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Gehazi's sin. It was a complicated sin. 

 1. The love of money, that root of all evil, was at the bottom of it.
 His master contemned Naaman's treasures, but he coveted them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 His heart (says bishop Hall) was packed up in Naaman's chests, and he
 must run after him to fetch it. Multitudes, by coveting worldly wealth, 
 have <I>erred from the faith</I> and <I>pierced themselves with many 
 sorrows.</I> 

 2. He blamed his master for refusing Naaman's present, condemned him as
 foolish in not taking gold when he might have it, envied and grudged 
 his kindness and generosity to this stranger, though it was for the 
 good of his soul. In short, he thought himself wiser than his master.  
 
 3. When Naaman, like a person of accomplished manners, alighted from
 his chariot to meet him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 he told him a deliberate lie, that his master sent him to him, and so
 he received that courtesy to himself that Naaman intended to his 
 master. 

 4. He abused his master, and basely misrepresented him to Naaman as one
 that had soon repented of his generosity, that was fickle, and did not 
 know his own mind, that would say and unsay, swear and unswear, that 
 would not do an honourable thing but he must presently undo it again. 
 his story of the two sons of the prophets was as silly as it was false; 
 if he would have begged a token for two young scholars, surely less 
 than a talent of silver might serve them. 

 5.  There was danger of his alienating Naaman from that holy religion
 which he had espoused, and lessening his good opinion of it.  he would
 be ready to say, as Paul's enemies suggested concerning him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:16,17">2 Cor. xii. 16, 17</A>),

 that, though Elisha himself did not burden him, yet being crafty he
 caught him with guile, sending those that made a gain of him. We hope 
 that he understood afterwards that Elisha's hand was not in it, and 
 that Gehazi was forced to restore what he had unjustly got, else it 
 might have driven him to his idols again. 

 6. His seeking to conceal what he had unjustly got added much to his
 sin.

 (1.) He hid it, as Achan did his gain, by sacrilege, in the tower, a
 secret place, a strong place, till he should have an opportunity of 
 laying it out, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Now he thought himself sure of it, and applauded his own management of
 a fraud by which he had imposed, not only upon the prudence of Naaman, 
 but upon Elisha's spirit of discerning, as Ananias and Sapphira upon 
 the apostles.

 (2.) He denied it: He <I>went in, and stood before his master,</I>
 ready to receive his orders. None looked more observant of his master, 
 though really none more injurious to him; he thought, as Ephraim, <I>I 
 have become rich, but they shall find no iniquity in me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:8">Hos. xii. 8</A>.
 
 His master asked him where he had been, "Nowhere, sir" (said he), "out
 of the house." Note, One lie commonly begets another: the way of that 
 sin is down-hill; therefore dare to be true.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The punishment of this sin. Elisha immediately called him to an 
 account for it; and observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How he was convicted. He thought to impose upon the prophet, but was
 soon given to understand that the Spirit of prophecy could not be 
 deceived, and that it was in vain to lie to the Holy Ghost. Elisha 
 could tell him, 

 (1.) What he had done, though he had denied it. "Thou sayest thou
 wentest nowhere, but <I>went not my heart with thee?</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Had Gehazi yet to learn that prophets had spiritual eyes? or could he
 think to hide any thing from a seer, from him with whom the secret of 
 the Lord was?  Note, It is folly to presume upon sin in hopes of 
 secresy.  When thou goest aside into any by-path does not thy own 
 conscience go with thee? Does not the eye of God go with thee? <I>He 
 that covers his sin shall not prosper,</I> particularly <I>a lying 
 tongue is but for a moment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+12:19">Prov. xii. 19</A>.

 Truth will transpire, and often comes to light strangely, to the
 confusion of those that make lies their refuge.

 (2.) What he designed, though he kept that in his own breast. He could
 tell him the very thoughts and intents of his heart, that he was 
 projecting, now that he had got these two talents, to purchase ground 
 and cattle, to leave Elisha's service, and to set up for himself. Note, 
 All the foolish hopes and contrivances of carnal worldlings are open 
 before God. And he tells him also the evil of it: "<I>Is it a time to 
 receive money?</I> Is this an opportunity of enriching thyself? Couldst 
 thou find no better way of getting money than by belying thy master and 
 laying a stumbling-block before a young convert?" Note, Those that are 
 for getting wealth at any time, and by any ways and means whatsoever, 
 right or wrong, lay themselves open to a great deal of temptation. 
 Those that will be rich (<I>per fas, per nefas; rem, rem, quocunque 
 modo rem--by fair means, by foul means; careless of principle, intent 
 only on money) drown themselves in destruction and perdition,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:9">1 Tim. vi. 9</A>.

 War, and fire, and plague, and shipwreck, are not, as many make them,
 things to get money by. It is not a time to increase our wealth when we 
 cannot do it but in such ways as are dishonourable to God and religion 
 or injurious to our brethren or the public.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he was punished for it: <I>The leprosy of Naaman shall cleave to 
 thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 If he will have his money, he shall take his disease with it,
 <I>Transit cum onere--It passes with this incumbrance.</I> He was 
 contriving to entail lands upon his posterity; but, instead of them, he 
 entails a loathsome disease on the heirs of his body, from generation 
 to generation. The sentence was immediately executed on himself; no 
 sooner said than done: He <I>went out from his presence a leper as 
 white as snow.</I> Thus he is stigmatized and made infamous, and 
 carries the mark of his shame wherever he goes: thus he loads himself 
 and family with a curse, which shall not only for the present proclaim 
 his villany, but for ever perpetuate the remembrance of it.  Note, 
 <I>The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and 
 fro of those that seek death,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:6">Prov. xxi. 6</A>.

 Those who get wealth by fraud and injustice cannot expect either the
 comfort or the continuance of it. What was Gehazi profited, though he 
 gained his two talents, when thereby he lost his health, his honour, 
 his peace, his service, and, if repentance prevented not, his soul for 
 ever? See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:12-14">Job xx. 12</A>,
