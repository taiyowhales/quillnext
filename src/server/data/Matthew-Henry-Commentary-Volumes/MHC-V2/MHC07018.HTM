 How idolatry crept into the family of Micah we read in the preceding 
 chapter, how it was translated thence into the tribe of Dan we have an 
 account in this chapter, and how it gained a settlement in a city of 
 note; for how great a matter does a little fire kindle! The tribe of 
 Dan had their lot assigned them last of all the tribes, and, it 
 happening to be too strait for them, a considerable city in the utmost 
 corner of Canaan northward was added to it. "Let them get it, and take 
 it;" it was called Laish or Leshem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:47">Josh. xix. 47</A>.

 Now here we are told, 

 I. How they sent spies to bring them an account of the place, who, by
 the way, got acquainted with Micah's priest,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.
 
 II. What an encouraging report these spies brought back, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.
 
 III. What forces were sent to conquer Laish, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>.

 IV. How they, by the way, plundered Micah of his gods,

 V.  How easily they conquered Laish 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:27-29">ver. 27-29</A>),

 and, when they had it, set up the graven image in it,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 In those days <I>there was</I> no king in Israel: and in those
 days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell
 in; for unto that day <I>all their</I> inheritance had not fallen unto
 them among the tribes of Israel.
 &nbsp; 2 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from
 their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy
 out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go,
 search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the
 house of Micah, they lodged there.
 &nbsp; 3 When they <I>were</I> by the house of Micah, they knew the voice
 of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said
 unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this
 <I>place?</I> and what hast thou here?
 &nbsp; 4 And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me,
 and hath hired me, and I am his priest.
 &nbsp; 5 And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God,
 that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.
 &nbsp; 6 And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 <I>is</I> your way wherein ye go.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The eye which these Danites had upon Laish, not the whole tribe of 
 Dan, but one family of them, to whose lot, in the subdivision of 
 Canaan, that city fell. Hitherto this family had sojourned with their 
 brethren, who had taken possession of their lot, which lay between 
 Judah and the Philistines, and had declined going to their own city, 
 because there was <I>no king in Israel</I> to rule over them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It lay a great way off, separate from the rest of their tribe; it was 
 entirely in the enemy's hand, and therefore they would sponge upon 
 their brethren rather than go far to provide for themselves. But at 
 length necessity forced them to arouse themselves, and they began to 
 think of an inheritance to dwell in. It is better to have a little of 
 one's own than always to hang upon others. 

 2. The enquiry which this family of the Danites made concerning Laish: 
 They sent <I>five men to search the land</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that they might know the character of the country, whether it was an 
 inheritance worth going so far for, and the posture of the people, 
 whether the making of themselves masters of it was a thing practicable, 
 what force was necessary in order thereunto, and which was the best way 
 of making an attack upon it. The men they sent were men of valour, who, 
 if they fell into their enemies' hands, knew how to look danger in the 
 face. It is prudent to look before we leap. Dan had the subtlety of 
 <I>a serpent by the way</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:17">Gen. xlix. 17</A>),

 as well as the courage of a <I>lion's whelp, leaping from Bashan,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:22">Deut. xxxiii. 22</A>.

 3. The acquaintance which their spies got with Micah's priest, and the
 use they made of that acquaintance. It seems, they had know this Levite 
 formerly, he having in his rambles been sometimes in their country; 
 and, though his countenance might be altered, they knew him again by 
 his voice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They were surprised to find him so far off, enquired what brought him 
 thither, and he told them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 what business he had there, and what encouragement. They, understanding 
 that he had an oracle in his custody, desired he would tell them 
 whether they should prosper in their present undertaking, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 See their carelessness and regardlessness of God and his providence; 
 they would not have enquired of the Lord at all if this Levite's 
 mentioning the teraphim he had with him had not put it into their 
 heads. Many never think of religion but just when it falls in their way 
 and they cannot avoid it, like chance customers. See their ignorance of 
 the divine law, that they thought God, who had forbidden the religious 
 use of graven images, would yet own them in consulting an image, and 
 give them an answer of peace.  <I>Should he be enquired of by them?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:3">Ezek. xiv. 3</A>.

 They seem to have had a greater opinion of Micah's teraphim than of
 God's urim; for they had passed by Shiloh, and, for aught that appears, 
 had not enquired there of God's high priest, but Micah's shabby Levite 
 shall be an oracle to them. He betakes himself to his usual method of 
 consulting his teraphim; and, whether he himself believed it or no, he 
 humoured the thing so well that he made them believe he had an answer 
 from God encouraging them to go on, and assuring them of good success 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Go in peace,</I> you shall be safe, and may be easy, for <I>before 
 the Lord is your way,</I>" that is, "he approves it" (as the Lord is 
 said to <I>know the way of the righteous</I> with acceptation), "and 
 therefore he will make it prosperous, his eye will be upon you for 
 good, he will direct your way, and preserve your <I>going out and 
 coming in."</I> Note, Our great care should be that our way be such as 
 God approves, and, if it be so, we may <I>go in peace.</I> If God care 
 for us, on him let us cast our care, and be satisfied that we cannot 
 miss our way if he <I>go before us.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the
 people that <I>were</I> therein, how they dwelt careless, after the
 manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and <I>there was</I> no
 magistrate in the land, that might put <I>them</I> to shame in <I>any</I>
 thing; and they <I>were</I> far from the Zidonians, and had no
 business with <I>any</I> man.
 &nbsp; 8 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and
 their brethren said unto them, What <I>say</I> ye?
 &nbsp; 9 And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we
 have seen the land, and, behold, it <I>is</I> very good: and <I>are</I> ye
 still? be not slothful to go, <I>and</I> to enter to possess the land.
 &nbsp; 10 When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a
 large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where
 <I>there is</I> no want of any thing that <I>is</I> in the earth.
 &nbsp; 11 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out
 of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with
 weapons of war.
 &nbsp; 12 And they went up, and pitched in Kirjath-jearim, in Judah:
 wherefore they called that place Mahaneh-dan unto this day:
 behold, <I>it is</I> behind Kirjath-jearim.
 &nbsp; 13 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the
 house of Micah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The observation which the spies made upon the city of Laish, and the 
 posture of its inhabitants,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Never was place so ill governed and so ill guarded, which would make it 
 a very easy prey to the invader.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was ill governed, for every man might be as bad as he would, and 
 there was no magistrate, no <I>heir of restraint</I> (as the word is), 
 that might so much as <I>put them to shame in any thing,</I> much less 
 <I>put them to death,</I> so that by the most impudent immoralities 
 they provoked God's wrath, and by all manner of mutual mischiefs 
 weakened and consumed one another. See here, 

 (1.) What the office of magistrates is. They are to be <I>heirs of 
 restraint,</I> that is, to preserve a constant entail of power, as 
 heirs to an inheritance, in the places where they are, for the 
 restraining of that which is evil. They are <I>possessors of 
 restraint,</I> entrusted with their authority for this end, that they 
 may check and suppress every thing that is vicious and be <I>a terror 
 to evil doers.</I> It is only God's grace that can renew men's depraved 
 minds and turn their hearts; but the magistrate's power may restrain 
 their bad practices and tie their hands, so that the wickedness of the 
 wicked may not be either so injurious or so infectious as otherwise it 
 would be. Though the sword of justice cannot cut up the root of 
 bitterness, it may cut off its branches and hinder its growth and 
 spreading, that vice may not go without a check, for then it becomes 
 daring and dangerous, and the community shares in the guilt. 

 (2.) See what method must be used for the restraint of wickedness. 
 Sinners must be put to shame, that those who will not be restrained by 
 the shamefulness of the sin before God and their own consciences may be 
 restrained by the shamefulness of the punishment before men. All ways 
 must be tried to dash sin out of countenance and cover it with 
 contempt, to make people ashamed of their idleness, drunkenness, 
 cheating, lying, and other sins, by making reputation always appear on 
 virtue's side. 

 (3.) See how miserable, and how near to ruin, those places are that 
 either have no magistrates or none that bear the sword to any purpose; 
 the wicked then <I>walk on every side,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:8">Ps. xii. 8</A>.

 And how happy we are in good laws and a good government.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was ill guarded. The people of Laish were careless, quiet, and 
 secure, their gates left open, their walls out of repair, because under 
 no apprehension of danger in any way, though their wickedness was so 
 great that they had reason to fear divine vengeance every day. It was a 
 sign that the Israelites, through their sloth and cowardice, were not 
 now such a terror to the Canaanites as they were when they first came 
 among them, else the city of Laish, which probably knew itself to be 
 assigned to them, would not have been so very secure. Though they were 
 an open and inland town, they <I>lived secure, like the Zidonians</I> 
 (who were surrounded with the sea and were well fortified both by art 
 and nature), but were <I>far from the Zidonians,</I> who therefore 
 could not come in to their assistance, nor help to defend them from the 
 danger which, by debauching their manners, they had helped to bring 
 them into. And, <I>lastly,</I> they had <I>no business with any 
 man,</I> which bespeaks either the idleness they affected (they 
 followed no trade, and so grew lazy and luxurious, and utterly unable 
 to defend themselves) or the independency they affected: they scorned 
 to be either in subjection to or alliance with any of their neighbours, 
 and so they had none to protect them nor bring in any aid to them. They 
 cared for nobody and therefore nobody cared for them. Such as these 
 were the men of Laish.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The encouragement which they consequently gave to their countrymen 
 that sent them to prosecute their design upon this city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.
 
 Probably the Danites had formed notions of the insuperable difficulties 
 of the enterprise, thought it impossible ever to make themselves 
 masters of Laish, and therefore had kept themselves so long out of the 
 possession of it, perhaps suggesting likewise to one another, in their 
 unbelief, that it was not a country worth going so far and running such 
 a risk for, which jealousies the spies (and they were not, in this, 
 evil spies) had an eye to in their report. 

 1. They represent the place as desirable: "If you will trust our 
 judgments, <I>we have seen the land,</I> and we are agreed in our 
 verdict upon the view, that, behold, <I>it is very good</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 better than this mountainous country into which we are here crowded by 
 the Philistines. You need not doubt of living comfortably in it, for it 
 is a place <I>where there is no want of any thing,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 See what a good land Canaan was, that this city which lay furthest of 
 all northward, in the utmost corner of the country, stood on such a 
 fruitful spot. 

 2. They represent it as attainable. They do not at all question but, 
 with God's blessing, they may soon get possession of it; for <I>the 
 people are secure,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 And the more secure always the less safe. "God <I>has given it into 
 your hands,</I> and you may have it for the taking." They stir them up 
 to the undertaking: "<I>Arise, that we may go up against them,</I> let 
 us go about it speedily and resolutely." They expostulate with them for 
 their delays, and chide them out of their sluggishness: <I>Are you 
 still? Be not slothful to go.</I> Men need to be thus stirred up to 
 mind even their interest. Heaven is <I>a very good land, where there is 
 no want of any thing;</I> our God has, by the promise, <I>given it into 
 our hands;</I> let us not then be slothful in making it sure, and 
 <I>laying hold on eternal life,</I> but <I>strive to enter.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The Danites' expedition against Laish. This particular family of 
 them, to whose lot that city fell, now at length make towards it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:11-13"><I>v.</I> 11-13</A>.

 The military men were but 600 in all, not a hundredth part of that 
 tribe, for when they entered Canaan the Danites were above 64,000, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:43">Num. xxvi. 43</A>.

 It was strange that none of their brethren of their own tribe, much
 less of any other, came in to their assistance; but it was long after 
 Israel came to Canaan before there appeared among them any thing of a 
 public spirit, or concern for a common interest, which was the reason 
 why they seldom united in a common head, and this kept them low and 
 inconsiderable. It appears (by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)

 that these 600 were the whole number that went to settle there, for 
 they had their families and effects with them, their <I>little ones and 
 cattle,</I> so confident were they of success. The other tribes gave 
 them a free passage through their country. Their first day's march 
 brought them to Kirjath-jearim 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and such rare things had military encampments now become in Israel that 
 the place where they rested that night was thence called 
 <I>Mahaneh-dan, the camp of Dan,</I> and probably the place whence they 
 began their march between Zorah and Eshtaol was called by the same 
 name, and is meant,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:25"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 25</A>.

 The second day's march brought them to Mount Ephraim, near Micah's
 house 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country
 of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is
 in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a
 molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.
 &nbsp; 15 And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the
 young man the Levite, <I>even</I> unto the house of Micah, and saluted
 him.
 &nbsp; 16 And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war,
 which <I>were</I> of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the
 gate.
 &nbsp; 17 And the five men that went to spy out the land went up,
 <I>and</I> came in thither, <I>and</I> took the graven image, and the
 ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest
 stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men <I>that
 were</I> appointed with weapons of war.
 &nbsp; 18 And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved
 image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then
 said the priest unto them, What do ye?
 &nbsp; 19 And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon
 thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest:
 <I>is it</I> better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man,
 or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?
 &nbsp; 20 And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and
 the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the
 people.
 &nbsp; 21 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the
 cattle and the carriage before them.
 &nbsp; 22 <I>And</I> when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the
 men that <I>were</I> in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered
 together, and overtook the children of Dan.
 &nbsp; 23 And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned
 their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou
 comest with such a company?
 &nbsp; 24 And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and
 the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what
 <I>is</I> this <I>that</I> ye say unto me, What aileth thee?
 &nbsp; 25 And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be
 heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose
 thy life, with the lives of thy household.
 &nbsp; 26 And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw
 that they <I>were</I> too strong for him, he turned and went back unto
 his house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Danites had sent out their spies to find out a country for them, 
 and they sped well in their search; but here, now that they came to the 
 place (for till this brought it to their mind it does not appear that 
 they had mentioned it to their brethren), they oblige them with a 
 further discovery--they can tell them where there are gods: "Here, <I>in
 these houses,</I> there are an ephod, and teraphim, and a great many 
 fine things for devotion, such as we have not the like in our country; 
 <I>now therefore consider what you have to do,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 We consulted them, and had a good answer from them; they are worth 
 having, nay, they are worth stealing (that is, having upon the worst 
 terms), and, if we can but make ourselves masters of these gods, we may 
 the better hope to prosper, and make ourselves masters of Laish." So 
 far they were in the right, that it was desirable to have God's 
 presence with them, but wretchedly mistaken when they took these images 
 (which were fitter to be used in a puppet-play than in acts of 
 devotion) for tokens of God's presence. They thought an oracle would be 
 pretty company for them in their enterprise, and instead of a council 
 of war to consult upon every emergency; and, the place they were going 
 to settle in being so far from Shiloh, they thought they had more need 
 of a <I>house of gods</I> among themselves than Micah had that lived so 
 near to it. They might have made as good an ephod and teraphim 
 themselves as these were, and such as would have served their purpose 
 every whit as well; but the reputation which they found them in 
 possession of (though they had had that reputation but a while) amused 
 them into a strange veneration for this <I>house of gods,</I> which 
 they would soon have dropped if they had had so much sense as to 
 enquire into its origin, and examine whether there were any thing 
 divine in its institution. Being determined to take these gods along 
 with them, we are here told how they stole the images, cajoled the 
 priest, and frightened Micah from attempting to rescue them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The five men that knew the house and the avenues to it, and 
 particularly the chapel, went in and fetched out the images, with the 
 ephod, and teraphim, and all the appurtenances, while the 600 kept the 
 priest in talk at the gate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:16-18"><I>v.</I> 16-18</A>.

 See what little care this sorry priest took of his gods; while he was 
 sauntering at the gate, and gazing at the strangers, his treasure (such 
 as it was) was gone. See how impotent these sorry gods were, that could 
 not keep themselves from being stolen. It is mentioned as the reproach 
 of idols that they <I>themselves had gone into captivity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:2">Isa. xlvi. 2</A>.

 O the sottishness of these Danites! How could they imagine those gods
 should protect them that could not keep themselves from being stolen? 
 Yet because they went by the name of gods, as if it were not enough 
 that they had with them the presence of the invisible God, nor that 
 they stood in relation to the tabernacle, where there were even visible 
 tokens of his presence, nothing will serve them but they must have 
 <I>gods to go before them,</I> not of their own making indeed, but, 
 which was as bad, of their own stealing. Their idolatry began in theft, 
 a proper prologue for such an opera. In order to the breaking of the 
 second commandment, they begin with the eighth, and take their 
 neighbour's goods to make them their gods. The holy God <I>hates 
 robbery for burnt-offerings,</I> but the devil loves it. Had these 
 Danites seized the images to deface and abolish them, and the priest to 
 punish him, they would have done like Israelites indeed, and would have 
 appeared jealous for their God as their fathers had done

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:16">Josh. xxii. 16</A>);

 but to take them for their own use was such a complicated crime as
 showed that they neither feared God nor regarded man, but were 
 perfectly lost both to godliness and honesty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They set upon the priest, and flattered him into a good humour, not 
 only to let the gods go, but to go himself along with them; for without 
 him they knew not well how to make use of the gods. Observe, 

 1. How they tempted him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 They assured him of better preferment with them than what he now had. 
 It would be more honour and profit to be chaplain to a regiment (for 
 they were no more, though they called themselves a <I>tribe</I>) than 
 to be only a domestic chaplain to a private gentleman. Let him go with 
 them, and he shall have more dependants on him, more sacrifices brought 
 to his altar, and more fees for consulting his teraphim, than he had 
 here. 

 2. How they won him. A little persuasion served: <I>His heart was 
 glad,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 The proposal took well enough with his rambling fancy, which would 
 never let him stay long at a place, and gratified his covetousness and 
 ambition. He had no reason to say but that he was well off where he 
 was; Micah had not <I>deceived him, nor changed his wages.</I> He was 
 not moved with any remorse of conscience for attending on a graven 
 image: had he gone away to Shiloh to minister to the Lord's priests, 
 according to the duty of a Levite, he might have been welcome there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:6">Deut. xviii. 6</A>),

 and his removal would have been commendable; but, instead of this, he
 takes the images with him, and carries the infection of the idolatry 
 into a whole city. It would have been very unjust and ungrateful to 
 Micah if he had only gone away himself, but it was much more so to take 
 the images along with him, which he knew the heart of Micah was set 
 upon. Yet better could not be expected from a treacherous Levite. What 
 house can be sure of him who has forsaken the house of the Lord? Or 
 what friend will he be true to that has been false to his God?  He 
 could not pretend that he was under compulsive force, for he was 
 <I>glad in his heart</I> to go. If ten shekels won him (as bishop Hall 
 expresses it), eleven would lose him; for what can hold those that have 
 made shipwreck of a good conscience?  <I>The hireling flees because he 
 is a hireling.</I> The priest and his gods went in <I>the midst of the 
 people.</I> There they placed him, that they might secure him either 
 from going back himself, if his mind should change, or from being 
 fetched back by Micah; or perhaps this post was assigned to him in 
 imitation of the order of Israel's march through the wilderness, in 
 which the ark and the priests went in the midst of their camp.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They frightened Micah back when he pursued them to recover his 
 gods. As soon as ever he perceived that his chapel was plundered, and 
 his chaplain had run away from him, he mustered all the forces he could 
 and pursued the robbers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 His neighbours, and perhaps tenants, that used to join with him in his 
 devotions, were forward to help him on this occasion; they got 
 together, and pursued the robbers, who, having their children and 
 cattle before them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 could make no great haste, so that they soon overtook them, hoping by 
 strength of reason to recover what was stolen, for the disproportion of 
 their numbers was such that they could not hope to do it by strength of 
 arm.  The pursuers called after them, desiring to speak a word with 
 them; those in the rear (where it is probable they posted the fiercest 
 and strongest of their company, expecting there to be attacked) turned 
 about and asked Micah what ailed him that he was so much concerned, and 
 what he would have, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 He argues with them, and pleads his right, which he thought should 
 prevail; but they, in answer, plead their might, which, it proved, did 
 prevail; for it is common that might overcomes right.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He insists upon the wrong they had certainly done him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):
 
 "<I>You have taken away my gods,</I> my images of God, which I have an 
 incontestable title to, for I made them myself, and which I have such 
 an affection for that I am undone if I lose them; for what have I more 
 that will do me any good if these be lost?" Now, 

 (1.) This discovers to us the folly of idolaters, and the power that 
 Satan has over them. What a folly was it for him to call those his 
 <I>gods</I> which he had made, when he only that made us is to be 
 worshipped by us as a God! Folly indeed to set his heart upon such 
 silly idle things, and to look upon himself as undone when he had lost 
 them! 

 (2.) This may discover to us our spiritual idolatry. That creature 
 which we place our happiness in, which we set our affections 
 inordinately upon, and which we can by no means find in our hearts to 
 part with, of which we say, "What have we more?" <I>that</I> we make an 
 idol of. That is put in God's place, and is a usurper, which we are 
 concerned about as if our life and comfort, our hope and happiness, and 
 our all, were bound up in it. But, 

 (3.) If all people will thus walk in the name of their god, shall we 
 not be in like manner affected towards our God, the true God? Let us 
 reckon the having of an interest in God and communion with him 
 incomparably the richest portion, and the loss of God the sorest loss. 
 Woe unto us if he depart, for what have we more? Deserted souls that 
 are lamenting after the Lord may well wonder, as Micah did, that you 
 should ask what ails them; for the tokens of God's favour are 
 suspended, his comforts are withdrawn, and what have they more?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They insist upon the mischief they would certainly do him if he 
 prosecuted his demand. They would not hear reason, nor do justice, nor 
 so much as offer to pay him the prime cost he had been at upon those 
 images, nor promise to make restitution of what they had taken when 
 they had served their present purpose with them in this expedition and 
 had time to copy them and make others like them for themselves: much 
 less had they any compassion for a loss he so bitterly lamented. They 
 would not so much as give him good words, but resolved to justify their 
 robbery with murder if he did not immediately let fall his claims, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 "Take heed <I>lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy 
 life,</I> and that is worse than losing thy gods." Wicked and 
 unreasonable men reckon it a great provocation to be asked to do 
 justice, and support themselves by their power against right and 
 reason. Micah's crime is asking his own, yet, for this, he is in danger 
 of losing his life and the lives of his household.  Micah has not 
 courage enough to venture his life for the rescue of his gods, so 
 little opinion has he of their being able to protect him and bear him 
 out, and therefore tamely gives them up

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>He turned and went back to his house;</I> and if the loss of his 
 idols did but convince him (as, one would think, it should) of their 
 vanity and impotency, and his own folly in setting his heart upon them, 
 and send him back to the true God from whom he had revolted, he that 
 lost them had a much better bargain than those that by force of arms 
 carried them off. If the loss of our idols cure us of the love of them, 
 and make us say, <I>What have we to do any more with idols?</I> the 
 loss will be unspeakable gain.  See

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27 And they took <I>the things</I> which Micah had made, and the
 priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people <I>that
 were</I> at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of
 the sword, and burnt the city with fire.
 &nbsp; 28 And <I>there was</I> no deliverer, because it <I>was</I> far from
 Zidon, and they had no business with <I>any</I> man; and it was in the
 valley that <I>lieth</I> by Beth-rehob. And they built a city, and
 dwelt therein.
 &nbsp; 29 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of
 Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of
 the city <I>was</I> Laish at the first.
 &nbsp; 30 And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and
 Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his
 sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the
 captivity of the land.
 &nbsp; 31 And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made,
 all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Laish conquered by the Danites. They proceeded on their march, and, 
 because they met with no disaster, perhaps concluded they had not done 
 amiss in robbing Micah. Many justify themselves in their impiety by 
 their prosperity. Observe,

 1.  What posture they found the people of Laish in, both those of the 
 city and those of the country about. They were quiet and secure, not 
 jealous of the five spies that had been among them to search out the 
 land, nor had they any intelligence of the approach of this enemy, 
 which made them a very easy prey to this little handful of men that 
 came upon them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Note, Many are brought to destruction by their security. Satan gets 
 advantage against us when we are careless and off our watch. Happy 
 therefore is the man that feareth always. 

 2. What a complete victory they obtained over them: They <I>put all the 
 people to the sword,</I> and burnt down so much of the city as they 
 thought fit to rebuild

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>),

 and, for aught that appears, herein they met with no resistance; for 
 the measure of the iniquity of the Canaanites was full, that of the 
 Danites was but beginning to fill. 

 3. How the conquerors settled themselves in their room,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.

 They built the city, or much of it, anew (the old buildings having gone 
 to decay), and <I>called the name of it Dan,</I> to be a witness for 
 them that, though separated so far off from their brethren, they were 
 nevertheless Danites by birth, which might hereafter, by reason of 
 their distance, be called in question. We should feel concerned not to 
 lose the privilege of our relation to God's Israel, and therefore 
 should take all occasions to own it and preserve the remembrance of it 
 to ours after us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Idolatry immediately set up there. God had graciously performed his 
 promise, in putting them in possession of that which fell to their lot, 
 obliging them thereby to be faithful to him who had been so to them. 
 They <I>inherited the labour of the people, that they might observe his 
 statues,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:44,45">Ps. cv. 44, 45</A>.

 But the first thing they do after they are settled is to break his
 statues. As soon as they began to settle themselves they <I>set up the 
 graven image</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 perversely attributing their success to that idol which, if God had not
 been infinitely patient, would have been their ruin. Thus a prosperous 
 idolater goes on to offend, <I>imputing this his power unto his 
 god,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:11">Hab. i. 11</A>.

 Their Levite, who officiated as priest, is at length <I>named</I>
 here--<I>Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh.</I> The 
 word <I>Manasseh,</I> in the original, has the letter <I>n,</I> set 
 over the head, which, some of the Jewish rabbin say, is an intimation 
 that it should be left out, and then <I>Manasseh</I> will be 
 <I>Moses,</I> and this Levite, they say, was grandson to the famous 
 Moses, who indeed had a son named Gershom; but, say they, the 
 historian, in honour of Moses, by a half interposition of that letter, 
 turned the name into Manasseh.  The vulgar Latin reads it <I>Moses.</I> 
 And if indeed Moses had a grandson that was rakish, and was picked up 
 as a fit tool to be made use of in the setting up of idolatry, it is 
 not the only instance (would to God it were!) of the unhappy 
 degenerating of the posterity of great and good men. Children's 
 children are not always the crown of old men. But the learned bishop 
 Patrick takes this to be an idle conceit of the rabbin, and supposes 
 this Jonathan to be of some other family of the Levites. How long these 
 corruptions continued we are told in the close.

 1. That the posterity of this Jonathan continued to act as priests to 
 this family of Dan that was seated at Laish, and in the country about, 
 till the captivity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 After Micah's image was removed this family retained the character of 
 priests, and had respect paid them as such by that city, and it is very 
 probable that Jeroboam had an eye to them when he set up one of his 
 calves there (which they could welcome at Can, and put some reputation 
 upon, when the priests of the Lord would have nothing to do with them), 
 and that this family officiated as some of his priests. 

 2.  That these images continued till Samuel's time, for so long <I>the 
 ark of God was at Shiloh;</I> and it is probable that in him time 
 effectual care was taken to suppress and abolish this idolatry. See how 
 dangerous it is to admit an infection, for spiritual distempers are not 
 so soon cured as caught.</P>
