 Saul, having made himself drunk with the blood of the priests of the
 Lord, is here, in this chapter, seeking David's life, who appears here
 doing good, and suffering ill, at the same time. Here is, 

 I. The good service he did to his king and country, in rescuing the
 city of Keilah out of the hands of the Philistines, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. The danger he was thereby brought into from the malice of the
 prince he served and the treachery of the city he saved, and his 
 deliverance, by divine direction, from that danger, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:7-13">ver. 7-13</A>.

 III.  David in a wood and his friend Jonathan visiting him there and
 encouraging him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:14-18">ver. 14-18</A>.

 IV.  The information which the Ziphites brought to Saul of David's
 haunts, and the expedition Saul made, in pursuit of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:19-25">ver. 19-25</A>.

 The narrow escape David had of falling into his hands, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:26-29">ver. 26-29</A>.

 "Many are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth them
 out of them all."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight
 against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.
 &nbsp; 2 Therefore David enquired of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, Shall I go and
 smite these Philistines? And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto David, Go, and
 smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.
 &nbsp; 3 And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in
 Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies
 of the Philistines?
 &nbsp; 4 Then David enquired of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> yet again. And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will
 deliver the Philistines into thine hand.
 &nbsp; 5 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the
 Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a
 great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
 &nbsp; 6 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled
 to David to Keilah, <I>that</I> he came down <I>with</I> an ephod in his
 hand.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now we find why the prophet Gad (by divine direction, no doubt) ordered 
 David to go into the land of Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:5"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 5</A>.

 It was that, since Saul neglected the public safety, he might take care
 of it, notwithstanding the ill treatment that was given him; for he 
 must render good for evil, and therein be a type of him who not only 
 ventured his life, but laid down his life, for those that were his 
 enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Tidings are brought to David, as to the patron and protector of his 
 country's liberties, that the Philistines had made a descent upon the 
 city of Keilah and plundered the country thereabouts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Probably it was the departure both of God and David from Saul that
 encouraged the Philistines to make this incursion. When princes begin 
 to persecute God's people and ministers, let them expect no other than 
 vexation on all sides. The way for any country to be quiet is to let 
 God's church be quiet in it.  If Saul fight against David, the 
 Philistines shall fight against his country.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David is forward enough to come in for their relief, but is willing 
 to enquire of the Lord concerning it. Here is an instance, 

 1. Of David's generosity and public-spiritedness. Though his head and
 hands were full of his own business, and he had enough to do, with the 
 little force he had, to secure himself, yet he was concerned for the 
 safety of his country and could not sit still to see that ravaged: nay, 
 though Saul, whose business it was to guard the borders of his land, 
 hated him and sought his life, yet he was willing, to the utmost of his 
 power, to serve him and his interests against the common enemy, and 
 bravely abhorred the thought of sacrificing the common welfare to his 
 private revenge. Those are unlike to David who sullenly decline to do 
 good because they have not been so well considered as they deserved for 
 the services they have done. 

 2. Of David's piety and regard to God. He enquired of the Lord by the
 prophet Gad; for it should seem (by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)
 
 that Abiathar came not to him with the ephod till he was in Keilah. His
 enquiry is, <I>Shall I go and smite these Philistines?</I> He enquires 
 both concerning the duty (whether he might lawfully take Saul's work 
 out of his hand, and act without a commission from him) and concerning 
 the event, whether he might safely venture against such a force as the 
 Philistines had with such a handful of men at his feet, and such a 
 dangerous enemy as Saul was at his back. It is our duty, and will be 
 our case and comfort, whatever happens, to acknowledge God in all our 
 ways and to seek direction from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God appointed him once and again to go against the Philistines, 
 and promised him success: <I>Go, and smite the Philistines,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 His men opposed it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 No sooner did he begin to have soldiers of his own than he found it
 hard enough to manage them. They objected that they had enemies enough 
 among their own countrymen, they needed not to make the Philistines 
 their enemies. Their hearts failed them when they only apprehended 
 themselves in danger from Saul's band of pursuers, much more when they 
 came to engage the Philistine-armies. To satisfy them, therefore, he 
 <I>enquired of the Lord again,</I> and now received, not only a full 
 commission, which would warrant him to fight though he had no orders 
 from Saul (<I>Arise, go down to Keilah</I>), but also a full assurance
 of victory: <I>I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 This was enough to animate the greatest coward he had in his
 regiment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He went accordingly against the Philistines, routed them, and 
 rescued Keilah, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and it should seem he made a sally into the country of the Philistines,
 for he carried off their cattle by way of reprisal for the wrong they 
 did to the men of Keilah in robbing their threshing-floors. Here notice 
 is taken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 that it was while David remained in Keilah, after he had cleared it of
 the Philistines, that Abiathar came to him with the ephod in his hand, 
 that is, the high priest's ephod, in which the urim and thummim were. 
 It was a great comfort to David, in his banishment, that when he could 
 not go to the house of God he had some of the choicest treasures of 
 that house brought to him, the high priest and his breast-plate of 
 judgment.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul
 said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in,
 by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.
 &nbsp; 8 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to
 Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
 &nbsp; 9 And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against
 him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.
 &nbsp; 10 Then said David, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, thy servant hath
 certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy
 the city for my sake.
 &nbsp; 11 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will
 Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel,
 I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, He will come
 down.
 &nbsp; 12 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my
 men into the hand of Saul? And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, They will deliver
 <I>thee</I> up.
 &nbsp; 13 Then David and his men, <I>which were</I> about six hundred,
 arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they
 could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from
 Keilah; and he forbare to go forth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. Saul contriving within himself the destruction of David
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>):

 <I>He heard that he had come to Keilah;</I> and did he not hear what
 brought him thither? Was it not told him that he had bravely relieved 
 Keilah and delivered it out of the hands of the Philistines?  This, one 
 would think, should have put Saul upon considering what honour and 
 dignity should be done to David for this. But, instead of that, he 
 catches at it as an opportunity of doing David a mischief. An 
 ungrateful wretch he was, and for ever unworthy to have any service or 
 kindness done him. Well might David complain of his enemies that they 
 rewarded him <I>evil for good,</I> and that for his love they ere his 
 adversaries, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:12,109:4">Ps. xxxv. 12; cix. 4</A>.
 
 Christ was used thus basely,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:32">John  x. 32</A>.
 
 Now observe, 

 1. How Saul abused the <I>God of Israel,</I> in making his providence
 to patronise and give countenance to his malicious designs, and thence 
 promising himself success in them: <I>God hath delivered him into my 
 hand;</I> as if he who was rejected of God were in this instance owned 
 and favoured by him, and David infatuated. He vainly triumphs before 
 the victory, forgetting how often he had had fairer advantages against 
 David than he had now and had yet missed his aim. He impiously connects 
 God with his cause, because he thought he had gained one point. 
 Therefore David prays

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+140:8">Ps. cxl. 8</A>),

 <I>Grant not, O Lord! the desires of the wicked; further not his wicked
 device, lest they exalt themselves.</I> We must not think that one 
 smiling providence either justifies an unrighteous cause or secures its 
 success. 

 2. How Saul abused the Israel of God, in making them the servants of
 his malice against David. He called all the people together to war, and 
 they must with all speed march to Keilah, pretending to oppose the 
 Philistines, but intending to besiege David and his men, though 
 concealing that design; for it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 that he <I>secretly practised mischief against him.</I> Miserable is
 that people whose prince is a tyrant, for, while some are sufferers by 
 his tyranny, others (which is worse) are made servants to it and 
 instruments of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David consulting with God concerning his own preservation. He knew 
 by the information bought him that Saul was plotting his ruin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)
 
 and therefore applied to his great protector for direction. No sooner
 is the ephod brought to him than he makes use of it: <I>Bring hither 
 the ephod.</I> We have the scriptures, those lively oracles, in our 
 hands; let us take advice from them in doubtful cases. "Bring hither 
 the Bible."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. David's address to God upon this occasion is, 

 (1.) Very solemn and reverent. Twice he calls God the <I>Lord God of 
 Israel,</I> and thrice calls himself his <I>servant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.
 
 Those that address God must know their distance, and who they are
 speaking to. 

 (2.) Very particular and express. His representation of the case is so
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "Thy servant has certainly heard on good authority" (for he would not
 call for the ephod upon every idle rumour) "that Saul has a design upon 
 Keilah;" he does not say, "to destroy me," but, "to destroy the city" 
 (as he had lately done the city of Nob) "for my sake." He seems more 
 solicitous for their safety than for his own, and will expose himself 
 any where rather than they shall be brought into trouble by his being 
 among them. Generous souls are thus minded.  His queries upon the case 
 are likewise very particular. God allows us to be so in our addresses 
 to him: "Lord, direct me in this matter, about which I am now at a 
 loss." He does indeed invert the due order of his queries, but God in 
 his answer puts him into method. That question should have been put 
 first, and was first answered, "Will Saul come down, as thy servant has 
 heard?" "Yea," says the oracle, "he will come down; he has resolved it, 
 is preparing for it, and will do it, unless he hear that thou hast 
 quitted the town." "Well, but if he do come down will the men of Keilah 
 stand by me in holding the city against him, or will they open to him 
 the gates, and deliver me into his hand?" If he had asked the men (the 
 magistrates or elders) of Keilah themselves what they would do in that 
 case, they could not have told him, not knowing their own minds, nor 
 what they should do when it came to the trial, much less which way the 
 superior vote of their council would carry it; or they might have told 
 him they would protect him, and yet afterwards have betrayed him; but 
 God could tell him infallibly: "When Saul besieges their city, and 
 demands of them that they surrender thee into his hands, how fond 
 soever they now seem of thee, as their saviour, they will deliver thee 
 up rather than stand the shock of Saul's fury." Note,

 [1.] God knows all men better than they know themselves, knows their 
 length, their strength, what is in them, and what they will do if they 
 come into such and such circumstances.

 [2.] He therefore knows not only what <I>will</I> be, but what 
 <I>would</I> be if it were not prevented; and therefore knows how to 
 deliver the godly out of temptation, and how to render to every man 
 according to his works.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. David, having thus far notice given him of his danger, quitted 
 Keilah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 His followers had now increased in number to 600; with these he went
 out, not knowing whither he went, but resolving to follow Providence 
 and put himself under its protection. This broke Saul's measures. He 
 thought God had delivered David into his hand, but it proved that God 
 delivered him out of his hand, as a bird out of the snare of the 
 fowler. When <I>Saul heard that David had escaped from Keilah, he 
 forbore to go forth</I> with the body of the army, as he intended

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and resolved to take only his own guards, and go in quest of his
 people's enemies and turn their counsels head-long.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and
 remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought
 him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.
 &nbsp; 15 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and
 David <I>was</I> in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.
 &nbsp; 16 And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the
 wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
 &nbsp; 17 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my
 father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel,
 and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father
 knoweth.
 &nbsp; 18 And they two made a covenant before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and David
 abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. David absconding. He abode in a <I>wilderness, in a mountain</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>in a wood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 We must here,

 1. Commend his eminent virtues, his humility, modesty, fidelity to his
 prince, and patient attendance on the providence of his God, that he 
 did not draw up his forces against Saul, fight him in the field, or 
 surprise him by some stratagem or other, and so avenge his own quarrel 
 and that of the Lord's priests upon him, and put an end to his own 
 troubles and the calamities of the country under Saul's tyrannical 
 government. No, he makes no such attempt; he keeps God's way, waits 
 God's time, and is content to secure himself in woods and wildernesses, 
 though with some it might seem a reproach to that courage for which he 
 had been famous.  But, 

 2. We must also lament his hard fate, that an innocent man should be
 thus terrified and put in fear of his life, that a man of honour should 
 be thus disgraced, a man of merit thus recompensed for his services, 
 and a man that delighted in the service both of God and his country 
 should be debarred from both and wrapped up in obscurity. What shall we 
 say to this? Let it make us think the worse of this world, which often 
 gives such bad treatment to its best men; let it reconcile even great 
 and active men to privacy and restraint, if Providence make these their 
 lot, for they were David's; and let it make us long for that kingdom 
 where goodness shall for ever be in glory and holiness in honour, and 
 the righteous shall shine as the sun, which cannot be put under a 
 bushel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Saul hunting him, as his implacable enemy. He sought him every day, 
 so restless was his malice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He sought no less than his life, so cruel was his malice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 As it had been from the beginning, so it was now, and will be, <I>he
 that is born after the flesh persecuteth him that is born after the 
 spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:29">Gal. iv. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God defending him, as his powerful protector. God delivered him 
 not into Saul's hand, as Saul hoped 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 and, unless God delivered him into his hand, he could not prevail
 against him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:11">John  xix. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Jonathan comforting him as his faithful and constant friend. True 
 friends will find out means to get together. David, it is likely, 
 appointed time and place for this interview, and Jonathan observed the 
 appointment, though he exposed himself thereby to his father's 
 displeasure, and, had it been discovered, it might have cost him his 
 life. True friendship will not shrink from danger, but can easily 
 venture, will not shrink from condescension, but can easily stoop, and 
 exchange a palace for a wood, to serve a friend. The very sight of 
 Jonathan was reviving to David; but, besides this, he said that to him 
 which was very encouraging. 

 1. As a pious friend, he directed him to God, the foundation of his 
 confidence and the fountain of his comfort: He <I>strengthened his hand 
 in God.</I> David, though a strong believer, needed the help of his 
 friends for the perfecting of what was lacking in his faith; and herein 
 Jonathan was helpful to him, by reminding him of the promise of God, 
 the holy oil wherewith he was anointed, the presence of God with him 
 hitherto, and the many experiences he had had of God's goodness to him. 
 Thus he strengthened his hands for action, by encouraging his heart, 
 not in the creature, but in God. Jonathan was not in a capacity of 
 doing any thing to strengthen him, but he assured him God would. 

 2. As a self-denying friend, he took a pleasure in the prospect of
 David's advancement to that honour which was his own birthright, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 "Thou shalt live to be king, and I shall think it preferment enough to
 be next thee, near thee, though under thee, and will never pretend to 
 be a rival with thee." This resignation which Jonathan made to David of 
 his title would be a great satisfaction to him, and make his way much 
 the more clear.  This, he tells him, Saul knew very well, Jonathan 
 having sometimes heard him say as much, whence it appears what a wicked 
 man Saul was, to persecute one whom God favoured, and what a foolish 
 man he was, in thinking to prevent that which God had determined and 
 which would certainly come to pass. How could he disannul what God had 
 purposed? 

 3.  As a constant friend, he renewed his league of friendship with him.
 They made a covenant now, this third time, before the Lord, calling him 
 to witness to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 True love takes delight in repeating its engagements, giving and
 receiving fresh assurances of the firmness of the friendship. Our 
 covenant with God should be often renewed, and therein our communion 
 with him kept up. David and Jonathan now parted, and never came 
 together again, that we find, in this world; for Jonathan said what he 
 wished, not what he had ground to expect, when he promised himself that 
 he should be next to David in his kingdom.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth
 not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in
 the hill of Hachilah, which <I>is</I> on the south of Jeshimon?
 &nbsp; 20 Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire
 of thy soul to come down; and our part <I>shall be</I> to deliver him
 into the king's hand.
 &nbsp; 21 And Saul said, Blessed <I>be</I> ye of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for ye have
 compassion on me.
 &nbsp; 22 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place
 where his haunt is, <I>and</I> who hath seen him there: for it is told
 me <I>that</I> he dealeth very subtilly.
 &nbsp; 23 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places
 where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the
 certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if
 he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the
 thousands of Judah.
 &nbsp; 24 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and
 his men <I>were</I> in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the
 south of Jeshimon.
 &nbsp; 25 Saul also and his men went to seek <I>him.</I> And they told
 David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the
 wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard <I>that,</I> he pursued after
 David in the wilderness of Maon.
 &nbsp; 26 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and
 his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get
 away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and
 his men round about to take them.
 &nbsp; 27 But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee,
 and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.
 &nbsp; 28 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
 against the Philistines: therefore they called that place
 Sela-hammahlekoth.
 &nbsp; 29 And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at
 En-gedi.

 Here, 

 1. The Ziphites offer their service to Saul, to betray David to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 He was sheltering himself in the wilderness of Ziph

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>),

 putting the more confidence in the people of that country because they
 were of his own tribe. They had reason to think themselves happy that 
 they had an opportunity of serving one who was the ornament of their 
 tribe and was likely to be much more so, who was so far from plundering 
 the country, or giving it any disturbance with his troops, that he was 
 ready to protect it and to them all the good offices that there was 
 occasion for. But, to ingratiate themselves with Saul, they went to 
 him, and not only informed him very particularly where David quartered

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 but invited him to come with his forces into their country in pursuit
 of him, and promised to deliver him into his hand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Saul had not sent to examine or threaten them, but of their own accord,
 and even without asking a reward (as Judas did--<I>What will you give 
 me?</I>), they offered to betray David to him who, they knew, thirsted 
 after his blood.

 2. Saul thankfully receives their information, and gladly lays hold of
 the opportunity of hunting David in their wilderness, in hopes to make 
 a prey of him at length. He intimates to them how kindly he took it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Blessed be you of the Lord</I> (so near is God to his mouth, though
 far from his heart), <I>for you have compassion on me.</I> It seems he 
 looked upon himself as a miserable man and an object of pity; his own 
 envy and ill-nature made him so, otherwise he might have been easy and 
 have needed no man's compassion. He likewise insinuates the little 
 concern that the generality of his people showed for him. "You have 
 compassion on me, which others have not." Saul gives them instructions 
 to search more particularly for his haunts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 "for" (says he) "I hear he deals very subtilely," representing him as a
 man crafty to do mischief, whereas all his subtlety was to secure 
 himself. It was strange that Saul did not go down with them 
 immediately, but he hoped by their means to set his game with the more 
 certainty, and thus divine Providence gave David time to shift for 
 himself. But the Ziphites had laid their spies upon all the places 
 where he was likely to be discovered, and therefore Saul might come and 
 seize him if he was in the land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 New he thought himself sure of his prey and pleased himself with the
 thoughts of devouring it.

 3. The imminent peril that David was now brought into. Upon
 intelligence that the Ziphites had betrayed him, he retired from the 
 hill of Hachilah to the wilderness of Maon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),
 
 and at this time he penned the
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+54:1-7">54th Psalm</A>,

 as appears by the title, wherein he calls the Ziphites
 <I>strangers,</I> though they were Israelites, because they used him 
 barbarously; but he puts himself under the divine protection: 
 "<I>Behold, God is my helper,</I> and then all shall be well" Saul, 
 having got intelligence of him, pursued him closely 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 till he came so near him that there was but a mountain between them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),
 
 David and his men on one side of the mountain flying and Saul and his
 men on the other side pursuing, David in fear and Saul in hope. But 
 this mountain was an emblem of the divine Providence coming between 
 David and the destroyer, like the pillar of cloud between the 
 Israelites and the Egyptians. David was concealed by this mountain and 
 Saul confounded by it. David now flees <I>as a bird to his mountain</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:1">Ps. xi. 1</A>)

 and finds God to him as the shadow of a great rock. Saul hoped with his
 numerous forces to enclose David, and compass him in and his men; but 
 the ground did not prove convenient for his design, and so it failed. A 
 new name was given to the place in remembrance of this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>Selah-hammah-lekoth--the rock of division,</I> because it divided
 between Saul and David. 

 4. The deliverance of David out of this danger.  Providence gave Saul a
 diversion, when he was just ready to lay hold of David; notice was 
 brought him that the Philistines were <I>invading the land</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 probably that part of the land where his own estate lay, which would be
 seized, or at least spoiled, by the invaders; for the little notice he 
 took of Keilah's distress and David's relief of it, in the beginning of 
 this chapter, gives us cause to suspect that he would not now have left 
 pursuing David, and gone to oppose the Philistines, if some private 
 interests of his own had not been at stake. However it was, he found 
 himself under a necessity of <I>going against the Philistines</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:28"><I>v.</I>  28</A>),

 and by this means David was delivered when he was on the brink of
 destruction. Saul was disappointed of his prey, and God was glorified 
 as David's wonderful protector. When the Philistines invaded the land 
 they were far from intending any kindness to David by it, yet the 
 overruling providence of God, which orders all events and the times of 
 them, made it very serviceable to him. The wisdom of God is never at a 
 loss for ways and means to preserve his people. As this Saul was 
 diverted, so another Saul was converted, just then when he was 
 <I>breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the saints of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:1">Acts ix. 1</A>.

 5. David, having thus escaped, took shelter in some natural fortresses,
 which he found in the wilderness of En-gedi, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 And this Dr.  Lightfoot thinks was the wilderness of Judah, in which
 David was when he penned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:1-11">Psalm 63</A>,

 which breathes as much pious and devout affection as almost any of his
 psalms; for in all places and in all conditions he still kept up his 
 communion with God.</P>
