 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the
 house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the
 house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.
 &nbsp; 2 And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn
 was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;
 &nbsp; 3 And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the
 Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter
 of Talmai king of Geshur;
 &nbsp; 4 And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,
 Shephatiah the son of Abital;
 &nbsp; 5 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were
 born to David in Hebron.
 &nbsp; 6 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of
 Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for
 the house of Saul.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The struggle that David had with the house of Saul before his 
 settlement in the throne was completed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 1. Both sides contested. Saul's house, though beheaded and diminished,
 would not fall tamely. It is not strange between them, but one would 
 wonder it should be a long war, when David's house had right on its 
 side, and therefore God on its side; but, though truth and equity will 
 triumph at last, God made for wise and holy ends prolonged the 
 conflict. The length of this war tried the faith and patience of David, 
 and made his establishment at last the more welcome to him. 

 2. David's side got ground. The house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker,
 lost places, lost men, sunk in its reputation, grew less considerable, 
 and was foiled in every engagement.  But the house of David grew 
 stronger and stronger. Many deserted the declining cause of Saul's 
 house, and prudently came into David's interest, being convinced that 
 he would certainly win the day. The contest between grace and 
 corruption in the hearts of believers, who are sanctified but in part, 
 may fitly be compared to this recorded here. There is a long war 
 between them, the flesh lusted against the spirit and the spirit 
 against the flesh; but, as the work of sanctification is carried on, 
 corruption, like the house of Saul, grows weaker and weaker; while 
 grace, like the house of David, grows stronger and stronger, till it 
 come to a perfect man, and judgment be brought forth unto victory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The increase of his own house. Here is an account of six sons he 
 had by six several wives, in the seven years he reigned in Hebron. 
 Perhaps this is here mentioned as that which strengthened David's 
 interest. Every child, whose welfare was embarked in the common safety, 
 was a fresh security given to the commonwealth for his care of it. He 
 that has his quiver filled with these arrows shall <I>speak with his 
 enemy in the gate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:5">Ps. cxxvii. 5</A>.

 As the death of Saul's sons weakened his interest, so the birth of
 David's strengthened his.

 1. It was David's fault thus to multiply wives, contrary to the law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:17">Deut. xvii. 17</A>),
 
 and it was a bad example to his successors. 

 2. It does not appear that in these seven years he had above one son by
 each of these wives; some have had as numerous a progeny, and with much 
 more honour and comfort, by one wife. 

 3. We read not that any of these sons came to be famous (three of them
 were infamous, Amnon, Absalom, and Adonijah); we have therefore reason
 to rejoice with trembling in the building up of our families. 

 4. His son by Abigail is called <I>Chileab</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 
 whereas
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:1">1 Chron. iii. 1</A>)

 he is called <I>Daniel.</I> Bishop Patrick mentions the reason which
 the Hebrew doctors give for these names, that his first name was 
 <I>Daniel--God has judged me</I> (namely, against Nabal), but David's 
 enemies reproached him, and said, "It is Nabal's son, and not David's," 
 to confute which calumny Providence so ordered it that, as he grew up, 
 he became, in his countenance and features, extremely like David, and 
 resembled him more than any of his children, upon which he gave him the 
 name of <I>Chileab,</I> which signifies, <I>like his father,</I> or the 
 father's picture. 

 5. Absalom's mother is said to be the daughter of Talmai king of
 Geshur, a heathen prince.  Perhaps David thereby hoped to strengthen 
 his interest, but the issue of the marriage was one that proved his 
 grief and shame. 

 6. The last is called <I>David's wife,</I> which therefore, some think,
 was Michal, his first and most rightful wife, called here by another 
 name; and, though she had no child after she mocked David, she might 
 have had before.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus was David's house strengthened; but it was Abner that <I>made 
 himself strong for the house of Saul,</I> which is mentioned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 to show that, if he failed them, they would fall of course.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And Saul had a concubine, whose name <I>was</I> Rizpah, the
 daughter of Aiah: and <I>Ishbosheth</I> said to Abner, Wherefore hast
 thou gone in unto my father's concubine?
 &nbsp; 8 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and
 said, <I>Am</I> I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness
 this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and
 to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of
 David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this
 woman?
 &nbsp; 9 So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 sworn to David, even so I do to him;
 &nbsp; 10 To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set
 up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even
 to Beer-sheba.
 &nbsp; 11 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he
 feared him.
 &nbsp; 12 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying,
 Whose <I>is</I> the land? saying <I>also,</I> Make thy league with me, and,
 behold, my hand <I>shall be</I> with thee, to bring about all Israel
 unto thee.
 &nbsp; 13 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one
 thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face,
 except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest
 to see my face.
 &nbsp; 14 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying,
 Deliver <I>me</I> my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an
 hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
 &nbsp; 15 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from <I>her</I> husband, <I>even</I>
 from Phaltiel the son of Laish.
 &nbsp; 16 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
 Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.
 &nbsp; 17 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel,
 saying, Ye sought for David in times past <I>to be</I> king over you:
 &nbsp; 18 Now then do <I>it:</I> for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath spoken of David, saying,
 By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out
 of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their
 enemies.
 &nbsp; 19 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went
 also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good
 to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
 &nbsp; 20 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him.
 And David made Abner and the men that <I>were</I> with him a feast.
 &nbsp; 21 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will
 gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a
 league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine
 heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Abner breaks with Ish-bosheth, and deserts his interest, upon a 
 little provocation which Ish-bosheth unadvisedly gave him. God can 
 serve his own purposes by the sins and follies of men.

 1. Ish-bosheth accused Abner of no less a crime than debauching one of
 his father's concubines, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Whether it was so or no does not appear, nor what ground he had for the
 suspicion: but, however it was, it would have been Ish-bosheth's 
 prudence to be silent, considering how much it was his interest not to 
 disoblige Abner. If the thing was false, and his jealousy groundless, 
 it was very disingenuous and ungrateful to entertain unjust surmises of 
 one who had ventured his all for him, and was certainly the best friend 
 he had in the world.

 2. Abner resented the charge very strongly. Whether he was guilty of
 the <I>fault concerning this woman</I> or no he does not say

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 but we suspect he was guilty, for he does not expressly deny it; and,
 though he was, he lets Ish-bosheth know,

 (1.) That he scorned to be reproached with it by him, and would not 
 take reproof at his hands. "What!" says Abner, "<I>Am I a dog's 
 head,</I> a vile and contemptible animal, that thou exposest me thus? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Is this my recompence for the kindness I have shown to thee and thy
 father's house, and the good services I have done you?" He magnifies 
 the service with this, that it was against Judah, the tribe on which 
 the crown was settled, and which would certainly have it at last, so 
 that, in supporting the house of Saul, he acted both against his 
 conscience and against his interest, for which he deserved a better 
 requital than this: and yet, perhaps, he would not have been so zealous 
 for the house of Saul if he had not thereby gratified his own ambition 
 and hoped to find his own account in it.  Note, Proud men will not bear 
 to be reproved, especially by those whom they think they have obliged.

 (2.) That he would certainly be revenged on him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 With the utmost degree of arrogance and insolence he lets him know
 that, as he had raised him up, so he could pull him down again and 
 would do it. He knew that God had sworn to David to give him the 
 kingdom, and yet opposed it with all his might from a principle of 
 ambition; but now he complies with it from a principle of revenge, 
 under colour of some regard to the will of God, which was but a 
 pretence. Those that are slaves to their lusts have many masters, which 
 drive, some one way and some another, and, according as they make head, 
 men are violently hurried into self-contradictions.  Abner's ambition 
 made him zealous for Ish-bosheth, and now his revenge made him as 
 zealous for David. If he had sincerely regarded God's promise to David, 
 and acted with an eye to that, he would have been steady and uniform in 
 his counsels, and acted in consistency with himself. But, while Abner 
 serves his own lusts, God by him serves his own purposes, makes even 
 his wrath and revenge to praise him, and ordains strength to David by 
 it.  <I>Lastly,</I> See how Ish-bosheth was thunder-struck by Abner's 
 insolence: He <I>could not answer him again,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 If Ish-bosheth had had the spirit of a man, especially of a prince, he
 might have answered him that his merits were the aggravation of his 
 crimes, that he would not be served by so base a man, and doubted not 
 but to do well enough without him. But he was conscious to himself of 
 his own weakness, and therefore said not a word, lest he should make 
 bad worse.  His heart failed him, and he now became, as David had 
 foretold concerning his enemies, like a bowing wall and a <I>tottering 
 fence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:3">Ps. lxii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Abner treats with David. We must suppose that he began to grow 
 weary of Ish-bosheth's cause, and sought an opportunity to desert it, 
 or else, however he might threaten Ish-bosheth with it, for the 
 quashing of the charge against himself, he would not have made good his 
 angry words so soon as he did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He <I>sent messengers to David,</I> to tell him that he was at his
 service. "<I>Whose is the land?</I> Is it not thine? For thou hast the 
 best title to the government and the best interest in the people's 
 affections." Note, God can find out ways to make those serviceable to 
 the kingdom of Christ who yet have no sincere affection for it and who 
 have vigorously set themselves against it. Enemies are sometimes made a 
 footstool, not only to be trodden upon, but to ascend by. The earth 
 helped the woman.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. David enters into a treaty with Abner, but upon condition that he 
 shall procure him the restitution of Michal his wife, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Hereby,

 1.  David showed the sincerity of his conjugal affection to his first
 and most rightful wife; neither her marrying another, nor his, had 
 alienated him from her. Many waters could not quench that love. 

 2. He testified his respect to the house of Saul. So far was he from
 trampling upon it, now that it was fallen, that even in his elevation 
 he valued himself not a little on his relation to it. He cannot be 
 pleased with the honours of the throne unless he have Michal, Saul's 
 daughter, to share with him in them, so far is he from bearing any 
 malice to the family of his enemy. Abner sent him word that he must 
 apply to Ish-bosheth, which he did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 pleading that he had purchased her at a dear rate, and she was
 wrongfully taken from him.  Ish-bosheth durst not deny his demand, now 
 that he had not Abner to stand by him, but took her from Phaltiel, to 
 whom Saul had married her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and Abner conducted her to David, not doubting but that then he should
 be doubly welcome when he brought him a wife in one hand and a crown in 
 the other. Her latter husband was loth to part with her, and followed 
 her <I>weeping</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 but there was no remedy: he must thank himself; for when he took her he
 knew that another had a right to her. Usurpers must expect to resign. 
 Let no man therefore set his heart on that to which he is not entitled. 
 If any disagreement has separated husband and wife, as they expect the 
 blessing of God let them be reconciled, and come together again; let 
 all former quarrels be forgotten, and let them live together in love, 
 according to God's holy ordinance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Abner uses his interest with the elders of Israel to bring them 
 over to David, knowing that whichever way they went the common people 
 would follow of course. Now that it serves his own turn he can plead in 
 David's behalf that he was, 
 
 1. Israel's choice
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>You sought for him in times past to be king over you,</I> when he
 had signalized himself in so many engagements with the Philistines and 
 done you so much good service; no man can pretend to greater personal 
 merit than David nor to less than Ish-bosheth. You have tried them 
 both, <I>Detur digniori--Give the crown to him that best deserves 
 it.</I> Let David be your king." 
 
 2. God's choice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>The Lord hath spoken of David.</I> Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 When God appointed Samuel to anoint him he did, in effect, promise that
 by his hand he would save Israel; for for that end he was made king. 
 God having promised, by David's hand, to save Israel, it is both your 
 duty, in compliance with God's will, and your interest, in order to 
 your victories over your enemies, to submit to him; and it is the 
 greatest folly in the world to oppose him." Who would have expected 
 such reasonings as these out of Abner's mouth? But thus God will make 
 the enemies of his people to know and own <I>that he has loved 
 them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9">Rev. iii. 9</A>.

 He particularly applied to the men of Benjamin, those of his own tribe,
 on whom he had the greatest influence, and whom he had drawn in to 
 appear for the house of Saul. He was the man that had deceived them, 
 and therefore he was concerned to undeceive them. Thus the multitude 
 are as they are managed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. David concludes the treaty with Abner; and he did wisely and well 
 therein; for, whatever induced Abner to it, it was a good work to put 
 an end to the war, and to settle the Lord's anointed on the throne; and 
 it was as lawful for David to make use of his agency as it is for a 
 poor man to receive alms from a Pharisee, who gives it in pride and 
 hypocrisy. Abner reported to David the sense of the people and the 
 success of his communications with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He came now, not as at first privately, but with a retinue of twenty
 men, and David entertained them with <I>a feast</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 in token of reconciliation and joy and as a pledge of the agreement
 between them: it was a feast upon a covenant, like that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:30">Gen. xxvi. 30</A>.
 
 <I>If thy enemy hunger, feed him;</I> but, if he submit, feast him.
 Abner, pleased with his entertainment, the prevention of his fall with 
 Saul's house (which would have been inevitable if he had not taken this 
 course), and much more with the prospect he had of preferment under 
 David, undertakes in a little time to perfect the revolution, and to 
 bring all Israel into obedience to David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 He tells David he shall <I>reign over all that his heart desired.</I>
 He knew David's elevation took rise from God's appointment, yet he 
 insinuates that it sprang from his own ambition and desire of rule; 
 thus (as bad men often do) he measured that good man by himself. 
 However, David and he parted very good friends, and the affair between 
 them was well settled. Thus it behoves all who fear God and keep his 
 commandments to avoid strife, even with the wicked, to live at peace 
 with all men, and to show the world that they are children of the 
 light.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from
 <I>pursuing</I> a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but
 Abner <I>was</I> not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away,
 and he was gone in peace.
 &nbsp; 23 When Joab and all the host that <I>was</I> with him were come,
 they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king,
 and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
 &nbsp; 24 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?
 behold, Abner came unto thee; why <I>is</I> it <I>that</I> thou hast sent
 him away, and he is quite gone?
 &nbsp; 25 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive
 thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know
 all that thou doest.
 &nbsp; 26 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers
 after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but
 David knew <I>it</I> not.
 &nbsp; 27 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside
 in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under
 the fifth <I>rib,</I> that he died, for the blood of Asahel his
 brother.
 &nbsp; 28 And afterward when David heard <I>it,</I> he said, I and my
 kingdom <I>are</I> guiltless before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for ever from the blood
 of Abner the son of Ner:
 &nbsp; 29 Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's
 house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that
 hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or
 that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.
 &nbsp; 30 So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had
 slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
 &nbsp; 31 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that <I>were</I>
 with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and
 mourn before Abner. And king David <I>himself</I> followed the bier.
 &nbsp; 32 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his
 voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.
 &nbsp; 33 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a
 fool dieth?
 &nbsp; 34 Thy hands <I>were</I> not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters:
 as a man falleth before wicked men, <I>so</I> fellest thou. And all
 the people wept again over him.
 &nbsp; 35 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat
 while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and
 more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.
 &nbsp; 36 And all the people took notice <I>of it,</I> and it pleased them:
 as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.
 &nbsp; 37 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that
 it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.
 &nbsp; 38 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there
 is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
 &nbsp; 39 And I <I>am</I> this day weak, though anointed king; and these
 men the sons of Zeruiah <I>be</I> too hard for me: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall
 reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the murder of Abner by Joab, and David's 
 deep resentment of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Joab very insolently fell foul upon David for treating with Abner. 
 He happened to be abroad upon service when Abner was with David, 
 pursuing a troop, either of Philistines or of Saul's party; but, upon 
 his return, he was informed that Abner was just gone 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>),

 and that a great many kind things had passed between David and him. He
 had all the reason in the world to be satisfied of David's prudence and 
 to acquiesce in the measures he took, knowing him to be a wise and good 
 man himself and under a divine conduct in all his affairs; and yet, as 
 if he had the same sway in David's cause that Abner had in 
 Ish-bosheth's, he chides David, and reproaches him to his face as 
 impolitic

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>):

 <I>What hast thou done?</I> As if David were accountable to him for
 what he did: "<I>Why hast thou sent him away,</I> when thou mightest 
 have made him a prisoner? He came as a spy, and will certainly betray 
 thee." I know not whether to wonder more that Joab had impudence enough 
 to give such an affront to his prince or that David had patience enough 
 to take it. He does, in effect, call David <I>a fool</I> when he tells 
 him he knew Abner came to deceive him and yet he trusted him. We find 
 no answer that David gave him, not because he feared him, as 
 Ish-bosheth did Abner

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 but because he despised him, or because Joab had not so much good
 manners as to stay for an answer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He very treacherously sent for Abner back, and, under colour of a 
 private conference with him, barbarously killed him with his own hand. 
 That he made use of David's name, under pretence of giving him some 
 further instructions, is intimated in that, <I>but David knew it 
 not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Abner, designing no harm, feared none, but very innocently returned to
 Hebron, and, when he found Joab waiting for him at the gate, turned 
 aside with him to speak with him privately, forgetting what he himself 
 had said when he slew Asahel, <I>How shall I hold up my face to Joab 
 thy brother?</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+2:22"><I>ch.</I> ii. 22</A>),

 and there Joab murdered him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),
 
 and it is intimated
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>)

 that Abishai was privy to the design, and was aiding and abetting, and
 would have come in to his brother's assistance if there had been 
 occasion; he is therefore charged as an accessary: <I>Joab and Abishai 
 slew Abner,</I> though perhaps he only knew it who is privy to the 
 thoughts and intents of men's hearts. Now in this, 

 1. It is certain that the Lord was righteous. Abner had maliciously,
 and against the convictions of his conscience, opposed David. He had 
 now basely deserted Ish-bosheth, and betrayed him, under pretence of 
 regard to God and Israel, but really from a principle of pride, and 
 revenge, and impatience of control. God will not therefore use so bad a 
 man, though David might, in so good a work as the uniting of Israel. 
 Judgments are prepared for such scorners as Abner was. But, 

 2. It is as certain that Joab was unrighteous, and, in what he did, did
 wickedly.  David was a man after God's own heart, but could not have 
 those about him, no, not in places of the greatest trust, after his own 
 heart. Many a good prince, and a good master, has been forced to employ 
 bad men.

 (1.) Even the pretence for doing this was very unjust. Abner had indeed 
 slain his brother Asahel, and Joab and Abishai pretended herein to be 
 the avengers of his blood 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:27,30"><I>v.</I> 27, 30</A>);

 but Abner slew Asahel in an open war, wherein Abner indeed had given
 the challenge, but Joab himself had accepted it and had slain many of 
 Abner's friends. He did it likewise in his own defence, and not till he 
 had given him fair warning (which he would not take), and he did it 
 with reluctancy; but Joab here shed <I>the blood of war in peace,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:5">1 Kings  ii. 5</A>.

 (2.) That which we have reason to think was at the bottom of Joab's
 enmity to Abner made it much worse. Joab was now general of David's 
 forces; but, if Abner should come into his interest, he would possibly 
 be preferred before him, being a senior officer, and more experienced 
 in the art of war.  This Joab was jealous of, and could better bear the 
 guilt of blood than the thoughts of a rival. 

 (3.) He did it treacherously, and under pretence of speaking peaceably 
 to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:24">Deut. xxvii. 24</A>.

 Had he challenged him, he would have done like a soldier; but to
 assassinate him was done villainously and like a coward. <I>His words 
 were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:21">Ps. lv. 21</A>.

 Thus he basely slew Amasa,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:9"><I>ch.</I> xx. 9, 10</A>.

 (4.) The doing of it was a great affront and injury to David, who was
 now in treaty with Abner, as Joab knew. Abner was now actually in his 
 master's service, so that, through his side, he struck at David 
 himself. 

 (5.) It was a great aggravation of the murder that he did it in the
 gate, openly and avowedly, as one that was not ashamed, nor could 
 blush. The gate was the place of judgment and the place of concourse, 
 to that he did it in defiance of justice, both the just sentence of the 
 magistrates and the just resentment of the crowd, as one that neither 
 feared God nor regarded men, but thought himself above all control: and 
 Hebron was a Levites' city and a city of refuge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. David laid deeply to heart and in many ways expressed his 
 detestation of this execrable villany.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He washed his hands from the guilt of Abner's blood. Lest any should 
 suspect that Joab had some secret intimation from David to do as he did 
 (and the rather because he went so long unpunished), he here solemnly 
 appeals to God concerning his innocency: <I>I and my kingdom are 
 guiltless</I> (and my kingdom is so because I am so) <I>before the Lord 
 for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 It is a comfort to be able to say, when any bad thing is done, that we
 had no hand in it. <I>We have not shed this blood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:7">Deut. xxi. 7</A>.

 However we may be censured or suspected, <I>our hearts shall not
 reproach us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He entailed the curse for it upon Joab and his family 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 "<I>Let it rest on the head of Joab.</I> Let the blood cry against him,
 and let divine vengeance follow him. Let the iniquity be visited upon 
 his children and children's children, in some hereditary disease or 
 other. The longer the punishment is delayed, the longer let it last 
 when it shall come. Let his posterity be stigmatized, blemished with an 
 issue or a leprosy, which will shut them out from society; let them be 
 beggars, or cripples, or come to some untimely end, that it may be 
 said, He is one of Joab's race." This intimates that the guilt of blood 
 brings a curse upon families; if men do not avenge it, God will, and 
 will lay up the iniquity for the children. But methinks a resolute 
 punishment of the murderer himself would better have become David than 
 this passionate imprecation of God's judgments upon his posterity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He called upon all about him, even Joab himself, to lament the death 
 of Abner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>Rend your clothes and mourn before Abner,</I> that is, before the
 hearse of Abner, as Abraham is said to mourn <I>before his dead</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:2,3">Gen. xxiii. 2, 3</A>),

 and he gives a reason why they should attend his funeral with sincere
 and solemn mourning

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 because there is <I>a prince and a great man fallen this day in
 Israel.</I> His alliance to Saul, his place as general, his interest, 
 and the great services he had formerly done, were enough to denominate 
 him <I>a prince and a great man.</I> When he could not call him a saint 
 or a good man, he said nothing of that, but what was true he gave him 
 the praise of, though he had been his enemy, that he was <I>a prince 
 and a great man.</I> "Such a man has fallen in Israel, and fallen 
 <I>this day,</I> just when he was doing the best deed he ever did in 
 his life, <I>this day,</I> when he was likely to be so serviceable to 
 the public peace and welfare and could so ill be spared."

 (1.) Let them all lament it. The humbling change death puts all men 
 under is to be lamented, especially as affecting princes and great men. 
 Alas! alas! (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:10">Rev. xviii. 10</A>)

 how mean, how little, are those made by death who made themselves the
 terror of the mighty in the land of the living! But we are especially 
 obliged to lament the fall of useful men in the midst of their 
 usefulness and when there is most need of them. A public loss must be 
 every man's grief, for every man shares in it. Thus David took care 
 that honour should be done to the memory of a man of merit, to animate 
 others.

 (2.) Let Joab, in a particular manner, lament it, which he has less 
 heart but more reason to do than any of them. If he could be brought to 
 do it sincerely, it would be an expression of repentance for his sin in 
 slaying him. If he did it in show only, as it is likely he did, yet it 
 was a sort of penance imposed upon him, and a present commutation of 
 the punishment. If he do not as yet expiate the murder with his blood, 
 let him do something towards it with tears.  This, perhaps, Joab 
 submitted to with no great reluctancy, now he had gained his point. Now 
 that he is on the bier, no matter in what pomp he lies.  <I>Sit divus, 
 modo non sit vivus</I>--<I>Let him be canonized, so that he be but 
 killed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. David himself followed the corpse as chief mourner, and made a 
 funeral oration at the grave. He attended the bier 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>)

 <I>and wept at the grave,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Though Abner had been his enemy, and might possibly have proved no very
 firm friend, yet because he had been a man of bravery in the field, and 
 might have done great service in the public counsels at this critical 
 juncture, all former quarrels are forgotten and David is a true mourner 
 for his fall. What he said over the grave fetched fresh floods of tears 
 from the eyes of all that were present, when they thought they had 
 already paid the debt in full

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:33,34"><I>v.</I> 33, 34</A>):
 
 <I>Died Abner as a fool dieth?</I>

 (1.) He speaks as one vexed that Abner was fooled out of his life, that 
 so great a man as he, so famed for conduct and courage, should be 
 imposed upon by a colour of friendship, slain by surprise, and so die 
 as a fool dies. The wisest and stoutest of men have no fence against 
 treachery. To see Abner, who thought himself the main hinge on which 
 the great affairs of Israel turned, so considerable as himself to be 
 able to turn the scale of a trembling government, his head full of 
 great projects and great prospects, to see him made a fool of by a base 
 rival, and falling on a sudden a sacrifice to his ambition and 
 jealousy--this stains the pride of all glory, and should put one out of 
 conceit with worldly grandeur.  <I>Put not your trust in princes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:3,4">Ps. cxlvi. 3, 4</A>.

 And let us therefore make that sure which we cannot be fooled out of. A
 man may have his life, and all that is dear to him, taken from him, and 
 not be able to prevent it with all his wisdom, care, and integrity; but 
 there is that which no thief can break through to steal. See here how 
 much more we are beholden to God's providence than to our own prudence 
 for the continuance of our lives and comforts.  Were it not for the 
 hold God has of the consciences of bad men, how soon would the weak and 
 innocent become an easy prey to the strong and merciless and the wisest 
 die as fools! Or,

 (2.) He speaks as one boasting that Abner did not fool himself out of 
 his life: "<I>Died Abner as a fool dies?</I> No, he did not, not as a 
 criminal, a traitor or felon, that forfeits his life into the hands of 
 public justice; his hands were not pinioned, nor his feet fettered, as 
 those of malefactors are: Abner falls not before just men, by a 
 judicial sentence; but as <I>a man, an innocent man, falleth before 
 wicked men,</I> thieves and robbers, so fellest thou." <I>Died Abner as 
 Nabal died?</I> so the LXX.  reads it. Nabal died as he lived, like 
 himself, like a sot; but Abner's fate was such as might have been the 
 fate of the wisest and best man in the world. Abner did not throw away 
 his life as Asahel did, who wilfully ran upon the spear, after fair 
 warning, but he was struck by surprise. Note, It is a sad thing to die 
 like a fool, as those do that in any way shorten their own days, and 
 much more those that make no provision for another world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He fasted all that day, and would by no means be persuaded to eat 
 any thing till night, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 It was then the custom of great mourners to refrain for the time from 
 bodily refreshments, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:12,1Sa+31:13"><I>ch.</I> i. 12; 1 Sam. xxxi. 13</A>.

 How incongruous is it then to turn the house of mourning into a house
 of feasting! This respect which David paid to Abner was very pleasing 
 to the people and satisfied them that he was not, in the least, 
 accessory to the murder 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>),

 of which he was solicitous to avoid the suspicion, lest Joab's villany
 should make him odious, as that of Simeon and Levi did Jacob, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:30">Gen. xxxiv. 30</A>.

 On this occasion it is said, <I>Whatever the king did pleased all the
 people.</I> This intimates,

 (1.) His good affection to them. He studied to please them in every 
 thing and carefully avoided what might be disobliging. 

 (2.) Their good opinion of him. They thought every thing he did well 
 done.  Such a mutual willingness to please, and easiness to be pleased, 
 will make every relation comfortable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He bewailed it that he could not with safety do justice on the 
 murderers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 He was weak, his kingdom was newly planted, and a little shake would
 overthrow it. Joab's family had a great interest, were bold and daring, 
 and to make them his enemies now might be of bad consequence. These 
 sons of Zeruiah were too hard for him, too big for the law to take hold 
 of; and therefore, though by man, by the magistrate, the blood of a 
 murderer <I>should be shed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:6">Gen. ix. 6</A>),
 
 David bears the sword in vain, and contents himself, as a private
 person, to leave them to the judgment of God: <I>The Lord shall reward
 the doer of evil according to his wickedness.</I> Now this is a 
 diminution, 

 (1.) To David's greatness. He is anointed king, and yet is kept in awe 
 by his own subjects, and some of them are too hard for him.  Who would 
 be fond of power when a man may have the name of it, and must be 
 accountable for it, and yet be hampered in the use of it? 

 (2.) To David's goodness. He ought to have done his duty, and trusted 
 God with the issue. <I>Fiat justitia, ruat coelum</I>--<I>Let justice 
 be done, though the heavens should fall asunder.</I> If the law had had 
 its course against Joab, perhaps the murder of Ishbosheth, Amnon, and 
 others, would have been prevented. It was carnal policy and cruel pity 
 that spared Joab. Righteousness supports the throne and will never 
 shake it. Yet it was only a reprieve that David gave to Joab; on his 
 death-bed he left it to Solomon (who could the better wield the sword 
 of justice because he had no occasion to draw the sword of war) to 
 avenge the blood of Abner. Evil pursues sinners, and will overtake them 
 at last. David preferred Abner's son Jaasiel,
