 In this chapter we have, 
 
 I. David's kingdom established, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+14:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II.  His family built up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+14:3-7">ver. 3-7</A>.

 III. His enemies, the Philistines, routed in two campaigns, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+14:8-17">ver. 8-17</A>.

 This is repeated here from

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber
 of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house.
 &nbsp; 2  And David perceived that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had confirmed him king over
 Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his
 people Israel.
 &nbsp; 3  And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more
 sons and daughters.
 &nbsp; 4  Now these <I>are</I> the names of <I>his</I> children which he had in
 Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
 &nbsp; 5  And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,
 &nbsp; 6  And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
 &nbsp; 7  And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe here, 

 1. There is no man that has such a sufficiency in himself but he has
 need of his neighbours and has reason to be thankful for their help: 
 David had a very large kingdom, Hiram a very little one; yet David 
 could not build himself a house to his mind unless Hiram furnished him 
 with both workmen and materials,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This is a reason why we should despise none, but, as we have
 opportunity, be obliging to all. 

 2. It is a great satisfaction to a wise man to be settled, and to a
 good man to see the special providences of God in his settlement. The 
 people had made David king; but he could not be easy, nor think himself 
 happy, till he perceived that <I>the Lord had confirmed him king over 
 Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 "Who shall unfix me if God hath fixed me?" 

 3. We must look upon all our advancements as designed for our
 usefulness.  <I>David's kingdom was lifted up on high,</I> not for his 
 own sake, that he might look great, but <I>because of his people 
 Israel,</I> that he might be a guide and protector to them. We are 
 blessed in order that we may be blessings.  See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:2">Gen. xii. 2</A>.

 We are not born, nor do we live, for ourselves. 

 4. It is difficult to thrive without growing secure and indulgent to
 the flesh.  It was David's infirmity that when he settled in his 
 kingdom <I>he took more wives</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 yet the numerous issue he had added to his honour and strength. Lo,
 <I>children are a heritage of the Lord.</I> We had an account of 
 David's children, not only in Samuel, but in this book

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:1-9"><I>ch.</I> iii. 1</A>,

 &c.) and now here again; for it was
 their honour to have such a father.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king
 over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And
 David heard <I>of it,</I> and went out against them.
 &nbsp; 9  And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley
 of Rephaim.
 &nbsp; 10  And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the
 Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine
 hand.
 &nbsp; 11  So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there.
 Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine
 hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the
 name of that place Baal-perazim.
 &nbsp; 12  And when they had left their gods there, David gave a
 commandment, and they were burned with fire.
 &nbsp; 13  And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in
 the valley.
 &nbsp; 14  Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto
 him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon
 them over against the mulberry trees.
 &nbsp; 15  And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in
 the tops of the mulberry trees, <I>that</I> then thou shalt go out to
 battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of
 the Philistines.
 &nbsp; 16  David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the
 host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.
 &nbsp; 17  And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 brought the fear of him upon all nations.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This narrative of David's triumph over the Philistines is much the same 
 with that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:17-25">2 Sam. v. 17</A>,

 &c.

 1. Let the attack which the Philistines made upon David forbid us to be
 secure in any settlement or advancement, and engage us to expect 
 molestation in this world. When we are most easy something or other may 
 come to be a terror or vexation to us. Christ's kingdom will thus be 
 insulted by the serpent's seed, especially when it makes any advances. 
 
 2. Let David's enquiry of God, once and again, upon occasion of the
 Philistines' invading him, direct us in all our ways to acknowledge 
 God--in distress to fly to him, when we are wronged to appeal to him, 
 and, when we know not what to do, to ask counsel at his oracles, to put 
 ourselves under his direction, and to beg of him to show us the right 
 way. 

 3. Let David's success encourage us to resist our spiritual enemies, in
 observance of divine directions and dependence on divine strength. 
 Resist the devil, and he shall flee as the Philistines did before 
 David. 

 4.  Let the sound of the going in the tops of the mulberry trees direct
 us to attend God's motions both in his providence and in the influences 
 of his Spirit. When we perceive God to go before us let us gird up our 
 loins, gird on our armour, and follow him.  

 5.  Let David's burning the gods of the Philistines, when they fell
 into his hands, teach us a holy indignation against idolatry and all 
 the remains of it.  

 6. Let David's thankful acknowledgment of the hand of God in his
 successes direct us to bring all our sacrifices of praise to God's 
 altar. <I>Not unto us, O Lord! not unto us, but to thy name give 
 glory.</I> 

 7. Let the reputation which David obtained, not only in his kingdom,
 but among his neighbours, be looked upon as a type and figure of the 
 exalted honour of the Son of David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+14:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>The fame of David went out into all lands;</I> he was generally
 talked of, and admired by all people, and <I>the Lord brought the fear 
 of him upon all nations.</I> All looked upon him as a formidable enemy 
 and a desirable ally. Thus has God highly exalted our Redeemer, and 
 given him a name above every name.</P>
