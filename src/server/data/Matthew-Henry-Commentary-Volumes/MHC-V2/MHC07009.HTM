 The apostasy of Israel after the death of Gideon is punished, not as 
 the former apostasies by a foreign invasion, or the oppressions of any 
 neighbouring power, but by intestine broils among themselves, which in 
 this chapter we have the story of; and it is hard to say whether their 
 sin or their misery appears most in it. It is an account of the 
 usurpation and tyranny of Abimelech, who was base son to Gideon; so we 
 must call him, and not more modishly his natural son: he was so unlike 
 him. We are here told, 

 I. How he thrust himself into the government at Shechem, his own city,
 by subtlety and cruelty, particularly by the murder of all his 
 brethren,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. How his doom was read in a parable by Jotham, Gideon's youngest son, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:7-21">ver. 7-21</A>.

 III. What strifes there were between Abimelech and his friends the
 Shechemites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:22-41">ver.  22-41</A>.

 IV. How this ended in the ruin of the Shechemites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:42-49">ver. 42-49</A>),

 and of Abimelech himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:50-57">ver. 50-57</A>.

 Of this meteor, this ignis fatuus of a prince, that was not a protector
 but a plague to his country, we may say, as once was said of a great 
 tyrant, that he came in like a fox, ruled like a lion, and died like a 
 dog.  "For the transgression of a land, such are the princes 
 thereof."</P>

 1 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his
 mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the
 family of the house of his mother's father, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem,
 Whether <I>is</I> better for you, either that all the sons of
 Jerubbaal, <I>which are</I> threescore and ten persons, reign over
 you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I <I>am</I> your
 bone and your flesh.
 &nbsp; 3 And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the
 men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to
 follow Abimelech; for they said, He <I>is</I> our brother.
 &nbsp; 4 And they gave him threescore and ten <I>pieces</I> of silver out
 of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and
 light persons, which followed him.
 &nbsp; 5 And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his
 brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, <I>being</I> threescore and ten
 persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest
 son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
 &nbsp; 6 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the
 house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain
 of the pillar that <I>was</I> in Shechem.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told by what arts Abimelech got into authority, and made 
 himself great. His mother perhaps had instilled into his mind some 
 towering ambitious thoughts, and the name his father gave him, carrying 
 royalty in it, might help to blow up these sparks; and now that he has 
 buried his father nothing will serve his proud spirit but he will 
 succeed him in the government of Israel, directly contrary to his 
 father's will, for he had declared <I>no son of his should rule over 
 them.</I> He had no call from God to this honour as his father had, nor 
 was there any present occasion for a judge to deliver Israel as there 
 was when his father was advanced; but his own ambition must be 
 gratified, and its gratification is all he aims at. Now observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How craftily he got his mother's relations into his interests. 
 Shechem was a city in the tribe of Ephraim, of great note. Joshua had 
 held his last assembly there. If that city would but appear for him, 
 and set him up, he thought it would go far in his favour. There he had 
 an interest in the family of which his mother was, and by them he made 
 an interest in the leading men of the city. It does not appear that any 
 of them had an eye to him as a man of merit, who had any thing to 
 recommend him to such a choice, but the motion came first from himself. 
 None would have dreamed of making such a one king, if he had not 
 dreamed of it himself. And see here, 

 1. How he wheedled them into the choice,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 He basely suggested that Gideon having left seventy sons, who made a 
 good figure and had a good interest, they were designing to keep the 
 power which their father had in their hands, and by a joint-influence 
 to reign over Israel. "Now," says he, "you had better have one king 
 than more, than many, than so many. Affairs of state are best managed 
 by a single person," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 We have no reason to think that all or any of Gideon's sons had the 
 least intention to reign over Israel (they were of their father's mind, 
 that <I>the Lord should reign over them,</I> and they were not called 
 of him), yet this he insinuates to pave the way to his own pretensions. 
 Note, Those who design ill themselves are commonly most apt to suspect 
 that others design ill. As for himself, he only puts them in mind of 
 his relation to them (<I>verbum sapienti--A word to the wise is 
 sufficient): Remember that I am your bone and your flesh.</I> The plot 
 took wonderfully. The magistrates of Shechem were pleased to think of 
 their city being a royal city and the metropolis of Israel, and 
 therefore they <I>inclined to follow him; for they said, "He is our 
 brother,</I> and his advancement will be our advantage." 

 2. How he got money from them to bear the charges of his pretensions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>They gave him seventy pieces of silver;</I> it is not said what the 
 value of these pieces was; so many shekels are less, and so many 
 talents more, than we can well imagine; therefore it is supposed they 
 were each a pound weight: but they gave this money out of the house of 
 Baal-berith, that is, out of the public treasury, which, out of respect 
 to their idol, they deposited in his temple to be protected by him; or 
 out of the offerings that had been made to that idol, which they hoped 
 would prosper the better in his hands for its having been consecrated 
 to their god. How unfit was he to reign over Israel, because unlikely 
 to defend them, who, instead of restraining and punishing idolatry, 
 thus early made himself a pensioner to an idol! 3. What soldiers he 
 enlisted. He hired into his service vain and light persons, the scum 
 and scoundrels of the country, men of broken fortunes, giddy heads, and 
 profligate lives; none but such would own him, and they were fittest to 
 serve his purpose. Like leader like followers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How cruelly he got his father's sons out of the way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The first thing he did with the rabble he headed was to kill all his 
 brethren at once, publicly and in cold blood, threescore and ten men, 
 one only escaping, all slain upon one stone. See in this bloody 
 tragedy, 

 (1.) The power of ambition what beasts it will turn men into, how it 
 will break through all the ties of natural affection and natural 
 conscience, and sacrifice that which is most sacred, dear, and 
 valuable, to its designs. Strange that ever it should enter into the 
 heart of a man to be so very barbarous! 

 (2.) The peril of honour and high birth. Their being the sons of so 
 great a man as Gideon exposed them thus and made Abimelech jealous of 
 them. We find just the same number of Ahab's sons slain together at 
 Samaria,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:1,7">2 Kings x. 1, 7</A>.

 The grand seigniors have seldom thought themselves safe while any of
 their brethren have been unstrangled. Let none then envy those of high 
 extraction, or complain of their own meanness and obscurity. The lower 
 the safer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Way being thus made for Abimelech's election, the men of Shechem 
 proceeded to choose him king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 God was not consulted whether they should have any king at all, much 
 less who it should be; here is no advising with the priest or with 
 their brethren of any other city or tribe, though it was designed that 
 he should reign over Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 But,

 (1.) The Shechemites, as if they were the people and wisdom must die 
 with them, did all; they aided and abetted him in the murder of his 
 brethren 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:24"><I>v.</I>  24</A>),

 and then they <I>made him king.</I> The men of Shechem (that is, the
 great men, the chief magistrates of the city), and the house of Millo 
 (that is, the common-council, the <I>full house</I> or <I>house of 
 fulness,</I> as the word signifies), those that met in their guildhall 
 (we read often of the house of Millo, or state-house in Jerusalem, or 
 the city of David,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:9,2Ki+12:20">2 Sam. v. 9; 2 Kings xii. 20</A>),

 these gathered together, not to prosecute and punish Abimelech for this
 barbarous murder, as they ought to have done, he being one of their 
 citizens, but to <I>make him king. Pretium sceleris tulit hic 
 diadema--His wickedness was rewarded with a diadem.</I> What could they 
 promise themselves from a king that laid the foundation of his kingdom 
 in blood? 

 (2.) The rest of the Israelites were so very sottish as to sit by 
 unconcerned. They took no care to give check to this usurpation, to 
 protect the sons of Gideon, or to avenge their death, but tamely 
 submitted to the bloody tyrant, as men who with their religion had lost 
 their reason, and all sense of honour and liberty, justice and 
 gratitude. How vigorously had their fathers appeared to avenge the 
 death of the Levite's concubine, and yet so wretchedly degenerate are 
 they now as not to attempt the avenging of the death of Gideon's sons; 
 it is for this that they are charged with ingratitude

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:35"><I>ch.</I> viii. 35</A>):
 
 <I>Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And when they told <I>it</I> to Jotham, he went and stood in the
 top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and
 said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may
 hearken unto you.
 &nbsp; 8 The trees went forth <I>on a time</I> to anoint a king over them;
 and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.
 &nbsp; 9 But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
 wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted
 over the trees?
 &nbsp; 10 And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, <I>and</I> reign
 over us.
 &nbsp; 11 But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my
 sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the
 trees?
 &nbsp; 12 Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, <I>and</I> reign
 over us.
 &nbsp; 13 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which
 cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?
 &nbsp; 14 Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, <I>and</I>
 reign over us.
 &nbsp; 15 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint
 me king over you, <I>then</I> come <I>and</I> put your trust in my shadow:
 and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the
 cedars of Lebanon.
 &nbsp; 16 Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that
 ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with
 Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the
 deserving of his hands;
 &nbsp; 17 (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far,
 and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:
 &nbsp; 18 And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and
 have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone,
 and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over
 the men of Shechem, because he <I>is</I> your brother;)
 &nbsp; 19 If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and
 with his house this day, <I>then</I> rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let
 him also rejoice in you:
 &nbsp; 20 But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the
 men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out
 from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour
 Abimelech.
 &nbsp; 21 And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt
 there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the only testimony that appears to have been borne against 
 the wicked confederacy of Abimelech and the men of Shechem. It was a 
 sign they had provoked God to depart from them that neither any prophet 
 was sent nor any remarkable judgment, to awaken this stupid people, and 
 to stop the progress of this threatening mischief. Only Jotham, the 
 youngest son of Gideon, who by a special providence escaped the common 
 ruin of his family 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 dealt plainly with the Shechemites, and his speech, which is here 
 recorded, shows him to have been a man of such great ingenuity and 
 wisdom, and really such an accomplished gentleman, that we cannot but 
 the more lament the fall of Gideon's sons. Jotham did not go about to 
 raise an army out of the other cities of Israel (in which, one would 
 think, he might have made a good interest for his father's sake), to 
 avenge his brethren's death, much less to set up himself in competition 
 with Abimelech, so groundless was the usurper's suggestion that the 
 sons of Gideon aimed at dominion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 but he contents himself with giving a faithful reproof to the 
 Shechemites, and fair warning of the fatal consequences. He got an 
 opportunity of speaking to them from the top of Mount Gerizim, the 
 mount of blessings, at the foot of which probably the Shechemites were, 
 upon some occasion or other, gathered together (Josephus says, 
 solemnizing a festival), and it seems they were willing to hear what he 
 had to say.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His preface is very serious: "<I>Hearken unto me, you men of 
 Shechem, that God may hearken unto you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 As ever you hope to obtain God's favour, and to be accepted of him, 
 give me a patient and impartial hearing." Note, Those who expect God to 
 hear their prayers must be willing to hear reason, to hear a faithful 
 reproof, and to hear the complaints and appeals of wronged innocency. 
 If we <I>turn away our ear from hearing the law, our prayer will be an 
 abomination,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:9">Prov. xxviii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His parable is very ingenious--that when the trees were disposed to
 choose a king the government was offered to those valuable trees the 
 olive, the fig-tree, and the vine, but they refused it, choosing rather 
 to serve than rule, to do good than bear sway. But the same tender 
 being made to the bramble he accepted it with vain-glorious exultation. 
 The way of instruction by parables is an ancient way, and very useful, 
 especially to give reproofs by.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He hereby applauds the generous modesty of Gideon, and the other 
 judges who were before him, and perhaps of the sons of Gideon, who had 
 declined accepting the state and power of kings when they might have 
 had them, and likewise shows that it is in general the temper of all 
 wise and good men to decline preferment and to choose rather to be 
 useful than to be great. 

 (1.) There was no occasion at all for the trees to choose a king; they 
 are all the <I>trees of the Lord which he has planted</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:16">Ps. civ. 16</A>)
 
 and which therefore he will protect. Nor was there any occasion for 
 Israel to talk of setting a king over them; for <I>the Lord was their 
 king.</I> 

 (2.) When they had it in their thoughts to choose a king they did not 
 offer the government to the stately cedar, or the lofty pine, which are 
 only for show and shade, and not otherwise useful till they are cut 
 down, but to the fruit-trees, the vine and the olive. Those that bear 
 fruit for the public good are justly respected and honoured by all that 
 are wise more than those that affect to make a figure. For a good 
 useful man some <I>would even dare to die.</I> 

 (3.) The reason which all these fruit-trees gave for their refusal was 
 much the same.  The olive pleads 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>Should I leave my wine,</I> wherewith both God and man are served 
 and honoured? for oil and wine were used both at God's altars and at 
 men's tables. And <I>shall I leave my sweetness, saith the fig-tree, 
 and my good fruit</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>and go to be promoted over the trees?</I> or, as the margin reads 
 it, <I>go up and down for the trees?</I> It is intimated, 

 [1.] That government involves a man in a great deal both of toil and 
 care; he that is promoted over the trees must go up and down for them, 
 and make himself a perfect drudge to business.

 [2.] That those who are preferred to places of public trust and power 
 must resolve to forego all their private interests and advantages, and 
 sacrifice them to the good of the community. The fig-tree must lose its 
 sweetness, its sweet retirement, sweet repose, and sweet conversation 
 and contemplation, if it go to be <I>promoted over the trees,</I> and 
 must undergo a constant fatigue.

 [3.] That those who are advanced to honour and dignity are in great
 danger of losing their fatness and fruitfulness.  Preferment is apt to 
 make men proud and slothful, and thus spoil their usefulness, with 
 which in a lower sphere they honoured God and man, for which reason 
 those that desire to do good are afraid of being too great.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He hereby exposes the ridiculous ambition of Abimelech, whom he 
 compares to the bramble or thistle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He supposes the trees to make their court to him: <I>Come thou and 
 reign over us,</I> perhaps because he knew not that the first motion of 
 Abimelech's preferment came from himself (as we found,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 but thought the Shechemites had proposed it to him; however, supposing 
 it so, his folly in accepting it deserved to be chastised. The bramble 
 is a worthless plant, not to be numbered among the trees, useless and 
 fruitless, nay, hurtful and vexatious, scratching and tearing, and 
 doing mischief; it began with the curse, and its end is to be burned. 
 Such a one was Abimelech, and yet chosen to the government <I>by the 
 trees, by all the trees;</I> this election seems to have been more 
 unanimous than any of the others.  Let us not think it strange if we 
 see <I>folly set in great dignity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:6">Eccl. x. 6</A>),

 and the <I>vilest men exalted</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:8">Ps. xii. 8</A>),

 and men blind to their own interest in the choice of their guides. The 
 bramble, being chosen to the government, takes no time to consider 
 whether he should accept it or no, but immediately, as if he had been 
 born and bred to dominion, hectors, and assures them they shall find 
 him as he found them. See what <I>great swelling words of vanity</I> he 
 speaks 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 what promises he makes to his faithful subjects: <I>Let them come and 
 trust in my shadow:</I> a goodly shadow to trust in! How unlike to 
 <I>the shadow of a great rock in a weary land,</I> which a good 
 magistrate is compared to! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:2">Isa. xxxii. 2</A>.

 Trust in his shadow!--more likely to be scratched if they came near
 him--more likely to be injured by him than benefited. Thus men <I>boast 
 of a false gift.</I> Yet he threatens with as much confidence as he 
 promises: If you be not faithful, <I>let fire come out of the 
 bramble</I> (a very unlikely thing to emit fire) and <I>devour the 
 cedars of Lebanon</I>--more likely to catch fire, and be itself 
 devoured.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His application is very close and plain. In it, 

 1. He reminds them of the many good services his father had done for
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He fought their battles, at the hazard of his own life, and to their 
 unspeakable advantage. It was a shame that they needed to be put in 
 mind of this. 

 2. He aggravates their unkindness to his father's family.  They had not
 <I>done to him according to the deserving of his hands,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Great merits often meet with very ill returns.  especially to 
 posterity, when the benefactor if forgotten, as Joseph was among the 
 Egyptians. Gideon had left many sons that were an honour to his name 
 and family, and these they had barbarously murdered; one son he had 
 left that was the blemish of his name and family, for he was <I>the son 
 of his maid-servant,</I> whom all that had any respect to Gideon's 
 honour would endeavour to conceal, yet him they made their king. In 
 both they put the utmost contempt imaginable upon Gideon. 3.  He leaves 
 it to the event to determine whether they had done well, whereby he 
 lodges the appeal with the divine providence.

 (1.) If they prospered long in this villany, he would give them leave 
 to say they had done well, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 "If your conduct towards the house of Gideon be such as can be 
 justified at any bar of justice, honour, or conscience, much good may 
 it do you with your new king." But,

 (2.) If they had, as he was sure they had, dealt basely and wickedly in 
 this matter, let them never expect to prosper, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Abimelech and the Shechemites, that had strengthened one another's 
 hands in this villany, would certainly be a plague and ruin one to 
 another. Let none expect to do ill and fare well.</P>

 Jotham, having given them this admonition, made a shift to escape with 
 his life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Either they could not reach him or they were so far convinced that they 
 would not add the guilt of his blood to all the rest. But, for fear of 
 Abimelech, he lived in exile, in some remote obscure place. Those whose 
 extraction and education are ever so high know not to what difficulties 
 and straits they may be reduced.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,
 &nbsp; 23 Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men
 of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with
 Abimelech:
 &nbsp; 24 That the cruelty <I>done</I> to the threescore and ten sons of
 Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech
 their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem,
 which aided him in the killing of his brethren.
 &nbsp; 25 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top
 of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by
 them: and it was told Abimelech.
 &nbsp; 26 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went
 over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in
 him.
 &nbsp; 27 And they went out into the fields, and gathered their
 vineyards, and trode <I>the grapes,</I> and made merry, and went into
 the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed
 Abimelech.
 &nbsp; 28 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who <I>is</I> Abimelech, and who
 <I>is</I> Shechem, that we should serve him? <I>is</I> not <I>he</I> the son of
 Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the
 father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?
 &nbsp; 29 And would to God this people were under my hand! then would
 I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine
 army, and come out.
 &nbsp; 30 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal
 the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
 &nbsp; 31 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying,
 Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem;
 and, behold, they fortify the city against thee.
 &nbsp; 32 Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that <I>is</I>
 with thee, and lie in wait in the field:
 &nbsp; 33 And it shall be, <I>that</I> in the morning, as soon as the sun
 is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold,
 <I>when</I> he and the people that <I>is</I> with him come out against
 thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
 &nbsp; 34 And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that <I>were</I> with
 him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four
 companies.
 &nbsp; 35 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering
 of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people
 that <I>were</I> with him, from lying in wait.
 &nbsp; 36 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold,
 there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul
 said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as <I>if they
 were</I> men.
 &nbsp; 37 And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by
 the middle of the land, and another company come along by the
 plain of Meonenim.
 &nbsp; 38 Then said Zebul unto him, Where <I>is</I> now thy mouth,
 wherewith thou saidst, Who <I>is</I> Abimelech, that we should serve
 him? <I>is</I> not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I
 pray now, and fight with them.
 &nbsp; 39 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with
 Abimelech.
 &nbsp; 40 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many
 were overthrown <I>and</I> wounded, <I>even</I> unto the entering of the
 gate.
 &nbsp; 41 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and
 his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
 &nbsp; 42 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out
 into the field; and they told Abimelech.
 &nbsp; 43 And he took the people, and divided them into three
 companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold,
 the people <I>were</I> come forth out of the city; and he rose up
 against them, and smote them.
 &nbsp; 44 And Abimelech, and the company that <I>was</I> with him, rushed
 forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and
 the two <I>other</I> companies ran upon all <I>the people</I> that <I>were</I>
 in the fields, and slew them.
 &nbsp; 45 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he
 took the city, and slew the people that <I>was</I> therein, and beat
 down the city, and sowed it with salt.
 &nbsp; 46 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard <I>that,</I>
 they entered into a hold of the house of the god Berith.
 &nbsp; 47 And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of
 Shechem were gathered together.
 &nbsp; 48 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the
 people that <I>were</I> with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his
 hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid
 <I>it</I> on his shoulder, and said unto the people that <I>were</I> with
 him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, <I>and</I> do as I <I>have
 done.</I>
 &nbsp; 49 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough,
 and followed Abimelech, and put <I>them</I> to the hold, and set the
 hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of
 Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three years Abimelech reigned, after a sort, without any disturbance; 
 it is not said, He judged Israel, or did any service at all to his 
 country, but so long he enjoyed the title and dignity of a king; and 
 not only the Shechemites, but many other places, paid him respect. They 
 must have been fond of a king that could please themselves with such a 
 one as this. But the triumphing of the wicked is short. <I>Within three 
 years, as the years of a hireling, all this glory shall be 
 contemned,</I> and laid in the dust, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:14">Isa. xvi. 14</A>.

 The ruin of these confederates in wickedness was from the righteous
 hand of the God to whom vengeance belongs. <I>He sent an evil spirit 
 between Abimelech and the Shechemites</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 that is, they grew jealous one of another and ill-affected one to 
 another. He slighted those that set him up, and perhaps countenanced 
 other cities which now began to come into his interests more than he 
 did theirs; and then they grew uneasy at his government, blamed his 
 conduct, and quarrelled at his impositions. This was from God. He 
 permitted the devil, that great mischief-maker, to sow discord between 
 them, and he is <I>an evil spirit,</I> whom God not only keeps under 
 his check, but sometimes serves his own purposes by.  Their own lusts 
 were evil spirits; they are devils in men's own hearts; from them come 
 wars and fightings. These God gave them up to, and so might be said to 
 <I>send the evil spirits between them.</I> When men's sin is made their 
 punishment, though God is not the author of the sin, yet the punishment 
 is from him. The quarrel God had with Abimelech and the Shechemites was 
 for the murder of the sons of Gideon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>That the cruelty done to them might come and their blood be laid</I> 
 as a burden <I>upon Abimelech that slew them, and the men of Shechem 
 that helped him.</I> Note, 

 1. Sooner or later God will make inquisition for blood, innocent blood,
 and will return it on the heads of those that shed it, who shall have 
 blood given them to drink, for they are worthy. 

 2.  Accessaries shall be reckoned with, as well as principals, in that
 and other sins.  The Shechemites that countenanced Abimelech's 
 pretensions, aided and abetted him in his bloody project, and avowed 
 the fact by making him king after he had done it, must fall with him, 
 fall by him, and fall first. 3. Those that combine together to do 
 wickedly are justly dashed in pieces one against another. Blood cannot 
 be a lasting cement to any interest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The Shechemites began to affront Abimelech, perhaps they scarcely 
 knew why or wherefore, but they were given to change. 

 1. They <I>dealt treacherously with him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 It is not said, They repented of their sin in owning him. Had they done 
 so, it would have been laudable to disown him; but they did it only 
 upon some particular pique conceived against him by their pride or 
 envy. Those that set him up were the first that deserted him and 
 endeavoured to dethrone him. It is not strange that those who were 
 ungrateful to Gideon were unfaithful to Abimelech; for what will hold 
 those that will not be held by the obligation of such merits as 
 Gideon's? Note, It is just with God that those who tempt others to be 
 cone perfidious should afterwards be themselves betrayed by those whom 
 they have taught to be perfidious. 

 2.  They aimed to seize him when he was at Arumah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 his country-seat. Expecting him to come to town, they <I>set liers in 
 wait for him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 who should make him their prisoner whom they had lately made their 
 prince. Those who were thus posted, he not coming, took the opportunity 
 of robbing travellers, which would help to make the people more and 
 more uneasy under Abimelech, when they saw he could not or would not 
 protect them from highway-men. 3. They entertained one Gaal, and set 
 him up as their head in opposition to Abimelech, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 This Gaal is said to be the son of <I>Ebed,</I> which signifies <I>a 
 servant,</I> perhaps denoting the meanness of his extraction. As 
 Abimelech was by the mother's side, so he by the father's, the son of a 
 servant. Here was one bramble contesting with another. We have reason 
 to suspect that this Gaal was a native Canaanite, because he courts the 
 Shechemites into subjection to the men of Hamor, who was the ancient 
 lord of this city in Jacob's time. He was a bold ambitious man, served 
 their purpose admirably well when they were disposed to quarrel with 
 Abimelech, and they also served his purpose; so he went over to them to 
 blow the coals, and they <I>put their confidence in him.</I> 

 4. They did all the despite they could to Abimelech's name,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 They made themselves very merry in his absence, as those who were glad 
 he was out of the way, and who, now that they had another to head them, 
 were in hopes to get clear of him; nay, they <I>went into the house of 
 their god,</I> to solemnize their feast of in-gathering, and there 
 <I>they did eat, and drink, and cursed Abimelech,</I> not only said all 
 the ill they could of him in their table-talk and the song of their 
 drunkards, but wished all the ill they could to him over their 
 sacrifices, praying to their idol to destroy him. They drank healths to 
 his confusion, and with as loud huzzas as ever they had drunk them to 
 his prosperity. That very temple whence they had fetched money to set 
 him up with did they now meet in to curse him and contrive his ruin. 
 Had they deserted their idol-god with their image-king, they might have 
 hoped to prosper; but, while they still cleave to the former, the 
 latter shall cleave to them to their ruin.  How should Satan cast out 
 Satan? 

 5. They pleased themselves with Gaal's vaunted defiance of Abimelech,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.

 They loved to hear that impudent upstart speak scornfully,

 (1.) Of Abimelech, though calling him in disdain <I>Shechem,</I> or 
 <I>a Shechemite,</I> he reflected upon their own city. 

 (2.) Of his good father likewise, Gideon: <I>Is not he the son of 
 Jerubbaal?</I> So he calls him, perhaps in an impious indignation at 
 his name and memory for throwing down the altar of Baal, turning that 
 to his reproach which was his praise. 

 (3.) Of his prime minister of state, <I>Zebul his officer, and ruler of 
 the city.</I> "We may well be ashamed to serve them, and need not be 
 afraid to oppose them." Men of turbulent ambitious spirits thus 
 <I>despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.</I> Gaal aimed not to 
 recover Shechem's liberty, only to change their tyrant: "<I>O that this 
 people were under my hand!</I> What I would do! I would challenge 
 Abimelech to try titles for the crown;" and it should seem he desired 
 his friends to send him word that he was ready to dispute it with him 
 whenever he pleased: "<I>Increase thy army, and come out.</I> Do thy 
 worst; let the point be determined by the sword." This pleased the 
 Shechemites, who were now as sick of Abimelech as ever they had been 
 fond of him. Men of no conscience will be men of no constancy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Abimelech turned all his force upon them, and, in a little time, 
 quite ruined them. Observe the steps of their overthrow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The Shechemites' counsels were betrayed to Abimelech by Zebul his 
 confidant, the ruler of the city, who continued hearty for him. <I>His 
 anger was kindled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 and the more because Gaal had spoken slightly of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 for perhaps, if he had complimented and caressed him now that things 
 were in this ferment, he might have gained him to his interest; but he, 
 being disobliged, sends notice to Abimelech of all that was said and 
 done in Shechem against him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Betrayers are often betrayed by some among themselves, and the cursing 
 of the king is sometimes strangely carried by a bird of the air. He 
 prudently advises him to come against the city immediately, and lose no 
 time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.

 He thinks it best that he should march his forces by night into the 
 neighbourhood, surprise the city in the morning, and then make the best 
 of his advantages. How could the Shechemites hope to speed in their 
 attempt when the ruler of their city was in the interests of their 
 enemy? They knew it, and yet took no care to secure him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Gaal, that headed their faction, having been betrayed by Zebul, 
 Abimelech's confidant, was most wretchedly bantered by him. Abimelech, 
 according to Zebul's advice, drew all his forces down upon Shechem by 
 night, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.
 
 Gaal, in the morning, went out <I>to the gate</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>)
 
 to see what posture things were in, and to enquire, What news? Zebul, 
 as a ruler of the city, met him there as a friend. Abimelech and his 
 forces beginning to move towards the city, Gaal discovers them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),
 
 takes notice of their approach to Zebul that was standing with him, 
 little thinking that he had sent for them and was now expecting them. 
 "Look," says he, "do not I see a body of men coming down from the 
 mountain towards us? Yonder they are," pointing to the place.  "No, 
 no," says Zebul; "thy eye-sight deceives thee; it is but <I>the shadow 
 of the mountains</I> which thou takest to be an army." By this he 
 intended, 

 (1.) To ridicule him, as a man of no sense or spirit, and therefore 
 very unfit for what he pretended to, as a man that might easily be 
 imposed upon and made to believe any thing, and that was so silly and 
 so cowardly that he apprehended danger where there was none, and was 
 ready to fight with a shadow. 

 (2.) To detain him, and hold him in talk, while the forces of Abimelech 
 were coming up, that thereby they might gain advantage. But when Gaal, 
 being content to believe those he now saw to be but the shadow of the 
 mountains (perhaps the mountains of Ebal and Gerizim, which lay close 
 by the city), was undeceived by the discovery of two other companies 
 that marched apace towards the city, then Zebul took another way to 
 banter him, upbraiding him with what he had said but a day or two 
 before, in contempt of Abimelech 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>Where is now thy mouth,</I> that foul mouth of thine, <I>wherewith 
 thou saidst, Who is Abimelech?</I> Note, Proud and haughty people are 
 often made in a little time to change their note, and to dread those 
 whom they had most despised. Gaal had, in a bravado, challenged 
 Abimelech to <I>increase his army and come out;</I> but now Zebul, in 
 Abimelech's name, challenges him: <I>Go out, and fight with them,</I> 
 if thou darest.  Justly are the insolent thus insulted over.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Abimelech routed Gaal's forces that sallied out of the town, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:39,40"><I>v.</I> 39, 40</A>.

 Gaal, disheartened no doubt by Zebul's hectoring him, and perceiving 
 his interest weaker than he thought it was, though he marched out 
 against Abimelech with what little force he had, was soon put to the 
 worst, and obliged to retire into the city with great precipitation. In 
 this action the Shechemites' loss was considerable: <I>Many were 
 overthrown and wounded,</I> the common effect of popular tumults, in 
 which the inconsiderate multitude are often drawn into fatal snare by 
 those that promise them glorious success.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Zebul that night expelled Gaal, and the party he had brought with 
 him into Shechem, out of the city 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 sending him to the place whence he came. For though the generality of 
 the city continued still averse to Abimelech, as appears by the sequel 
 of the story, yet they were willing to part with Gaal, and did not 
 oppose his expulsion, because, though he had talked big, both his skill 
 and courage had failed him when there was occasion for them. Most 
 people judge of men's fitness for business by their success, and he 
 that does not speed well is concluded not to do well. Well, Gaal's 
 interest in Shechem is soon at an end, and he that had talked of 
 removing Abimelech is himself removed, nor do we ever hear of him any 
 more. <I>Exit Gaal</I>--<I>Gaal retires.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Abimelech, the next day, set upon the city, and quite destroyed it, 
 for their treacherous dealings with him. Perhaps Abimelech had notice 
 of their expelling Gaal, who had headed the faction, with which they 
 thought he would have been satisfied, but the crime was too keep to be 
 thus atoned for, and his resentments were too keen to be pacified by so 
 small an instance of submission, besides that it was more Zebul's act 
 than theirs; by it their hands were weakened, and therefore he resolved 
 to follow his blow, and effectually to chastise their treachery. 

 (1.) He had intelligence brought him that the people of Shechem had 
 come out <I>into the field,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 Some think into the field of business to plough and sow (having lately 
 gathered in their harvest), or to perfect their harvest, for it was 
 only their vintage that they had made an end of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 and then it intimates that they were secure. And because Abimelech had 
 retired 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>)

 they thought themselves in no danger from him, and then the issue of it 
 is an instance of sudden destruction coming upon those that cry, Peace 
 and safety. Others think they went out into the field of battle; though 
 Gaal was driven out, they would not lay down their arms, but put 
 themselves into a posture for another engagement with Abimelech, in 
 which they hoped to retrieve what they had lost the day before, 

 (2.) He himself, with a strong detachment, cut off the communication 
 between them and the city, <I>stood in the entering of the gate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>),

 that they might neither make their retreat into the city nor receive 
 any succours from the city, and then sent two companies of his men, who 
 were too strong for them, and they put them all to the sword, <I>ran 
 upon those that were in the fields and slew them.</I> When we go out 
 about our business we are not sure that we shall come home again; there 
 are deaths both in the city and in the field. 

 (3.) He then fell upon the city itself, and, with a rage reaching up to 
 heaven, though it was the place of his nativity, laid it in ruins, slew 
 all the people, beat down all the buildings, and, in token of his 
 desire that it might be a perpetual desolation, sowed it with salt, 
 that it might remain a lasting monument of the punishment of 
 perfidiousness. Yet Abimelech prevailed not to make its desolations 
 perpetual; for it was afterwards rebuilt, and became so considerable a 
 place that all Israel came thither to make Rehoboam king,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:1">1 Kings xii. 1</A>.
 
 And the place proved an ill omen. Abimelech intended hereby to punish
 the Shechemites for their serving him formerly in the murder of 
 Gideon's sons. Thus, when God makes use of men as instruments in his 
 hand to do his work, he means one thing and they another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:6,7">Isa. x. 6, 7</A>.
 
 They design to maintain their honour, but God to maintain his.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Those that retired into a strong-hold of their idol-temple were all 
 destroyed there. These are called <I>the men of the tower of 
 Shechem</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:46,47"><I>v.</I> 46, 47</A>),

 some castle that belonged to the city, but lay at some distance from 
 it. They, hearing of the destruction of the city, withdrew into a hold 
 of the temple, trusting, it is likely, not so much to its strength as 
 to its sanctity; they put themselves under the protection of their 
 idol: for thus <I>all people will walk in the name of their god,</I> 
 and shall not we then choose to dwell in the house of the Lord all the 
 days of our life? For <I>in the time of trouble he shall hide us in his 
 pavilion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:5">Ps. xxvii. 5</A>.
 
 The <I>name of the Lord is a strong tower,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:10">Prov. xviii. 10</A>.

 But that which they hoped would be for their welfare proved to them a 
 snare and a trap, as those will certainly find that run to idols for 
 shelter; it will prove a refuge of lies. When Abimelech had them 
 altogether penned up in that hold he desired no more. That barbarous 
 project immediately came into his head of setting fire to the 
 strong-hold, and, so to speak, burning all the birds together in the 
 nest. He kept the design to himself, but set all his men on work to 
 expedite the execution of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:48,49"><I>v.</I> 48, 49</A>.

 He ordered them all to follow him, and do as he did: as his father had 
 said to his men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:17"><I>ch.</I> vii. 17</A>),

 <I>Look on me, and do likewise;</I> so saith he to his, as becomes a
 general that will not be wanting to give both the plainest direction 
 and the highest encouragement that can be to his soldiers: <I>What you 
 have seen me do make haste to do, as I have done.</I> Not <I>Ite 
 illuc--Go thither;</I> but <I>Venite huc--Come hither.</I> The officers 
 in Christ's army should thus teach by their example, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:9">Phil. iv. 9</A>.

 He and they fetched each of them a bough from a wood not far off, laid
 all their boughs together under the wall of this tower, which it is 
 probable was of wood, set fire to their boughs, and so burnt down their 
 hold and all that were in it, who were either burnt or stifled with the 
 smoke. What inventions men have to destroy one another! Whence come 
 these cruel wars and fightings but from their lusts? Some think that 
 the men of the tower of Shechem were the same with the house of Millo, 
 and then Jotham's just imprecation was answered in the letter: <I>Let 
 fire come out from</I> Abimelech, and devour not only in general the 
 men of Shechem, but in particular the house of Millo,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 About 1000 men and women perished in these flames, many of whom, it is 
 probable, were no way concerned in the quarrel between Abimelech and 
 the Shechemites, nor meddled with either side, yet, in this civil war, 
 they came to this miserable end; for men of factious turbulent spirits 
 <I>perish not alone in their iniquity,</I> but involve many more, that 
 follow them in their simplicity, in the same calamity with them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>50 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez,
 and took it.
 &nbsp; 51 But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither
 fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut
 <I>it</I> to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.
 &nbsp; 52 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it,
 and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
 &nbsp; 53 And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon
 Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.
 &nbsp; 54 Then he called hastily unto the young man his armour bearer,
 and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not
 of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through,
 and he died.
 &nbsp; 55 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they
 departed every man unto his place.
 &nbsp; 56 Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did
 unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:
 &nbsp; 57 And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon
 their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of
 Jerubbaal.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have seen the ruin of the Shechemites completed by the hand of 
 Abimelech; and now it comes to his turn to be reckoned with who was 
 their leader in villany. Thebez was a small city, probably not far from 
 Shechem, dependent upon it, and in confederacy with it. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Abimelech attempted the destruction of this city 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>),

 drove all the inhabitants of the town into the castle, or citadel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:51"><I>v.</I>  51</A>.

 When he had them there he did not doubt but he should do the same 
 execution here that he had lately done at the strong-hold of the temple 
 of Baal-berith, not considering that the tower of an idol-temple lay 
 more exposed to divine vengeance than any other tower. He attempted to 
 set fire to this tower, at least to burn down the door, and so force an 
 entrance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>.

 Those who have escaped and succeeded well in one desperate attempt are 
 apt to think the like attempt another time not desperate. This instance 
 was long after quoted to show how dangerous it is to come near the call 
 of a besieged city,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:20,21">2 Sam. xi. 20</A>,

 &c. But God infatuates those whom he will ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In the attempt he was himself destroyed, having his brains knocked 
 out with a piece of a millstone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>.

 <I>No doubt this man was a murderer, whom, though he had escaped</I> 
 the dangers of the war with Shechem, yet <I>vengeance suffered not to 
 live,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:4">Acts xxviii. 4</A>.

 <I>Evil pursues sinners,</I> and sometimes overtakes them when they are
 not only secure, but triumphant. Thebez, we may suppose, was a weak 
 inconsiderable place, compared with Shechem.  Abimelech, having 
 conquered the greater, makes no doubt of being master of the less 
 without any difficulty, especially when he had taken the city, and had 
 only the tower to deal with; yet he lays his bones by that, and there 
 is all his honour buried. Thus are the <I>mighty things of the 
 world</I> often confounded by the weakest and those things that are 
 most made light of. See here what rebukes those are justly put under 
 many times by the divine providence that are unreasonable in their 
 demands of satisfaction for injuries received. Abimelech had some 
 reason to chastise the Shechemites, and he had done it with a witness; 
 but when he will carry his revenges further, and nothing will serve but 
 that Thebez also must be sacrificed to his rage, he is not only 
 disappointed there, but destroyed; <I>for verily there is a God that 
 judges in the earth.</I> Three circumstances are worthy of observation 
 in the death of Abimelech:--

 1. That he was slain with a stone, as he had slain his brethren all
 <I>upon one stone.</I> 

 2. That he had his skull broken. Vengeance aimed at that guilty head
 which had worn the usurped crown. 3. That the stone was cast upon him 
 by a woman,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>.

 He saw the stone come; it was therefore strange he did not avoid it, 
 but, no doubt, this made it so much the greater mortification to him to 
 see from what hand it came. Sisera died by a woman's hand and knew it 
 not; but Abimelech not only fell by the hand of a woman but knew it, 
 and, when he found himself ready to breathe his last, nothing troubled 
 him so much as this, that it should be said, A woman slew him. See,

 (1.) His foolish pride, in laying so much to heart this little 
 circumstance of his disgrace. Here was no care taken about his precious 
 soul, no concern what would become of that, no prayer to God for his 
 mercy; but very solicitous he is to patch up his shattered credit, when 
 there is no patching his shattered skull. "O let it never be said that 
 such a mighty man as Abimelech was killed by a woman!" The man was 
 dying, but his pride was alive and strong, and the same vain-glorious 
 humour that had governed him all along appears now at last. <I>Qualis 
 vita, finis ita--As was his life, such was his death.</I> As God 
 punished his cruelty by the manner of his death, so he punished his 
 pride by the instrument of it. 

 (2.) His foolish project to avoid this disgrace; nothing could be more 
 ridiculous; his own servant must run him through, not to rid him the 
 sooner out of his pain, but <I>that men say not, A woman slew him.</I> 
 Could he think that this would conceal what the woman had done, and not 
 rather proclaim it the more? Nay, it added to the infamy of his death, 
 for hereby he became a self-murderer.  Better have it said, <I>A woman 
 slew him,</I> than that it should be said, His servant slew him by his 
 own order; yet now both will be said of him to his everlasting 
 reproach. And it is observable that this very thing which Abimelech was 
 in such care to conceal appears to have been more particularly 
 remembered by posterity than most passages of his history; for Joab 
 speaks of it as that which he expected David would reproach him with, 
 for coming so <I>nigh the wall,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:21">2 Sam. xi. 21</A>.

 The ignominy we seek to avoid by sin we do but perpetuate the
 remembrance of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The issue of all is that Abimelech being slain, 

 1. Israel's peace was restored, and an end was put to this civil war; 
 for those that followed him <I>departed every man to his place,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>.

 2. God's justice was glorified

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:56,57"><I>v.</I> 56, 57</A>):

 <I>Thus God</I> punished <I>the wickedness of Abimelech, and of the men 
 of Shechem,</I> and fulfilled Jotham's curse, for it was not a <I>curse 
 causeless.</I> Thus he preserved the honour of his government, and gave 
 warning to all ages to expect blood for blood.  <I>The Lord is known by 
 the judgments which he executes,</I> when <I>the wicked is snared in 
 the work of his own hands.</I> Though wickedness may prosper awhile, it 
 will not prosper always.</P>
