 The glory of the kingdom of Israel was in its height and perfection in 
 Solomon; it was long in coming to it, but it soon declined, and began 
 to sink and wither in the very next reign, as we find in this chapter, 
 where we have the kingdom divided, and thereby weakened and made little 
 in comparison with what it had been. Here is, 

 I. Rehoboam's accession to the throne and Jeroboam's return out of
 Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The people's petition to Rehoboam for the redress of grievances,
 and the rough answer he gave, by the advice of his young counsellors, 
 to that petition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:3-15">ver. 3-15</A>.

 III. The revolt of the ten tribes thereupon, and their setting up
 Jeroboam, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:16-20">ver. 16-20</A>.

 IV. Rehoboam's attempt to reduce them and the prohibition God gave to
 that attempt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:21-24">ver. 21-24</A>.

 V.  Jeroboam's establishment of his government upon idolatry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:25-33">ver. 25-33</A>.

 Thus did Judah become weak, being deserted by their brethren, and
 Israel, by deserting the house of the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to
 Shechem to make him king.
 &nbsp; 2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was
 yet in Egypt, heard <I>of it,</I> (for he was fled from the presence
 of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)
 &nbsp; 3 That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the
 congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,
 &nbsp; 4 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou
 the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he
 put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
 &nbsp; 5 And he said unto them, Depart yet <I>for</I> three days, then come
 again to me. And the people departed.
 &nbsp; 6 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood
 before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye
 advise that I may answer this people?
 &nbsp; 7 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant
 unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them,
 and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for
 ever.
 &nbsp; 8 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had
 given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up
 with him, <I>and</I> which stood before him:
 &nbsp; 9 And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may
 answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke
 which thy father did put upon us lighter?
 &nbsp; 10 And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto
 him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake
 unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou
 <I>it</I> lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little
 <I>finger</I> shall be thicker than my father's loins.
 &nbsp; 11 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I
 will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips,
 but I will chastise you with scorpions.
 &nbsp; 12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third
 day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the
 third day.
 &nbsp; 13 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the
 old men's counsel that they gave him;
 &nbsp; 14 And spake to them after the counsel of the young men,
 saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your
 yoke: my father <I>also</I> chastised you with whips, but I will
 chastise you with scorpions.
 &nbsp; 15 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the
 cause was from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that he might perform his saying, which
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of
 Nebat.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon had 1000 wives and concubines, yet we read but of one son he 
 had to bear up his name, and he a fool. It is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:10">Hos. iv. 10</A>),

 <I>They shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase.</I> Sin is a bad
 way of building up a family. Rehoboam was the son of the wisest of men, 
 yet did not inherit his father's wisdom, and then it stood him in 
 little stead to inherit his father's throne. Neither wisdom nor grace 
 runs in the blood. Solomon came to the crown very young, yet he was 
 then a wise man. Rehoboam came to the crown at forty years old, when 
 men will be wise if ever they will, yet he was then foolish. Wisdom 
 does not go by age, nor is it the multitude of years nor the advantage 
 of education that reaches it. Solomon's court was a mart of wisdom and 
 the rendezvous of learned men, and Rehoboam was the darling of the 
 court; and yet all was not sufficient to make him a wise man. <I>The 
 race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.</I> No dispute 
 is made of Rehoboam's succession; upon the death of his father, he was 
 immediately proclaimed. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The people desired a treaty with him at Shechem, and he condescended 
 to meet them there. 

 1. Their pretence was to make him king, but the design was to unmake
 him. They would give him a public inauguration in another place than 
 the city of David, that he might not seem to be king of Judah only. 
 They had ten parts in him, and would have him among themselves for 
 once, that they might recognize his title. 

 2. The place was ominous: at <I>Shechem,</I> where Abimelech set up
 himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:1-57">Judg. ix.</A>);

 yet it had been famous for the convention of the states there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:1">Josh. xxiv. 1</A>.

 Rehoboam, we may suppose, knew of the threatening, that the kingdom
 should be rent from him, and hoped by going to Shechem, and treating 
 there with the ten tribes, to prevent it: yet it proved the most 
 impolitic thing he could do, and hastened the rupture.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The representatives of the tribes addressed him, praying to be 
 eased of the taxes they were burdened with. The meeting being 
 appointed, they sent for Jeroboam out of Egypt to come and be their 
 speaker. This they needed not to have done: he knew what God had 
 designed him for, and would have come though he had not been sent for, 
 for now was his time to expect the possession of the promised crown. In 
 their address, 

 1. They complain of the last reign: <I>Thy father made our yoke
 grievous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They complain not of his father's idolatry and revolt from God; that
 which was the greatest grievance of all was none to them, so careless 
 and indifferent were they in the matters of religion, as if God or 
 Moloch were all one, so they might but live at ease and pay no taxes. 
 Yet the complaint was groundless and unjust.  Never did people live 
 more at ease than they did, nor in great plenty.  Did they pay taxes? 
 It was to advance the strength and magnificence of their kingdom. If 
 Solomon's buildings cost them money, they cost them no blood, as war 
 would do. Were many servile hands employed about them?  They were not 
 the hands of the Israelites. Were the taxes a burden? How could that 
 be, when Solomon imported bullion in such plenty that silver was, in a 
 manner, as common as the stones? So that they did but render to Solomon 
 the things that were Solomon's.  Nay, suppose there was some hardship 
 put upon them, were they not told before that this would be the manner 
 of the king and yet they would have one? The best government cannot 
 secure itself from reproach and censure, no, not Solomon's.  Factious 
 spirits will never want something to complain of. I know nothing in 
 Solomon's administration that could make the people's yoke grievous, 
 unless perhaps the women whom in his latter days he doted on were 
 connived at in oppressing them.

 2. They demand relief from him, and on this condition will continue in
 their allegiance to the house of David. They asked not to be wholly 
 free from paying taxes, but to have the burden made lighter; this was 
 all their care, to save their money, whether their religion was 
 supported and the government protected or no. All seek their own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Rehoboam consulted with those about him concerning the answer he 
 should give to this address. It was prudent to take advice, especially 
 having so weak a head of his own; yet, upon this occasion, it was 
 impolitic to take time himself to consider, for thereby he gave time to 
 the disaffected people to ripen things for a revolt, and his 
 deliberating in so plain a case would be improved as an indication of 
 the little concern he had for the people's ease. They saw what they 
 must expect, and prepared accordingly. Now, 

 1. The grave experienced men of his council advised him by all means to
 give the petitioners a kind answer, to give them good words, to promise 
 them fair, and this day, this critical day, to serve them, that is, to 
 tell them that he was their servant, and that he would redress all 
 their grievances and make it his business to please them and make them 
 easy. "Deny thyself (say they) so far as to do this for this once, and 
 they will be <I>thy servants for ever.</I> When the present heat is 
 allayed with a soft answer, and the assembly dismissed, their cooler 
 thoughts will reconcile and fix them to Solomon's family still." Note, 
 The way to rule is to serve, to do good, and stoop to do it, to become 
 all things to all men and so win their hearts. Those who are in power 
 really sit highest, and easiest, and safest, when they take this 
 method. 

 2. The young men of his council were hot and haughty, and they advised
 him to return a severe and threatening answer to the people's demands. 
 It was an instance of Rehoboam's weakness,

 (1.) That he did not prefer aged counsellors, but had a better opinion 
 of the young men that had grown up with him and with whom he was 
 familiar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Days should speak. It was a folly for him to think that, because they
 had been his agreeable companions in the sports and pleasures of his 
 youth, they were therefore fit to have the management of the affairs of 
 his kingdom.  Great wits have not always the most wisdom; nor are those 
 to be relied on as our best friends that know how to make us merry, for 
 that will not make us happy. It is of great consequence to young 
 people, that are setting out in the world, whom they associate with, 
 accommodate themselves to, and depend upon for advice. If they reckon 
 those that feed their pride, gratify their vanity, and further them in 
 their pleasures, their best friends, they are already marked for ruin.

 (2.) That he did not prefer moderate counsels, but was pleased with 
 those that put him upon harsh and rigorous methods, and advised him to 
 double the taxes, whether there was occasion for so doing or no, and to 
 tell them in plain terms that he would do so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 These young counsellors thought the old men expressed themselves but
 dully, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They affect to be witty in their advice, and value themselves on that.
 The old men did not undertake to put words into Rehoboam's mouth, only 
 counselled him to speak good words; but the young men will furnish him 
 with very quaint and pretty phrases, with pointed and pert similitudes: 
 <I>My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins,</I> &c.  
 That is not always the best sense that is best worded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He answered the people according to the counsel of the young men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 He affected to be haughty and imperious, and fancied he could carry all
 before him with a high hand, and therefore would rather run the risk of 
 losing them than deny himself so far as to give them good words. Note, 
 Many ruin themselves by consulting their humour more than their 
 interest. See,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How Rehoboam was infatuated in his counsels. He could not have acted 
 more foolishly and impoliticly. 

 (1.) He owned their reflections upon his father's government to be 
 true: <I>My father made your yoke heavy;</I> and therein he was unjust 
 to his father's memory, which he might easily have vindicated from the 
 imputation. 

 (2.) He fancied himself better able to manage them, and impose upon 
 them, than his father was, not considering that he was vastly inferior 
 to him in capacity. Could he think to support the blemishes of his 
 father's reign who could never pretend to come near the glories of it? 
 
 (3.) He threatened not only to squeeze them by taxes, but to chastise 
 them by cruel laws and severe executions of them, which should be not 
 as whips only, but as scorpions, whips with rowels in them, that will 
 fetch blood at every lash. In short, he would use them as brute beasts, 
 load them and beat them at his pleasure: not caring whether they loved 
 him or no, he would make them fear him. 

 (4.) He gave this provocation to a people that by long ease and 
 prosperity were made wealthy, and strong, and proud, and would not be 
 trampled upon (as a poor cowed dispirited people may), to a people that 
 were now disposed to revolt, and had one ready to head them. Never, 
 surely, was man so blinded by pride and affectation of arbitrary power, 
 than which nothing is more fatal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How God's counsels were hereby fulfilled. It was <I>from the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 He left Rehoboam to his own folly, and <I>hid from his eyes</I> the
 <I>things which belonged to his peace,</I> that the kingdom might be 
 rent from him. Note, God serves his own wise and righteous purposes by 
 the imprudences and iniquities of men, and snares sinners in the work 
 of their own hands. Those that lose the kingdom of heaven throw it 
 away, as Rehoboam did his, by their own wilfulness and folly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto
 them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we
 in David? neither <I>have we</I> inheritance in the son of Jesse: to
 your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So
 Israel departed unto their tents.
 &nbsp; 17 But <I>as for</I> the children of Israel which dwelt in the
 cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
 &nbsp; 18 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who <I>was</I> over the tribute;
 and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore
 king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to
 Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 19 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
 &nbsp; 20 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was
 come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation,
 and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed
 the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
 &nbsp; 21 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all
 the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and
 fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight
 against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to
 Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
 &nbsp; 22 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 23 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and
 unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of
 the people, saying,
 &nbsp; 24 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against
 your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his
 house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the
 word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and returned to depart, according to the word
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the rending of the kingdom of the ten tribes from the 
 house of David, to effect which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The people were hold and resolute in their revolt. They highly 
 resented the provocation that Rehoboam had given them, were incensed at 
 his menaces, concluded that that government would in the progress of it 
 be intolerably grievous which in the beginning of it was so very 
 haughty, and therefore immediately came to this resolve, one and all: 
 <I>What portion have we in David?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 They speak here very unbecomingly of David, that great benefactor of
 their nation, calling him <I>the son of Jesse,</I> no greater a man 
 than his neighbours. How soon are good men, and their good services to 
 the public, forgotten!  The rashness of their resolution was also much 
 to be blamed. In time, and with prudent management, they might have 
 settled the original contract with Rehoboam to mutual satisfaction. Had 
 they enquired who gave Rehoboam this advice, and taken a course to 
 remove those evil counsellors from about him, the rupture might have 
 been prevented: otherwise their jealousy for their liberty and property 
 well became that free people. <I>Israel is not a servant, is not a 
 homeborn slave; why should he be spoiled?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:14">Jer. ii. 14</A>.

 They are willing to be ruled, but not to be ridden. Protection draws
 allegiance, but destruction cannot. No marvel that <I>Israel falls away 
 from the house of David</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 if the house of David fall away from the great ends of their 
 advancement, which was to be <I>ministers of God to them for good.</I> 
 But thus to rebel against the seed of David, whom God had advanced to 
 the kingdom (entailing it on his seed), and to set up another king in 
 opposition to that family, was a great sin; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:5-8">2 Chron. xiii. 5-8</A>.

 To this God refers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:4">Hos. viii. 4</A>.

 <I>They have set up kings, but not by me.</I> And it is here mentioned
 to the praise of the tribe of Judah that they <I>followed the house of 
 David</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:17,20"><I>v.</I> 17, 20</A>),

 and, for aught that appears, they found Rehoboam better than his word, 
 nor did he rule with the rigour which at first he threatened.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Rehoboam was imprudent in the further management of this affair, 
 and more and more infatuated. Having foolishly thrown himself into a 
 quick-sand, he sunk the further in with plunging to get out. 

 1. He was very unadvised in sending Adoram, who was <I>over the
 tribute,</I> to treat with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 The tribute was the thing, and, for the sake of that, Adoram was the
 person, they most complained of.  The very sight of him, whose name was 
 odious among them, exasperated them, and made them outrageous. He was 
 one to whom they could not so much as give a patient hearing, but 
 <I>stoned him to death</I> in a popular tumult.  Rehoboam was now as 
 unhappy in the choice of his ambassador as before of his counsellors.

 2. Some think he was also unadvised in quitting his ground, and making
 so much haste to Jerusalem, for thereby he deserted his friends and 
 gave advantage to his enemies, who had gone to their tents indeed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 in disgust, but did not offer to make Jeroboam king till Rehoboam had 
 gone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 See how soon this foolish prince went from one extreme to the other. He
 hectored and talked big when he thought all was his own, but sneaked 
 and looked very mean when he saw himself in danger. It is common for 
 those that are most haughty in their prosperity to be most abject in 
 adversity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God forbade his attempt to recover by the sword what he had lost. 
 What was done was of God, who would not suffer that it should be undone 
 again (as it would be if Rehoboam got the better and reduced the ten 
 tribes), nor that more should be done to the prejudice of the house of 
 David, as would be if Jeroboam got the better and conquered the two 
 tribes. The thing must rest as it is, and therefore God forbids the 
 battle. 

 1. It was brave in Rehoboam to design the reducing of the revolters by
 force. His courage came to him when he had come to Jerusalem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 There he thought himself among his firm friends, who generously adhered
 to him and appeared for him. Judah and Benjamin (who feared the Lord 
 and the king, and meddled not with those that were given to change) 
 presently raised an army of 180,000 men, for the recovery of their 
 king's right to the ten tribes, and were resolved to stand by him (as 
 we say) with their lives and fortunes, having either not such cause, or 
 rather not such a disposition, to complain, as the rest had. 

 2. It as more brave in Rehoboam to desist when God, by a prophet,
 ordered him to lay down his arms. He would not lose a kingdom tamely, 
 for then he would have been unworthy the title of a prince; and yet he 
 would not contend for it in opposition to God, for then he would have 
 been unworthy the title of an Israelite. To proceed in this war would 
 be not only to <I>fight against their brethren</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 whom they ought to love, but to fight against their God, to whom they 
 ought to submit: <I>This thing is from me.</I> These two considerations 
 should reconcile us to our losses and troubles, that God is the author 
 of them and our brethren are the instruments of them; let us not 
 therefore meditate revenge. Rehoboam and his people <I>hearkened to the 
 word of the Lord,</I> disbanded the army, and acquiesced. Though, in 
 human probability, they had a fair prospect of success (for their army 
 was numerous and resolute, Jeroboam's party weak and unsettled), though 
 it would turn to their reproach among their neighbours to lose so much 
 of their strength and never have one push for it, to make a flourish 
 and do nothing, yet,

 (1.) They regarded the command of God though sent by a poor prophet. 
 When we know God's mind we must submit to it, how much soever it 
 crosses our own mind. 

 (2.) They consulted their own interest, concluding that though they had
 all the advantages, even that of right, on their side, yet they could 
 not prosper if they fought in disobedience to God; and it was better to 
 sit still than to rise up and fall. In the next reign God allowed them

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt
 therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.
 &nbsp; 26 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return
 to the house of David:
 &nbsp; 27 If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again
 unto their lord, <I>even</I> unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they
 shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.
 &nbsp; 28 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves <I>of</I>
 gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to
 Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out
 of the land of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 29 And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan.
 &nbsp; 30 And this thing became a sin: for the people went <I>to
 worship</I> before the one, <I>even</I> unto Dan.
 &nbsp; 31 And he made a house of high places, and made priests of the
 lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.
 &nbsp; 32 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the
 fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that <I>is</I> in
 Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth-el,
 sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in
 Beth-el the priests of the high places which he had made.
 &nbsp; 33 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-el the
 fifteenth day of the eighth month, <I>even</I> in the month which he
 had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the
 children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt
 incense.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the beginning of the reign of Jeroboam. He built Shechem 
 first and then Penuel--beautified and fortified them, and probably had a
 palace in each of them for himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 the former in Ephraim, the latter in Gad, on the other side Jordan. 
 This might be proper; but he formed another project for the 
 establishing of his kingdom which was fatal to the interests of 
 religion in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That which he designed was by some effectual means to secure those 
 to himself who had now chosen him for their king, and to prevent their 
 return to the house of David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.
 
 It seems,

 1. He was jealous of the people, afraid that, some time or other, they
 would kill him and go again to Rehoboam. Many that have been advanced 
 in one tumult have been hurled down in another. Jeroboam could not put 
 any confidence in the affections of his people, though now they seemed 
 extremely fond of him; for what is got by wrong and usurpation cannot 
 be enjoyed nor kept with any security or satisfaction. 

 2. He was distrustful of the promise of God, could not take his word
 that, if he would keep close to his duty, <I>God would build him a sure 
 house</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:38"><I>ch.</I> xi. 38</A>);

 but he would contrive ways and means, and sinful ones too, for his own
 safety. A practical disbelief of God's all-sufficiency is at the bottom 
 of all our treacherous departures from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The way he took to do this was by keeping the people from going up 
 to Jerusalem to worship. That was the place God had chosen, to put his 
 name there. Solomon's temple was there, which God had, in the sight of 
 all Israel, and in the memory of many now living, taken solemn 
 possession of in a cloud of glory. At the altar there the priest of the 
 Lord attended, there all Israel were to keep the feasts, and thither 
 they were to bring their sacrifices. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Jeroboam apprehended that, if the people continued to do this, they 
 would in time return to the house of David, allured by the magnificence 
 both of the court and of the temple. If they cleave to their old 
 religion, they will go back to their old king. We may suppose, if he 
 had treated with Rehoboam for the safe conduct of himself and his 
 people to and from Jerusalem at the times appointed for their solemn 
 feasts, it would not have been denied him; therefore he fears not their 
 being driven back by force, but their going back voluntarily to 
 Rehoboam.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He therefore dissuaded them from going up to Jerusalem, pretending 
 to consult their ease: "<I>It is too much for you</I> to go so far to 
 worship God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 It is a heavy yoke, and it is time to shake it off; <I>you have gone
 long enough to Jerusalem</I>" (so some read it); "the temple, now that 
 you are used to it, does not appear so glorious and sacred as it did at 
 first" (sensible glories wither by degrees in men's estimation); "you 
 have greed yourselves from other burdens, free yourselves from this: 
 why should we now be tied to one place any more than in Samuel's 
 time?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He provided for the assistance of their devotion at home. Upon 
 consultation with some of his politicians, he came to this resolve, to 
 set up two golden calves, as tokens or signs of the divine presence, 
 and persuade the people that they might as well stay at home and offer 
 sacrifice to those as go to Jerusalem to worship before the ark: and 
 some are so charitable as to think they were made to represent the 
 mercy-seat and the cherubim over the ark; but more probably he adopted 
 the idolatry of the Egyptians, in whose land he had sojourned for some 
 time and who worshipped their god Apis under the similitude of a bull 
 or calf. 

 (1.) He would not be at the charge of building a golden temple, as 
 Solomon had done; two golden calves are the most that he can afford. 
 
 (2.) He intended, no doubt, by these to represent, or rather make 
 present, not any false god, as Moloch or Chemosh, but the true God 
 only, the God of Israel, the God that brought them up out of the land 
 of Egypt, as he declares, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 So that it was no violation of the first commandment, but the second.
 And he chose thus to engage the people's devotion because he knew there 
 were many among them so in love with images that for the sake of the 
 calves they would willingly quit God's temple, where all images were 
 forbidden.

 (3.) He set up two, by degrees to break people off from the belief of 
 the unity of the godhead, which would pave the way to the polytheism of 
 the Pagans. He set up these two at Dan and Beth-el (one the utmost 
 border of his country northward), the other southward, as if they were 
 the guardians and protectors of the kingdom. Beth-el lay close to 
 Judah. He set up one there, to tempt those of Rehoboam's subjects over 
 to him who were inclined to image-worship, in lieu of those of his 
 subjects that would continue to go to Jerusalem. He set up the other at 
 Dan, for the convenience of those that lay most remote, and because 
 Micah's images had been set up there, and great veneration paid to them 
 for many ages,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:30,31">Judg. xviii. 30, 31</A>.

 <I>Beth-el</I> signifies <I>the house of God,</I> which gave some
 colour to the superstition; but the prophet called it <I>Beth-aven, the 
 house of vanity,</I> or iniquity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The people complied with him herein, and were fond enough of the 
 novelty: They <I>went to worship before the one, even unto Dan</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 to that at Dan first because it was first set up, or <I>even</I> to 
 that at Dan, though it lay such a great way off. Those that thought it 
 much to go to Jerusalem, to worship God according to his institution, 
 made no difficulty of going twice as far, to Dan, to worship him 
 according to their own inventions. Or they are said to go to one of the 
 calves at Dan because Abijah, king of Judah, within twenty years, 
 recovered Beth-el

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:19">2 Chron. xiii. 19</A>),

 and it is likely removed the golden calf, or forbade the use of it, and
 then they had only that at Dan to go to. <I>This became a sin;</I> and 
 a great sin it was, against the express letter of the second 
 commandment. God had sometimes dispensed with the law concerning 
 worshipping in one place, but never allowed the worship of him by 
 images. Hereby they justified their fathers in making the calf at 
 Horeb, though God had so fully shown his displeasure against them for 
 it and threatened to visit for it in the day of visitation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:34">Exod. xxxii. 34</A>),

 so that it was as great a contempt of God's wrath as it was of his law; 
 and thus they added sin to sin. Bishop Patrick quotes a saying of the 
 Jews, That till Jeroboam's time the Israelites sucked but one calf, but 
 from that time they sucked two.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Having set up the gods, he fitted up accommodations for them; and 
 wherein he varied from the divine appointment we are here told, which 
 intimates that in other things he imitated what was done in Judah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>)
 
 as well as he could. See how one error multiplied into many.

 (1.) He made a house of high-places, or of altars, one temple at Dan, 
 we may suppose, and another at Beth-el 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 and in each many altars, probably complaining of it as an inconvenience 
 that in the temple at Jerusalem there was but one. The multiplying of 
 altars passed with some for a piece of devotion, but God, by the 
 prophet, puts another construction upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:11">Hos. viii. 11</A>.

 <I>Ephraim has made many altars to sin.</I>

 (2.) He made priests of the lowest of the people; and the lowest of the 
 people were good enough to be priests to his calves, and too good. He 
 made priests <I>from the extremest parts of the people,</I> that is, 
 some out of every corner of the country, whom he ordered to reside 
 among their neighbours, to instruct them in his appointments and 
 reconcile them to them. Thus were they dispersed as the Levites, but 
 <I>were not of the sons of Levi.</I> But the priests of the high-laces, 
 or altars, he ordered to reside in Beth-el, as the priests at Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),
 
 to attend the public service.

 (3.) The feast of tabernacles, which God had appointed on the fifteenth 
 day of the seventh month, he adjourned to the fifteenth day of the 
 eighth month 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 <I>the month which he devised of his own heart,</I> to show his power 
 in ecclesiastical matters, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 The passover and pentecost he observed in their proper season, or did
 not observe them at all, or with little solemnity in comparison with 
 this.

 (4.) He himself assuming a power to make priests, no marvel if he 
 undertook to do the priests' work with his own hands: <I>He offered 
 upon the altar.</I> This is twice mentioned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>),

 as also that he burnt incense. This was connived at in him because it 
 was of a piece with the rest of his irregularities; but in king Uzziah 
 it was immediately punished with the plague of leprosy. He did it 
 himself, to make himself look great among the people and to get the 
 reputation of a devout man, also to grace the solemnity of his new 
 festival, with which, it is likely, at this time he joined the feast of 
 the dedication of his altar. And thus,

 [1.] Jeroboam sinned himself, yet perhaps excused himself to the world 
 and his own conscience with this, that he did not do so ill as Solomon 
 did, who worshipped other gods.

 [2.] He <I>made Israel to sin,</I> drew them off from the worship of 
 God and entailed idolatry upon their seed. And hereby they were 
 punished for deserting the thrones <I>of the house of David.</I> The 
 learned Mr.  Whiston, in his chronology, for the adjusting of the 
 annals of the two kingdoms of Judah and Israel, supposes that Jeroboam 
 changed the calculation of the year and made it to contain but eleven 
 months, and that by those years the reigns of the kings of Israel are 
 measured till Jehu's revolution and no longer, so that during this 
 interval eleven years of the annals of Judah answer to twelve in those 
 of Israel.</P>
