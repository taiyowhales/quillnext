 Six years bloody Athaliah had tyrannised; in this chapter we have her 
 deposed and slain, and Joash, the rightful heir, enthroned. We had the 
 story before nearly as it is here related, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:4-21">2 Kings xi. 4</A>,

 &c.

 I. Jehoiada prepared the people for the king, acquainted them with his
 design, armed them, and appointed them their posts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>.

 II. He produced the king to the people, crowned him, and anointed him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:11">ver. 11</A>.

 III. He slew the usurper, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 IV. He reformed the kingdom, re-established religion, and restored the
 civil government,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and
 took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and
 Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and
 Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri,
 into covenant with him.
 &nbsp; 2  And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of
 all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel,
 and they came to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 3  And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the
 house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall
 reign, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath said of the sons of David.
 &nbsp; 4  This <I>is</I> the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you
 entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites,
 <I>shall be</I> porters of the doors;
 &nbsp; 5  And a third part <I>shall be</I> at the king's house; and a third
 part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people <I>shall be</I>
 in the courts of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6  But let none come into the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, save the
 priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in,
 for they <I>are</I> holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 7  And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man
 with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever <I>else</I> cometh into
 the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when
 he cometh in, and when he goeth out.
 &nbsp; 8  So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
 Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men
 that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go
 <I>out</I> on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the
 courses.
 &nbsp; 9  Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of
 hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that <I>had been</I> king
 David's, which <I>were</I> in the house of God.
 &nbsp; 10  And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in
 his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of
 the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round
 about.
 &nbsp; 11  Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the
 crown, and <I>gave him</I> the testimony, and made him king. And
 Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.

 We may well imagine the bad posture of affairs in Jerusalem during 
 Athaliah's six years' usurpation, and may wonder that God permitted it 
 and his people bore it so long; but after such a dark and tedious night 
 the returning day in this revolution was the brighter and the more 
 welcome. The continuance of David's seed and throne was what God had 
 sworn by his holiness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:35">Ps. lxxxix. 35</A>),

 and an interruption was no defeasance; the stream of government here
 runs again in the right channel. The instrument and chief manager of 
 the restoration is Jehoiada, who appears to have been, 

 1. A man of great prudence, who reserved the young prince for so many
 years till he was fit to appear in public, and till the nation had
 grown weary of the usurper, who prepared his work beforehand, and then
 effected it with admirable secresy and expedition. When God has work to
 do he will qualify and animate men for it. 

 2. A man of great interest.  The captains joined with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The Levites and the chief of the fathers of Israel came at his call to
 Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 and were there ready to receive his orders. See what a command wisdom
 and virtue will give men. <I>The Levites and all Judah did as Jehoiada 
 commanded</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and, which is strange, all that were entrusted with the secret kept
 their own counsel till it was executed. Thus <I>the words of the wise 
 are heard in quiet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:17">Eccl. ix. 17</A>.

 3. A man of great faith. It was not only common equity (much less his
 wife's relation to the royal family) that put him upon this 
 undertaking, but a regard to the word of God, and the divine entail of 
 the crown

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>The king's son shall reign,</I> must reign, <I>as the Lord hath
 said.</I> His eye to the promise, and dependence upon that, added a 
 great deal of glory to this undertaking.  

 4. A man of great religion.  This matter was to be done in the temple,
 which might occasion some breach of rule, and the necessity of the case 
 might be thought to excuse it; but he gave special order that none of 
 the people should come into the house of the Lord, but the priests and 
 Levites only, who were holy, upon pain of death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 Never let sacred things be profaned, no, not for the support of civil
 rights.

 5.  A man of great resolution. When he had undertaken this business he
 went through with it, <I>brought out the king, crowned him, and gave 
 him the testimony,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He ventured his head, but it was in a good cause, and therefore he went
 on boldly. It is here said that his sons joined with him in anointing 
 the young king. One of them, it is likely, was that Zechariah whom 
 Joash afterwards put to death for reproving him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:20"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 20</A>),

 which was so much the more ungrateful because he bore a willing part in
 anointing him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
 praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 13  And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at
 the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king:
 and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with
 trumpets, also the singers with instruments of music, and such
 as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and
 said, Treason, Treason.
 &nbsp; 14  Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of
 hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have
 her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be
 slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the
 house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15  So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the
 entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her
 there.
 &nbsp; 16  And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all
 the people, and between the king, that they should be the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s
 people.
 &nbsp; 17  Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it
 down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew
 Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
 &nbsp; 18  Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had
 distributed in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to offer the burnt
 offerings of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, as <I>it is</I> written in the law of Moses,
 with rejoicing and with singing, <I>as it was ordained</I> by David.
 &nbsp; 19  And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that none <I>which was</I> unclean in any thing should enter in.
 &nbsp; 20  And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and
 the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and
 brought down the king from the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and they came
 through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king
 upon the throne of the kingdom.
 &nbsp; 21  And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was
 quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 
 
 I. The people pleased,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 When the king stood at his pillar, whose right it was to stand there,
 <I>all the people of the land rejoiced to see a rod sprung out of the 
 stem of Jesse,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:1">Isa. xi. 1</A>.

 When it seemed a withered root in a dry ground, to see what they
 despaired of ever seeing--a king of the house of David, what a pleasing 
 surprise was it to them! They ran in transports of joy to see this 
 sight, praised the king, and praised God, for they had with them such 
 as <I>taught to sing praise.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Athaliah slain. She ran upon the point of the sword of justice; 
 for, imagining her interest much better than it was, she ventured 
 <I>into the house of the Lord</I> at that time, and cried, <I>Treason, 
 treason!</I> But nobody seconded her, or sided with her. The pride of 
 her heart deceived her. She thought all her own, whereas none were 
 cordially so. Jehoiada, as protector in the king's minority, ordered 
 her to be slain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 
 which was done immediately
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 only care was taken that she should not be <I>slain in the house of the
 Lord,</I> that sacred place must not be so far disgraced, nor that 
 wicked woman so far honoured.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The original contract agreed to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 In the <I>Kings</I> it is said that Jehoiada made a covenant between
 the <I>Lord,</I> the people, and the king,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:17">2 Kings xi. 17</A>.

 Here it is said to be between <I>himself,</I> the people, and the king;
 for he, as God's priest, was his representative in this transaction, or 
 a sort of mediator, as Moses was. The indenture was tripartite, but the 
 true intent and meaning of the whole was that <I>they should be the 
 Lord's people.</I> God covenanted by Jehoiada to take them for his 
 people; the king and people covenanted with him to be his; and then the 
 king covenanted with the people to govern them <I>as the people of
 God,</I> and the people with the king to be subject to him <I>as the
 Lord's people,</I> in his fear and for his sake. Let us look upon 
 ourselves and one another as <I>the Lord's people,</I> and this will 
 have a powerful influence upon us in the discharge of all our duty both 
 to God and man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Baal destroyed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 They would not have done half their work if they had only destroyed the
 usurper of the <I>king's</I> right, and not the usurper of <I>God's</I> 
 right--if they had asserted the honour of the throne, and not that of 
 the altar.  The greatest grievance of Athaliah's reign was the bringing 
 in of the worship of Baal, and supporting of that; therefore that must 
 be abolished in the first place. Down with Baal's house, his altars, 
 his images; down with them all, and let the blood of his priests be 
 mingled with his sacrifices; for God had commanded that seducers to 
 idolatry should be put to death,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:5,6">Deut. xiii. 5, 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The temple service revived, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 This had been neglected in the last reigns, the priest and people
 wanting either power or zeal to keep it up when they had princes that 
 were disaffected to it. But Jehoiada restored <I>the offices of the 
 house of the Lord,</I> which in the late times had been disturbed and 
 invaded, to the proper course and proper hands.

 1. He appointed the priests to their courses, for the due offering of
 sacrifices, according to the law of Moses. 

 2. The singers to theirs, according to the appointment of David. The
 sacrifices (it should seem) were <I>offered with rejoicing and 
 singing,</I> and with good reason.  We <I>joy in God</I> when we 
 <I>receive the atonement,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:11">Rom. v. 11</A>.

 3. The porters were put in their respective posts as David ordered

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and their office was to take care that none who were upon any account
 ceremonially unclean should be admitted into the courts of the 
 temple.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The civil government re-established, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 They brought the king in state to his own palace, and set him <I>upon
 the throne of the kingdom,</I> to give law, and give judgment, either 
 in his own person or by Jehoiada his tutor. Thus was this happy 
 revolution perfected. The generality of the people rejoiced in it, and 
 the rest were quiet and made no opposition,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 When the Son of David is enthroned in the soul all is quiet and springs
 of joy are opened.</P>
