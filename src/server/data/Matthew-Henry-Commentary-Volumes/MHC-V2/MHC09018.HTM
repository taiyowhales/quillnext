 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the course of the foregoing chapter we left David in triumph; now in
 this chapter we have,

 I. The improvement of his triumphs; he soon became,

 1. Saul's constant attendant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:2">ver. 2</A>.

 2. Jonathan's covenant friend, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:1,3,4">ver. 1, 3, 4</A>.

 3. The darling of his country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:5,7,16">ver. 5, 7, 16</A>.

 II.  The allays of his triumphs. This is the vanity that accompanies
 even a right work, that "for it a man is envied," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:4">Eccl. iv. 4</A>.

 So David was by Saul. 
 
 1. He hated him, and sought to kill him himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 2. He feared him, and contrived how he might have some mischief done
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:12-17">ver.  12-17</A>.

 He proposed to marry his daughter to him; but,

 [1.] cheated him of the eldest to provoke him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:19">ver. 19</A>),

 and,

 [2.] Gave him the younger, upon conditions which would endanger his
 life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:20-25">ver.  20-25</A>.

 But David performed his conditions bravely 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:26,27">ver. 26, 27</A>),

 and grew to be more and more esteemed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:28-30">ver. 28-30</A>.

 Still David is rising, but (as all that aim at the crown of life must
 expect) he had a great deal of difficulty and opposition to grapple 
 with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
 Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David,
 and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
 &nbsp; 2 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home
 to his father's house.
 &nbsp; 3 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him
 as his own soul.
 &nbsp; 4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that <I>was</I> upon
 him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword,
 and to his bow, and to his girdle.
 &nbsp; 5 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, <I>and</I> behaved
 himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was
 accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of
 Saul's servants.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David was anointed to the crown to take it out of Saul's hand, and over 
 Jonathan's head, and yet here we find,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That Saul, who was now in possession of the crown, reposed a 
 confidence in him, God so ordering it, that he might by his preferment 
 at court be prepared for future service. Saul now took David home with 
 him, and would not suffer him to return again to his retirement, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 And David having signalized himself above the men of war, in taking up
 the challenge which they declined, <I>Saul set him over the men of 
 war</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 not that he made him general (Abner was in that post), but perhaps
 captain of the life-guard; or, though he was youngest, he ordered him 
 to have the precedency, in recompence of his great services. He 
 employed him in the affairs of government; <I>and David went out 
 whithersoever Saul sent him,</I> showing himself as dutiful as he was 
 bold and courageous. Those that hope to rule must first learn to obey. 
 He had approved himself a dutiful son to Jesse his father, and now a 
 dutiful servant to Saul his master; those that are good in one relation 
 it is to be hoped will be so in another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That Jonathan, who was heir to the crown, entered into covenant 
 with him, God so ordering it, that David's way might be the clearer 
 when his rival was his friend. 

 1. Jonathan conceived an extraordinary kindness and affection for him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>When he had made an end of speaking to Saul</I> he fell perfectly in
 love with him. Whether it refers to his conference with Saul before the 
 battle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:34,37"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 34, 37</A>),
 
 or to that after 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),

 in which it is probable much more was said than is there set down, is
 uncertain. But, in both, David expressed himself with so much prudence, 
 modesty, and piety, such a felicity of expression, with so much 
 boldness and yet so much sweetness, and all this so natural and 
 unaffected, and the more surprising because of the disadvantages of his 
 education and appearance, <I>that the soul of Jonathan was</I> 
 immediately <I>knit</I> unto <I>the soul of David.</I> Jonathan had 
 formerly set upon a Philistine army with the same faith and bravery 
 with which David had now attacked a Philistine giant; so that there was 
 between them a very near resemblance of affections, dispositions, and 
 counsels, which made their spirits unite to easily, so quickly, so 
 closely, that they seemed but as one soul in two bodies.  None had so 
 much reason to dislike David as Jonathan had, because he was to put him 
 by the crown, yet none regards him more. Those that are governed in 
 their love by principles of wisdom and grace will not suffer their 
 affections to be alienated by any secular regards or considerations: 
 the greater thoughts will swallow up and overrule the less. 

 2. He testified his love to David by a generous present he made him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He was uneasy at seeing so great a soul, though lodged in so fair a
 body, yet disguised in the mean and despicable dress of a poor 
 shepherd, and therefore takes care to put him speedily into the habit 
 of a courtier (for he gave him a robe) and of a soldier, for he gave 
 him, instead of his staff and sling, a sword and bow, and, instead of 
 his shepherd's scrip, a girdle, either a belt or a sash; and, which 
 made the present much more obliging, they were the same that he himself 
 had worn, and (as a presage of what would follow) he stripped himself 
 of them to dress David in them. Saul's would not fit him, but 
 Jonathan's did.  Their bodies were of a size, a circumstance which well 
 agreed with the suitableness of their minds. When Saul put these marks 
 of honour on David he put them off again, because he would first earn 
 them and then wear them; but, now that he had given proofs of the 
 spirit of a prince and a soldier, he was not ashamed to wear the habits 
 of a prince and a soldier. David is seen in Jonathan's clothes, that 
 all may take notice he is a Jonathan's second self. Our Lord Jesus has 
 thus shown his love to us, that he stripped himself to clothe us, 
 emptied himself to enrich us; nay, he did more than Jonathan, he 
 clothed himself with our rags, whereas Jonathan did not put on David's.

 3. He endeavored to perpetuate this friendship. So entirely satisfied
 were they in each other, even at the first interview, that they made a 
 covenant with each other, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Their mutual affection was sincere; and he that bears an honest mind
 startles not at assurances. True love desires to be constant. Those who 
 love Christ as their own souls will be willing to join themselves to 
 him in an everlasting covenant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That both court and country agree to bless him. It is but seldom 
 that they agree in their favourites; yet David was <I>accepted in the 
 sight of all the people, and also</I> (which was strange) <I>in the 
 sight of Saul's servants,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The former cordially loved him, the latter could not for shame but
 caress and compliment him. And it was certainly a great instance of the 
 power of God's grace in David that he was able to bear all this respect 
 and honour flowing in upon him on a sudden without being lifted up 
 above measure. Those that climb so fast have need of good heads and 
 good hearts. It is more difficult to know how to abound than how to be 
 abased.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned
 from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of
 all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul,
 with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.
 &nbsp; 7 And the women answered <I>one another</I> as they played, and
 said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.
 &nbsp; 8 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and
 he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me
 they have ascribed <I>but</I> thousands: and <I>what</I> can he have more
 but the kingdom?
 &nbsp; 9 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
 &nbsp; 10 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from
 God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house:
 and David played with his hand, as at other times: and <I>there
 was</I> a javelin in Saul's hand.
 &nbsp; 11 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David
 even to the wall <I>with it.</I> And David avoided out of his presence
 twice.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now begin David's troubles, and they not only tread on the heels of his 
 triumphs, but take rise from them, such is the vanity of that in this 
 world which seems greatest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He was too much magnified by the common people. Some time after the 
 victory Saul went a triumphant progress through the cities of Israel 
 that lay next him, to receive the congratulations of the country. And, 
 when he made his public entry into any place, the women were most 
 forward to show him respect, as was usual then in public triumphs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and they had got a song, it seems, which they sang in their dances
 (made by some poet or other, that was a great admirer of David's 
 bravery, and was more just than wise, in giving his achievements in the 
 late action the preference before Saul's), the burden of which was, 
 <I>Saul had slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.</I> Such 
 a difference as this Moses made between the numbers of Ephraim and 
 Manasseh,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:17">Deut. xxxiii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. This mightily displeased Saul, and made him envy David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 He ought to have considered that they referred only to this late
 action, and intended not to diminish any of Saul's former exploits; and 
 that in the action now celebrated it was undeniably true that David, in 
 killing Goliath, did in effect slay all the Philistines that were slain 
 that day and defeated the whole army; so that they did but give David 
 his due. It may be, he that composed the song only used a poetic 
 liberty, and intended not any invidious comparison between Saul and 
 David; or, if he did, it was below the great mind of a prince to take 
 notice of such a reflection upon his personal honour, when it appeared 
 that the glory of the public was sincerely intended. But Saul was very 
 wroth, and presently suspected some treasonable design at the bottom of 
 it: <I>What can he have more but the kingdom?</I> This made him eye 
 David as one he was jealous of and sought advantages against

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 his countenance was not towards him as it had been. Proud men cannot
 endure to hear any praised but themselves, and think all their honour 
 lost that goes by themselves. It is a sign that the Spirit of God has 
 departed from men if they be peevish in their resentment of affronts, 
 envious and suspicious of all about them, and ill-natured in their 
 conduct; for the wisdom from above makes us quite otherwise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In his fury he aimed to kill David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 <I>Jealousy is the rage of a man;</I> it made Saul outrageous against
 David and impatient to get him out of the way.

 1. His fits of frenzy returned upon him. The very next day after he
 conceived malice against David the evil spirit from God, that had 
 formerly haunted him, seized him again. Those that indulge themselves 
 in envy and uncharitableness <I>give place to the devil,</I> and 
 prepare for the re-entry of the unclean spirit, with seven others more 
 wicked. Where envy is there is confusion. Saul pretended a religious 
 ecstasy: <I>He prophesied in the midst of the house,</I> that is, he 
 had the gestures and motions of a prophet, and humoured the thing well 
 enough to decoy David into a snare, and that he might be fearless of 
 any danger and off his guard; and perhaps designing, if he could but 
 kill him, to impute it to a divine impulse and to charge it upon the 
 spirit of prophecy with which he seemed to be animated: but really it 
 was a hellish fury that actuated him. 

 2. David, though advanced to a much higher post of honour, disdained
 not, for his master's service, to return to his harp: <I>He played with 
 his hand as at other times.</I> Let not the highest think any thing 
 below them whereby they may do good and be serviceable to those they 
 are obliged to. 

 3. He took this opportunity to aim at the death of David. A sword in a
 madman's hand is a dangerous thing, especially such a madman as Saul 
 was, that was mad with malice. Yet he had a javelin or dart in his 
 hand, which he projected, endeavouring thereby to slay David, not in a 
 sudden passion, but deliberately: <I>I will smite David to the wall 
 with it,</I> with such a desperate force did he throw it.  Justly does 
 David complain of his enemies that they hated him with <I>a cruel 
 hatred,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:19">Ps. xxv. 19</A>.

 No life is thought too precious to be sacrificed to malice. If a
 grateful sense of the great service David had done to the public could 
 not assuage Saul's fury, yet one would think he should have allowed 
 himself to consider the kindness David was now doing him, in relieving 
 him, as no one else could, against the worst of troubles.  Those are 
 possessed with a devilish spirit indeed that render evil for good.  
 Compare David, with his harp in his hand, aiming to serve Saul, and 
 Saul, with his javelin in his hand, aiming to slay David; and observe 
 the meekness and usefulness of God's persecuted people and the 
 brutishness and barbarity of their persecutors. <I>The bloodthirsty 
 hate the upright, but the just seek his soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:10">Prov. xxix. 10</A>.

 4. David happily avoided the blow twice (namely, now, and afterwards,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:10"><I>ch.</I> xix. 10</A>);

 he did not throw the javelin at Saul again, but withdrew, not fighting
 but flying for his own preservation; though he had both strength and 
 courage enough, and colour of right, to make resistance and revenge the 
 injury, yet he did no more than secure himself, by getting out of the 
 way of it. David, no doubt, had a watchful eye upon Saul's hand, and 
 the javelin in it, and did as bravely in running from it as he did 
 lately in running upon Goliath. Yet his safety must be ascribed to the 
 watchful eye of God's providence upon him, saving his servant from the 
 hurtful sword; and by this narrow escape it seemed he was designed for 
 something extraordinary.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  And Saul was afraid of David, because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was with him,
 and was departed from Saul.
 &nbsp; 13 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his
 captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the
 people.
 &nbsp; 14 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>was</I> with him.
 &nbsp; 15 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely,
 he was afraid of him.
 &nbsp; 16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out
 and came in before them.
 &nbsp; 17 And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her
 will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him,
 but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.
 &nbsp; 18 And David said unto Saul, Who <I>am</I> I? and what <I>is</I> my life,
 <I>or</I> my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to
 the king?
 &nbsp; 19 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter
 should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel
 the Meholathite to wife.
 &nbsp; 20 And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul,
 and the thing pleased him.
 &nbsp; 21 And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare
 to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.
 Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in
 law in <I>the one of</I> the twain.
 &nbsp; 22 And Saul commanded his servants, <I>saying,</I> Commune with
 David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee,
 and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son
 in law.
 &nbsp; 23 And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David.
 And David said, Seemeth it to you <I>a</I> light <I>thing</I> to be a
 king's son in law, seeing that I <I>am</I> a poor man, and lightly
 esteemed?
 &nbsp; 24 And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner
 spake David.
 &nbsp; 25 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth
 not any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be
 avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David
 fall by the hand of the Philistines.
 &nbsp; 26 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased
 David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not
 expired.
 &nbsp; 27 Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of
 the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their
 foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he
 might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his
 daughter to wife.
 &nbsp; 28 And Saul saw and knew that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>was</I> with David, and
 <I>that</I> Michal Saul's daughter loved him.
 &nbsp; 29 And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became
 David's enemy continually.
 &nbsp; 30 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came
 to pass, after they went forth, <I>that</I> David behaved himself more
 wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much
 set by.
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Saul had now, in effect, proclaimed war with David. He began in open 
 hostility when he threw the javelin at him. Now we are here told how 
 his enmity proceeded, and how David received the attacks of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See how Saul expressed his malice against David. 

 1. He was <I>afraid of him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Perhaps he pretended to be afraid that David would do himself mischief,
 to force his way to the crown. Those that design ill against others are 
 commonly willing to have it thought that others design ill against 
 them. But David's withdrawal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 was a plain evidence that he was far from such a thought. However, he
 really stood in awe of him, as Herod feared John,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:20">Mark vi. 20</A>.

 Saul was sensible that he had lost the favourable presence of God
 himself, and that David had it, and for this reason he feared him. 
 Note, Those are truly great and to be reverenced that have God with 
 them. The more <I>wisely David behaved himself</I> the more <I>Saul 
 feared him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>,
 
 and again

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Men think the way to be feared is to hector and threaten, which makes
 them feared by fools only, but despised by the wise and good; whereas 
 the way to be both feared and loved, feared by those to whom we would 
 wish to be a terror and loved by those to whom we would wish to be a 
 delight, is to <I>behave ourselves wisely.</I> Wisdom makes the face to 
 shine and commands respect.

 2. He removed him from court, and gave him a regiment in the country,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He made him captain over 1000, that he might be from under his eye,
 because he hated the sight of him; and that he might not secure the 
 interest of the courtiers. Yet herein he did impolitely; for it gave 
 David an opportunity of ingratiating himself with the people, who 
 therefore <I>loved him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 because he <I>went out and came in before them,</I> that is, he
 presided in the business of his country, civil as well as military, and 
 have universal satisfaction. 

 3.  He stirred him up to take all occasions of quarrelling with the 
 Philistines and engaging them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 insinuating to him that hereby he would do good service to his prince
 (<I>be thou valiant for me</I>), and good service to his God (<I>fight
 the Lord's battles</I>), and a kindness to himself too, for hereby he
 would qualify himself for the honour he designed him, which was to 
 marry his eldest daughter to him.  This he had merited by killing 
 Goliath, for it was promised by proclamation to him that should do that 
 exploit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:25"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 25</A>);

 but David was so modest as not to demand it, and now, when Saul
 proposed it, it was with design of mischief to him, to make him venture 
 upon hazardous attempts, saying in his heart, <I>Let the hand of the 
 Philistines be upon him,</I> hoping that he would some time or other be 
 the death of him; yet how could he expect this when he saw that God was 
 with him? 

 4. He did what he could to provoke him to discontent and mutiny, by
 breaking his promise with him, and giving his daughter to another when 
 the time came that she should have been given to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 This was as great an affront as he could possibly put upon him, and
 touched him both in his honour and in his love. He therefore thought 
 David's resentment of it would break out in some indecency or other, in 
 word or deed, which might give him an advantage against him to take him 
 off by the course of law. Thus evil men seek mischief.

 5. When he was disappointed in his, he proffered him his other daughter
 (who it seems had a secret kindness for David,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 but with this design, that she might be <I>a snare to him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 (1.) Perhaps he hoped that she would, even after her marriage to David, 
 take part with her father against her husband, and give him an 
 opportunity of doing David an unkindness. However, 

 (2.) The conditions of the marriage, he hoped, would be his 
 destruction; for (so zealous will Saul seem against the Philistines) 
 the conditions of the marriage must be that he killed 100 Philistines, 
 and, as proofs that those he had slain were uncircumcised, he must 
 bring in their foreskins cut off; this would be a just reproach upon 
 the Philistines, who hated circumcision as it was an ordinance of God; 
 and perhaps David, in doing this, would the more exasperate them 
 against him, and make them seek to be revenged on him, which was the 
 thing that Saul desired and designed, much more than to be avenged on 
 the Philistines: <I>For Saul thought to make David fall by the 
 Philistines,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 See here,

 [1.] What cheats bad men put upon themselves. Saul's conscience would 
 not suffer him, except when the evil spirit was actually upon him, to 
 aim at David's life himself, for even he could not but conceive a 
 horror at the thought of murdering such an innocent and excellent 
 person; but he thought that to expose him designedly to the Philistines 
 had nothing bad in it (<I>Let not my hand be upon him, but the hand of 
 the Philistines</I>), whereas that malicious design against him was as
 truly murder before God as if he had slain him with his own hands. 

 [2.] What cheats they put upon the world. Saul pretended extraordinary 
 kindness for David even when he aimed at his ruin, and was actually 
 plotting it: <I>Thou shalt be my son-in-law,</I> says he 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),
 
 notwithstanding he hated him implacably. Perhaps David refers to this
 when 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:21">Ps. lv. 21</A>)

 he speaks of his enemy as one whose words were <I>smoother than butter,
 but war was in his heart.</I> It is probable that Saul's employing his 
 servants to persuade David to enter into a treaty of a match with his 
 daughter Michal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 arose from an apprehension that either his having cheated him about his
 elder daughter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 or the hardness of the terms he intended now to propose would make him
 decline it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See how David conducted himself when the tide of Saul's displeasure 
 ran thus high against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>He behaved himself wisely in all his ways.</I> He perceived 
 Saul's jealousy of him, which made him very cautious and circumspect in 
 every thing he said and did, and careful to give no offence. He did not 
 complain of hard measure more make himself the head of a party, but 
 managed all the affairs he was entrusted with as one that made it his 
 business to do real service to his king and country, looking upon that 
 to be the end of his preferment. And then <I>the Lord was with him</I> 
 to give him success in all his undertakings. Though he procured Saul's 
 ill-will by it, yet he obtained God's favour. Compare this with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:2">Ps. ci. 2</A>,

 where it is David's promise, <I>I will behave myself wisely;</I> and
 that promise he here performed; and it is his prayer, <I>O, when wilt 
 thou come unto me?</I> And that prayer God here answered: <I>The Lord 
 was with him.</I> However blind fortune may seem to favour fools, God 
 will own and bless those that behave themselves wisely.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When it was proposed to him to be son-in-law to the king he once and 
 again received the proposal with all possible modesty and humility. 
 When Saul proposed his elder daughter to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 he said, <I>Who am I, and what is my life?</I> When the courtier
 proposed the younger, he took no notice of the affront Saul had put 
 upon him in disposing of the elder from him, but continued in the same 
 mind

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Seemeth it a light thing to you to be a king's son-in-law, seeing
 that I am a poor man and lightly esteemed?</I> He knew Michal loved 
 him, and yet did not offer to improve his interest in her affections 
 for the gaining of her without her father's consent, but waited till it 
 was proposed to him.  And then see,

 (1.) How highly he speaks of the honour offered him: <I>To be 
 son-in-law to the king.</I> Though his king was but an upstart, in his 
 original as mean as himself, in his management no better than he should 
 be, yet, being a crowned head, he speaks of him and the royal family 
 with all due respect. Note, Religion is so far from teaching us to be 
 rude and unmannerly that it does not allow us to be so. We must 
 <I>render honour to whom honour is due.</I> 

 (2.) How humbly he speaks of himself: <I>Who am I?</I> This did not 
 proceed from a mean, abject, sneaking spirit, for when there was 
 occasion he made it appear that he had as high a sense of honour as 
 most men; nor was it from his jealousy of Saul (though he had reason 
 enough to fear a snake under the green grass), but from him true and 
 deep humility: <I>Who am I, a poor man, and lightly esteemed?</I> David 
 had as much reason as any man to value himself. He was of an ancient 
 and honourable family of Judah, a comely person, a great statesman and 
 soldier; his achievements were great, for he had won Goliath's head and 
 Michal's heart. He knew himself destined by the divine counsels to the 
 throne of Israel, and yet, <I>Whom am I, and what is my life?</I> Note, 
 It well becomes us, however God has advanced us, always to have low 
 thoughts of ourselves.  <I>He that humbleth himself shall be 
 exalted.</I> And, if David thus magnified the honour of being 
 son-in-law to the king, how should we magnify the honour of being sons 
 (not in law, but in gospel) to the King of kings!  <I>Behold what 
 manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us!</I> Who are we that we 
 should be thus dignified?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. When the slaying of 100 Philistines was made the condition of 
 David's marrying Saul's daughter he readily closed with it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):
 
 <I>It pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law</I> upon those
 terms; and, before the time given him for the action had expired, he 
 doubled the demand, and slew 200, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 He would not seem to suspect that Saul designed his hurt by it (though
 he had reason enough), but would rather act as if Saul had meant to 
 consult his honour, and therefore cheerfully undertook it, as became a 
 brave soldier and a true lover, though we may suppose it uneasy to 
 Michal. David hereby discovered likewise,

 (1.) A great confidence in the divine protection.  He knew God was with 
 him, and therefore, whatever Saul hoped, David did not fear falling by 
 the Philistines, though he must needs expose himself much by such an 
 undertaking as this. 

 (2.) A great zeal for the good of his country, which he would not 
 decline any occasion of doing service to, though with the hazard of his 
 life. 

 (3.) A right notion of honour, which consists not so much in being 
 preferred as in deserving to be so. David was then pleased with the 
 thoughts of being the king's son-in-law when he found the honour set at 
 this high price, being more solicitous how to merit it than how to 
 obtain it; nor could he wear it with satisfaction till he had won 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Even after he was married he continued his good services to Israel. 
 When the princes of the Philistines began to move towards another war 
 David was ready to oppose them, and <I>behaved himself more wisely than 
 all the servants of Saul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 The law dispensed with men from going to war the first year after they
 were married

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:5">Deut. xxiv. 5</A>),

 but David loved his country too well to make use of that dispensation.
 Many that have shown themselves forward to serve the public when they 
 have been in pursuit of preferment have declined it when they have 
 gained their point; but David acted from more generous principles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Observe how God brought good to David out of Saul's project 
 against him. 

 1. Saul gave him his daughter to be a snare to him, but in this respect
 that marriage was a kindness to him, that his being Saul's son-in-law 
 made his succeeding him much the less invidious, especially when so 
 many of his sons were slain with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:2"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 2</A>.

 2. Saul thought, by putting him upon dangerous services, to have him
 taken off, but that very thing confirmed his interest in the people; 
 for the more he did against the Philistines the better they loved him, 
 so that <I>his name was much set by</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 which would make his coming to the crown the more easy. Thus God makes
 even the wrath of man to praise him and serves his designs of kindness 
 to his own people by it.</P>
