 Still Solomon looks great, and every thing in this chapter adds to his 
 magnificence. We read nothing indeed of his charity, of no hospitals he 
 built, or alms-houses; he made his kingdom so rich that it did not need 
 them; yet, no question, many poor were relieved from the abundance of 
 his table. A church he had built, never to be equalled; schools or 
 colleges he need not build any, his own palace is an academy, and his 
 court a rendezvous of wise and learned men, as well as the centre of 
 all the circulating riches of that part of the world. 

 I. What abundance of wisdom there was there appears from the 
 application the queen of Sheba made to him, and the great satisfaction 
 she had in her entertainment there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:1-13">ver. 1-13</A>),

 and others likewise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:24">ver. 24</A>.

 II. What abundance of wealth there was there appears here by the gold
 imported, with other things, yearly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>),

 and in a triennial return,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:22">ver. 22</A>.

 Gold presented 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:25">ver. 25</A>),

 and gold used in targets and shields

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>),

 and vessels,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:21">ver. 21</A>.

 A stately throne made, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>.

 His chariots and horsemen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:26">ver. 26</A>.

 His trade with Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:28,29">ver. 28, 29</A>.

 And the great plenty of silver and cedars among his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:27">ver. 27</A>.

 So that, putting all together, it must be owned, as it is here said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:23">ver. 23</A>),

 that "king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches, and
 for wisdom." Yet what was he to the King of kings? Where Christ is, by
 his word and Spirit, "Behold, a greater than Solomon is there."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
 concerning the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, she came to prove him with hard
 questions.
 &nbsp; 2 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with
 camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones:
 and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all
 that was in her heart.
 &nbsp; 3 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not <I>any</I>
 thing hid from the king, which he told her not.
 &nbsp; 4 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom,
 and the house that he had built,
 &nbsp; 5 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
 and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his
 cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; there was no more spirit in her.
 &nbsp; 6 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard
 in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
 &nbsp; 7 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes
 had seen <I>it:</I> and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom
 and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.
 &nbsp; 8 Happy <I>are</I> thy men, happy <I>are</I> these thy servants, which
 stand continually before thee, <I>and</I> that hear thy wisdom.
 &nbsp; 9 Blessed be the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, which delighted in thee, to set
 thee on the throne of Israel: because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> loved Israel for
 ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.
 &nbsp; 10 And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold,
 and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came
 no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of
 Sheba gave to king Solomon.
 &nbsp; 11 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,
 brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious
 stones.
 &nbsp; 12 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries
 for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto
 this day.
 &nbsp; 13 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her
 desire, whatsoever she asked, beside <I>that</I> which Solomon gave
 her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own
 country, she and her servants.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the visit which the queen of Sheba made to 
 Solomon, no doubt when he was in the height of his piety and 
 prosperity. Our Saviour calls her <I>the queen of the south,</I> for 
 Sheba lay south of Canaan. The common opinion is that it was in Africa; 
 and the Christians in Ethiopia, to this day, are confident that she 
 came from their country, and that Candace was her successor, who is 
 mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:27">Acts viii. 27</A>.

 But it is more probable that she came from the south part of Arabia the
 happy. It should seem she was a queen regent, sovereign of her country. 
 Many a kingdom would have been deprived of its greatest blessings if a 
 Salique law had been admitted into its constitution. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. On what errand the queen of Sheba came--not to treat of trade or
 commerce, to adjust the limits of their dominions, to court his 
 alliance for their mutual strength or his assistance against some 
 common enemy, which are the common occasions of the congress of crowned 
 heads and their interviews, but she came, 

 1. To satisfy her curiosity; for she had heard of his fame, especially
 for wisdom, and she came to prove him, whether he was so great a man as 
 he was reported to be,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Solomon's fleet sailed near the coast of her country, and probably
 might put in there for fresh water; perhaps it was thus that <I>she 
 heard of the fame of Solomon,</I> that he excelled in wisdom all the 
 children of the east, and nothing would serve her but she would go 
 herself and know the truth of the report. 

 2. To receive instruction from him. She came to <I>hear his wisdom,</I>
 and thereby to improve her own

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:42">Matt. xii. 42</A>),

 that she might be the better able to govern her own kingdom by his
 maxims of policy. Those whom God has called to any public employment, 
 particularly in the magistracy and ministry, should, by all means 
 possible, be still improving themselves in that knowledge which will 
 more and more qualify them for it, and enable them to discharge their 
 trust well. But, it should seem, that which she chiefly aimed at was to 
 be instructed in the things of God. She was religiously inclined, and 
 had heard not only of the fame of Solomon, but <I>concerning the name 
 of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 the great name of that God whom Solomon worshipped and from whom he 
 received his wisdom, and with this God she desired to be better 
 acquainted. Therefore does our Saviour mention her enquiries after God, 
 by Solomon, as an aggravation of the stupidity of those who enquire not 
 after God by our Lord Jesus Christ, though he, having lain in his 
 bosom, was much better able to instruct them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. With what equipage she came, with a very great retinue, agreeable 
 to her rank, intending to try Solomon's wealth and generosity, as well 
 as his wisdom, what entertainment he could and would give to a royal 
 visitant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Yet she came not as one begging, but brought enough to bear her
 charges, and abundantly to recompense Solomon for his attention to her, 
 nothing mean or common, but gold, and precious stones, and spices, 
 because she came to trade for wisdom, which she would purchase at any 
 rate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What entertainment Solomon gave her. He despised not the weakness 
 of her sex, blamed her not for leaving her own business at home to come 
 so long a journey, and put herself and him to so much trouble and 
 expense merely to satisfy her curiosity; but he made her welcome and 
 all her train, gave her liberty to put all her questions, though some 
 perhaps were frivolous, some captious, and some over-curious; he 
 allowed her to <I>commune with him of all that was in her heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)
 
 and gave her a satisfactory answer to <I>all her questions</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 whether natural, moral, political, or divine. Were they designed to try
 him? he gave them such turns as abundantly satisfied her of his 
 uncommon knowledge. Were they designed for her own instruction? (as we
 suppose most of them were), she received abundant instruction from him, 
 and he made things surprisingly easy which she apprehended insuperably 
 difficult, and satisfied her that there was <I>a divine sentence in the 
 lips of</I> this <I>king.</I> But he informed her no doubt, with 
 particular care, concerning God, and his law and instituted worship. He 
 had taken it for granted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:42"><I>ch.</I> viii. 42</A>)

 that <I>strangers would hear of his great name,</I> and would come
 thither to enquire after him; and now that so great a stranger came we 
 may be sure he was not wanting to assist and encourage her enquiries, 
 and give her a description of the temple, and the officers and services 
 of it, that she might be persuaded to serve the Lord whom she now 
 sought.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How she was affected with what she saw and heard in Solomon's 
 court. Divers things are here mentioned which she admired, the 
 buildings and furniture of his palace, the provision that was made very 
 day for his table (when she saw that perhaps she wondered where there 
 were mouths for all that meat, but when she saw the multitude of his 
 attendants and guests she was as ready to wonder where was the meat for 
 all those mouths), the orderly sitting of his servants, every one in 
 his place, and the ready attendance of his ministers, without any 
 confusion, their rich liveries, and the propriety with which his 
 cup-bearers waited at his table. These things she admired, as adding 
 much to his magnificence. But, above all these, the first thing 
 mentioned (which contained all) is his wisdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 of the transcendency of which she now had incontestable proofs: and the
 last thing mentioned, which crowned all, is his piety, the <I>ascent by 
 which he went up to the house of the Lord,</I> with what gravity and 
 seriousness, and an air of devotion in his countenance, he appeared, 
 when he went to the temple to worship God, with as much humility then 
 as majesty at other times. Many of the ancient versions read it, The 
 <I>burnt-offerings which he offered in the house of the Lord;</I> she 
 observed with what a generous bounty he brought his sacrifices, and 
 with what a pious fervour he attended the offering of them; never did 
 she see so much goodness with so much greatness. Every thing was so 
 surprising that there was no more spirit in her, but she stood amazed; 
 she had never seen the like.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. How she expressed herself upon this occasion. 

 1. She owned her expectation far out-done, though it was highly raised
 by the report she heard, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 She is far from repenting her journey or calling herself a <I>fool</I>
 for undertaking it, but acknowledges it was well worth her while to 
 come so far for the sight of that which she could not believe the 
 report of. Usually things are represented to us, both by common fame 
 and by our own imagination, much greater than we find them when we come 
 to examine them; but here the truth exceeded both fame and fancy. Those 
 who, through grace, are brought to experience the delights of communion 
 with God will say that the one-half was not told them of the pleasures 
 of Wisdom's ways and the advantages of her gates. Glorified saints,
 much more, will say that it was a true report which they heard of the 
 happiness of heaven, but that the thousandth part was not told them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:9">1 Cor. ii. 9</A>.

 2. She pronounced those happy that constantly attended him, and waited
 on him at table: "<I>Happy are thy men, happy are these thy 
 servants</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 they may improve their own wisdom by hearing thine." She was tempted to
 envy them and to which herself one of them. Note, It is a great
 advantage to be in good families, and to have opportunity of frequent 
 converse with those that are wise, and good, and communicative. Many 
 have this happiness who know not how to value it. With much more reason 
 may we say this of Christ's servants, <I>Blessed are those that dwell 
 in his house, they will be still praising him.</I> 

 3. She blessed God, the giver of Solomon's wisdom and wealth, and the
 author of his advancement, who had made him king,

 (1.) In kindness to him, that he might have the larger opportunity of 
 doing good with his wisdom: He <I>delighted in thee, to set thee on the 
 throne of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Solomon's preferment began in the prophet's calling him <I>Jedidiah,
 because the Lord loved him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:25">2 Sam. xii. 25</A>.
 
 It more than doubles our comforts if we have reason to hope they come
 from God's delight in us. <I>It was his pleasure concerning thee</I> 
 (so it may be read) to <I>set thee on the throne,</I> not for thy 
 merit's sake, but because it so seemed good unto him. 

 (2.) In kindness to the people, <I>because the Lord loved Israel for 
 ever,</I> designed them a lasting bliss, long to survive him that laid 
 the foundations of it. "He has made thee king, not that thou mayest 
 live in pomp and pleasure, and do what thou wilt, but <I>to do judgment 
 and justice.</I>" This she kindly reminded Solomon of, and no doubt he 
 took it kindly. Both magistrates and ministers must be more solicitous 
 to do the duty of their places than to secure the honours and profits 
 of them. To this she attributes his prosperity, not to his wisdom, for 
 bread is not always <I>to the wise</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:11">Eccl. ix. 11</A>),

 but whoso <I>doeth judgment and justice,</I> it shall be <I>well with
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:15">Jer. xxii. 15</A>.

 Thus <I>giving of thanks</I> must be <I>made for kings,</I> for good
 kings, for such kings; they are what God makes them to be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. How they parted. 

 1. She made a noble present to Solomon of <I>gold and spices,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 David had foretold concerning Solomon that <I>to him should be given of
 the gold of Sheba,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:15">Ps. lxxii. 15</A>.

 The present of gold and spices which the wise men of the east brought
 to Christ was signified by this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:11">Matt. ii. 11</A>.

 Thus she paid for the wisdom she had learned and did not think she
 bought it dearly. Let those that are taught of God give him their 
 hearts, and the present will be more acceptable than this of gold and 
 spices. Mention is made of the great abundance Solomon had of his own, 
 notwithstanding she presented and he accepted this gold. What we 
 present to Christ he needs not, but will have us so to express our 
 gratitude. The almug-trees are here spoken of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>)

 as extraordinary, because perhaps much admired by the queen of Sheba.
 
 2. Solomon was not behind-hand with her: <I>He gave her whatsoever,
 she asked,</I> patterns, we may suppose, of those things that were 
 curious, by which she might make the like; or perhaps he gave her his 
 precepts of wisdom and piety in writing, <I>besides that which he gave 
 her of his royal bounty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Thus those who apply to our Lord Jesus will find him not only greater
 than Solomon, and wiser, but more kind; whatsoever we ask, it shall be 
 done for us; nay, he will, out of his divine bounty, which infinitely 
 exceeds royal bounty, even Solomon's, do for us <I>more than we are 
 able to ask or think.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was
 six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,
 &nbsp; 15 Beside <I>that he had</I> of the merchantmen, and of the traffick
 of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of
 the governors of the country.
 &nbsp; 16 And king Solomon made two hundred targets <I>of</I> beaten gold:
 six hundred <I>shekels</I> of gold went to one target.
 &nbsp; 17 And <I>he made</I> three hundred shields <I>of</I> beaten gold; three
 pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the
 house of the forest of Lebanon.
 &nbsp; 18 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
 it with the best gold.
 &nbsp; 19 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne <I>was</I>
 round behind: and <I>there were</I> stays on either side on the place
 of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.
 &nbsp; 20 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the
 other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any
 kingdom.
 &nbsp; 21 And all king Solomon's drinking vessels <I>were of</I> gold, and
 all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon <I>were of</I>
 pure gold; none <I>were of</I> silver: it was nothing accounted of in
 the days of Solomon.
 &nbsp; 22 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of
 Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing
 gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
 &nbsp; 23 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for
 riches and for wisdom.
 &nbsp; 24 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom,
 which God had put in his heart.
 &nbsp; 25 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver,
 and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices,
 horses, and mules, a rate year by year.
 &nbsp; 26 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he
 had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
 horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with
 the king at Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 27 And the king made silver <I>to be</I> in Jerusalem as stones, and
 cedars made he <I>to be</I> as the sycamore trees that <I>are</I> in the
 vale, for abundance.
 &nbsp; 28 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
 the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
 &nbsp; 29 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
 <I>shekels</I> of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: and
 so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria,
 did they bring <I>them</I> out by their means.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further account of Solomon's prosperity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he increased his wealth. Though he had much, he still coveted to 
 have more, being willing to try the utmost the things of this world 
 could do to make men happy. 

 1. Besides the gold that came from Ophir

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+9:28"><I>ch.</I> ix. 28</A>),

 he brought so much into his country from other places that the whole
 amounted, every year, to 666 <I>talents</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 an ominous number, compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:18,Ezr+2:13">Rev. xiii. 18, and Ezra ii. 13</A>.

 2. He received a great deal in customs from the merchants, and in
 land-taxes from the countries his father had conquered and made 
 tributaries to Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 3. He was Hiram's partner in a Tharshish fleet, of and for Tyre, which
 imported once in three years, not only gold, and silver, and ivory, 
 substantial goods and serviceable, but apes to play with and peacocks 
 to please the eye with their feathers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 I wish this may not be an evidence that Solomon and his people, being
 overcharged with prosperity, by this time grew childish and wanton. 

 4. He had presents made him, every year, from the neighbouring princes
 and great men, to engage the continuance of his friendship, not so much 
 because they feared him or were jealous of him as because they loved 
 him and admired his wisdom, had often occasion to consult him as an 
 oracle, and sent him these presents by way of recompence for his advice 
 in politics, and (whether it became his grandeur and generosity or no 
 we will not enquire) he took all that came, even garments and spices, 
 horses and mules, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 5. He traded to Egypt for horses and linen-yarn (or, as some read it,
 <I>linen-cloth</I>), the staple commodities of that country, and had
 his own merchants or factors whom he employed in this traffic and who 
 were accountable to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.

 The custom to be paid to the king of Egypt for exported chariots and
 horses out of Egypt was very high, but (as bishop Patrick understands 
 it) Solomon, having married his daughter, got him to compound for the 
 customs, so that he could bring them up cheaper than his neighbours, 
 which obliged them to buy them of him, which he was wise enough no 
 doubt to make his advantage of. This puts an honour upon the trading 
 part of a nation, and sets a tradesman not so much below a gentleman as 
 some place him, that Solomon, one of the greatest men that ever was, 
 thought it no disparagement to him to deal in trade. In all labour 
 there is profit.</P>

 II. What use he made of his wealth. He did not hoard it up in his 
 coffers, that he might have it to look upon and leave behind him. He 
 has, in his Ecclesiastes, so much exposed the folly of hoarding that we 
 cannot suppose he would himself be guilty of it. No, God that had given 
 him riches, and wealth, and honour, gave him also power to eat thereof, 
 and to take his portion,

 1. He laid out his gold in fine things for himself, which he might the 
 better be allowed to do when he had before laid out so much in fine 
 things for the house of God. 

 (1.) He made 200 targets, and 300 shields, of beaten gold 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>),
 
 not for service, but for state, to be carried before him when he
 appeared in pomp. With us, magistrates have <I>swords</I> and 
 <I>maces</I> carried before them, as the Romans had their <I>rods</I> 
 and <I>axes,</I> in token of their power to correct and punish the bad, 
 to whom they are to be a terror. But Solomon had <I>shields</I> and 
 <I>targets</I> carried before him, to signify that he took more 
 pleasure in using his power for the defence and protection of the good, 
 to whom he would be a praise. Magistrates are <I>shields of the 
 earth.</I> 

 (2.) He made a stately throne, on which he sat, to give laws to his 
 subjects, audience to ambassadors, and judgment upon appeals, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:18-20"><I>v.</I> 18-20</A>.

 It was made of ivory, or elephants' teeth, which was very rich; and
 yet, as if he had so much gold that he knew not what to do with it, he 
 <I>overlaid that with gold,</I> the best gold. Yet some think he did 
 not cover the ivory all over, but here and there. He rolled it, 
 flowered it, or inlaid it, with gold. The stays or arms of this stately 
 chair were supported by the images of lions in gold; so were the steps 
 and paces by which he went up to it, to be a memorandum to him of that 
 courage and resolution wherewith he ought to execute judgment, not 
 fearing the face of man. <I>The righteous,</I> in that post, <I>is bold 
 as a lion.</I>

 (3.) He made all his drinking vessels, and all the furniture of his 
 table, even at his country seat, of pure gold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 He did not grudge himself what he had, but took the credit and comfort
 of it, such as it was. That is good that does us good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He made it circulate among his subjects, so that the kingdom was as 
 rich as the king; for he had no separate interests of his own to 
 consult, but sought the welfare of his people. Those princes are not 
 governed by Solomon's maxims who think it policy to keep their subjects 
 poor. Solomon was herein a type of Christ, who is not only rich 
 himself, but enriches all that are his. Solomon was instrumental to 
 bring so much gold into the country, and disperse it, that <I>silver 
 was nothing accounted of,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 There was such plenty of it in Jerusalem that it was as the stones; and
 cedars, that used to be great rarities, were as common <I>as sycamore 
 trees,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Such is the nature of worldly wealth, plenty of it makes it the less
 valuable; much more should the enjoyment of spiritual riches lessen our 
 esteem of all earthly possessions. If <I>gold in abundance</I> would 
 make silver to seem so despicable, shall not wisdom, and grace, and the 
 foretastes of heaven, which are far better than gold, make earthly 
 wealth seem much more despicable?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Well, thus rich, thus great, was Solomon, and thus did 
 he <I>exceed all the kings of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Now let us remember,

 1. That this was he who, when he was <I>setting out in the world,</I>
 did not ask for the wealth and honour of it, but asked for <I>a wise 
 and understanding heart.</I> The more moderate our desires are towards 
 earthly things the better qualified we are for the enjoyment of them 
 and the more likely to have them. See, in Solomon's greatness, the 
 performance of God's promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:13"><I>ch.</I> iii. 13</A>),

 and let it encourage us to <I>seek first the righteousness of God's
 kingdom.</I> 

 2. That this was he who, having tasted all these enjoyments, wrote a
 whole book to show the vanity of all worldly things and the vexation of 
 spirit that attends them, their insufficiency to make us happy and the 
 folly of setting our hearts upon them, and to recommend to us the 
 practice of serious godliness, as that which is the whole of man, and 
 will do infinitely more towards the making of us easy and happy than 
 all the wealth and power that he was master of, and which, through the 
 grace of God, is within our reach, when the thousandth part of 
 Solomon's greatness is a thousand times more than we can ever be so 
 vain as to promise ourselves in this world.</P>
