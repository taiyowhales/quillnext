 How Absalom threw himself out of his royal father's protection and 
 favour we read in the foregoing chapter, which left him an exile, 
 outlawed, and proscribed; in this chapter we have the arts that were 
 used to bring him and his father together again, and how, at last, it 
 was done, which is here recorded to show the folly of David in sparing 
 him and indulging him in his wickedness, for which he was soon after 
 severely corrected by his unnatural rebellion. 

 I. Joab, by bringing a feigned issue (as the lawyers speak) to be tried
 before him, in the case of a poor widow of Tekoah, gains from him a
 judgment in general, That the case might be so as that the putting of a
 murderer to death ought to be dispensed with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:1-20">ver. 1-20</A>.

 II. Upon the application of this, he gains from him an order to bring
 Absalom back to Jerusalem, while yet he was forbidden the court, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:21-24">ver. 21-24</A>.

 III.  After an account of Absalom, his person, and family, we are told
 how at length he was introduced by Joab into the king's presence, and 
 the king was thoroughly reconciled to him,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart
 <I>was</I> toward Absalom.
 &nbsp; 2 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and
 said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and
 put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but
 be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:
 &nbsp; 3 And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So
 Joab put the words in her mouth.
 &nbsp; 4 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on
 her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O
 king.
 &nbsp; 5 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she
 answered, I <I>am</I> indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.
 &nbsp; 6 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together
 in the field, and <I>there was</I> none to part them, but the one
 smote the other, and slew him.
 &nbsp; 7 And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine
 handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that
 we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we
 will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal
 which is left, and shall not leave to my husband <I>neither</I> name
 nor remainder upon the earth.
 &nbsp; 8 And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I
 will give charge concerning thee.
 &nbsp; 9 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king,
 the iniquity <I>be</I> on me, and on my father's house: and the king
 and his throne <I>be</I> guiltless.
 &nbsp; 10 And the king said, Whosoever saith <I>ought</I> unto thee, bring
 him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
 &nbsp; 11 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to
 destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, <I>As</I> the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the
 earth.
 &nbsp; 12 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak
 <I>one</I> word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
 &nbsp; 13 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a
 thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this
 thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch
 home again his banished.
 &nbsp; 14 For we must needs die, and <I>are</I> as water spilt on the
 ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God
 respect <I>any</I> person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished
 be not expelled from him.
 &nbsp; 15 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my
 lord the king, <I>it is</I> because the people have made me afraid:
 and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be
 that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.
 &nbsp; 16 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the
 hand of the man <I>that would</I> destroy me and my son together out
 of the inheritance of God.
 &nbsp; 17 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall
 now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so <I>is</I> my lord the
 king to discern good and bad: therefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God will be
 with thee.
 &nbsp; 18 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not
 from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the
 woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
 &nbsp; 19 And the king said, <I>Is not</I> the hand of Joab with thee in
 all this? And the woman answered and said, <I>As</I> thy soul liveth,
 my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left
 from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant
 Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of
 thine handmaid:
 &nbsp; 20 To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab
 done this thing: and my lord <I>is</I> wise, according to the wisdom
 of an angel of God, to know all <I>things</I> that <I>are</I> in the earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Joab's design to get Absalom recalled out of banishment, his crime 
 pardoned, and his attainder reversed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Joab made himself very busy in this affair.

 1. As a courtier that was studious, by all ways possible, to ingratiate
 himself with his prince and improve his interest in his favour: He 
 <I>perceived that the king's heart was towards Absalom,</I> and that, 
 the heat of his displeasure being over, he still retained his old 
 affection for him, and only wanted a friend to court him to be 
 reconciled, and to contrive for him how he might do it without 
 impeaching the honour of his justice. Joab, finding how David stood 
 affected, undertook this good office. 

 2. As a friend to Absalom, for whom perhaps he had a particular
 kindness, whom at least he looked upon as the rising sun, to whom it 
 was his interest to recommend himself. He plainly foresaw that his 
 father would at length be reconciled to him, and therefore thought he 
 should make both his friends if he were instrumental to bring it about.  
 
 3. As a statesman, and one concerned for the public welfare. He knew
 how much Absalom was the darling of the people, and, if David should 
 die while he was in banishment, it might occasion a civil war between 
 those that were for him and those that were against him; for it is 
 probable that though all Israel loved his person, yet they were much 
 divided upon his case. 

 4.  As one who was himself a delinquent, by the murder of Abner. He was
 conscious to himself of the guilt of blood, and that he was himself 
 obnoxious to public justice, and therefore whatever favour he could 
 procure to be shown to Absalom would corroborate his reprieve.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His contrivance to do it by laying somewhat of a parallel case 
 before the king, which was done so dexterously by the person he 
 employed that the king took it for a real case, and gave judgment upon 
 it, as he had done upon Nathan's parable; and, the judgment being in 
 favour of the criminal, the manager might, by that, discover his 
 sentiments so far as to venture upon the application of it, and to show 
 that it was the case of his own family, which, it is probable, she was 
 instructed not to proceed to if the king's judgment upon her case 
 should be severe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The person he employed is not named, but she is said to be <I>a 
 woman of Tekoah,</I> one whom he knew to be fit for such an 
 undertaking: and it was requisite that the scene should be laid at a 
 distance, that David might not think it strange that he had not heard 
 of the case before. It is said, She was <I>a wise woman,</I> one that 
 had a quicker wit and a readier tongue than most of her neighbours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The truth of the story would be the less suspected when it came, as was
 supposed, from the person's own mouth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The character she put on was that of a disconsolate widow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Joab knew such a one would have an easy access to the king, who was
 always ready to comfort the mourners, especially the mourning widows, 
 having himself mentioned it among the titles of God's honour that he is 
 <I>a Judge of the widows,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:5">Ps. lxviii. 5</A>.

 God's ear, no doubt, is more open to the cries of the afflicted, and
 his heart too, than that of the most merciful princes on earth can 
 be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It was a case of compassion which she had to represent to the king, 
 and a case in which she could have no relief but from the chancery in 
 the royal breast, the law (and consequently the judgment of all the 
 inferior courts) being against her. She tells the king that she had 
 buried her husband 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),--that

 she had two sons that were the support and comfort of her widowed
 state,--that these two (as young men are apt to do) fell out and 
 fought, and one of them unhappily killed the other

 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),--that,

 for her part, she was desirous to protect the manslayer (for, as
 Rebekah argued concerning her two sons, <I>Why should she be deprived 
 of them both in one day?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:45">Gen. xxvii. 45</A>),

 but though she, who was nearest of kin to the slain, was willing to let
 fall the demands of an avenger of blood, yet the other relations 
 insisted upon it that the surviving brother should be put to death 
 according to law, not out of any affection either to justice or to the 
 memory of the slain brother, but that, by destroying the heir (which 
 they had the impudence to own was the thing they aimed at), the 
 inheritance might be theirs: and thus they would cut off,

 (1.) Her comfort: "<I>They shall quench my coal,</I> deprive me of the
 only support of my old age, and put a period to all my joy in this 
 world, which is reduced to this one coal."

 (2.) Her husband's memory: "His family will be quite extinct, and they
 will <I>leave</I> him <I>neither name nor remainder,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The king promised her his favour and a protection for her son. 
 Observe how she improved the king's compassionate concessions. 

 (1.) Upon the representation of her case he promised to consider of it
 and to give orders about it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 This was encouraging, that he did not dismiss her petition with
 "<I>Currat lex--Let the law take its course;</I> blood calls for blood, 
 and let it have what it calls for:" but he will take time to enquire 
 whether the allegations of her petition be true.

 (2.) The woman was not content with this, but begged that he would
 immediately give judgment in her favour; and if the matter of fact were 
 not as she represented it, and consequently a wrong judgment given upon 
 it, let her bear the blame, and free <I>the king and his throne from 
 guilt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Yet her saying this would not acquit the king if he should pass
 sentence without taking due cognizance of the case.

 (3.) Being thus pressed, he made a further promise that she should not
 be injured nor insulted by her adversaries, but he would protect her 
 from all molestation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Magistrates ought to be the patrons of oppressed widows.

 (4.) Yet this does not content her, unless she can get her son's
 pardon, and protection for him too.  Parents are not easy, unless their 
 children be safe, safe for both worlds: "<I>Let not the avenger of 
 blood destroy my son</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 for I am undone if I lose him; as good take my life as his.
 <I>Therefore let the king remember the Lord thy God,</I>" that is, 

 [1.] "Let him confirm this merciful sentence with an oath, making
 mention of the Lord our God, by way of appeal to him, that the sentence 
 may be indisputable and irreversible; and then I shall be easy." See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:17,18">Heb. vi. 17, 18</A>.

 [2.] "Let him consider what good reason there is for this merciful
 sentence, and then he himself will be confirmed in it.  <I>Remember</I> 
 how gracious and merciful <I>the Lord thy God</I> is, how he bears long 
 with sinners and does not deal with them according to their deserts, 
 but is ready to forgive. <I>Remember</I> how <I>the Lord thy God</I> 
 spared Cain, who slew his brother, and protected him from the avengers 
 of blood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:15">Gen. iv. 15</A>.

 <I>Remember</I> how <I>the Lord thy God</I> forgave thee the blood of
 Uriah, and let the king, that has found mercy, show mercy." Note, 
 Nothing is more proper, nor more powerful, to engage us to every duty, 
 especially to all acts of mercy and kindness, than to remember the Lord 
 our God.

 (5.) This importunate widow, by pressing the matter thus closely,
 obtains at last a full pardon for her son, ratified with an oath as she 
 desired: <I>As the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son 
 fall to the earth,</I> that is, "I will undertake he shall come to no 
 damage upon this account." The Son of David has assured all that put 
 themselves under his protection that, though they should be put to 
 death for his sake, <I>not a hair of their head shall perish</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:16-18">Luke xxi. 16-18</A>),

 though they should lose for him, they shall not lose by him. Whether
 David did well this to undertake the protection of a murderer, whom the 
 cities of refuge would not protect, I cannot say. But, as the matter of 
 fact appeared to him, there was not only great reason for compassion to 
 the mother, but room enough for a favourable judgment concerning the 
 son: he had slain his brother, but he <I>hated him not in time 
 past;</I> it was upon a sudden provocation, and, for aught that 
 appeared, it might be done in his own defence. He pleaded not this 
 himself, but the judge must be of counsel for the prisoner; and 
 therefore, <I>Let mercy</I> at this time <I>rejoice against 
 judgment.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The case being thus adjudged in favour of her son, it is now time to 
 apply it to the king's son, Absalom. The mask here begins to be thrown 
 off, and another scene opened. The king is surprised, but not at all 
 displeased, to find his humble petitioner, of a sudden, become his 
 reprover, his privy-counsellor, an advocate for the prince his son, and 
 the mouth of the people, undertaking to represent to him their 
 sentiments. She begs his pardon, and his patience, for what she had 
 further to say 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and has leave to say it, the king being very well pleased with her wit
 and humour.

 (1.) She supposes Absalom's case to be, in effect, the same with that
 which she had put as her son's; and therefore, if the king would 
 protect her son, though he had slain his brother, much more ought he to 
 protect his own, and to <I>fetch home his banished,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 <I>Mutato nomine, de te fabula narratur--Change but the name, to you
 the tale belongs.</I> She names not Absalom, nor needed she to name 
 him. David longed so much after him, and had him so much in his 
 thoughts, that he was soon aware whom she meant by his banished. And in 
 those two words were two arguments which the king's tender spirit felt 
 the force of: "He is banished, and has for three years undergone the 
 disgrace and terror, and all the inconveniences, of banishment. 
 <I>Sufficient to such a one is this punishment.</I> But he is 
 <I>thy</I> banished, thy own son, a piece of thyself, thy dear son, 
 whom thou lovest." It is true, Absalom's case differed very much from 
 that which she had put. Absalom did not slay his brother upon a hasty 
 passion, but maliciously, and upon an old grudge; not in the field, 
 where there were no witnesses, but at table, before all his guests. 
 Absalom was not an only son, as hers was; David had many more, and one 
 lately born, more likely to be his successor than Absalom, for he was 
 called <I>Jedidiah,</I> because God loved him.  But David was himself 
 too well affected to the cause to be critical in his remarks upon the 
 disparity of the cases, and was more desirous than she could be to 
 bring that favourable judgment to his own son which he had given 
 concerning hers.

 (2.) She reasons upon it with the king, to persuade him to recall
 Absalom out of banishment, give him his pardon, and take him into his 
 favour again. 

 [1.] She pleads the interest which the people of Israel had in him. 
 "What is done against him is done <I>against the people of God,</I> who 
 have their eye upon him as heir of the crown, at least have their eye 
 upon the house of David in general, with which the covenant is made, 
 and which therefore they cannot tamely see the diminution and decay of 
 by the fall of so many of its branches in the flower of their age. 
 Therefore <I>the king speaks as one that is faulty,</I> for he will 
 provide that my husband's name and memory be not cut off, and yet takes 
 no care though his own be in danger, which is of more value and 
 importance than ten thousand of ours." 

 [2.] She pleads man's mortality

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>We must needs die.</I> Death is appointed for us; we cannot avoid
 the thing itself, nor defer it till another time. We are all under a 
 fatal necessity of dying; and, when we are dead, we are past recall, as 
 water spilt upon the ground; nay, even while we are alive, we are so, 
 we have lost our immortality, past retrieve. Amnon must have died, some 
 time, if Absalom had not killed him; and, if Absalom be now put to 
 death for killing him, that will not bring him to life again." This was 
 poor reasoning, and would serve against the punishment of any murderer: 
 but, it should seem, Amnon was a man little regarded by the people and 
 his death little lamented, and it was generally thought hard that so 
 dear a life as Absalom's should go for one so little valued as Amnon's. 
 
 [3.] She pleads God's mercy and his clemency towards poor guilty 
 sinners: "<I>God does not take away the soul, or life, but devises 
 means that his banished,</I> his children that have offended him, and 
 are obnoxious to his justice, as Absalom is to thine, <I>be not</I> for 
 ever <I>expelled from him,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Here are two great instances of the mercy of God to sinners, properly
 urged as reasons for showing mercy:<I>--First,</I> The patience he 
 exercises towards them. His law is broken, yet he does not immediately 
 take away the life of those that break it, does not strike sinners 
 dead, as justly he might, in the act of sin, but bears with them, and 
 waits to be gracious. God's vengeance had suffered Absalom to live; why 
 then should not David's justice suffer him?  <I>Secondly,</I> The 
 provision he has made for their restoration to his favour, that though 
 by sin they have banished themselves from him, yet they might not be 
 expelled, or cast off, for ever. Atonement might be made for sinners by 
 sacrifice. Lepers, and others ceremonially unclean, were banished, but 
 provision was made for their cleansing, that, though for a time 
 excluded, they might not be finally expelled. The state of sinners is a 
 state of banishment from God. Poor banished sinners are likely to be 
 for ever expelled from God if some course be not taken to prevent it. 
 It is against the mind of God that they should be so, for he is not 
 willing that any should perish. Infinite wisdom has devised proper 
 means to prevent it; so that it is the sinners' own fault if they be 
 cast off. This instance of God's good-will toward us all should incline 
 us to be merciful and compassionate one towards another,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:32,33">Matt. xviii. 32, 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. She concludes her address with high compliments to the king, and 
 strong expressions of her assurance that he would do what was just and 
 kind both in the one case and in the other 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>);

 for, as if the case had been real, still she pleads for herself and her
 son, yet meaning Absalom.

 (1.) She would not have troubled the king thus but that the people made
 her afraid. Understanding it of her own case, all her neighbours made 
 her apprehensive of the ruin she and her son were upon the brink of, 
 from the avengers of blood, the terror of which made her thus bold in 
 her application to the king himself. Understanding it of Absalom's 
 case, she gives the king to understand, what he did not know before, 
 that the nation was disgusted at his severity towards Absalom to such a 
 degree that she was really afraid it would occasion a general mutiny or 
 insurrection, for the preventing of which great mischief she ventured 
 to speak to the king himself. The fright she was in must excuse her 
 rudeness.

 (2.) She applied to him with a great confidence in his wisdom and
 clemency: "I said, <I>I will speak to the king</I> myself, and ask 
 nobody to speak for me; for the king will hear reason, even from so 
 mean a creature as I am, will hear the cries of the oppressed, and will 
 not suffer the poorest of his subjects to be <I>destroyed out of the 
 inheritance of God,</I>" that is, "driven out of the land of Israel, to 
 seek for shelter among the uncircumcised, as Absalom is, whose case is 
 so much the worse, that, being shut <I>out of the inheritance of 
 God,</I> he wants God's law and ordinances, which might help to bring 
 him to repentance, and is in danger of being infected with the idolatry 
 of the heathen among whom he sojourns, and of bringing home the 
 infection." To engage the king to grant her request, she expressed a 
 confident hope that his answer would be comfortable, and such as angels 
 bring (as bishop Patrick explains it), who are messengers of divine 
 mercy. What this woman says by way of compliment the prophet says by 
 way of promise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:8">Zech. xii. 8</A>),

 that, when <I>the weak shall be as David, the house of David shall be
 as the angel of the Lord.</I> "And, in order to this, <I>the Lord thy 
 God will be with thee,</I> to assist thee in this and every judgment 
 thou givest." Great expectations are great engagements, especially to 
 persons of honour, to do their utmost not to disappoint those that 
 depend upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. The hand of Joab is suspected by the king, and acknowledged by the
 woman, to be in all this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:18-20"><I>v.</I> 18-20</A>.

 (1.) The king soon suspected it.  For he could not think that such a
 woman as this would appeal to him, in a matter of such moment, of her 
 own accord; and he knew none so likely to set her on as Joab, who was a 
 politic man and a friend of Absalom.

 (2.) The woman very honestly owned it: "<I>Thy servant Joab bade
 me.</I> If it be well done, let him have the thanks; if ill, let him 
 bear the blame." Though she found it very agreeable to the king, yet 
 she would not take the praise of it to herself, but speaks the truth as 
 it was, and gives us an example to do likewise, and never to tell a lie 
 for the concealing of a well-managed scheme. <I>Dare to be true; 
 nothing can need a lie.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this
 thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.
 &nbsp; 22 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself,
 and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth
 that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that
 the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.
 &nbsp; 23 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to
 Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 24 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let
 him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and
 saw not the king's face.
 &nbsp; 25 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as
 Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the
 crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
 &nbsp; 26 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end
 that he polled <I>it:</I> because <I>the hair</I> was heavy on him,
 therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two
 hundred shekels after the king's weight.
 &nbsp; 27 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one
 daughter, whose name <I>was</I> Tamar: she was a woman of a fair
 countenance.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 

 I. Orders given for the bringing back of Absalom. The errand on which 
 the woman came to David was so agreeable, and her management of it so 
 very ingenious and surprising, that he was brought into a peculiarly 
 kind humour: <I>Go</I> (says he to Joab), <I>bring the young man 
 Absalom again,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 He was himself inclined to favour him, yet, for the honour of his
 justice, he would not do it but upon intercession made for him, which 
 may illustrate the methods of divine grace. It is true God has thought 
 of compassion towards poor sinners, not willing that any should perish, 
 yet he is reconciled to them through a Mediator, who intercedes with 
 him on their behalf, and to whom he has given these orders, <I>Go, 
 bring them again. God was in Christ reconciling the world to 
 himself,</I> and he came to this land of our banishment to bring us to 
 God. Joab, having received these orders,

 1. Returns thanks to the king for doing him the honour to employ him in
 an affair so universally grateful, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Joab took it as a kindness to himself, and (some think) as an
 indication that he would never call him to an account for the murder he 
 had been guilty of. But, if he meant so, he was mistaken, as we shall 
 find,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:5,6">1 Kings ii. 5, 6</A>.

 2. Delays not to execute David's orders; he brought Absalom to
 Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 I see not how David can be justified in suspending the execution of the
 ancient law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:6">Gen. ix. 6</A>),

 <I>Whoso sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed,</I> in
 which a righteous magistrate ought not to <I>acknowledge even his 
 brethren, or know his own children.</I> God's laws were never designed 
 to be like cobwebs, which catch the little flies, but suffer the great 
 ones to break through. God justly made Absalom, whom his foolish pity 
 spared, a scourge to him. But, though he allowed him to return to his 
 own house, he forbade him the court, and would not see him himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 He put him under this interdict,

 (1.) For his own honour, that he might not seem to countenance so great
 a criminal, nor to forgive him too easily.

 (2.) For Absalom's greater humiliation. Perhaps he had heard something
 of his conduct when Joab went to fetch him, which gave him too much 
 reason to think that he was not truly penitent; he therefore put him 
 under this mark of his displeasure, that he might be awakened to a 
 sight of his sin and to sorrow for it, and might make his peace with 
 God, upon the first notice of which, no doubt, David would be forward 
 to receive him again into his favour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Occasion taken hence to give an account of Absalom. Nothing is said 
 of his wisdom and piety. Though he was the son of such a devout father, 
 we read nothing of his devotion. Parents cannot give grace to their 
 children, though they give them ever so good an education. All that is 
 here said of him is, 

 1. That he was a very handsome man; there was not his equal in all
 Israel for beauty,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 a poor commendation for a man that had nothing else in him valuable.
 Handsome are those that handsome do.  Many a polluted deformed soul 
 dwells in a fair and comely body; witness Absalom's, that was polluted 
 with blood, and deformed with unnatural disaffection to his father and 
 prince. In his body there was no blemish, but in his mind nothing but 
 wounds and bruises. Perhaps his comeliness was one reason why his 
 father was so fond of him and protected him from justice. Those have 
 reason to fear affliction in their children who are better pleased with 
 their beauty than with their virtue. 

 2. That he had a very fine head of hair. Whether it was the length, or
 colour, or extraordinary softness of it, something there was which made 
 it very valuable and very much an ornament to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 This notice is taken of his hair, not as the hair of a Nazarite (he was
 far from that strictness), but as the hair of a beau. He let it grow 
 till it was a burden to him, and was heavy on him, nor would he cut it 
 as long as ever he could bear it; as pride feels no cold, so it feels 
 no heat, and that which feeds and gratifies it is not complained of, 
 though very uneasy. When he did poll it at certain times, for 
 ostentation he had it weighed, that it might be seen how much it 
 excelled other men's, and it weighed 200 shekels, which some reckon to 
 be three pounds and two ounces of our weight; and with the oil and 
 powder, especially if powdered (as Josephus says the fashion then was) 
 with gold-dust, bishop Patrick thinks it is not at all incredible that 
 it should weigh so much. This fine hair proved his halter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:9"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 9</A>.

 3.  That his family began to be built up. It is probable that it was a
 good while before he had a child; and then it was that, despairing of 
 having one, he set up that pillar which is mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:18"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 18</A>,

 to bear up his name; but afterwards he had three sons and one daughter,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Or perhaps these sons, while he was hatching his rebellion, were all
 cut off by the righteous hand of God, and thereupon he set up that 
 monument.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not
 the king's face.
 &nbsp; 29 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the
 king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the
 second time, he would not come.
 &nbsp; 30 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is
 near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And
 Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
 &nbsp; 31 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto <I>his</I> house, and
 said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?
 &nbsp; 32 And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying,
 Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore
 am I come from Geshur? <I>it had been</I> good for me <I>to have been</I>
 there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if
 there be <I>any</I> iniquity in me, let him kill me.
 &nbsp; 33 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had
 called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his
 face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three years Absalom had been an exile from his father-in-law, and now 
 two years a prisoner at large in his own house, and, in both, better 
 dealt with than he deserved; yet his spirit was still unhumbled, his 
 pride unmortified, and, instead of being thankful that his life is 
 spared, he thinks himself sorely wronged that he is not restored to all 
 his places at court. Had he truly repented of his sin, his distance 
 from the gaieties of the court, and his solitude and retirement in his 
 own house, especially being in Jerusalem the holy city, would have been 
 very agreeable to him. If a murderer must live, yet let him be for ever 
 a recluse. But Absalom could not bear this just and gentle 
 mortification. He longed to see the king's face, pretending it was 
 because he loved him, but really because he wanted an opportunity to 
 supplant him. He cannot do his father a mischief till he is reconciled 
 to him; this therefore is the first branch of his plot; this snake 
 cannot sting again till he be warmed in his father's bosom. He gained 
 this point, not by pretended submissions and promises of reformation, 
 but (would you think it?) by insults and injuries. 

 1. By his insolent carriage towards Joab, he brought him to mediate for
 him. Once and again he sent to Joab to come and speak with him, for he 
 durst not go to him; but Joab would not come

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 probably because Absalom had not owned the kindness he had done him in
 bringing him to Jerusalem so gratefully as he thought he should have 
 done; proud men take every service done them for a debt. One would 
 think that a person in Absalom's circumstances should have sent to Joab 
 a kindly message, and offered him a large gratuity: courtiers expect 
 noble presents. But, instead of this, he bids his servants set Joab's 
 corn-fields on fire

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 as spiteful a thing as he could do. Samson could not think of a greater
 injury to do the Philistines than this. Strange that Absalom should 
 think, by doing Joab a mischief, to prevail with him to do him a 
 kindness, or to recommend himself to the favour of his prince or people 
 by showing himself so very malicious and ill-natured, and such an enemy 
 to the public good, for the fire might spread to the corn of others.  
 Yet by this means he brings Joab to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Thus God, by afflictions, brings those to him that kept at a distance
 from him.  Absalom was obliged by the law to make restitution

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:6">Exod. xxii. 6</A>),

 yet we do not find either that he offered it or that Joab demanded it.
 Joab (it might be) thought he could not justify his refusal to go and 
 speak with him; and therefore Absalom thought he could justify his 
 taking this way to fetch him. And now Joab (perhaps frightened at the 
 surprising boldness and fury of Absalom, and apprehensive that he had 
 made an interest in the people strong enough to bear him out in doing 
 the most daring things, else he would never have done this) not only 
 puts up with this injury, but goes on his errand to the king. See what 
 some men can do by threats, and carrying things with a high hand. 

 2. By his insolent message (for I can call it no better) to the king,
 he recovered his place at court, to see the king's face, that is, to 
 become a privy counsellor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:14">Esth. i. 14</A>.

 (1.) His message was haughty and imperious, and very unbecoming either
 a son or a subject, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 He undervalued the favour that had been shown him in recalling him from
 banishment, and restoring him to his own house, and that in Jerusalem: 
 <I>Wherefore have I come from Geshur?</I> He denies his own crimes, 
 though most notorious, and will not own that there was any iniquity in 
 him, insinuating that therefore he had been wronged in the rebuke he 
 had been under. He defies the king's justice: "Let him kill me, if he 
 can find in his heart," knowing he loved him too well to do it.

 (2.) Yet with this message he carried his point, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 David's strong affection for him construed all this to be the language
 of a great respect to his father, and an earnest desire of his favour, 
 when alas!  it was far otherwise. See how easily wise and good men may 
 be imposed upon by their own children that design ill, especially when 
 they are blindly fond of them. Absalom, by the posture of his body, 
 testified his submission to his father: <I>He bowed himself on his face 
 to the ground;</I> and David, with a kiss, sealed his pardon. Did the 
 bowels of a father prevail to reconcile him to an impenitent son, and 
 shall penitent sinners question the compassion of him who is the Father 
 of mercy? If Ephraim bemoan himself, God soon bemoans him, with all the 
 kind expressions of a fatherly tenderness: <I>He is a dear son, a 
 pleasant child,</I>
