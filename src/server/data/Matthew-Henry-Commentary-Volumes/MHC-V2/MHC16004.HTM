 We left all hands at work for the building of the wall about Jerusalem.
 But such good work is not wont to be carried on without opposition; now
 here we are told what opposition was given to it, and what methods
 Nehemiah took to forward the work, notwithstanding that opposition.

 I. Their enemies reproached and ridiculed their undertaking, but their
 scoffs they answered with prayers: they heeded them not, but went on
 with their work notwithstanding, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. They formed a bloody design against them, to hinder them by force
 of arms, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:7,8,10-12">ver. 7, 8, 10-12</A>.

 To guard against this Nehemiah prayed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:9">ver. 9</A>),
 
 set guards 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:13">ver. 13</A>),
 
 and encouraged them to fight 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:14">ver. 14</A>),

 by which the design was broken 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:15">ver. 15</A>),

 and so the work was carried on with all needful precaution against a 
 surprise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:16-23">ver. 16-23</A>.

 In all this Nehemiah approved himself a man of great wisdom and
 courage, as well as great piety.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we
 builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and
 mocked the Jews.
 &nbsp; 2  And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and
 said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves?
 will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they
 revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are
 burned?
 &nbsp; 3  Now Tobiah the Ammonite <I>was</I> by him, and he said, Even that
 which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their
 stone wall.
 &nbsp; 4  Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach
 upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of
 captivity:
 &nbsp; 5  And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be
 blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked <I>thee</I> to
 anger before the builders.
 &nbsp; 6  So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together
 unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The spiteful scornful reflection which Sanballat and Tobiah cast 
 upon the Jews for their attempt to build the wall about Jerusalem. The
 country rang of it presently; intelligence was brought of it to 
 Samaria, that nest of enemies to the Jews and their prosperity; and 
 here we are told how they received the tidings. 

 1. In heart. They were very angry at the undertaking, and had <I>great
 indignation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 It vexed them that Nehemiah came to seek the welfare of the children of
 Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:10"><I>ch.</I> ii. 10</A>);

 but, when they heard of this great undertaking for their good, they
 were out of all patience. They had hitherto pleased themselves with the 
 thought that while Jerusalem was unwalled they could swallow it up and 
 make themselves masters of it when they pleased; but, if it be walled, 
 it will not only be fenced against them, but by degrees become 
 formidable to them. The strength and safety of the church are the grief 
 and vexation of its enemies. 

 2. In word. They despised it, and made it the subject of their 
 ridicule. In this they sufficiently displayed their malice; but good 
 was brought out of it; for, looking upon it as a foolish undertaking 
 that would sink under its own weight, they did not go about to obstruct 
 it till it was too late. Let us see with what pride and malice they set 
 themselves publicly to banter it.

 (1.) Sanballat speaks with scorn of the workmen: "<I>These feeble
 Jews</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 "what will they do for materials? <I>Will they revive the stones out of
 the rubbish?</I> And what mean they by being so hasty? Do they think to 
 make the walling of a city but one day's work, and to keep the feast of 
 dedication with sacrifice the next day? Poor silly people! See how
 ridiculous they make themselves!"

 (2.) Tobiah speaks with no less scorn of the work itself. He has his
 jest too, and must show his wit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Profane scoffers sharpen one another. "Sorry work," says he, "they are
 likely to make of it; they themselves will be ashamed of it: <I>If a 
 fox go up,</I> not with his subtlety, but with his weight, he <I>will 
 break down their stone wall.</I>" Many a good work has been thus looked 
 upon with contempt by the <I>proud and haughty scorners.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Nehemiah's humble and devout address to God when he heard of these 
 reflections. He had notice brought him of what they said. It is 
 probable that they themselves sent him a message to this purport, to 
 discourage him, hoping to jeer him out of his attempt; but he did not 
 answer these fools according to their folly; he did not upbraid them 
 with their weakness, but looked up to God by prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He begs of God to take notice of the indignities that were done them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and in this we are to imitate him: <I>Hear, O our God! for we are
 despised.</I> Note,

 (1.) God's people have often been a despised people, and loaded with
 contempt.

 (2.) God does, and will, hear all the slights that are put upon his 
 people, and it is their comfort that he does so and a good reason why 
 they should be as though they were deaf, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:13,15">Ps. xxxviii. 13, 15</A>.

 "Thou art our God to whom we appeal; our cause needs no more than a
 fair hearing."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He begs of God to avenge their cause and turn the reproach upon the 
 enemies themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>);

 and this was spoken rather by a spirit of prophecy than by a spirit of
 prayer, and is not to be imitated by us who are taught of Christ to 
 <I>pray for</I> those that <I>despitefully use and persecute us.</I> 
 Christ himself prayed for those that reproached him: <I>Father, forgive 
 them.</I> Nehemiah here prays, <I>Cover not their iniquity.</I> Note,

 (1.) Those that cast contempt on God's people do but prepare 
 everlasting shame for themselves.

 (2.) It is a sin from which sinners are seldom recovered. Doubtless 
 Nehemiah had reason to think the hearts of those sinners were 
 desperately hardened, so that they would never repent of it, else he 
 would not have prayed that it might <I>never be blotted out.</I> The 
 reason he gives is not, <I>They have abused us,</I> but, <I>They have 
 provoked thee,</I> and that <I>before the builders,</I> to whom, it is 
 likely, they sent a spiteful message. Note, We should be angry at the 
 malice of persecutors, not because it is abusive to us, but because it 
 is offensive to God; and on that we may ground an expectation that God 
 will appear against it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:18,22">Ps. lxxiv. 18, 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The vigour of the builders, notwithstanding these reflections, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 They made such good speed that in a little time they had run up the
 wall to half its height, for <I>the people had a mind to work;</I> 
 their hearts were upon it, and they would have it forwarded. Note,

 1.  Good work goes on well when people have a mind to it. 

 2. The reproaches of enemies should rather quicken us to our duty than
 drive us from it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  But it came to pass, <I>that</I> when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and
 the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that
 the walls of Jerusalem were made up, <I>and</I> that the breaches
 began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,
 &nbsp; 8  And conspired all of them together to come <I>and</I> to fight
 against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.
 &nbsp; 9  Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch
 against them day and night, because of them.
 &nbsp; 10  And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is
 decayed, and <I>there is</I> much rubbish; so that we are not able to
 build the wall.
 &nbsp; 11  And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see,
 till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause
 the work to cease.
 &nbsp; 12  And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them
 came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye
 shall return unto us <I>they will be upon you.</I>
 &nbsp; 13  Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, <I>and</I>
 on the higher places, I even set the people after their families
 with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
 &nbsp; 14  And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to
 the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of
 them: remember the Lord, <I>which is</I> great and terrible, and fight
 for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and
 your houses.
 &nbsp; 15  And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was
 known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that
 we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The conspiracy which the Jews' enemies formed against them, to stay 
 the building by slaying the builders. The conspirators were not only 
 Sanballat and Tobiah, but other neighbouring people whom they had drawn 
 into the plot. They flattered themselves with a fancy that the work 
 would soon stand still of itself; but, when they heard that it went on 
 a prospered, they were angry at the Jews for being so hasty to push the 
 work forward and angry at themselves for being so slow in opposing it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>They were very wroth. Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce, and
 their wrath, for it was cruel.</I> Nothing would serve but they would 
 <I>fight against Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Why, what quarrel had they with the Jews? Had they done them any wrong?
 Or did they design them any?  No, they lived peaceably by them; but it 
 was merely out of envy and malice; they hated the Jews' piety, and were 
 therefore vexed at their prosperity and sought their ruin. Observe,

 1. How unanimous they were: <I>They conspired all of them together,</I>
 though of different interests among themselves, yet one in their 
 opposition to the work of God. 

 2. How close they were; they said, "<I>They shall not know, neither 
 see,</I> till we have them at our mercy." Thus they took crafty 
 counsel, and digged deep to hide it from the Lord, and promised 
 themselves security and success from the secresy of their management.  
 
 3. How cruel they were: <I>We will come and slay them.</I> If nothing
 less than the murder of the workmen will put a stop to the work, they 
 will not stick at that; nay, it is their blood they thirst for, and 
 they are glad of any pretence to glut themselves with it. 

 4. What the design was and how confident they were of success: it was
 to <I>cause the work to cease</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and this they were confident that they should effect. The hindering of
 good work is that which bad men aim at and promise themselves; but good 
 work is God's work, and it shall prosper.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The discouragements which the builders themselves laboured under. 
 At the very time when the adversaries said, Let us <I>cause the work to 
 cease,</I> Judah said, "Let us even let it fall, for we are not able to 
 go forward with it," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They represent the labourers as tired, and the remaining difficulties,
 even of that first part of their work, the removing of the rubbish, as 
 insuperable, and therefore they think it advisable to desist for the 
 present. Can Judah, that warlike valiant tribe, sneak thus? Active 
 leading men have many times as much ado to grapple with the fears of 
 their friends as with the terrors of their enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The information that was brought to Nehemiah of the enemies' 
 designs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 There were <I>Jews that dwelt by them,</I> in the country, who, though
 they had not zeal enough to bring them to Jerusalem to help their 
 brethren in building the wall, yet, having by their situation 
 opportunity to discover the enemies' motions, had so much honesty and 
 affection to the cause as to give intelligence of them; nay, that their 
 intelligence might be the more credited, they came themselves to give 
 it, and they said it ten times, repeating it as men in earnest, and 
 under a concern, and the report was confirmed by many witnesses. The 
 intelligence they gave is expressed abruptly, and finds work for the 
 critics to make out the sense of it, which perhaps is designed to 
 intimate that they gave this intelligence as men out of breath and in 
 confusion, whose very looks would make up the deficiencies of their 
 words. I think it may be read, without supplying any thing: 
 "<I>Whatever place you turn to, they are against us,</I> so that you 
 have need to be upon your guard on all sides," Note, God has many ways 
 of bringing to light, and so bringing to nought, the devices and 
 designs of his and his church's enemies. Even the cold and feeble Jews 
 that contentedly dwell by them shall be made to serve as spies upon 
 them; nay, rather than fail, <I>a bird of the air shall carry their 
 voice.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The pious and prudent methods which Nehemiah, hereupon, took to 
 baffle the design, and to secure his work and workmen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)
 
 he <I>looked.</I>

 (1.) He looked up, engaged God for him, and put himself and his cause
 under the divine protection

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>We made our prayer unto our God.</I> That was the way of this good
 man, and should be our way; all his cares, all his griefs, all his 
 fears, he spread before God, and thereby made himself easy. This was 
 the first thing he did; before he used any means, he made his prayer to 
 God, for with him we must always begin.

 (2.) He looked about him. Having prayed, he <I>set a watch against
 them.</I> The instructions Christ has given us in our spiritual warfare 
 agree with this example,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:41">Matt. xxvi. 41</A>.

 <I>Watch and pray.</I> If we think to secure ourselves by prayer only,
 without watchfulness, we are slothful and tempt God; if by 
 watchfulness, without prayer, we are proud and slight God; and, either 
 way, we forfeit his protection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Observe, 

 (1.) How he posted the guards, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 <I>In the lower places</I> he set them <I>behind the wall,</I> that
 they might annoy the enemy over it, as a breast-work; but <I>in the 
 higher places,</I> where the wall was raised to its full height, he set 
 them upon it, that from the top of it they might throw down stones or 
 darts upon the heads of the assailants: he set them <I>after their 
 families,</I> that mutual relation might engage them to mutual 
 assistance.

 (2.) How he animated and encouraged the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He observed even the nobles and rulers themselves, as well as the rest
 of the people, to be in a great consternation upon the intelligence 
 that was brought them, and ready to conclude that they were all undone, 
 by which their hands were weakened both for work and war, and 
 therefore, he endeavours to silence their fears. "Come," says he, 
 "<I>be not afraid of them,</I> but behave yourselves valiantly, 
 considering,

 [1.] Whom you fight under. You cannot have a better captain:
 <I>Remember the Lord, who is great and terrible;</I> you think your 
 enemies <I>great and terrible,</I> but what are they in comparison with 
 God, especially in opposition to him? He is great above them to control 
 them, and will be terrible to them when he comes to reckon with them." 
 Those that with an eye of faith see the church's God to be great and 
 terrible will see the church's enemies to be mean and despicable. The 
 reigning fear of God is the best antidote against the ensnaring fear of 
 man. He that is afraid of <I>a man that shall die forgets the Lord his 
 Maker,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:12,13">Isa. lxxiv. 12, 13</A>.

 [2.] "Whom you fight for. You cannot have a better cause; you fight for
 <I>your brethren</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:8">Ps. cxxii. 8</A>),

 <I>your sons, and your daughters.</I> All that is dear to you in their
 world lies at stake; therefore <I>behave yourselves valiantly.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The happy disappointment which this gave to the enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 When they found that their design was discovered, and that the Jews
 were upon their guard, they concluded that it was to no purpose to 
 attempt any thing, but that <I>God had brought their counsel to 
 nought.</I> They knew they could not gain their point but by surprise, 
 and, if their plot was known, it was quashed. The Jews hereupon 
 <I>returned every one to his work,</I> with so much the more 
 cheerfulness because they saw plainly that God owned it and owned them 
 in the doing of it.  Note, God's care of our safety should engage and 
 encourage us to go on with vigour in our duty. As soon as ever a danger 
 is over let us <I>return to our work,</I> and trust God another 
 time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  And it came to pass from that time forth, <I>that</I> the half of
 my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held
 both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons;
 and the rulers <I>were</I> behind all the house of Judah.
 &nbsp; 17  They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens,
 with those that laded, <I>every one</I> with one of his hands wrought
 in the work, and with the other <I>hand</I> held a weapon.
 &nbsp; 18  For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his
 side, and <I>so</I> builded. And he that sounded the trumpet <I>was</I> by
 me.
 &nbsp; 19  And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the
 rest of the people, The work <I>is</I> great and large, and we are
 separated upon the wall, one far from another.
 &nbsp; 20  In what place <I>therefore</I> ye hear the sound of the trumpet,
 resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.
 &nbsp; 21  So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears
 from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.
 &nbsp; 22  Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every
 one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night
 they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.
 &nbsp; 23  So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men
 of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes,
 <I>saving that</I> every one put them off for washing.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When the builders had so far reason to think the design of the enemies 
 broken <I>as to return to their work,</I> yet they were not so secure 
 as to lay down their arms, knowing how restless and unwearied they were 
 in their attempts, and that, if one design failed, they would be 
 hatching another. Thus must we watch always against our spiritual 
 enemies, and not expect that our warfare will be accomplished till our 
 work is. See what course Nehemiah took, that the people might hold 
 themselves in a readiness, in case there should be an attack. 

 1. While one half were at work, the other half were under their arms,
 holding <I>spears, and shields, and bows,</I> not only for themselves 
 but for the labourers too, who would immediately quit their work, and 
 betake themselves to their weapons, upon the first alarm, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 It is probable that they changed services at stated hours, which would
 relieve the fatigue of both, and particularly would be an ease to the 
 <I>bearers of burdens,</I> whose <I>strength</I> had <I>decayed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 while they held the weapons, they were eased and yet not idle. Thus
 dividing their time between the trowels and the spears, they are said 
 to <I>work with one hand</I> and hold their weapons <I>with the 
 other</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 which cannot be understood literally, for the work would require both
 hands; but it intimates that they were equally employed in both. Thus 
 must we work out our salvation with the weapons of our warfare in our 
 hand; for in every duty we must expect to meet with opposition from our 
 spiritual enemies, against whom we must still be <I>fighting the good 
 fight of faith.</I> 
 
 2. Every builder had a sword by his side

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 which he could carry without hindering his labour. The word of God is
 the sword of the Spirit, which we ought to have always at hand and 
 never to seek, both in our labours and in our conflicts as Christians. 
 
 3. Care was taken both to get and give early notice of the approach of
 the enemy, in case they should endeavour to surprise them. Nehemiah 
 kept a trumpeter always by him to sound an alarm, upon the first 
 intimation of danger. The work was large, and the builders were 
 dispersed; for in all parts of the wall they were labouring at the same 
 time. Nehemiah continually walked round to oversee the work and 
 encourage the workmen, and so would have speedy intelligence if the 
 enemy made an attack, of which, by sound of trumpet, he would soon give 
 notice to all, and they must immediately repair to him with a full 
 assurance that their <I>God</I> would <I>fight for them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:18-20"><I>v.</I> 18-20</A>.
 
 When they acted as workmen, it was requisite they should be dispersed
 wherever there was work to do; but when as soldiers it was requisite 
 they should come into close order, and be found in a body. Thus should 
 the labourers in Christ's building be ready to unite against a common 
 foe. 

 4. The inhabitants of the villages were ordered to lodge within
 Jerusalem, with their servants, not only that they might be the nearer 
 to their work in the morning, but that they might be ready to help in 
 case of an attack in the night,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The strength of a city lies more in its hands than in its walls; secure 
 them, and God's blessing upon them, and be secure. 

 5. Nehemiah himself, and all his men, kept closely to their business.
 The spears were held up, with the sight of them to terrify the enemy, 
 not only from sun to sun, but from twilight to twilight every day,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Thus ought we to be always upon our guard against our spiritual
 enemies, not only (as here) while <I>it is light,</I> but when <I>it is 
 dark,</I> for they are the <I>rulers of the darkness of this world.</I> 
 Nay, so very intent was Nehemiah upon his work, and so fast did he hold 
 his servants to it, that while the heat of the business lasted neither 
 he himself nor his attendants went into bed, but every night lay and 
 slept in their clothes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 except that they shifted them now and then, either for cleanliness or
 in a case of ceremonial pollution. It was a sign that their heart was 
 upon their work when they could not find time to dress and undress, but 
 resolved they would be at all times ready for service. Good work is 
 likely to go on successfully when those that labour in it thus make a 
 business of it.</P>
