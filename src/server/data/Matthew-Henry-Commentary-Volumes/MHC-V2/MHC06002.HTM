 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have an account of the scouts that were employed to 
 bring an account to Joshua of the posture of the city of Jericho. 
 Observe here, 
 
 I. How Joshua sent them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. How Rahab received them, and protected them, and told a lie for
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:2-7">ver. 2-7</A>),

 so that they escaped out of the hands of the enemy. 

 III. The account she gave them of the present posture of Jericho, and
 the panic-fear they were struck with upon the approach of Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 IV. The bargain she made with them for the security of herself and her
 relations in the ruin she saw coming upon her city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:12-21">ver. 12-21</A>.

 V. Their safe return to Joshua, and the account they gave him of their
 expedition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:22-24">ver. 22-24</A>.

 And that which makes this story most remarkable is that Rahab, the
 person principally concerned in it, is twice celebrated in the New
 Testament as a great believer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:31">Heb. xi. 31</A>)

 and as one whose faith proved itself by good works,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy
 secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went,
 and came into a harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.
 &nbsp; 2 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there
 came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search
 out the country.
 &nbsp; 3 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth
 the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine
 house: for they be come to search out all the country.
 &nbsp; 4 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus,
 There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they <I>were:</I>
 &nbsp; 5 And it came to pass <I>about the time</I> of shutting of the gate,
 when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I
 wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.
 &nbsp; 6 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid
 them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon
 the roof.
 &nbsp; 7 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the
 fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone
 out, they shut the gate.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prudence of Joshua, in sending spies to observe this important 
 pass, which was likely to be disputed at the entrance of Israel into 
 Canaan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>).

 Go <I>view the land, even Jericho.</I> Moses had sent spies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:1-33">Num. xiii.</A>)

 Joshua himself was one of them and it proved of ill consequence. Yet 
 Joshua now sent spies, not, as the former were sent, to survey the 
 whole land, but Jericho only; not to bring the account to the whole 
 congregation, but to Joshua only, who, like a watchful general, was 
 continually projecting for the public good, and, was particularly 
 careful to take the first step well and not to stumble at the 
 threshold. It was not fit that Joshua should venture over Jordan, to 
 make his remarks <I>incognito</I>--<I>in disguise;</I> but he sends two
 men (two young men, says the LXX.), to view the land, that from
 their report he might take his measures in attacking Jericho. Observe,
 
 1. There is no remedy, but great men must see with other people's eyes,
 which makes it very necessary that they be cautious in the choice of 
 those they employ, since so much often depends upon their fidelity. 

 2. Faith in God's promise ought not to supersede but encourage our
 diligence in the use of proper means. Joshua is sure he has God with 
 him, and yet sends men before him. We do not trust God, but tempt him, 
 if our expectations slacken our endeavours. 

 3. See how ready these men were to go upon this hazardous enterprise.
 Though they put their lives in their hands yet they ventured in 
 obedience to Joshua their general, in zeal for the service of the camp, 
 and in dependence upon the power of that God who, being the keeper of 
 Israel in general, is the protector of every particular Israelite in 
 the way of his duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The providence of God directing the spies to the house of Rahab. 
 How they got over Jordan we are not told; but into Jericho they came, 
 which was about seven or eight miles from the river, and there seeking 
 for a convenient inn were directed to the house of Rahab, here called a 
 <I>harlot,</I> a woman that had formerly been of ill fame, the reproach 
 of which stuck to her name, though of late she had repented and 
 reformed. Simon the leper 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:6">Matt. xxvi. 6</A>),

 though cleansed from his leprosy, wore the reproach of it in his name 
 at long as he lived; so Rahab the harlot; and she is so called in the 
 New Testament, where both her faith and her good works are praised, to 
 teach us, 

 1. That the greatness of sin is no bar to pardoning mercy if it be
 truly repented of in time. We read of publicans and harlots entering 
 into the kingdom of the Messiah, and being welcomed to all the 
 privileged of that kingdom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:31">Matt. xxi. 31</A>.

 2. That there are many who before their conversion were very wicked
 and vile, and yet afterwards come to great eminence in faith and 
 holiness.

 3. Even those that through grace have repented of the sins of their
 youth must expect to bear the reproach of them, and when they hear of 
 their old faults must renew their repentance, and, as an evidence of 
 that, hear of them patiently. God's Israel, for aught that appears, had 
 but one friend, but one well-wisher in all Jericho, and that was Rahab 
 a harlot. God has often served his own purposes and his church's 
 interests by men of different morals. Had these scouts gone to any 
 other house than this they would certainly have been betrayed and put 
 to death without mercy. But God knew where they had a friend that
 would be true to them, though they did not, and directed them thither.
 Thus that which seems to us most contingent and accidental is often 
 over-ruled by the divine providence to serve its great ends. And those 
 that faithfully acknowledge God in their ways he will <I>guide with his 
 eye.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:19,26">Jer. xxxvi. 19, 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The piety of Rahab in receiving and protecting these Israelites. 
 Those that keep public-houses entertain all comers, and think 
 themselves obliged to be civil to their guests. But Rahab showed her 
 guests more than common civility, and went upon an uncommon principle 
 in what she did; it was <I>by faith</I> that she received those with 
 peace against whom her king and country had denounced war, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:31">Heb. xi. 31</A>.
 
 1. She bade them welcome to her house; they lodged there, though it
 appears by what she said to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 she knew both whence they came and what their business was. 

 2. Perceiving that they were observed coming into the city, and that
 umbrage was taken at it, she hid them upon the roof of the house, which 
 was flat, and covered them with stalks of flax

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 so that, if the officers should come thither to search for them, there 
 they might lie undiscovered. By these stalks of flax, which she herself 
 had lain in order upon the roof to dry in the sun, in order to the 
 beating of it and making it ready for the wheel, it appears she had one 
 of the good characters of the virtuous woman, however in others of them 
 she might be deficient, that she <I>sought wool and flax, and wrought 
 willingly with her hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:13">Prov. xxxi. 13</A>.

 From this instance of her honest industry one would hope that, whatever
 she had been formerly, she was not now a harlot.

 3. When she was examined concerning them, she denied they were in her
 house, turned off the officers that had a warrant to search for them 
 with a sham, and so secured them. No marvel that the king of Jericho 
 sent to enquire after them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>);

 he had cause to fear when the enemy was at his door, and his fear made 
 him suspicious and jealous of all strangers. He had reason to demand 
 from Rahab that she should <I>bring forth the men</I> to be dealt with 
 as spies; but Rahab not only disowned that she knew them, or knew where 
 they were, but, that no further search might be made for them in the 
 city, told the pursuers they had gone away again and in all probability 
 might be overtaken, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.
 
 Now,

 (1.) We are sure this was a good work: it is canonized by the apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:25">James ii. 25</A>),

 where she is said to be <I>justified by works,</I> and this is 
 specified, that <I>she received the messengers, and sent them out 
 another way,</I> and she did it by faith, such a faith as set her above 
 the fear of man, even of the wrath of the king. She believed, upon the 
 report she had heard of the wonders wrought for Israel, that their God 
 was the only true God, and that therefore their declared design upon 
 Canaan would undoubtedly take effect and in this faith she sided with 
 them, protected them, and courted their favour. Had she said, "I 
 believe God is yours and Canaan yours, but I dare not show you any 
 kindness," her faith had been dead and inactive, and would not have 
 justified her. But by this it appeared to be both alive and lively, 
 that she exposed herself to the utmost peril, even of life, in 
 obedience to her faith. Note, Those only are true believers that can 
 find in their hearts to venture for God; and those that by faith take 
 the Lord for their God take his people for their people, and cast in 
 their lot among them. Those that have God for their refuge and 
 hiding-place must testify their gratitude by their readiness to shelter 
 his people when there is occasion. <I>Let my outcasts dwell with 
 thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:3,4">Isa. xvi. 3, 4</A>.

 And we must be glad of an opportunity of testifying the sincerity and
 zeal of our love to God by hazardous services to his church and kingdom 
 among men. But,

 (2.) There is that in it which it is not easy to justify, and yet it 
 must be justified, or else it could not be so good a work as to justify 
 her.

 [1.] It is plain that she betrayed her country by harbouring the 
 enemies of it, and aiding those that were designing its destruction, 
 which could not consist with her allegiance to her prince and her 
 affection and duty to the community she was a member of. But that which 
 justifies her in this is that <I>she knew the Lord had given Israel 
 this land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 knew it by the incontestable miracles God had wrought for them, which 
 confirmed that grant; and her obligations to God were higher than her 
 obligations to any other. If she knew <I>God had given them this 
 land,</I> it would have been a sin to join with those that hindered 
 them from possessing it. But, since no such grant of any land to any 
 people can now be proved, this will by no means justify any such 
 treacherous practices against the public welfare.

 [2.] It is plain that she deceived the officers that examined her with 
 an untruth--That she knew not whence the men were, that they had gone
 out, that she knew not whither they had gone. What shall we say to 
 this? If she had either told the truth or been silent, she would have 
 betrayed the spies, and this would certainly have been a great sin; and 
 it does not appear that she had any other way of concealing them that 
 by this ironical direction to the officers to pursue them another way, 
 which if they would suffer themselves to be deceived by, let them be 
 deceived. None are bound to accuse themselves, or their friends, of
 that which, though enquired after as a crime, they know to be a virtue. 
 This case was altogether extraordinary, and therefore cannot be drawn 
 into a precedent; and that my be justified here which would be by no 
 means lawful in a common case. Rahab knew, by what was already done on 
 the other side Jordan, that no mercy was to be shown to the Canaanites, 
 and thence inferred that, if mercy was not owing them, truth was not; 
 those that might be destroyed might be deceived. Yet divines generally 
 conceive that it was a sin, which however admitted of this extenuation, 
 that being a Canaanite she was not better taught the evil of lying; but 
 God accepted her faith and pardoned her infirmity. However it was in 
 this case, we are sure it is our duty to speak every man the truth to 
 his neighbour, to dread and detest lying, and never to <I>do evil, 
 that</I> evil, <I>that good may come of it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:8">Rom. iii. 8</A>.

 But God accepts what is sincerely and honestly intended, though there
 be a mixture of frailty and folly in it, and is not extreme to mark 
 what we do amiss. Some suggest that what she said might possibly be 
 true of some other men.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon
 the roof;
 &nbsp; 9 And she said unto the men, I know that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath given
 you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that
 all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.
 &nbsp; 10 For we have heard how the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> dried up the water of the Red
 sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the
 two kings of the Amorites, that <I>were</I> on the other side Jordan,
 Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
 &nbsp; 11 And as soon as we had heard <I>these things,</I> our hearts did
 melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man,
 because of you: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, he <I>is</I> God in heaven
 above, and in earth beneath.
 &nbsp; 12 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, since
 I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto
 my father's house, and give me a true token:
 &nbsp; 13 And <I>that</I> ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and
 my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver
 our lives from death.
 &nbsp; 14 And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter
 not this our business. And it shall be, when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath given
 us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.
 &nbsp; 15 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her
 house <I>was</I> upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
 &nbsp; 16 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the
 pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until
 the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.
 &nbsp; 17 And the men said unto her, We <I>will be</I> blameless of this
 thine oath which thou hast made us swear.
 &nbsp; 18 Behold, <I>when</I> we come into the land, thou shalt bind this
 line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down
 by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy
 brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.
 &nbsp; 19 And it shall be, <I>that</I> whosoever shall go out of the doors
 of thy house into the street, his blood <I>shall be</I> upon his head,
 and we <I>will be</I> guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in
 the house, his blood <I>shall be</I> on our head, if <I>any</I> hand be
 upon him.
 &nbsp; 20 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of
 thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.
 &nbsp; 21 And she said, According unto your words, so <I>be</I> it. And she
 sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line
 in the window.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The matter is here settled between Rahab and the spies respecting the 
 service she was now to do for them, and the favour they were afterwards 
 to show to her. She secures them on condition that they should secure 
 her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. She gives them, and by them sends to Joshua and Israel, all the 
 encouragement that could be desired to make their intended descent upon 
 Canaan. This was what they came for, and it was worth coming for.
 Having got clear of the officers, she comes up to them to the <I>roof 
 of the house</I> where they lay hid, finds them perhaps somewhat 
 dismayed at the peril they apprehended themselves in from the officers, 
 and scarcely recovered from the fright, but has that to say to them 
 which will give them abundant satisfaction. 

 1. She lets them know that the report of the great things God had done
 for them had come to Jericho

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 not only that they had an account of their late victories obtained over 
 the Amorites in the neighbouring country, on the other side of the 
 river, but that their miraculous deliverance out of Egypt, and passage 
 through the Red Sea, a great way off, and forty years ago, were 
 remembered and talked of afresh in Jericho, to the amazement of every 
 body. Thus <I>this</I> Joshua and his fellows were <I>men wondered 
 at,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:8">Zech. iii. 8</A>.

 See how God <I>makes his wonderful works to be remembered</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:4">Ps. cxi. 4</A>),

 so that <I>men shall speak of the might of his terrible acts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:6">Ps. cxlv. 6</A>.

 2. She tells them what impressions the tidings of these things had made
 upon the Canaanites: Your <I>terror has fallen upon us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 <I>our hearts did melt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 If she kept a public house, this would give her an opportunity of
 understanding the sense of various companies and of travellers from 
 other parts of the country, so that they could not know this any way 
 better than by her information; and it would be of great use to Joshua 
 and Israel to know it; it would put courage into the most cowardly 
 Israelite to hear how their enemies were dispirited, and it was easy to 
 conclude that those who now fainted before them would infallibly fall 
 before them, especially because it was the accomplishment of a promise 
 God had made them, that he would <I>lay the fear and dread of them upon 
 all this land</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+11:25">Deut. xi. 25</A>),

 and so it would be an earnest of the accomplishment of all the other 
 promises God had made to them. Let not the stout man glory in his 
 courage, any more than the strong man in his strength; for God can 
 weaken both mind and body. Let not God's Israel be afraid of their most 
 powerful enemies; for their God can, when he pleases, make their most 
 powerful enemies afraid of them. Let none think to harden their hearts 
 against God and prosper; for he that made man's soul can at any time 
 make the sword of his terrors approach to it. 

 3. She hereupon makes profession of her faith in God and his promise;
 and perhaps <I>there was not found so great faith</I> (all things 
 considered), <I>no, not in Israel,</I> as in this woman of Canaan.

 (1.) who believes God's power and dominion over all the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 "Jehovah your God, whom you worship and call upon, is so far above all 
 gods that he is the only true God; for <I>he is God in heaven above and 
 in earth beneath,</I> and is served by all the hosts of both." A vast 
 distance there is between heaven and earth, yet both are equally under 
 the inspection and government of the great Jehovah. Heaven is not
 above his power, nor is earth below his cognizance. 

 (2.) She believes his promise to his people Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>I know that the Lord hath given you the land.</I> The king of 
 Jericho had heard as much as she had of the great things God had done 
 for Israel, yet he cannot infer thence that the Lord had given them 
 this land, but resolves to hold it out against them to the last 
 extremity; for the most powerful means of conviction will not of 
 themselves attain the end without divine grace, and by that grace Rahab 
 the harlot, who had only heard of the wonders God had wrought, speaks 
 with more assurance of the truth of the promise made to the fathers 
 than all the elders of Israel had done who were eye-witnesses of those 
 wonders, many of whom perished through unbelief of this promise.
 <I>Blessed are those that have not seen, and yet have believed;</I> so 
 Rahab did. <I>O woman, great is thy faith!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. She engaged them to take her and her relations under their 
 protection, that they might not perish in the destruction of Jericho, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 
 Now,

 1. It was an evidence of the sincerity and strength of her faith
 concerning the approaching revolution in her country that she was so 
 solicitous to make an interest for herself with the Israelites, and 
 courted their kindness. She foresaw the conquest of her country, and in 
 the belief of that bespoke in time the favour of the conquerors. Thus
 Noah, being <I>moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his 
 house, and the condemning of the world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:7">Heb. xi. 7</A>.

 Those who truly believe the divine revelation concerning the ruin of
 sinners, and the grant of the heavenly land to God's Israel, will give 
 diligence to flee from the wrath to come, and to lay hold of eternal 
 life, by joining themselves to God and to his people.

 2. The provision she made for the safety of her relations, as well as
 for her own, is a laudable instance of natural affection, and an 
 intimation to us in like manner to do all we can for the salvation of 
 the souls of those that are dear to us, and, with ourselves, to bring 
 them, if possible, into the bond of the covenant. No mention is made of 
 her husband and children, but only her parents, and brothers, and 
 sisters, for whom, though she was herself a housekeeper, she retained a 
 due concern. 

 3. Her request that they would swear unto her by Jehovah is an instance
 of her acquaintance with the only true God, and her faith in him and 
 devotion towards him, one act of which is religiously to <I>swear by 
 his name.</I> 

 4. Her petition is very just and reasonable, that, since she had
 protected them, they should protect her, and since her kindness to them 
 extended to their people, for whom they were now negotiating, their 
 kindness to her should take in all hers. It was the least they could do 
 for one that had saved their lives with the hazard of her own. Note,
 Those that show mercy may expect to find mercy. Observe, She does not 
 demand any preferment by way of reward for her kindness to them, though 
 they lay so much at her mercy that she might have made her own terms, 
 but only indents for her Life, which in a general destruction would be 
 a singular favour. Thus God promised Ebed-Melech, in recompence for his 
 kindness to Jeremiah, that in the worst of times he should have <I>his 
 life for a prey,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+39:18">Jer. xxxix. 18</A>.

 Yet this Rahab was afterwards advanced to be a princess in Israel, the
 wife of Salmon, and one of the ancestors of Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:5">Matt. i. 5</A>.

 Those that faithfully serve Christ and suffer for him he will not only
 protect, but prefer, and will do for them <I>more than they are able to 
 ask or think.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They solemnly engaged for her preservation in the common 
 destruction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>Our life for yours.</I> We will take as much care of your lives as 
 of our own, and would as soon hurt ourselves as any of you." Nay, they 
 imprecate God's judgments on themselves if they should violate their 
 promise to her. She had pawned her life for theirs, and now they in 
 requital pawn their lives for hers, and (as public persons) with them 
 they pawn the public faith and the credit of their nation, for they 
 plainly interest all Israel in the engagement in those words, <I>When 
 the Lord has given us the land,</I> meaning not themselves only, but 
 the people whose agents they were. No doubt they knew themselves 
 sufficiently authorized to treat with Rahab concerning this matter, and 
 were confident that Joshua would ratify what they did, else they had 
 not dealt honestly; the general law that they should make no covenant 
 with the Canaanites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:2">Deut. vii. 2</A>)

 did not forbid them to take under their protection a particular person, 
 that had heartily come into their interests and had done them real 
 kindnesses. The law of gratitude is one of the laws of nature. Now 
 observe here, 

 1. The promises they made her. In general, "<I>We will deal kindly and
 truly with thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 We will not only be kind in promising now, but true in performing what
 we promise; and not only true in performing just what we promise, but 
 kind in out-doing thy demands and expectations." The goodness of God is 
 often expressed by his kindness and truth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+117:2">Ps. cxvii. 2</A>),

 and in both these we must be followers of him. In particular, "<I>If a 
 hand be upon any in the house with thee,</I> his <I>blood shall be on 
 our head,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 If hurt come through our carelessness to those whom we are obliged to
 protect, we thereby contract guilt, and blood will be found a heavy 
 load.

 2. The provisos and limitations of their promises. Though they were in
 haste, and it may be in some confusion, yet we find them very cautious 
 in settling this agreement and the terms of it, not to bind themselves 
 to more than was fit for them to perform. Note, Covenants must be made
 with care, and we must swear in judgment, lest we find ourselves 
 perplexed and entangled when it is too late <I>after vows to make 
 enquiry.</I> Those that will be conscientious in keeping their promises 
 will be cautious in making them, and perhaps may insert conditions 
 which others may think frivolous. Their promise is here accompanied 
 with three provisos, and they were necessary ones. They will protect
 Rahab, and all her relations always, provided,

 (1.) That she tie the scarlet cord with which she was now about to let 
 them down in the window of her house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 This was to be a mark upon the house, which the spies would take care
 to give notice of to the camp of Israel, that no soldier, how hot and 
 eager soever he was in military executions, might offer any violence to 
 the house that was thus distinguished. This was like the blood 
 sprinkled upon the door-post, which secured the first-born from the 
 destroying angel, and, being of the same colour, some allude to this 
 also to represent the safety of believers under the protection of the 
 blood of Christ sprinkled on the conscience. The same cord that she 
 made use of for the preservation of these Israelites was to be made use 
 of for her preservation. What we serve and honour God with we may 
 expect he will bless and make comfortable to us.

 (2.) That she should have all those whose safety she had desired in the 
 house with her and keep them there, and that, at the time of taking the 
 town, none of them should dare to stir out of doors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 This was a <I>necessary</I> proviso, for Rahab's kindred could not be
 distinguished any other way than by being in her distinguished house; 
 should they mingle with their neighbours, there was no remedy, but the 
 sword would devour <I>one as well as another.</I> It was a 
 <I>reasonable</I> proviso that, since they were saved purely for 
 Rahab's sake, her house should have the honour of being their castle, 
 and that, if they would not <I>perish with those that believed not,</I> 
 they should thus far believe the certainty and severity of the ruin 
 coming upon their city as to retire into a place made safe by promise, 
 as Noah into the ark and Lot into Zoar, and should <I>save themselves 
 from this untoward generation,</I> by separating from them. It was 
 likewise a <I>significant</I> proviso, intimating to us that those who 
 are added to the church that they may be saved must keep close to the 
 society of the faithful, and, having <I>escaped the corruption that is 
 in the world through lust,</I> must take heed of being again entangled 
 therein.

 (3.) That she should keep counsel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:14,20"><I>v.</I> 14, 20</A>):

 <I>If thou utter this our business,</I> that is, "If thou betray us 
 when we are gone, or if thou make this agreement public, so as that 
 others tie scarlet lines in their windows and so confound us, then we 
 will be clear of thy oath." Those are unworthy of <I>the secret of the 
 Lord</I> that know now how to keep it to themselves when there is 
 occasion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. She then took effectual care to secure her new friends, and <I>sent 
 them out another way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:25">James ii. 25</A>.

 Having fully understood the bargain they made with her, and consented
 to it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 she then <I>let them down by a cord</I> over the city wall 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 the situation of her house befriending them herein: thus Paul made his 
 escape out of Damascus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:33">2 Cor. xi. 33</A>.

 She also directed them which way to go for their own safety, being
 better acquainted with the country than they were, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 She directs them to leave the high road, and abscond in the mountains
 till the pursuers returned, for till then they could not safely venture 
 over Jordan. Those that are in the way of God and their duty may expect
 that Providence will protect them, but this will not excuse them from 
 taking all prudent methods for their own safety. God will keep us, but 
 then we must not wilfully expose ourselves. Providence must be trusted, 
 but not tempted. Calvin thinks that their charge to Rahab to keep this 
 matter secret, and not to utter it, was intended for her safety, lest 
 she, boasting of her security from the sword of Israel, should, before 
 they came to protect her, fall into the hands of the king of Jericho 
 and be put to death for treason: thus do they prudently advise her for 
 her safety, as she advised them for theirs. And it is good advice, 
 which we should at any time be thankful for, to <I>take heed to 
 ourselves.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there
 three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers
 sought <I>them</I> throughout all the way, but found <I>them</I> not.
 &nbsp; 23 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain,
 and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him
 all <I>things</I> that befell them:
 &nbsp; 24 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath delivered
 into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the
 country do faint because of us.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the safe return of the spies Joshua had sent, and the 
 great encouragement they brought with them to Israel to proceed in 
 their descent upon Canaan. Had they been disposed to discourage the 
 people, as the evil spies did that Moses sent, they might have told 
 them what they had observed of the height and strength of the walls of 
 Jericho, and the extraordinary vigilance of the king of Jericho, and 
 how narrowly they escaped out of his hands; but they were of another 
 spirit, and, depending themselves upon the divine promise, they 
 animated Joshua likewise. 

 1. Their return in safety was itself an encouragement to Joshua, and a
 token for good. That God provided for them so good a friend as Rahab
 was in an enemy's country, and that notwithstanding the rage of the 
 king of Jericho and the eagerness of the pursuers they had come back in 
 peace, was such an instance of God's great care concerning them for 
 Israel's sake as might assure the people of the divine guidance and 
 care they were under, which should undoubtedly make the progress of 
 their arms glorious. He that so wonderfully protected their scouts 
 would preserve their men of war, and cover their heads in the day of 
 battle. 
 
 2. The report they brought was much more encouraging

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 "<I>All the inhabitants of the country,</I> though resolved to stand it 
 out, yet <I>do faint because of us,</I> they have neither wisdom to 
 yield nor courage to fight," whence they conclude, "<I>Truly the Lord 
 has delivered into our hands all the land,</I> it is all our own; we 
 have nothing to do, in effect, but to take possession." Sinners' 
 frights are sometimes sure presages of their fall. If we resist our 
 spiritual enemies they will flee before us, which will encourage us to 
 hope that in due time we shall be more than conquerors.</P>
