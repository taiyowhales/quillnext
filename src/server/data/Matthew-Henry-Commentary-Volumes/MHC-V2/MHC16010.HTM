 We have in this chapter a particular account of the covenant which in 
 the close of the foregoing chapter was resolved upon; they struck while 
 the iron was not, and immediately put that good resolve in execution, 
 when they were in a good frame, lest, if it should be delayed, it might 
 be dropped. Here we have, 

 I. The names of those that set their hands and seals to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:1-27">ver. 1-27</A>.
 
 II. An account of those who signified their consent and concurrence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:28,29">ver. 28, 29</A>.

 III. The covenant itself, and the articles of it in general, that they
 would "keep God's commandments"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:29">ver. 29</A>);

 in particular, that they would not marry with the heathen

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:30">ver. 30</A>),

 nor profane the sabbath, nor be rigorous with their debtors

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:31">ver. 31</A>),

 and that they would carefully pay their church-dues, for the
 maintenance of the temple service, which they promise faithfully to 
 adhere to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:32-39">ver.  32-39</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now those that sealed <I>were,</I> Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the
 son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,

 &nbsp; 9  And the Levites: both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of
 the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;
 &nbsp; 10  And their brethren, Shebaniah, Hodijah, Kelita, Pelaiah,
 Hanan,
 &nbsp; 11  Micha, Rehob, Hashabiah,

 &nbsp; 28  And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the
 porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and all they that had
 separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of
 God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one
 having knowledge, and having understanding;
 &nbsp; 29  They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into
 a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given
 by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the
 commandments of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our Lord, and his judgments and his
 statutes;
 &nbsp; 30  And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of
 the land, nor take their daughters for our sons:
 &nbsp; 31  And <I>if</I> the people of the land bring ware or any victuals
 on the sabbath day to sell, <I>that</I> we would not buy it of them on
 the sabbath, or on the holy day: and <I>that</I> we would leave the
 seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When Israel was first brought into covenant with God it was done by
 sacrifice and the sprinkling of blood,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:1-8">Exod. xxiv.</A>

 But here it was done by the more natural and common way of sealing and
 subscribing the written articles of the covenant, which bound them to
 no more than was already their duty. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The names of those public persons who, as the representatives and
 heads of the congregation, set their hands and seals to this covenant, 
 because it would have been an endless piece of work for every 
 particular person to do it; and, if these leading men did their part in 
 pursuance of this covenant, their example would have a good influence 
 upon all the people. Now observe, 

 1. Nehemiah, who was the governor, signed first, to show his
 forwardness in this work and to set others a good example,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Those that are above others in dignity and power should go before them
 in the way of God. 

 2. Next to him subscribed twenty-two priests, among whom I wonder we do 
 not find Ezra, who was an active man in the solemnity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:2"><I>ch.</I> viii. 2</A>)

 which was but the first day of the same month, and therefore we cannot
 think he was absent; but he, having before done his part as a scribe, 
 now left it to others to do theirs. 

 3. Next to the priests, seventeen Levites subscribed this covenant,
 among whom we find all or most of those who were the mouth of the 
 congregation in prayer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:4,5"><I>ch.</I> ix. 4, 5</A>.

 This showed that they themselves were affected with what they had said,
 and would not bind those burdens on others which they themselves 
 declined to touch. Those that lead in prayer should lead in every other 
 good work. 

 4. Next to the Levites, forty-four of the chief of the people gave it
 under their hands for themselves and all the rest, chiefly those whom 
 they had influence upon, that they would keep God's commandments. Their 
 names are left upon record here, to their honour, as men that were 
 forward and active in reviving and endeavouring to perpetuate religion 
 in their country. The memory of such shall be blessed. It is observable 
 that most of those who were mentioned,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:8-63"><I>ch.</I> vii. 8</A>,

 &c., as heads of houses or
 clans, are here mentioned among the first of the chief of the people 
 that subscribed, whoever was the present head bearing the name of him 
 that was head when they came out of Babylon, and these were fittest to 
 subscribe for all those of their father's house. Here are <I>Parosh, 
 Pahathmoab, Elam, Zatthu, Bani</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>Azgad, Bebai, Bigvai, Adin, Ater, Hashum, Bezai, Hariph,
 Anathoth,</I> and some others in the following verses, that are all 
 found in that catalogue. Those that have interest must use it for 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The concurrence of the rest of the people with them, and the rest 
 of the priests and Levites, who signified their consent to what their 
 chiefs did. With them joined, 

 1. Their wives and children; for they had transgressed, and they must
 reform.  Every one that had knowledge and understanding must covenant 
 with God. As soon as young people grow up to be capable of 
 distinguishing between good and evil, and of acting intelligently, they 
 ought to make it their own act and deed to <I>join themselves to the 
 Lord.</I> 

 2. The proselytes of other nations, <I>all that had separated 
 themselves from the people of the lands,</I> their gods and their 
 worship, <I>unto the law of God,</I> and the observance of that law.  
 See what conversion it; it is separating ourselves from the course and 
 custom of this world, and devoting ourselves to the conduce of the word 
 of God. And, as there is one law, so there is one covenant, one 
 baptism, for the stranger and for him that is born in the land. Observe 
 how the concurrence of the people is expressed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 (1.) <I>They clave to their brethren</I> one and all. Here those whom
 the court blessed the country blessed too! The commonalty agreed with 
 their nobles in this good work. Great men never look so great as when 
 they encourage religion, and are examples of it; and they would by 
 that, as much as any thing, secure an interest in the most valuable of 
 their inferiors. Let but the nobles cordially espouse religious causes, 
 and perhaps they will find people cleave to them therein closer than 
 they can imagine. Observe, Their nobles are called their 
 <I>brethren;</I> for, in the things of God, rich and poor, high and 
 low, meet together. 

 (2.) They <I>entered into a curse and an oath.</I> As the nobles
 confirmed the covenant with their hands and seals, so the people with a 
 curse and an oath, solemnly appealing to God concerning their 
 sincerity, and imprecating his just revenge if they dealt deceitfully. 
 Every oath has in it a conditional curse upon the soul, which makes it 
 a strong bond upon the soul; for our own tongues, if false and lying 
 tongues, will fall, and fall heavily, upon ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The general purport of this covenant. They laid upon themselves no 
 other burden than this necessary thing, which they were already obliged 
 to by all other engagements of duty, interest, and gratitude--<I>to walk
 in God's law, and to do all his commandments,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Thus David swore that he would <I>keep God's righteous judgments,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:106">Ps. cxix. 106</A>.

 Our own covenant binds us to this, if not more strongly, yet more
 sensibly, than we were before bound, and therefore we must not think it 
 needless thus to bind ourselves. Observe, When we bind ourselves to do 
 the commandments of God we bind ourselves to do <I>all</I> his 
 commandments, and therein to have an eye to him as the Lord and our 
 Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Some of the particular articles of this covenant, such as were 
 adapted to their present temptations. 

 1. That they would not intermarry with the heathen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 Many of them had been guilty of this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:1">Ezra ix. 1</A>.

 In our covenants with God we should engage particularly against those
 sins that we have been most frequently overtaken in and damaged by. 
 Those that resolve to <I>keep the commandments of God must say to evil 
 doers, Depart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:115">Ps. cxix. 115</A>.

 2. That they would keep no markets on the sabbath day, or any other day 
 of which the law had said, <I>You shall do no work therein.</I> They 
 would not only not sell goods themselves for gain on that day, but they 
 would not encourage the heathen to sell on that day by buying of them, 
 no not victuals, under pretence of necessity; but would buy in their 
 provisions for their families the day before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Note, Those that covenant to keep all God's commandments must
 particularly covenant to keep sabbaths well; for the profanation of 
 them is an inlet to other instances of profaneness. The sabbath is a 
 market day for our souls, but not for our bodies. 

 3. That they would not be severe in exacting their debts, but would
 observe the seventh year as a year of release, according to the law,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 
 In this matter they had been faulty
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:1-19"><I>ch.</I> v.</A>),

 and here therefore they promise to reform. This was the acceptable
 fast, to <I>undo the heavy burden,</I> and to <I>let the oppressed go 
 free,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:6">Isa. lviii. 6</A>.

 It was in the close of the day of expiation that the jubilee trumpet
 sounded. It was for the neglect of observing the seventh year as a year 
 of rest for the land that God had made it enjoy its sabbaths seventy 
 years

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:35">Lev. xxvi. 35</A>),

 and therefore they covenanted to observe that law. Those are stubborn
 children indeed that will not amend the fault for which they have been 
 particularly corrected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>32  Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly
 with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of
 our God;
 &nbsp; 33  For the showbread, and for the continual meat offering, and
 for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new
 moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy <I>things,</I> and for the
 sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and <I>for</I> all the
 work of the house of our God.
 &nbsp; 34  And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the
 people, for the wood offering, to bring <I>it</I> into the house of
 our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year
 by year, to burn upon the altar of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God, as <I>it is</I>
 written in the law:
 &nbsp; 35  And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the
 firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the
 house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 36  Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as <I>it
 is</I> written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of
 our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests
 that minister in the house of our God:
 &nbsp; 37  And <I>that</I> we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and
 our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and
 of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our
 God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the same
 Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.
 &nbsp; 38  And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites,
 when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the
 tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers,
 into the treasure house.
 &nbsp; 39  For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall
 bring the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil,
 unto the chambers, where <I>are</I> the vessels of the sanctuary, and
 the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers: and
 we will not forsake the house of our God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Having covenanted against the sins they had been guilty of, they 
 proceed in obliging themselves to revive and observe the duties they 
 had neglected. We must not only <I>cease to do evil,</I> but <I>learn 
 to do well.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It was resolved, in general, that the temple service should be 
 carefully kept up, that the work of the house of their God should be 
 done in its season, according to the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Let not any people expect the blessing of God unless they make
 conscience of observing his ordinances and keeping up the public 
 worship of him. Then it is likely to go well with our houses when care 
 is taken that the work of God's house go on well. It was likewise 
 resolved that they would never <I>forsake the house of their God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>),

 as they and their fathers had done, would not forsake it for the house
 of any other god, or for the high places, as idolaters did, nor forsake 
 it for their farms and merchandises, as those did that were atheistical 
 and profane.  Those that forsake the worship of God forsake God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It was resolved, in pursuance of this, that they would liberally 
 maintain the temple service, and not starve it. The priests were ready 
 to do their part in all the work of God's house, if the people would do 
 theirs, which was to find them with materials to work upon. Now here it 
 was agreed and concluded, 

 1. That a stock should be raised for the furnishing of God's table and
 altar plentifully. Formerly there were treasures in the house of the 
 Lord for this purpose, but these were gone, and there was no settled 
 fund to supply the want of them. It was a constant charge to provide 
 show-bread for the table, two lambs for the daily offerings, four for 
 the sabbaths, and more, and more costly, sacrifices for other 
 festivals, occasional sin-offerings, and meat-offerings, and 
 drink-offerings for them all. They had no rich king to provide these, 
 as Hezekiah did; the priests could not afford to provide them, their 
 maintenance was so small; the people therefore agreed to contribute 
 yearly, every one of them, the third part of a shekel, about ten pence 
 a-piece for the bearing of this expense. When every one will act, and 
 every one will give, though but little, towards a good work, the whole 
 amount will be considerable. The tirshatha did not impose this tax, but 
 the people made it an ordinance for themselves, and charged themselves 
 with it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.

 2. That particular care should be taken to provide wood for the altar, 
 to keep the fire always burning upon it, and wherewith to boil the 
 peace-offerings. All of them, priests and Levites as well as people, 
 agreed to bring in their quota, and cast lots in what order they should 
 bring it in, which family first and which next, that there might be a 
 constant supply, and not a scarcity at one time and an overplus at 
 another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Thus they provided the fire and the wood, as well as the lambs for the
 burnt-offerings.

 3. That all those things which the divine law had appointed for the
 maintenance of the priests and Levites should be duly paid in, for 
 their encouragement to mind their business, and that they might not be 
 under any temptation to neglect it for the making of necessary 
 provision for their families.  Then the work of the house of God is 
 likely to go on when those that serve at the altar live, and live 
 comfortably, upon the altar.  First-fruits and tenths were then the 
 principal branches of the ministers' revenues; and they here resolved,

 (1.) To bring in the first-fruits justly, the first-fruits of their
 ground and trees

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:19,Le+19:23">Exod. xxiii. 19; Lev. xix. 23</A>),

 the first-born of their children (even the money wherewith they were to
 be redeemed) and of their cattle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:2,11,12">Exod. xiii. 2, 11, 12</A>

 (this was given to the priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:15,16">Num. xviii. 15, 16</A>),

 also the first-fruits of their dough

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+15:21">Num. xv. 21</A>),

 concerning which there is a particular order given in the prophecy
 concerning the second temple,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+44:30">Ezek. xliv. 30</A>.

 (2.) To bring in their tenths likewise, which were due to the Levites
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 and a tenth out of those tenths to the priest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.
 
 This was the law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:21-28">Num. xviii. 21-28</A>);

 but these dues had been withheld, in consequence of which God, by the
 prophet, charges them with <I>robbing him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:8,9">Mal. iii. 8, 9</A>),

 at the same time encouraging them to be more just to him and his
 receivers, with a promise that, if they brought the <I>tithes into the 
 store-house,</I> he would <I>pour out blessings upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 This therefore they resolved to do, that there might be meat in God's
 house, and plenty in the store-chambers of the temple, where the 
 vessels of the sanctuary were, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 "We will do it (say they) <I>in all the cities of our tillage,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 <I>In all the cities of our servitude,</I> so the LXX., for they were
 servants in their own land,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:36"><I>ch.</I> ix. 36</A>.

 But (as Mr. Poole well observes), though they paid great taxes to the 
 kings of Persia, and had much hardship put upon them, they would not 
 make that an excuse for not paying their tithes, but would render to 
 God the things that were his, as well as to C&aelig;sar the things that
 were his. We must do what we can in works of piety and charity 
 notwithstanding the taxes we pay to the government, and cheerfully
