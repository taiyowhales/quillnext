 This short history of the domestic affairs of one particular family 
 fitly follows the book of Judges (the events related here happening in 
 the days of the judges), and fitly goes before the books of Samuel, 
 because in the close it introduces David; yet the Jews, in their 
 Bibles, separate it from both, and make it one of the five 
 <I>Megilloth,</I> or <I>Volumes,</I> which they put together towards 
 the latter end, in this order: <I>Solomon's Song, Ruth, Lamentations, 
 Ecclesiastes,</I> and <I>Esther.</I> It is probable that Samuel was the 
 penman of it. It relates not miracles nor laws, wars nor victories, nor 
 the revolutions of states, but the affliction first and afterwards the 
 comfort of Naomi, the conversion first and afterwards the preferment of 
 Ruth. Many such events have happened, which perhaps we may think as 
 well worthy to be recorded; but these God saw fit to transmit the 
 knowledge of to us; and even common historians think they have liberty 
 to choose their subject. The design of this book is, 

 I. To lead to providence, to show us how conversant it is about our 
 private concerns, and to teach us in them all to have an eye to it, 
 acknowledging God in all our ways and in all events that concern us.

 II. To lead to Christ, who descended from Ruth, and part of whose
 genealogy concludes the book, whence it is fetched into

 In the conversion of Ruth the Moabitess, and the bringing of her into
 the pedigree of the Messiah, we have a type of the calling of the 
 Gentiles in due time into the fellowship of Christ Jesus our Lord. The 
 afflictions of Naomi and Ruth we have an account of,

 Instances of their industry and humility,

 The bringing of them into an alliance with Boaz,

 And their happy settlement thereby,

 And let us remember the scene is laid in Bethlehem, the city where our
 Redeemer was born.</P>
