 Samson's name (we have observed before) signifies a little sun
 (sol parvus); we have seen this sun rising very bright, and his morning
 ray strong and clear; and, nothing appearing to the contrary, we take 
 it for granted that the middle of the day was proportionably 
 illustrious, while he judged Israel twenty years; but the melancholy 
 story of this chapter gives us such an account of his evening as did 
 not commend his day. This little sun set under a cloud, and yet, just 
 in the setting, darted forth one such strong and glorious beam as made 
 him even then a type of Christ, conquering by death. Here is, 

 I. Samson greatly endangered by his familiarity with one harlot, and 
 hardly escaping,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. Samson quite ruined by his familiarity with another harlot,
 Delilah. Observe, 

 1. How he was betrayed to her by his own lusts,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:4">ver. 4</A>.

 2. How he was betrayed by her to his sworn enemies, the Philistines,
 who, 

 (1.) By her means got it out of him at last where his great strength
 lay,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:5-17">ver. 5-17</A>.

 (2.) Then robbed him of his strength, by taking from his head the crown
 of his separation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>.

 (3.) Then seized him, blinded him, imprisoned him, abused him, and, at
 a solemn festival, made a show of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:21-25">ver. 21-25</A>.

 But, lastly, he avenged himself of them by pulling down the theatre
 upon their heads, and so dying with them,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there a harlot, and went
 in unto her.
 &nbsp; 2 <I>And it was told</I> the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither.
 And they compassed <I>him</I> in, and laid wait for him all night in
 the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In
 the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.
 &nbsp; 3 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took
 the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went
 away with them, bar and all, and put <I>them</I> upon his shoulders,
 and carried them up to the top of a hill that <I>is</I> before
 Hebron.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 1. Samson's sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 His taking a Philistine to wife, in the beginning of his time, was in
 some degree excusable, but to join himself to a harlot that he 
 accidentally saw among them was such a profanation of his honour as an 
 Israelite, as a Nazarite, that we cannot but blush to read it. <I>Tell 
 it not in Gath.</I> This vile impurity makes the graceful visage of 
 this Nazarite <I>blacker than a coal,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:7,8">Lam. iv. 7, 8</A>.

 We find not that Samson had any business in Gaza; if he went thither in
 quest of a harlot it would make one willing to hope that, as bad as 
 things were otherwise, there were no prostitutes among the daughters of 
 Israel.  Some think he went thither to observe what posture the 
 Philistines were in, that he might get some advantages against them; if 
 so, he forgot his business, neglected that, and so fell into this 
 snare. His sin began in his eye, with which he should have made a 
 covenant; he saw there one in the <I>attire of a harlot,</I> and the 
 lust which conceived brought forth sin: he <I>went in unto her.</I>

 2. Samson's danger. Notice was sent to the magistrates of Gaza, perhaps 
 by the treacherous harlot herself, that Samson was in the town, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Probably he came in a disguise, or in the dusk of the evening, and went
 into an inn or public-house, which happened to be kept by this harlot. 
 The gates of the city were hereupon shut, guards set, all kept quiet, 
 that Samson might suspect no danger. Now they thought they had him in a 
 prison, and doubted not but to be the death of him the next morning. O 
 that all those who indulge their sensual appetites in drunkenness, 
 uncleanness, or any fleshly lusts, would see themselves thus 
 surrounded, waylaid, and marked for ruin, by their spiritual enemies!  
 The faster they sleep, and the more secure they are, the greater is 
 their danger. 
 
 3. Samson's escape,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He rose at midnight, perhaps roused by a dream, in slumberings upon the
 bed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:15">Job  xxxiii. 15</A>),

 by his guardian angel, or rather by the checks of his own conscience. 
 He arose with a penitent abhorrence (we hope) of the sin he was now 
 committing, and of himself because of it, and with a pious resolution 
 not to return to it,--rose under an apprehension of the danger he was 
 in, that he was as one that slept upon the top of a mast,--rose with 
 such thoughts as these: "Is this a bed fit for a Nazarite to sleep in? 
 Shall a temple of the living God be thus polluted? Can I be safe under 
 this guilt?" It was bad that he lay down without such checks; but it 
 would have been worse if he had lain still under them. He makes 
 immediately towards the gate of the city, probably finds the guards 
 asleep, else he would have made them sleep their last, stays not to 
 break open the gates, but plucks up the posts, takes them, gates and 
 bar and all, all very large and strong and a vast weight, yet he 
 carries them on his back several miles, <I>up to the top of a hill,</I> 
 in disdain of their attempt to secure him with gates and bars, 
 designing thus to render himself more formidable to the Philistines and 
 more acceptable to his people, thus to give a proof of the great 
 strength God had given him and a type of Christ's victory over death 
 and the grave. He not only rolled away the stone from the door of the 
 sepulchre, and so came forth himself, but carried away the gates of the 
 grave, bar and all, and so left it, ever after, an open prison to all 
 that are his; it shall not, it cannot, always detain them. <I>O death! 
 where is thy sting?</I> Where are thy gates? Thanks be to him that not 
 only gained a victory for himself, but giveth us the victory!</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the
 valley of Sorek, whose name <I>was</I> Delilah.
 &nbsp; 5 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said
 unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength <I>lieth,</I>
 and by what <I>means</I> we may prevail against him, that we may bind
 him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven
 hundred <I>pieces</I> of silver.
 &nbsp; 6 And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy
 great strength <I>lieth,</I> and wherewith thou mightest be bound to
 afflict thee.
 &nbsp; 7 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green
 withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as
 another man.
 &nbsp; 8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven
 green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with
 them.
 &nbsp; 9 Now <I>there were</I> men lying in wait, abiding with her in the
 chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines <I>be</I> upon thee,
 Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when
 it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.
 &nbsp; 10 And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me,
 and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou
 mightest be bound.
 &nbsp; 11 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes
 that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another
 man.
 &nbsp; 12 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith,
 and said unto him, The Philistines <I>be</I> upon thee, Samson. And
 <I>there were</I> liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake
 them from off his arms like a thread.
 &nbsp; 13 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me,
 and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And
 he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with
 the web.
 &nbsp; 14 And she fastened <I>it</I> with the pin, and said unto him, The
 Philistines <I>be</I> upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his
 sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.
 &nbsp; 15 And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when
 thine heart <I>is</I> not with me? thou hast mocked me these three
 times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength <I>lieth.</I>
 &nbsp; 16 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her
 words, and urged him, <I>so</I> that his soul was vexed unto death;
 &nbsp; 17 That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There
 hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I <I>have been</I> a
 Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my
 strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like
 any <I>other</I> man.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The burnt child dreads the fire; yet Samson, that has more than the 
 strength of a man, in this comes short of the wisdom of a child; for, 
 though he had been more than once brought into the highest degree of 
 mischief and danger by the love of women and lusting after them, yet he 
 would not take warning, but is here again taken in the same snare, and 
 this third time pays for all. Solomon seems to refer especially to this 
 story of Samson when, in his caution against uncleanness, he gives this 
 account of a whorish woman 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:26">Prov. vii. 26</A>),

 that <I>she hath cast down many wounded, yea, many strong men have been 
 slain by her;</I> and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:26">Prov. vi. 26</A>)

 that <I>the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</I> This bad 
 woman, that brought Samson to ruin, is here named <I>Delilah,</I> an 
 infamous name, and fitly used to express the person, or thing, that by 
 flattery or falsehood brings mischief and destruction on those to whom 
 kindness is pretended. See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The affection Samson had for Delilah: he loved her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Some think she was his wife, but then he would have had her home to his
 own house; others that he courted her to make her his wife; but there 
 is too much reason to suspect that it was a sinful affection he had for 
 her, and that he lived in uncleanness with her. Whether she was an 
 Israelite or a Philistine is not certain. If an Israelite, which is 
 scarcely probable, yet she had the heart of a Philistine.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The interest which the lords of the Philistines made with her to 
 betray Samson, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 1. That which they told her they designed was to humble him, or afflict
 him; they would promise not to do him any hurt, only they would disable 
 him not to do them any. And so much conscience it should seem they made 
 of this promise that even then, when he lay ever so much at their 
 mercy, they would not kill him, no, not when the razor that cut his 
 hair might sooner and more easily have cut his throat. 

 2. That which they desired, in order hereunto, was to know where his 
 great strength lay, and by what means he might be bound.  Perhaps they 
 imagined he had some spell or charm which he carried about with him, by 
 the force of which he did these great things, and doubted not but that, 
 if they could get this from him, he would be manageable; and therefore, 
 having had reason enough formerly to know which was his blind side, 
 hoped to find out his riddle a second time by ploughing with his 
 heifer. They engaged Delilah to get it out of him, telling her what a 
 kindness it would be to them, and perhaps assuring her it should not be 
 improved to any real mischief, either to him or her. 

 3. For this they bid high, promised to give her each of them 1100
 pieces of silver, 5500 in all.  So many shekels amounted to above 
 1000<I>l.</I> sterling; with this she was hired to betray one she 
 pretended to love. See what horrid wickedness the love of money is the 
 root of. Our blessed Saviour was thus betrayed by one whom he called 
 <I>friend,</I> and with a kiss too, for filthy lucre. No marvel if 
 those who are unchaste, as Delilah, be unjust; such as lose their 
 honesty in one instance will in another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The arts by which he put her off from time to time, and kept his 
 own counsel a great while. She asked him <I>where his great strength 
 lay,</I> and whether it were possible for him to be bound and afflicted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 pretending that she only desired he would satisfy her curiosity in that 
 one thing, and that she thought it was impossible he should be bound 
 otherwise than by her charms.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When she urged him very much, he told her, 

 (1.) That he might be bound with <I>seven green withs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The experiment was tried

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:8"><I>v.</I>  8</A>),

 but it would not do: he <I>broke the withs</I> as easily <I>as a thread 
 of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 (2.) When she still continued her importunity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:10"><I>v.</I>  10</A>)

 he told her that with two new ropes he might be so cramped and hampered 
 that he might be as easily dealt with as any other man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This experiment was tried too, but it failed: the <I>new ropes</I>
 broke from off his arm <I>like a thread,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 (3.) When she still pressed him to communicate the secret, and 
 upbraided him with it as an unkindness that he had bantered her so 
 long, he then told her that the weaving of the seven locks of his head 
 would make a great alteration in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 This came nearer the matter than any thing he had yet said, but it
 would not do: his strength appeared to be very much in his hair, when, 
 upon the trial of this, purely by the strength of his hair, he carried 
 away the <I>pin of the beam</I> and <I>the web.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In the making of all these experiments, it is hard to say whether 
 there appears more of Samson's weakness or Delilah's wickedness. 

 (1.) Could any thing be more wicked than her restless and unreasonable 
 importunity with him to discover a secret which she knew would endanger 
 his life if ever it were lodged any where but in his own breast? What 
 could be more base and disingenuous, more false and treacherous, than 
 to lay his head in her lap, as one whom she loved, and at the same time 
 to design the betraying of him to those by whom he was mortally hated?  
 
 (2.) Could any thing be more weak than for him to continue a parley 
 with one who, he so plainly saw, was aiming to do him a mischief,--that 
 he should lend an ear so long to such an impudent request, that she 
 might know how to do him a mischief,--that when he perceived liers in 
 wait for him in the chamber, and that they were ready to apprehend him 
 if they had been able, he did not immediately quit the chamber, with a 
 resolution never to come into it any more,--nay, that he should again 
 lay his head in that lap out of which he had been so often roused with 
 that alarm, <I>The Philistines are upon thee, Samson?</I> One can 
 hardly imagine a man so perfectly besotted, and void of all 
 consideration, as Samson now was; but whoredom is one of those things 
 that <I>take away the heart.</I> It is hard to say what Samson meant in 
 suffering her to try so often whether she could weaken and afflict him; 
 some think he did not certainly know himself where his strength lay, 
 but, it should seem, he did know, for, when he told her that which 
 would disable him indeed, it is said, <I>He told her all his heart.</I> 
 It seems, he designed to banter her, and to try if he could turn it off 
 with a jest, and to baffle the <I>liers in wait,</I> and make fools of 
 them; but it was very unwise in him that he did not quit the field as 
 soon as ever he perceived that he was not able to keep the ground.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The disclosure he at last made of this great secret; and, if the 
 disclosure proved fatal to him, he must thank himself, who had not 
 power to keep his own counsel from one that manifestly sought his ruin. 
 <I>Surely in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird,</I> but 
 in Samson's sight is the net spread, and yet he is taken in it. If he 
 had not been blind before the Philistines put out his eyes, he might 
 have seen himself betrayed. Delilah signifies a <I>consumer;</I> she 
 was so to him.  Observe, 

 1. How she teazed him, telling him she would not believe he loved her,
 unless he would gratify her in this matter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>How canst thou say, I love thee, when they heart is not with me?</I> 
 That is, "when thou canst not trust me with the counsels of they 
 heart?" Passionate lovers cannot bear to have their love called in 
 question; they would do any thing rather than their sincerity should be 
 suspected. Here therefore Delilah had this fond fool (excuse me that I 
 call him so) at an advantage. This expostulation is indeed grounded 
 upon a great truth, that those only have our love, not that have our 
 good words or our good wishes, but that have our hearts. That is love 
 without dissimulation; but it is falsehood and flattery in the highest 
 degree to say we love those with whom our hearts are not. How can we say 
 we love either our brother, whom we have seen, or God, whom we have not 
 seen, if our hearts be not with him? She continued many days vexatious 
 to him with her importunity, so that he had no pleasure of his life 
 with her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 why then did he not leave her? It was because he was captivated to her 
 by the power of love, falsely so called, but truly lust. This bewitched 
 and perfectly intoxicated him, and by the force of it see, 

 2. How she conquered him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 He <I>told her all his heart.</I> God left him to himself to do this 
 foolish thing, to punish him for indulging himself in the lusts of 
 uncleanness. The angel that foretold his birth said nothing of his 
 great strength, but only that he should be a Nazarite, and particularly 
 that <I>no razor should come upon his head,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:5"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 5</A>.

 His consecration to God was to be his strength, for he was to be
 <I>strengthened according to the glorious power of that Spirit which 
 wrought in him mightily,</I> that his strength, by promise, not by 
 nature, might be a type and figure of the spiritual strength of 
 believers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:11,29">Col. i. 11, 29</A>.

 Therefore the badge of his consecration was the pledge of his strength;
 if he lose the former, he knows he forfeits the latter. "If I be 
 shaven, I shall no longer be a Nazarite, and then my strength will be 
 lost." The making of his bodily strength to depend so much on his hair, 
 which could have no natural influence upon it either one way or other, 
 teaches us to magnify divine institutions, and to expect God's grace, 
 and the continuance of it, only the use of those means of grace wherein 
 he has appointed us to attend upon him, the word, sacraments, and 
 prayer. In these earthen vessels is this treasure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she
 sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up
 this once, for he hath showed me all his heart. Then the lords of
 the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their
 hand.
 &nbsp; 19 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a
 man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head;
 and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
 &nbsp; 20 And she said, The Philistines <I>be</I> upon thee, Samson. And he
 awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times
 before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was
 departed from him.
 &nbsp; 21 But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and
 brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass;
 and he did grind in the prison house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the fatal consequences of Samson's folly in betraying his 
 own strength; he soon paid dearly for it. A <I>whore is a deep ditch; 
 he that is abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein.</I> In that pit 
 Samson sinks. Observe, 

 1. What care Delilah took to make sure of the money for herself. She
 now perceived, by the manner of his speaking, that he had <I>told her 
 all his heart,</I> and the lords of the Philistines that hired her to 
 do this base thing are sent for; but they must be sure to bring <I>the 
 money in their hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 The wages of unrighteousness are accordingly produced, unknown to
 Samson. It would have grieved one's heart to have seen one of the 
 bravest men then in the world sold and bought, as a <I>sheep for the 
 slaughter;</I> how does this instance sully all the glory of man, and 
 forbid the strong man ever to boast of his strength!

 2. What course she took to deliver him up to them according to the
 bargain. Many in the world would, for the hundredth part of what was 
 here given Delilah, sell those that they pretend the greatest respect 
 for. <I>Trust not in a friend then, put no confidence in a guide.</I> 
 See what a treacherous method she took

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 She <I>made him sleep upon her knees.</I> Josephus says, She gave him 
 some intoxicating liquor, which laid him to sleep. What opiates she 
 might steal into his cup we know not, but we cannot suppose that he 
 knowingly drank wine or strong drink, for that would have been a 
 forfeiture of his Nazariteship as much as the cutting off of his hair.  
 She pretended the greatest kindness even when she designed the greatest 
 mischief, which yet she could not have compassed if she had not made 
 him sleep. See the fatal consequences of security. Satan ruins men by 
 rocking them asleep, flattering them into a good opinion of their own 
 safety, and so bringing them to mind nothing and fear nothing, and then 
 he robs them of their strength and honour and leads them captive at his 
 will. When we sleep our spiritual enemies do not. When he was asleep 
 she had a person ready to cut off his hair, which he did so silently 
 and so quickly that it did not awake him, but plainly afflicted him; 
 even in his sleep, his spirit manifestly sunk upon it. I think we may 
 suppose that if this ill turn had been done to him in his sleep by some 
 spiteful body, without his being himself accessory to it, as he was 
 here, it would not have had this strange effect upon him; but it was 
 his own wickedness that corrected him. It was his iniquity, else it 
 would not have been so much his infelicity. 

 3. What little concern he himself was in at it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 He could not but miss his hair as soon as he awoke, and yet said, "<I>I
 will shake myself as at other times</I> after sleep," or, "as at other 
 times when the Philistines were upon me, to make my part good against 
 them." Perhaps he thought to shake himself the more easily, and that 
 his head would feel the lighter, now that his hair was cut, little 
 thinking how much heavier the burden of guilt was than that of hair. He 
 soon found in himself some change, we have reason to think so, and yet 
 <I>wist not that the Lord had departed from him:</I> he did not 
 consider that this was the reason of the change.  Note, Many have lost 
 the favourable presence of God and are not aware of it; they have 
 provoked God to withdraw from them, but are not sensible of their loss, 
 nor ever complain of it. Their souls languish and grow weak, their 
 gifts wither, every thing goes cross with them; and yet they impute not 
 this to the right cause: they are not aware that <I>God has departed 
 from them,</I> nor are they in any care to reconcile themselves to him 
 or to recover his favour. When God has departed we cannot do as at 
 other times.

 4. What improvement the Philistines soon made of their advantages
 against him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:21"><I>v.</I>  21</A>.

 The Philistines took him when God had departed from him. Those that
 have thrown themselves out of God's protection become an easy prey to 
 their enemies. If we sleep in the lap of our lusts, we shall certainly 
 wake in the hands of the Philistines. It is probable they had promised 
 Delilah not to kill him, but they took an effectual course to disable 
 him. The first thing they did, when they had him in their hands and 
 found they could manage him, was to <I>put out his eyes,</I> by 
 <I>applying fire to them,</I> says the Arabic version. They considered 
 that his eyes would never come again, as perhaps his hair might, and 
 that the strongest arms could do little without eyes to guide the, and 
 therefore, if now they blind him, they for ever blind him. His eyes 
 were the inlets of his sin: he saw the harlot at Gaza, and went in unto 
 her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and now his punishment began there. Now that the Philistines had 
 blinded him he had time to remember how his own lust had blinded him. 
 The best preservative of the eyes is to turn them away from beholding 
 vanity. <I>They brought him down to Gaza,</I> that there he might 
 appear in weakness where he had lately given such proofs of his 
 strength 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and be a jest to those to whom he had been a terror.  They <I>bound him 
 with fetters of brass</I> who had before been held in the cords of his 
 own iniquity, and he did <I>grind in the prison,</I> work in their 
 bridewell, either for their profit or his punishment, or for both. The 
 devil does thus by sinners, <I>blinds the minds of those who believe 
 not,</I> and so enslaves them, and secures them in his interests. Poor 
 Samson, how hast thou fallen! How is thy honour laid in the dust! How 
 has the glory and defence of Israel become the drudge and triumph of 
 the Philistines! <I>The crown has fallen from his head; woe unto him, 
 for he hath sinned.</I> Let all take warning by his fall carefully to 
 preserve their purity, and to watch against all fleshly lusts; for all 
 our glory has gone, and our defence departed form us, when the covenant 
 of our separation to God, as spiritual Nazarites, is profaned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he
 was shaven.
 &nbsp; 23 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for
 to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice:
 for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our
 hand.
 &nbsp; 24 And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for
 they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and
 the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.
 &nbsp; 25 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they
 said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called
 for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and
 they set him between the pillars.
 &nbsp; 26 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand,
 Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house
 standeth, that I may lean upon them.
 &nbsp; 27 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords
 of the Philistines <I>were</I> there; and <I>there were</I> upon the roof
 about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made
 sport.
 &nbsp; 28 And Samson called unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and said, O Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>,
 remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only
 this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the
 Philistines for my two eyes.
 &nbsp; 29 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which
 the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with
 his right hand, and of the other with his left.
 &nbsp; 30 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he
 bowed himself with <I>all his</I> might; and the house fell upon the
 lords, and upon all the people that <I>were</I> therein. So the dead
 which he slew at his death were more than <I>they</I> which he slew in
 his life.
 &nbsp; 31 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down,
 and took him, and brought <I>him</I> up, and buried him between Zorah
 and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he
 judged Israel twenty years.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though the last stage of Samson's life was inglorious, and one could 
 wish there were a veil drawn over it, yet this account here given of 
 his death may be allowed to lessen, though it does not quite roll away, 
 the reproach of it; for there was honour in his death. No doubt he 
 greatly repented of his sin, the dishonour he had by it done to God and 
 his forfeiture of the honour God had put upon him; for that God was 
 reconciled to him appears, 

 1. By the return of the sign of his Nazariteship

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>His hair began to grow again, as when he was shaven,</I> that is, to 
 be as thick and as long as when it was cut off.  It is probable that 
 their general thanksgiving to Dagon was not long deferred, before which 
 Samson's hair had thus grown, by which, and the particular notice taken 
 of it, it seems to have been extraordinary, and designed for a special 
 indication of the return of God's favour to him upon his repentance. 
 For the growth of his hair was neither the cause nor the sign of the 
 return of his strength further than as it was the badge of his 
 consecration, and a token that God accepted him as a Nazarite again, 
 after the interruption, without those ceremonies which were appointed 
 for the restoration of a lapsed Nazarite, which he had not now the 
 opportunity of performing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:9">Num. vi. 9</A>.

 It is strange that the Philistines in whose hands he was were not
 jealous of the growth of his hair again, and did not cut it; but 
 perhaps they were willing his great strength should return to him, that 
 they might have so much the more work out of him, and now that he was 
 blind they were in no fear of any hurt from him.

 2. By the use God made of him for the destruction of the enemies of his
 people, and that at a time when it would be most for the vindication of 
 the honour of God, and not immediately for the defence and deliverance 
 of Israel. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How insolently the Philistines affronted the God of Israel, 

 1. By the sacrifices they offered to Dagon, his rival. This Dagon they
 call their <I>god,</I> a god of their own making, represented by an 
 image, the upper part of which was in the shape of a man, the lower 
 part of a fish, purely the creature of fancy; yet it served them to set 
 up in opposition to the true and living God. To this pretended deity 
 they ascribe their success

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>):

 <I>Our god has delivered Samson our enemy, and the destroyer of our 
 country, into our hands.</I> So they dreamed, though he could do 
 neither good nor evil. They knew Delilah had betrayed him, and they had 
 paid her for doing it, yet they attribute it to their god, and are 
 confirmed by it in their belief of his power to protect them. All 
 people will thus walk in the name of their gods: they will give them 
 the praise of their achievements; and shall not we pay this tribute to 
 our God whose kingdom ruleth over all?  Yet, considering what wicked 
 arts they used to get Samson into their hands, it must be confessed it 
 was only such a dunghill-deity as Dagon that was fit to be made a 
 patron of the villany. Sacrifices were offered, and songs of praise 
 sung, on the general thanksgiving day, for this victory obtained over 
 one man; there were great expressions of joy, and all to the honour of 
 Dagon. Much more reason have we to give the praise of all our successes 
 to our God. <I>Thanks be to him who causeth us to triumph in Christ 
 Jesus!</I> 

 2. By the sport they made with Samson, God's champion, they reflected
 on God himself. When they were merry with wine, to make them more merry 
 Samson must be fetched to make sport for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:25,27"><I>v.</I> 25, 27</A>),
 
 that is, for them to make sport with.  Having sacrificed to their god, 
 and eaten and drunk upon the sacrifice, they rose up to play, according 
 to the usage of idolaters

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:7">1 Cor. x. 7</A>),
 
 and Samson must be the fool in the play. They made themselves and one
 another laugh to see how, being blind, he stumbled and blundered. It is 
 likely they <I>smote this judge of Israel upon the cheek</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:1">Mic. v. 1</A>),

 and said, <I>Prophesy who smote thee.</I> It was an instance of their 
 barbarity to trample thus upon a man in misery, at the sight of whom 
 awhile ago they would have trembled. It put Samson into the depth of 
 misery, and as a sword in his bones were their reproaches, when they 
 said, <I>Where is now they God?</I> Nothing could be more grievous to 
 so great a spirit; yet, being a penitent, his godly sorrow makes him 
 patient, and he accepts the indignity as the punishment of his 
 iniquity. How unrighteous soever the Philistines were, he could not but 
 own that God was righteous. He had sported himself in his own 
 deceivings and with his own deceivers, and justly are the Philistines 
 let loose upon him to make sport with him. Uncleanness is a sin that 
 makes men vile, and exposes them to contempt. <I>A wound and dishonour 
 shall he get</I> whose heart is deceived by a woman, and <I>his 
 reproach shall not be wiped away.</I> Everlasting shame and contempt 
 will be the portion of those that are blinded and bound by their own 
 lusts. The devil that deceived them will insult over them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How justly the God of Israel brought sudden destruction upon them 
 by the hands of Samson. Thousands of the Philistines had got together, 
 to attend their lords in the sacrifices and joys of this day, and to be 
 the spectators of this comedy; but it proved to them a fatal tragedy, 
 for they were all slain, and buried in the ruins of the house: whether 
 it was a temple or a theatre, or whether it was some slight building 
 run up for the purpose, is uncertain.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who were destroyed: All the <I>lords of the Philistines</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),
 
 who had by bribes corrupted Delilah to betray Samson to them. Evil 
 pursued those sinners. Many of the people likewise, to the number of 
 3000, and among them a great many women, one of whom, it is likely, was 
 that harlot of Gaza mentioned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Samson had been drawn into sin by the Philistine women, and now a great
 slaughter is made among them, as was by Moses's order among the women 
 of Midian, because it was they that <I>caused the children of Israel to 
 trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:16">Num. xxxi. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When they were destroyed. 

 (1.) When they were merry, secure, and jovial, and far from 
 apprehending themselves in any danger. When they saw Samson lay hold of 
 the pillars, we may suppose, his doing so served them for a jest, and 
 they made sport with that too: <I>What will this feeble Jew do?</I> How 
 are sinners brought to desolation in a moment!  They are lifted up in 
 pride and mirth, that their fall may be the more dreadful. Let us never 
 envy the mirth of wicked people, but infer from this instance that 
 their triumphing is short and their joy but for a moment. 

 (2.) It was when they were praising Dagon their god, and giving that 
 honour to him which is due to God only, which is no less than treason 
 against the King of kings, his crown and dignity.  Justly therefore is 
 the blood of these traitors mingled with their sacrifices.  Belshazzar 
 was cut off when he was praising his man-made gods, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:4">Dan. v. 4</A>.

 (3.) It was when they were making sport with an Israelite, a Nazarite, 
 and insulting over him, persecuting him whom God had smitten.  Nothing 
 fills the measure of the iniquity of any person or people faster than 
 mocking and misusing the servants of God, yea, though it is by their 
 own folly that they are brought low. Those know not what they do, nor 
 whom they affront, that make sport with a good man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How they were destroyed. Samson pulled the house down upon them, God 
 no doubt putting it into his heart, as a public person, thus to avenge 
 God's quarrel with them, Israel's, and his own. 

 (1.) He gained strength to do it by prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 That strength which he had lost by sin he, like a true penitent, 
 recovers by prayer; as David, who, when he had provoked the Spirit of 
 grace to withdraw, prayed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:12">Ps. li. 12</A>),

 <I>Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy 
 free Spirit.</I> We may suppose that this was only a mental prayer, and 
 that his voice was not heard (for it was made in a noisy clamorous 
 crowd of Philistines); but, though his voice was not heard of men, yet 
 his prayer was heard of God and graciously answered, and though he 
 lived not to give an account himself of this his prayer, as Nehemiah 
 did of his, yet God not only accepted it in heaven, but, by revealing 
 it to the inspired penmen, provided for the registering of it in his 
 church. He prayed to God to remember him and strengthen him this once, 
 thereby owning that his strength for what he had already done he had 
 from God, and begged it might be afforded to him once more, to give 
 them a parting blow. That it was not from a principle of passion or 
 personal revenge, but from a holy zeal for the glory of God and Israel, 
 that he desired to do this, appears from God's accepting and answering 
 the prayer. Samson died praying, so did our blessed Saviour; but Samson 
 prayed for vengeance, Christ for forgiveness. 

 (2.) He gained opportunity to do it by leaning on the two pillars which 
 were the chief supports of the building, and were, it seems, so near 
 together that he could take hold of them both at one time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:26,29"><I>v.</I> 26, 29</A>.
 
 Having hold of them, he bore them down with all his might, crying
 aloud, <I>Let me die with the Philistines,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 <I>Animamque in vulnere ponit--While inflicting the wound he dies.</I>
 The vast concourse of people that were upon the roof looking down 
 through it to see the sport, we may suppose, contributed to the fall of 
 it. A weight so much greater than ever it was designed to carry might 
 perhaps have sunk of itself, at least it made the fall more fatal to 
 those within: and indeed few of either could escape being either 
 stifled or crushed to death. This was done, not by any natural strength 
 of Samson, but by the almighty power of God, and is not only 
 marvellous, but miraculous, in our eyes. Now in this,

 [1.] The Philistines were greatly mortified.  All their lords and great 
 men were killed, and abundance of their people, and this in the midst 
 of their triumph; the temple of Dagon (as many think the house was) was 
 pulled down, and Dagon buried in it. This would give a great check to 
 the insolence of the survivors, and, if Israel had but had so much 
 sense and spirit left them as to improve the advantages of this 
 juncture, they might now have thrown off the Philistines' yoke. 

 [2.] Samson may very well be justified, and brought in not guilty of 
 any sinful murder either of himself or the Philistines. He was a public 
 person, a declared enemy to the Philistines, against whom he might 
 therefore take all advantages. They were now in the most barbarous 
 manner making war upon him; all present were aiding and abetting, and 
 justly die with him. Nor was he <I>felo de se,</I> or <I>a 
 self-murderer,</I> in it; for it was not his own life that he aimed at, 
 though he had too much reason to be weary of it, but the lives of 
 Israel's enemies, for the reaching of which he bravely resigned his 
 own, <I>not counting it dear to him, so that he might finish his 
 course</I> with honour. 

 [3.] God was very much glorified in pardoning Samson's great 
 transgressions, of which this was an evidence.  It has been said that 
 the prince's giving a commission to one convicted amounts to a pardon. 
 Yet, <I>though he was a God that forgave him, he took vengeance of his 
 inventions</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:8">Ps.  xcix. 8</A>),

 and, by suffering his champion to die in fetters, warned all to take 
 heed of those lusts which war against the soul. However, we have good 
 reason to hope that though Samson died with the Philistines he had not 
 his everlasting portion with them. <I>The Lord knows those that are 
 his.</I> 

 [4.] Christ was plainly typified. He pulled down the devil's kingdom, 
 as Samson did Dagon's temple; and, when he died, he obtained the most 
 glorious victory over the powers of darkness. Then when his arms were 
 stretched out upon the cross, as Samson's to the two pillars, he gave a 
 fatal shake to the gates of hell, and, <I>through death, destroyed him 
 that had the power of death, that is, the devil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:14,15">Heb. ii. 14, 15</A>),

 and herein exceeded Samson, that he not only died with the Philistines, 
 but rose again to triumph over them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The story of Samson concludes, 

 1. With an account of his burial. His own relations, animated by the
 glories that attended his death, came and found out his body among the 
 slain, brought it honourably to his own country, and buried it in the 
 place of his fathers' sepulchres, the Philistines being in such a 
 consternation that they durst not oppose it. 

 2. With the repetition of the account we had before of the continuance
 of his government: <I>He judged Israel twenty years;</I> and, if they 
 had not been as mean and sneaking as he was brave and daring, he would 
 have left them clear of the Philistines' yoke. They might have been 
 easy, safe, and happy, if they would but have given God and their 
 judges leave to make them so.</P>
