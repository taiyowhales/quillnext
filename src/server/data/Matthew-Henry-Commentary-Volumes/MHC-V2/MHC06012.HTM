 This chapter is a summary of Israel's conquests.

 I. Their conquests under Moses, on the other side Jordan (for we now
 suppose ourselves in Canaan) eastward, which we had the history of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:24-35">Num. xxi. 24</A>,

 &c. And here the abridgment of that history, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+12:1-6">ver.  1-6</A>.

 II. Their conquests under Joshua, on this side Jordan, westward. 

 1. The country they reduced, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+12:7,8">ver.  7, 8</A>.

 2. The kings they subdued, thirty-one in all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+12:9-24">ver. 9-24</A>.

 And this comes in here, not only as a conclusion of the history of the
 wars of Canaan (that we might at one view see what they had got), but 
 as a preface to the history of the dividing of Canaan, that all that 
 might be put together which they were not to make a distribution 
 of.</P>

 1 Now these <I>are</I> the kings of the land, which the children of
 Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan
 toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount
 Hermon, and all the plain on the east:
 &nbsp; 2 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, <I>and</I> ruled
 from Aroer, which <I>is</I> upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from
 the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the
 river Jabbok, <I>which is</I> the border of the children of Ammon;
 &nbsp; 3 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and
 unto the sea of the plain, <I>even</I> the salt sea on the east, the
 way to Beth-jeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdoth-pisgah:
 &nbsp; 4 And the coast of Og king of Bashan, <I>which was</I> of the
 remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
 &nbsp; 5 And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all
 Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites,
 and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
 &nbsp; 6 Them did Moses the servant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> and the children of
 Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> gave it <I>for</I> a
 possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
 tribe of Manasseh.

 Joshua, or whoever else is the historian before he comes to sum up the 
 new conquests Israel had made, in these verses receives their former 
 conquests in Moses's time, under whom they became masters of the great 
 and potent kingdoms of Sihon and Og.  Note, Fresh mercies must not 
 drown the remembrance of former mercies, nor must the glory of the 
 present instruments of good to the church be suffered to eclipse and 
 diminish the just honour of those who have gone before them, and who 
 were the blessings and ornaments of their day. Joshua's services and 
 achievements are confessedly great, but let not those under Moses be 
 overlooked and forgotten, since God was the same who wrought both, and 
 both put together proclaim him the Alpha and Omega of Israel's great 
 salvation. Here is, 

 1. A description of this conquered country, the measure and bounds of
 it in general

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>From the river Arnon</I> in the south, to <I>Mount Hermon</I> in the
 north. In particular, here is a description of the kingdom of Sihon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+12:2,3"><I>v.</I>  2, 3</A>),

 and that of Og, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+12:4,5"><I>v.</I>  4, 5</A>.

 Moses had described this country very particularly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:36,3:4">Deut. ii. 36; iii. 4</A>,

 &c.), and this description here agrees with his. King Og is said to
 dwell at Ashtaroth and Edrei 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 probably because they were both his royal cities; he had palaces in
 both, and resided sometimes in one and sometimes in the other; one 
 perhaps was his summer seat and the other his winter seat. But Israel 
 took both from him, and made one grave to serve him that could not be 
 content with one palace. 

 2.  The distribution of this country. Moses assigned it to the two 
 tribes and a half, at their request, and divided it among them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 of which we had the story at large, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:1-42">Num. xxxii</A>.

 The dividing of it when it was conquered by Moses is here mentioned as
 an example to Joshua what he must do now that he had conquered the 
 country on this side Jordan.  Moses, in his time, gave to one part of 
 Israel a very rich and fruitful country, but it was on the outside of 
 Jordan; but Joshua gave to all Israel the holy land, the mountain of 
 God's sanctuary, within Jordan: so the law conferred upon some few of 
 God's spiritual Israel external temporal blessings, which were earnests 
 of good things to come; but our Lord Jesus, the true Joshua, has 
 provided for all the children of promise spiritual blessings--the 
 privileges of the sanctuary, and the heavenly Canaan. The triumphs and 
 grants of the law were glorious, but those of the gospel far exceed in 
 glory.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And these <I>are</I> the kings of the country which Joshua and the
 children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from
 Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that
 goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel
 <I>for</I> a possession according to their divisions;
 &nbsp; 8 In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and
 in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country;
 the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites,
 the Hivites, and the Jebusites:
 &nbsp; 9 The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which <I>is</I> beside
 Beth-el, one;
 &nbsp; 10 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
 &nbsp; 11 The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
 &nbsp; 12 The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
 &nbsp; 13 The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
 &nbsp; 14 The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
 &nbsp; 15 The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
 &nbsp; 16 The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Beth-el, one;
 &nbsp; 17 The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
 &nbsp; 18 The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;
 &nbsp; 19 The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
 &nbsp; 20 The king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
 &nbsp; 21 The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
 &nbsp; 22 The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;
 &nbsp; 23 The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the
 nations of Gilgal, one;
 &nbsp; 24 The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a breviate of Joshua's conquests.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The limits of the country he conquered. It lay between Jordan on the 
 east and the Mediterranean Sea on the west, and extended from Baal-gad 
 near Lebanon in the north to Halak, which lay upon the country of Edom 
 in the south, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 The boundaries are more largely described,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+34:2-12">Num. xxxiv. 2</A>,

 &c. But what is here said is enough to show that God had been as
 good as his word, and had given them possession of all he had promised 
 them by Moses, if they would but have kept it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The various kinds of land that were found in this country, which 
 contributed both to its pleasantness and to its fruitfulness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+12:8">v. 8</A>.
 
 There were mountains, not craggy, and rocky, and barren, which are
 frightful to the traveller and useless to the inhabitants, but fruitful 
 hills, such as put forth <I>precious things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:15">Deut. xxxiii. 15</A>),

 which charmed the spectator's eye and filled the owner's hand. And
 valleys, not mossy and boggy, but <I>covered with corn,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:13">Ps. lxv. 13</A>.
 
 There were plains, and springs to water them; and even in that rich
 land there were wildernesses too, or forests, which were not so thickly 
 inhabited as other parts, yet had towns and houses in them, but served 
 as foils to set off the more pleasant and fruitful countries.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The several nations that had been in possession of this 
 country--Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, &c., all of them descended from
 Canaan, the accursed son of Ham, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:15-18">Gen. x. 15-18</A>.

 Seven nations they are called

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:1">Deut. vii. 1</A>),

 and so many are there reckoned up, but here six only are mentioned, the
 Girgashites being either lost or left out, though we find them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:16,15:21">Gen. x. 16 and xv. 21</A>.

 Either they were incorporated with some other of these nations, or, as
 the tradition of the Jews is, upon the approach of Israel under Joshua 
 they all withdrew and went into Africa, leaving their country to be 
 possessed by Israel, with whom they saw it was to no purpose to 
 contend, and therefore they are not named among the nations that Joshua 
 subdued.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A list of the kings that were conquered and subdued by the sword of 
 Israel, some in the field, others in their own cities, thirty-one in 
 all, and very particularly named and counted, it should seem, in the 
 order in which they were conquered; for the catalogue begins with the 
 kings of Jericho and Ai, then takes in the king of Jerusalem and the 
 princes of the south that were in confederacy with him, and then 
 proceeds to those of the northern association. Now, 

 1. This shows what a very fruitful country Canaan then was, which could
 support so many kingdoms, and in which so many kings chose to throng 
 together rather than disperse themselves into other countries, which we 
 may suppose not yet inhabited, but where, though they might find more 
 room, they could not expect such plenty and pleasure: this was the land 
 God spied out for Israel; and yet at this day it is one of the most 
 barren, despicable, and unprofitable countries in the world: such is 
 the effect of the curse it lies under, since its possessors rejected 
 Christ and his gospel, as was foretold by Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:23">Deut. xxix. 23</A>.

 2. It shows what narrow limits men's ambition was then confined to.
 These kings contented themselves with the government, each of them, of 
 one city and the towns and villages that pertained to it; and no one of 
 them, for aught that appears, aimed to make himself master of the rest, 
 but, when there was occasion, all united for the common safety. Yet it 
 should seem that what was wanting in the extent of their territories 
 was made up in the absoluteness of their power, their subjects being 
 all their tenants and vassals, and entirely at their command. 

 3. It shows how good God was to Israel, in giving them victory over all
 these kings, and possession of all these kingdoms, and what obligations 
 he hereby laid upon them to <I>observe his statutes and to keep his 
 laws,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:44,45">Ps. cv. 44, 45</A>.

 Here were thirty-one kingdoms, or seigniories, to be divided among nine
 tribes and a half of Israel. Of these there fell to the lot of Judah 
 the kingdoms of Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, Eglon, Debir, Arad, Libnah, 
 and Adullam, eight in all, besides part of the kingdom of Jerusalem and 
 part of Geder. Benjamin had the kingdoms of Jericho, Ai, Jerusalem, 
 Makkedah, Beth-el, and the nations of Gilgal, six in all.  Simeon had 
 the kingdom of Hormah and part of Geder.  Ephraim had the kingdoms of 
 Gezer and Tirzah. Manasseh (that half-tribe) had the kingdoms of 
 Tappuah and Hepher, Taanach and Megiddo. Asher had the kingdoms of 
 Aphek and Achshaph. Zebulun had the kingdoms of Lasharon, 
 Shimron-meron, and Jokneam. Naphtali had the kingdoms of Madon, Hazor,
 and Kedesh. And Issachar had that of Dor.  These were some of the great
 and famous kings that God smote, <I>for his mercy endureth for ever;
 and gave their land for a heritage, even a heritage unto Israel his
 servant, for his mercy endureth for ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:17-24">Ps. cxxxvi. 17</A>,
