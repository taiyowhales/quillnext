 David, having given charge concerning the building of the temple, in 
 this and the following chapters settles the method of the 
 temple-service and puts into order the offices and officers of it. In 
 the late irregular times, and during the wars in the beginning of his 
 reign, we may suppose that, though the Levitical ordinances were kept 
 up, yet it was not in the order, nor with the beauty and exactness, 
 that were desirable. Now David, being a prophet, as well as a prince, 
 by divine warrant and direction, "set in order the things that were 
 wanting." In this chapter we are informed, 

 I. He declared Solomon to be his successor,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. He numbered the Levites, and appointed them to their respective
 offices,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:2-5">ver. 2-5</A>.

 III. He took an account of the several families of the Levites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:6-23">ver. 6-23</A>.

 IV. He made a new reckoning of them from twenty years old, and
 appointed them their work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:24-32">ver. 24-32</A>.

 And in this he prepared for the temple as truly as when he laid up gold
 and silver for it; for the place is of small account in comparison with 
 the work.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his
 son king over Israel.
 &nbsp; 2  And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the
 priests and the Levites.
 &nbsp; 3  Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years
 and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was
 thirty and eight thousand.
 &nbsp; 4  Of which, twenty and four thousand <I>were</I> to set forward the
 work of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and six thousand <I>were</I> officers
 and judges:
 &nbsp; 5  Moreover four thousand <I>were</I> porters; and four thousand
 praised the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with the instruments which I made, <I>said David,</I>
 to praise <I>therewith.</I>
 &nbsp; 6  And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi,
 <I>namely,</I> Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
 &nbsp; 7  Of the Gershonites <I>were,</I> Laadan, and Shimei.
 &nbsp; 8  The sons of Laadan; the chief <I>was</I> Jehiel, and Zetham, and
 Joel, three.
 &nbsp; 9  The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.
 These <I>were</I> the chief of the fathers of Laadan.
 &nbsp; 10  And the sons of Shimei <I>were,</I> Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and
 Beriah. These four <I>were</I> the sons of Shimei.
 &nbsp; 11  And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush
 and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one
 reckoning, according to <I>their</I> father's house.
 &nbsp; 12  The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
 &nbsp; 13  The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated,
 that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for
 ever, to burn incense before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to minister unto him, and
 to bless in his name for ever.
 &nbsp; 14  Now <I>concerning</I> Moses the man of God, his sons were named
 of the tribe of Levi.
 &nbsp; 15  The sons of Moses <I>were,</I> Gershom, and Eliezer.
 &nbsp; 16  Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel <I>was</I> the chief.
 &nbsp; 17  And the sons of Eliezer <I>were,</I> Rehabiah the chief. And
 Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very
 many.
 &nbsp; 18  Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.
 &nbsp; 19  Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,
 Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
 &nbsp; 20  Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah the first, and Jesiah the
 second.
 &nbsp; 21  The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli;
 Eleazar, and Kish.
 &nbsp; 22  And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their
 brethren the sons of Kish took them.
 &nbsp; 23  The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.

 Here we have, 

 I. The crown entailed, according to the divine appointment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 David made Solomon king, not to reign with him, or reign under him, but
 only to reign after him. This he did,

 1. When he was old and full of days. He was but seventy years old when
 he died, and yet he was full of days, <I>satur dierum--satisfied with 
 living</I> in this world. When he found himself going off, he made 
 provision for the welfare of the kingdom after his decease, and pleased 
 himself with the hopeful prospect of a happy settlement both in church 
 and state. 

 2. He did it in parliament, in a solemn assembly of all the princes of
 Israel, which made Adonijah's attempt to break in upon Solomon's title 
 and set it aside, notwithstanding this public recognition and 
 establishment of it, the more impudent, impious, and ridiculous. Note, 
 The settling or securing of the crown in the interests of the temple is 
 a great blessing to the people and a great satisfaction to those who 
 are themselves leaving the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The Levites numbered, according to the rule in Moses's time, from 
 thirty years old to fifty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:2,3">Num. iv. 2, 3</A>.

 Their number in Moses's time. by this rule, was 8580

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:47,48">Num. iv. 47, 48</A>),

 but now it had increased above four-fold, much more in proportion than
 the rest of the tribes; for the serviceable men of Levi's tribe were 
 now 38,000, unless we suppose that here those were reckoned who were 
 above fifty, which was not the case there. Joab had not numbered the 
 Levites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:6"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 6</A>),

 but David now did, not in pride, but for a good purpose, and then he
 needed not fear wrath for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The Levites distributed to their respective posts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>),

 that every hand might be employed (for, of all men, an idle Levite
 makes the worst figure), and that every part of the work might be 
 carefully done. Now it was for the honour of God that so great a
 number of servants attended his house and the business of it. Much of 
 the state of great men consists in the greatness of their retinue. When 
 God kept house in Israel see what a great household he had, and all 
 well fed and well taught. But what were these to the attendants of his 
 throne above, and the innumerable company of angels? It was the 
 happiness of Israel that they had among them such a considerable body 
 of men who were obliged by their office to promote and keep up religion 
 among them. If the worship of God go to decay in Israel, let it not be
 said that it was for want of due provision for the support of it, but 
 that those who should have done it were careless and false. The work 
 assigned the Levites was four-fold:--

 1. Some, and indeed far the greater number, were to set forward the
 work of the house of the Lord: 24,000, almost two-thirds, were 
 appointed for this service, to attend the priests in killing the 
 sacrifices, flaying them, washing them, cutting them up, burning them, 
 to have the meat-offerings and drink-offerings ready, to carry out 
 dirt, and keep all the vessels and utensils of the temple clean, and 
 every thing in its place, that the service might be performed both with 
 expedition and with exactness. These served 1000 a-week, and so went 
 round in twenty-four courses. Perhaps while the temple was in building 
 some of these were employed to set forward that work, to assist the 
 builders, at least to quicken them, and keep good order among them, and 
 the decorum which became temple-work. 

 2. Others were officers and judges, not in the affairs of the temple,
 and in the controversies that arose there (for there, we may suppose, 
 the priests presided), but in the country. They were magistrates, to 
 give the laws of God in charge, to resolves difficulties, and to 
 determine controversies that arose upon them. Of these there were 6000, 
 in the several parts of the kingdom, that assisted the princes and 
 elders of every tribe in the administration of justice. 

 3. Others were porters, to guard all the avenues of the house of God,
 to examine those that desired entrance, and to resist those that would 
 force an entrance. These were the life-guards of the temple, and
 probably were armed accordingly. 

 4. Others were singers and players on instruments, whose business it
 was to keep up that part of the service; this was a new-erected 
 office.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The Levites mustered, and disposed of into their respective 
 families and kindreds, that an account of them might the better be 
 kept, and those that neglected their duty might be the more easily 
 discovered, by calling over the roll, and obliging them to answer to 
 their names, which each family might do for itself. When those of the 
 same family were employed together it would engage them to love and 
 assist one another. When Christ sent forth his disciples two and two he 
 put together those that were brethren. Two families were here joined in 
 one 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 because they had not many sons. Those that are weak and little,
 separately, may be put together and appear considerable. That which is 
 most observable in this account of the families of the Levites is that 
 the posterity of Moses (that great man) stood upon the level with 
 common Levites, and had no dignities or privileges at all peculiar to 
 them; whilst the posterity of Aaron were advanced to the priest's 
 office, to <I>sanctify the most holy things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 It is said indeed of the grandson of Moses, Rehabiah, that <I>his sons
 were highly multiplied,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>,

 <I>margin.</I> When God proposed to him that, if he would let fall his
 intercession for Israel, he would make of him a great nation, he 
 generously refused it, in recompence for which his family is here 
 greatly increased, and makes up in number what it wants in figure, in 
 the tribe of Levi. Now,

 1. The levelling of Moses' family with the rest is an evidence of his
 self-denial. Such an interest had he both with God and man that if he 
 had aimed to raise his own family, to dignify and enrich that, he might 
 easily have done so; but he was no self-seeking man, as appears from 
 his leaving to his children no marks of distinction, which was a sign 
 that he had the spirit of God and not the spirit of the world. 

 2. The elevation of Aaron's family above the rest was a recompence for
 his self-denial. When Moses (his younger brother) was made a god to 
 Pharaoh, and he only his prophet or spokesman, to observe his orders 
 and do as he was bidden, Aaron never disputed it, nor insisted upon his 
 seniority, but readily took the inferior post God put him in, submitted 
 to Moses, and, upon occasion, called him <I>his lord;</I> and because 
 he thus submitted himself, in his own person, to his junior, in 
 compliance with the will of God, God highly exalted his family, even 
 above that of Moses himself. Those that are content to stoop are in the 
 fairest way to rise. Before honour is humility.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  These <I>were</I> the sons of Levi after the house of their
 fathers; <I>even</I> the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by
 number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service
 of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, from the age of twenty years and
 upward.
 &nbsp; 25  For David said, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel hath given rest unto
 his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:
 &nbsp; 26  And also unto the Levites; they shall no <I>more</I> carry the
 tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.
 &nbsp; 27  For by the last words of David the Levites <I>were</I> numbered
 from twenty years old and above:
 &nbsp; 28  Because their office <I>was</I> to wait on the sons of Aaron for
 the service of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, in the courts, and in the
 chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work
 of the service of the house of God;
 &nbsp; 29  Both for the showbread, and for the fine flour for meat
 offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for <I>that which is
 baked in</I> the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all
 manner of measure and size;
 &nbsp; 30  And to stand every morning to thank and praise the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 likewise at even;
 &nbsp; 31  And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the
 sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number,
 according to the order commanded unto them, continually before
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 32  And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of
 the congregation, and the charge of the holy <I>place,</I> and the
 charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the
 house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. An alteration made in the computation of the effective men of the 
 Levites--that whereas, in Moses's time, they were not enlisted, or 
 taken into service, till they were thirty-years old, nor admitted as 
 probationers till twenty-five 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+8:24">Num. viii. 24</A>),

 David ordered, by direction from God, that they should be numbered
 <I>for the service of the house of the Lord,</I> from the age of twenty 
 years and upwards, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 This order he confirmed by his last words, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 When he put his last hand to the draught of this establishment he
 expressly appointed this to be done for ever after; yet not he; but the 
 Lord.

 1. Perhaps the young Levites, having no work appointed them till
 twenty-five years old, had many of them got a habit of idleness, or 
 grew addicted to their pleasures, which proved both a blemish to their 
 reputation and a hindrance to their usefulness afterwards, to prevent 
 which inconvenience they are set to work, and brought under discipline, 
 at twenty-years old. Those that will be eminent must learn to take care 
 and take care betimes. 

 2. When the work of the Levites was to carry burdens, heavy burdens,
 the tabernacle and the furniture of it, God would not call any to it 
 till they had come to their full strength; for he considers our frame, 
 and, in service as well as sufferings, will lay no more upon us than we 
 are able to bear. But now God had given rest to his people, and made 
 Jerusalem his dwelling-place for ever, so that there was no more 
 occasion to carry the tabernacle and the vessels thereof, the service 
 was much easier, and what would not over-work them nor over-load them 
 if they entered upon it at twenty-years old. 

 3. Now the people of Israel were multiplied, and there was a more
 general resort to Jerusalem, and would be when the temple was built, 
 than had ever been at Shiloh, or Nob, or Gibeon; it was therefore 
 requisite there should be more hands employed in the temple-service, 
 that every Israelite who brought an offering might find a Levite ready 
 to assist him. When more work is to be done it is a pity but there 
 should be more workmen fetched in for the doing of it. When the harvest 
 is plenteous why should the labourers be few?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A further account of the Levites' work. What the work of the 
 priests was we are told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>To sanctify the most holy things, to burn incense before the
 Lord,</I> and to <I>bless in his name;</I> that work the Levites were 
 not to meddle with, and yet they had work enough, and good work, 
 according to that to which they were appointed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 1. Those of them that were to <I>set forward the work of the house of
 God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 were therein to <I>wait on the sons of Aaron</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 were to do the drudgery-work (if any work for God is to be called
 <I>drudgery</I>) of the house of God, to keep the courts and chambers 
 clean, set things in their places, and have them ready when there was 
 occasion to use them. They were to prepare the show-bread which the 
 priests were to set on the table, to provide the flour and cakes for 
 the meat-offerings, that the priests might have every thing ready to 
 their hands. 

 2. Those of them that were judges and officers had an eye particularly
 upon all <I>measure and size,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 The standards of all weights and measures were kept in the sanctuary;
 and the Levites had the care of them, to see that they were exact, and 
 to try other weights and measures by them when they were appealed to.

 3. The work of the singers was to <I>thank and praise the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 at the offering of the morning and evening sacrifices, and other
 oblations on the sabbaths, new moons, &c., 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Moses appointed that they should blow with trumpets over their burnt
 offerings and other sacrifices, and on their solemn days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:10">Num. x. 10</A>.
 
 The sound of the trumpet was awful, and might be affecting to the
 worshippers, but was not articulate, nor such a reasonable service as 
 this which David appointed, of singing psalms on those occasions. As 
 the Jewish church grew up from its infancy, it grew more and more 
 intelligent in its devotions, till it came at length, in the gospel, to 
 <I>put away childish things,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:11,Ga+4:3,9">1 Cor. xiii. 11; Gal. iv. 3, 9</A>.

 4. The work of the porters
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 was to keep <I>the charge of the tabernacle and of the holy place,</I>
 that none might come nigh but such as were allowed, and those no nearer 
 than was allowed them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 They were likewise to keep the charge of the sons of Aaron, to be at
 their beck and go on their errands, who are yet called <I>their 
 brethren,</I> to be a memorandum to the priests that, though they were 
 advanced to a high station, yet they were <I>hewn out of the same 
 rock</I> with common Levites, and therefore must not lord it over them, 
 but in all instances treat them as brethren.</P>
