 Hazael and Jehu were the men that were designed to be the instruments 
 of God's justice in punishing and destroying the house of Ahab. Elijah 
 was told to appoint them to this service; but, upon Ahab's humiliation, 
 a reprieve was granted, and so it was left to Elisha to appoint them. 
 Hazael's elevation to the throne of Syria we read of in the foregoing 
 chapter; and we must now attend Jehu to the throne of Israel; for him 
 that escapeth the sword of Hazael, as Joram and Ahaziah did, Jehu must 
 slay, of which this chapter gives us an account. 

 I. A commission is sent to Jehu by the hand of one of the prophets, to
 take upon him the government, and destroy the house of Ahab, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>.

 II. Here is his speedy execution of this commission. 

 1. He communicates it to his captains,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:11-15">ver. 11-15</A>.

 2. He marches directly to Jezreel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:16-20">ver. 16-20</A>),

 and there dispatches

 (1.) Joram king of Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:21-26">ver. 21-26</A>.

 (2.) Ahaziah king of Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:27-29">ver. 27-29</A>.
 
 (3.) Jezebel,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the
 prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box
 of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead:
 &nbsp; 2 And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of
 Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up
 from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;
 &nbsp; 3 Then take the box of oil, and pour <I>it</I> on his head, and say,
 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then
 open the door, and flee, and tarry not.
 &nbsp; 4 So the young man, <I>even</I> the young man the prophet, went to
 Ramoth-gilead.
 &nbsp; 5 And when he came, behold, the captains of the host <I>were</I>
 sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And
 Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.
 &nbsp; 6 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil
 on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of
 Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 <I>even</I> over Israel.
 &nbsp; 7 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may
 avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of
 all the servants of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, at the hand of Jezebel.
 &nbsp; 8 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off
 from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut
 up and left in Israel:
 &nbsp; 9 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam
 the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:
 &nbsp; 10 And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel,
 and <I>there shall be</I> none to bury <I>her.</I> And he opened the door,
 and fled.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the anointing of Jehu to be king, who was, at this time, a
 commander (probably commander-in-chief) of the forces employed at
 Ramoth-Gilead,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 There he was fighting for the king his master, but received orders from
 a higher king to fight against him. It does not appear that Jehu aimed 
 at the government, or that he ever thought of it, but the commission 
 given him was a perfect surprise to him. Some think that he had been 
 anointed before by Elijah, whom God ordered to do it, but privately, 
 and with an intimation that he must not act till further orders, as 
 Samuel anointed David long before he was to come to the throne: but 
 that it not at all probable, for then we must suppose Elijah had 
 anointed Hazael too. No, when God bade him do these things he bade him 
 anoint Elisha to <I>be prophet in his room,</I> to do them when he was 
 gone, as God should direct him. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The commission sent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Elisha did not go himself to anoint Jehu, because he was old and 
 unfit for such a journey and so well known that he could not do it 
 privately, could not go and come without observation; therefore he 
 sends <I>one of the sons of the prophets</I> to do it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They not only reverences him as their father

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:15"><I>ch.</I> ii. 15</A>),

 but observed and obeyed him as their father. This service of anointing
 Jehu, 
 
 (1.) Had danger in it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+16:2">1 Sam. xvi. 2</A>),

 and therefore it was not fit that Elisha should expose himself, but one
 of the sons of the prophets, whose life was of less value, and who 
 could do it with less danger.  

 (2.) It required labour and was therefore fitter for a young man in his 
 full strength. Let youth work and age direct. 

 (3.) Yet it was an honourable piece of service, to anoint a king, and 
 he that did it might hope to be preferred for it afterwards, and 
 therefore, for the encouragement of the young prophets, Elisha employed 
 one of them: he would not engross all the honours to himself, nor 
 grudge the young prophets a share in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When he sent him, 

 (1.) He put the oil into his hand with which he must anoint Jehu:
 <I>Take this box of oil</I> Solomon was anointed with <I>oil out of the 
 tabernacle,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:39">1 Kings i. 39</A>.

 That could not now be had, but oil from a prophet's hand was equivalent
 to oil out of God's house. Probably it was not the constant practice to 
 anoint kings, but upon the disturbance of the succession, as in the 
 case of Solomon, or the interruption of it, as in the case of Joash

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:12"><I>ch.</I> xi. 12</A>),

 or the translation of the government to a new family, as here and in
 the case of David; yet it might be used generally, though the scripture 
 does not mention it. 

 (2.) He put <I>the words into his mouth</I> which he must say 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)--

 <I>I have anointed thee king,</I> and, no doubt, told him all the rest
 that he said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:7-10"><I>v.</I> 7-10</A>.

 Those whom God sends on his errands shall not go without full
 instructions.

 (3.) He also ordered him,

 [1.] To do it privately, to single out Jehu from the rest of the 
 captains and anoint him <I>in an inner chamber</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that Jehu's confidence in his commission might be tried, when he had no
 witness to attest it. His being suddenly animated for the service would 
 be proof sufficient of his being anointed to it. There needed no other 
 proof.  The thing signified was the best evidence of the sign.

 [2.] To do it expeditiously. When he went about it he must <I>gird up 
 his loins;</I> when he had done it he must <I>flee and not tarry</I> 
 for a fee, or a treat, or to see what Jehu would do. It becomes the 
 sons of the prophets to be quick and lively at their work, to go about 
 it and go through it as men that hate sauntering and trifling. They 
 should be as angels that fly swiftly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The commission delivered. The young prophet did his business with 
 despatch, was at Ramoth-Gilead presently, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 There he found the general officers sitting together, either at dinner
 or in a council of war, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 With the assurance that became a messenger from God, notwithstanding 
 the meanness of his appearance, he called Jehu out from the rest, not 
 waiting his leisure, or begging his pardon for disturbing him, but as 
 one having authority: <I>I have an errand to thee, O captain.</I> 
 Perhaps Jehu had some intimation of his business; and therefore, that 
 he might not seem too forward to catch at the honour, he asked, <I>To 
 which of all us?</I> that it might not be said afterwards he got it by 
 speaking first, but they might all be satisfied he was indeed the 
 person designed. When the prophet had him alone he anointed him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 The anointing of the Spirit is a hidden thing, that new name which none
 knows but those that have it.  Herewith,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He invests him with the royal dignity: <I>Thus saith the Lord God of 
 Israel,</I> whose messenger I am, in his name <I>I have anointed thee 
 king over the people of the Lord.</I> He gives him an incontestable 
 title, but reminds him that he was made king, 

 (1.) <I>By the God of Israel;</I> from him he must see his power 
 derived (for by him kings reign), for he must use it, and to him he 
 must be accountable.  Magistrates are the ministers of God, and must 
 therefore act in dependence upon him and with an entire devotedness to 
 him and to his glory. 

 (2.) <I>Over the Israel of God.</I> Though the people of Israel were 
 wretchedly corrupted, and had forfeited all the honour of relationship 
 to God, yet they are here called the <I>people of the Lord,</I> for he 
 had a right to them and had not yet given them a bill of divorce. Jehu 
 must look upon the people he was made king of as the <I>people of the 
 Lord,</I> not as his vassals, but God's freemen, his sons, his 
 first-born, not to be abused or tyrannized over, <I>God's people,</I> 
 and therefore to be ruled for him, and according to his laws.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He instructs him in his present service, which was to destroy all 
 the house of Ahab 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 not that he might clear his own way to the throne, and secure to
 himself the possession of it, but that he might execute the judgments 
 of God upon that guilty and obnoxious family. He calls Ahab his 
 <I>master,</I> that the relation might be no objection.  "He was thy 
 master, and to lift up thy hand against his son and successor would be 
 not only base ingratitude, but treason, rebellion, and all that is bad, 
 if thou hadst not an immediate command from God to do it. But thou art 
 under higher obligations to thy Master in heaven than to thy master 
 Ahab. He has determined that <I>the whole house of Ahab shall 
 perish,</I> and <I>by thy hand;</I> fear not: has not he commanded 
 thee? Fear not sin; his command will justify thee and bear thee out: 
 fear not danger; his command will secure and prosper thee." That he 
 might intelligently, and in a right manner, do this great execution on 
 the house of Ahab, he tells him,

 (1.) What was their crime, what the ground of the controversy, and 
 wherefore God had quarrel with them, that he might have an eye to that 
 which God had an eye to, and that was <I>the blood of God's servants, 
 the prophets</I> and others, faithful worshippers, which they had shed, 
 and which must now be required at the hand of Jezebel. That they were 
 idolaters was bad enough, and merited all that was brought upon them; 
 yet that is not mentioned here, but the controversy God has with them 
 is for their being persecutors, not so much their <I>throwing down 
 God's altars</I> as their <I>slaying his prophets with the sword.</I> 
 Nothing fills the measure of the iniquity of any prince or people as 
 this does nor brings a surer or a sorer ruin. This was the sin that 
 brought on Jerusalem its first destruction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:16">2 Chron. xxxvi. 16</A>)
 
 and its final one,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37,38">Matt. xxiii. 37, 38</A>.
 
 Jezebel's whoredoms and witchcrafts were not so provoking as her
 persecuting the prophets, killing some and driving the rest into 
 corners and caves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:4">1 Kings xviii. 4</A>.

 (2.) What was their doom. They were sentenced to utter destruction; not
 to be corrected, but to be cut off and rooted out. This Jehu must know, 
 that his eye might not spare for pity, favour, or affection. All that 
 belonged to Ahab must be slain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 A pattern is given him of the destruction intended, in the destruction
 of the families of Jeroboam and Baasha

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 and he is particularly directed to throw Jezebel to the dogs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 The whole stock of royal blood was little enough, and too little, to
 atone for the blood of the prophets, the saints and martyrs, which, in 
 God's account, is of great price.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The prophet, having done this errand, made the best of his way home 
 again, and left Jehu alone to consider what he had to do and beg 
 direction from God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and <I>one</I>
 said unto him, <I>Is</I> all well? wherefore came this mad <I>fellow</I> to
 thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his
 communication.
 &nbsp; 12 And they said, <I>It is</I> false; tell us now. And he said, Thus
 and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I have
 anointed thee king over Israel.
 &nbsp; 13 Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put
 <I>it</I> under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets,
 saying, Jehu is king.
 &nbsp; 14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired
 against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he and all
 Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.
 &nbsp; 15 But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the
 wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with
 Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, <I>then</I>
 let none go forth <I>nor</I> escape out of the city to go to tell <I>it</I>
 in Jezreel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jehu, after some pause, returned to his place at the board, taking no 
 notice of what had passed, but, as it should seem, designing, for the 
 present, to keep it to himself, if they had not urged him to disclose 
 it. Let us therefore see what passed between him and the captains.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. With what contempt the captains speak of the young prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 "<I>Wherefore came this mad fellow to thee?</I> What business had he
 with thee? And why wouldst thou humour him so far as to retire for 
 conversation with him? Are prophets company for captains?" They are 
 called him <I>a mad fellow,</I> because he was one of those that would 
 not <I>run with them to an excess of riot</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:4">1 Pet. iv. 4</A>),

 but lived a life of self-denial, mortification, and contempt of the
 world, and spent their time in devotion; for these things they thought 
 the prophets were fools and the <I>spiritual men were mad,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:7">Hos. ix. 7</A>.

 Note, Those that have no religion commonly speak with disdain of those
 that are religious, and look upon them as mad. They said of our 
 Saviour, <I>He is beside himself,</I> of John Baptist, <I>He has a 
 devil</I> (is a poor melancholy man), of St. Paul, <I>Much learning has 
 made him mad.</I> The highest wisdom is thus represented as folly, and 
 those that best understand themselves are looked upon as beside 
 themselves. Perhaps Jehu intended it for a rebuke to his friends when 
 he said, "<I>You know the man</I> to be a prophet, why then do you call 
 him a mad fellow? You know the way of his communication to be not from 
 madness, but inspiration." Or, "Being a prophet, you may guess what his 
 business is, to tell me of my faults, and to teach me my duty; I need 
 not inform you concerning it." Thus he thought to put them off, but 
 they urged him to tell them. "It is false," say they, "we cannot 
 conjecture what was his errand, and therefore tell us." Being thus 
 pressed to it, he told them that the prophet had <I>anointed him 
 king,</I> and it is probable showed them the oil upon his head,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 He knew not but some of them either out of loyalty to Joram or envy of
 him, might oppose him, and go near to crush his interest in its 
 infancy; but he relied on the divine appointment, and was not afraid to 
 own it, knowing whom he had trusted: he that raised him would stand by 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. With what respect they compliment the new king upon the first 
 notice of his advancement, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 How meanly soever they thought of the prophet that anointed him, and of
 his office, they expressed a great veneration for the royal dignity of 
 him that was anointed, and were very forward to proclaim him and sound 
 of trumpet. In token of their subjection and allegiance to him, their 
 affection to his person and government, and their desire to see him 
 high and easy in it, they put their garments under him, that he might 
 stand or sit upon them <I>on the top of the stairs,</I> in sight of the 
 soldiers, who, upon the first intimation, came together to grace the 
 solemnity. God put it into their hearts thus readily to own him, for he 
 turns the hearts of people as well as kings, like the rivers of water, 
 into what channel he pleases. Perhaps they were disquieted at Joram's 
 government or had a particular affection for Jehu; or, however this 
 might be, things it seems were ripe for the revolution, and they all 
 came into Jehu's interest and <I>conspired against Joram,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. With what caution Jehu proceeded. He had advantages against Joram, 
 and he knew how to improve them. He had the army with him. Joram had 
 left it, and had gone home badly wounded. Jehu's good conduct appears 
 in two things:--

 1. That he complimented the captains, and would do nothing without
 their advice and consent ("If it be your minds, we will do so and so, 
 else not"), thereby intimating the deference he paid to their judgment 
 and the confidence he had in their fidelity, both which tended to 
 please and fix them. It is the wisdom of those that would rise fast, 
 and stand firm, to take their friends along with them.

 2. That he contrived to surprise Joram; and, in order thereto, to come
 upon him with speed, and to prevent his having notice of what was now 
 done: "<I>Let none go forth to tell it in Jezreel,</I> that, as a 
 snare, the ruin may come on him and his house." The suddenness of an 
 attack sometimes turns to as good an account as the force of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram
 lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.
 &nbsp; 17 And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he
 spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company.
 And Joram said, Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let
 him say, <I>Is it</I> peace?
 &nbsp; 18 So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus
 saith the king, <I>Is it</I> peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to
 do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told,
 saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.
 &nbsp; 19 Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them,
 and said, Thus saith the king, <I>Is it</I> peace? And Jehu answered,
 What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.
 &nbsp; 20 And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and
 cometh not again: and the driving <I>is</I> like the driving of Jehu
 the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.
 &nbsp; 21 And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready.
 And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each
 in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in
 the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.
 &nbsp; 22 And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, <I>Is
 it</I> peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the
 whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts <I>are so</I>
 many?
 &nbsp; 23 And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah,
 <I>There is</I> treachery, O Ahaziah.
 &nbsp; 24 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote
 Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart,
 and he sunk down in his chariot.
 &nbsp; 25 Then said <I>Jehu</I> to Bidkar his captain, Take up, <I>and</I> cast
 him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for
 remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his
 father, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> laid this burden upon him;
 &nbsp; 26 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the
 blood of his sons, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and I will requite thee in
 this plat, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. Now therefore take <I>and</I> cast him into
 the plat <I>of ground,</I> according to the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 27 But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw <I>this,</I> he fled by
 the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and
 said, Smite him also in the chariot. <I>And they did so</I> at the
 going up to Gur, which <I>is</I> by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo,
 and died there.
 &nbsp; 28 And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and
 buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of
 David.
 &nbsp; 29 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began
 Ahaziah to reign over Judah.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 From Ramoth-Gilead to Jezreel was more than one day's march; about the 
 mid-way between them the river Jordan must be crossed. We may suppose 
 Jehu to have marched with all possible expedition, and to have taken 
 the utmost precaution to prevent the tidings from getting to Jezreel 
 before him; and, at length, we have him within sight first, and then 
 within reach, of the devoted king.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Joram's watchman discovers him first at a distance, him and his 
 retinue, and gives notice to the king of the approach of a company, 
 whether of friends or foes he cannot tell. But the king (impatient to 
 know what is the matter, and perhaps jealous that the Syrians, who had 
 wounded him, had traced him by the blood to his own palace, and were 
 coming to seize him) sent first one messenger, and then another, to 
 bring him intelligence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:17-19"><I>v.</I> 17-19</A>.

 He had scarcely recovered from the fright he was put into in the
 battle, and his guilty conscience put him into a continual terror. Each 
 messenger asked the same question: "<I>Is it peace?</I> are you for us 
 or for our adversaries? Do you bring good tidings or bad?" Each had the 
 same answer: <I>What hast thou to do with peace? Turn thee behind 
 me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 As if he had said, "It is not to thee, but to him that sent thee, that
 I will give answer; for thy part, if thou consult thy own safety, 
 <I>turn thee behind me,</I> and enlist thyself among my followers." The 
 watchman gave notice that the messengers were taken prisoners, and at 
 length observed that the leader of this troop drove like Jehu, who it 
 seems was noted for driving furiously, thereby discovering himself to 
 be a man of a hot eager spirit, intent upon his business, and pushing 
 forward with all his might. A man of such a violent temper was fittest 
 for the service to which Jehu was designated. The wisdom of God is seen 
 in the choice of proper instruments to be employed in his work. But it 
 is not much for any man's reputation to be known by his fury. He that 
 has rule over his own spirit is better than the mighty. The Chaldee 
 paraphrase gives this a contrary sense: <I>The leading is like that of 
 Jehu, for he leads quietly.</I> And, it should seem, he did not come up 
 very fast, for then there would not have been time for all this that 
 passed. And some think he chose to march slowly, that he might give 
 Joram time to come out to him, and so dispatch him before he entered 
 the city.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Joram himself goes out to meet him, and takes Ahaziah king of Judah 
 along with him, neither of them equipped for war, as not expecting an 
 enemy, but in haste to have their curiosity satisfied. How strangely 
 has Providence sometimes ordered it, that men have been in haste to 
 meet their ruin when their day has come to fall.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The place where Joram met Jehu was ominous: <I>In the portion of 
 Naboth the Jezreelite,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 The very sight of that ground was enough to make Joram tremble and Jehu
 triumph; for Joram had the guilt of Naboth's blood fighting against him 
 and Jehu had the force of Elijah's curse fighting for him. The 
 circumstances of events are sometimes so ordered by divine Providence 
 as to make the punishment answer to the sin as face answers to face in 
 a glass.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Joram's demand was still the same: "<I>Is it peace, Jehu?</I> Is all 
 well? Dost thou come home thus flying from the Syrians or more than a 
 conqueror over them?" It seems, he looked for peace, and could not 
 entertain any other thought. Note, It is very common for great sinners, 
 even when they are upon the brink of ruin, to flatter themselves with 
 an opinion that all is well with them, and to cry peace to 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Jehu's reply was very startling. He answered him with a question: 
 <I>What peace</I> canst thou expect, <I>so long as the whoredoms of thy 
 mother Jezebel</I> (who, though queen dowager, was in effect queen 
 regent) <I>and her witchcrafts are so many?</I> See how plainly Jehu 
 deals with him. Formerly he durst not do so, but now he had another 
 spirit. Note, Sinners will not always be flattered; one time or other, 
 they will have their own given them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:2">Ps. xxxvi. 2</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) He charges upon him his mother's wickedness, because he had at 
 first learned it and then with his kingly power protected it. She 
 stands impeached for whoredom, corporal and spiritual (serving idols 
 and serving them with the very acts of lewdness), for witchcraft 
 likewise, enchantments and divinations, used in honour of her idols; 
 and these multiplied, the whoredoms and the witchcrafts many; for those 
 that abandon themselves to wicked courses know not where they will 
 stop. One sin begets another. 

 (2.) Upon that account he throws him off from all pretensions to peace: 
 "What peace can come to that house in which there is so much wickedness 
 unrepented of?" Note, The way of sin can never be the way of peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:21">Isa. lvii. 21</A>.

 What peace can sinners have with God, what peace with their own
 consciences, what good, what comfort, can they expect in life, in 
 death, or after death, who go on still in their trespasses? No peace so 
 long as sin is persisted in; but, as soon as it is repented of and 
 forsaken, there is peace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The execution was done immediately. When Joram heard of his mother's 
 crimes his heart failed him; he presently concluded the long-threatened 
 day of reckoning had now come, and cried out, "<I>There is treachery, O 
 Ahaziah!</I> Jehu is our enemy, and it is time for us to shift for our 
 safety." Both fled, and, 

 (1.) Joram king of Israel was slain presently, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Jehu dispatched him with his own hands. The bow was not drawn at a
 venture, as that which sent the fatal arrow through the joints of his 
 father's harness, but Jehu directed the arrow between his shoulders as 
 he fled (it was one of God's arrows which he <I>has ordained against 
 the persecutor,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:13">Ps. vii. 13</A>),

 and it reached to his heart, so that he died upon the spot. He was now
 the top branch of Ahab's house, and therefore was first cut off. He 
 died a criminal, under the sentence of the law, which Jehu, the 
 executioner, pursues in the disposal of the dead body.  Naboth's 
 vineyard was hard by, which put him in mind of that circumstance of the 
 doom Elijah passed upon Ahab, "<I>I will requite thee in this plat, 
 said the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>),

 <I>for the blood of Naboth</I> himself, and <I>for the blood of his
 sons,</I>" who were either put to death with him as partners in his 
 crime, or secretly murdered afterwards, lest they should bring an 
 appeal, or find some way to avenge their father's death, or break their 
 hearts for the loss of him, or (his whole estate being confiscated, as 
 well as his vineyard) lose their livelihoods, which was in effect to 
 lose their lives. For this the house of Ahab must be reckoned with; and 
 that very piece of ground which he, with so much pride and pleasure, 
 had made himself master of at the expense of the guilt of innocent 
 blood, now became the theatre on which his son's dead body lay exposed 
 a spectacle to the world. Thus <I>the Lord is known by the judgment 
 which he executeth.  Higgaion. Selah.</I>

 (2.) Ahaziah king of Judah was pursued, and slain in a little time, and 
 not far off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.

 [1.] Though he was now in Joram's company, he would not have been slain 
 but that he was joined with the house of Ahab both in affinity and in 
 iniquity. He was one of them (so he had made himself by his sins) and 
 therefore he must fare as they fared. Jehu justly construed his 
 commission as extending to them.  Yet,

 [2.] Perhaps he would not at this time have fallen with them if he had 
 not been found in company with them. It is a dangerous thing to 
 associate with evil-doers; we may be entangled both in guilt and misery 
 by it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>30 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard <I>of it;</I>
 and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a
 window.
 &nbsp; 31 And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, <I>Had</I> Zimri
 peace, who slew his master?
 &nbsp; 32 And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who <I>is</I>
 on my side? who? And there looked out to him two <I>or</I> three
 eunuchs.
 &nbsp; 33 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and
 <I>some</I> of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses:
 and he trode her under foot.
 &nbsp; 34 And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go,
 see now this cursed <I>woman,</I> and bury her: for she <I>is</I> a king's
 daughter.
 &nbsp; 35 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her
 than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of <I>her</I> hands.
 &nbsp; 36 Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This
 <I>is</I> the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which he spake by his servant Elijah
 the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat
 the flesh of Jezebel:
 &nbsp; 37 And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of
 the field in the portion of Jezreel; <I>so</I> that they shall not
 say, This <I>is</I> Jezebel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The greatest delinquent in the house of Ahab was Jezebel: it was she 
 that introduced Baal, slew the Lord's prophets, contrived the murder of 
 Naboth, stirred up her husband first, and then her sons, to do 
 wickedly; a <I>cursed woman</I> she is here called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 a curse to the country, and whom all that wished well to their country
 had a curse for. Three reigns her reign had lasted, but now, at length, 
 her day had come to fall. We read of a false prophetess in the church 
 of Thyatira that is compared to Jezebel, and called by her name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:20">Rev. ii. 20</A>),

 her wickedness the same, seducing God's servants to idolatry, a long
 <I>space given her to repent</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)

 as to Jezebel, and a fearful ruin brought upon her at last

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>),

 as here upon Jezebel. So that Jezebel's destruction may be looked upon
 as typical of the destruction of idolaters and persecutors, especially 
 that great whore, that mother of harlots, that hath made herself 
 <I>drunk with the blood of saints</I> and the nations <I>drunk with the 
 wine of her fornications,</I> when God shall put it into the heart of 
 the kings of the earth to hate her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:5,6,16">Rev. xvii. 5, 6, 16</A>.

 Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jezebel daring the judgment. She heard that Jehu had slain her son,
 and slain him for her whoredoms and witchcrafts, and thrown his dead 
 body into the portion of Naboth, according to the word of the Lord, and 
 that he was now coming to Jezreel, where she could not but expect 
 herself to fall next a sacrifice to his revenging sword. Now see how 
 she meets her fate; she posted herself in a window at the entering of 
 the gate, to affront Jehu and set him at defiance. 

 1. Instead of hiding herself, as one afraid of divine vengeance, she 
 exposed herself to it and scorned to flee, mocked at fear and was not 
 affrighted. See how a heart hardened against God will brave it out to 
 the last, <I>run upon him, even upon his neck,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:26">Job xv. 26</A>.

 But never did any thus harden their hearts against him and prosper.

 2. Instead of humbling herself, and putting herself into close mourning
 for her son, she <I>painted her face, and tired her head,</I> that she 
 might appear like herself, that is (as she thought), great and 
 majestic, hoping thereby to daunt Jehu, to put him out of countenance, 
 and to stop his career. <I>The Lord God called to baldness and girding 
 with sackcloth,</I> but behold painting and dressing, walking contrary 
 to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:12,13">Isa. xxii. 12, 13</A>.

 There is not a surer presage of ruin than an unhumbled heart under
 humbling providences. Let painted faces look in Jezebel's glass, and 
 see how they like themselves.

 3. Instead of trembling before Jehu, the instrument of God's vengeance, 
 she thought to make him tremble with that threatening question, <I>Had 
 Zimri peace, who slew his master?</I> Observe,

 (1.) She took no notice of the hand of God gone out against her family, 
 but flew in the face of him that was only the sword in his hand. We are 
 very apt, when we are in trouble, to break out into a passion against 
 the instruments of our trouble, when we ought to be submissive to God 
 and angry at ourselves only. 

 (2.) She pleased herself with the thought that what Jehu was now doing 
 would certainly end in his own ruin, and that he would not have peace 
 in it. He had cut her off from all pretensions to peace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 and now she thought to cut him off likewise. Note, It is no new thing
 for those that are doing God's work to be looked upon as out of the way 
 of peace. Active reformers, faithful reprovers, are threatened with 
 trouble; but let them be in nothing terrified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:28">Phil. i. 28</A>.

 (3.) She quoted a precedent, to deter him from the prosecution of this 
 enterprise: "<I>Had Zimri peace?</I> No, he had not; he came to the 
 throne by blood and treachery, and within seven days was constrained to 
 burn the palace over his head and himself in it: and canst thou expect 
 to fare any better?" Had the case been parallel, it would have been 
 proper enough to give him this memorandum; for the judgments of God 
 upon those that have gone before us in any sinful way should be 
 warnings to us to take heed of treading in their steps. But the 
 instance of Zimri was misapplied to Jehu. Zimri had no warrant for what 
 he did, but was incited to it merely by his own ambition and cruelty; 
 whereas Jehu was anointed by one of the sons of the prophets, and did 
 this by order from heaven, which would bear him out. In comparing 
 persons and things we must carefully distinguish between the precious 
 and the vile, and take heed lest from the fate of sinful men we read 
 the doom of useful men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jehu demanding aid against her. He looked up to the window, not 
 daunted at the menaces of her impudent but impotent rage, and cried, 
 <I>Who is on my side? Who?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 He was called out to do God's work, in reforming the land and punishing
 those that had debauched it; and here he calls out for assistance in 
 the doing of it, looked as if there were any to help, any to uphold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:5">Isa. lxiii. 5</A>.
 
 He lifts up a standard, and makes proclamation, as Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:26">Exod. xxxii. 26</A>),

 <I>Who is on the Lord's side?</I> And the Psalmist
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:16">Ps. xciv. 16</A>),

 <I>Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers?</I> Note, When
 reformation-work is set on foot, it is time to ask, "Who sides with 
 it?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Her own attendants delivering her up to his just revenge. Two or 
 three chamberlains looked out to Jehu with such a countenance as 
 encouraged him to believe they were on his side, and to them he called 
 not to seize or secure her till further orders, but immediately to 
 throw her down, which was one way of stoning malefactors, casting them 
 headlong from some steep place. Thus was vengeance taken on her for the 
 stoning of Naboth. They threw her down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 If God's command would justify Jehu, his command would justify them.
 Perhaps they had a secret dislike of Jezebel's wickedness, and hated 
 her, though they served her; or, it may be, she was barbarous and 
 injurious to those about her, and they were pleased with this 
 opportunity of being avenged on her; or, observing Jehu's success, they 
 hoped thus to ingratiate themselves with him, and keep their places in 
 his court. However it was, thus she was most shamefully put to death, 
 dashed against the wall and the pavement, and then trodden on by the 
 horses, which were all besmeared with her blood and brains. See the end 
 of pride and cruelty, and say, <I>The Lord is righteous.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The very dogs completing her shame and ruin, according to the 
 prophecy. When Jehu had taken some refreshment in the palace, he 
 bethought himself of showing so much respect to Jezebel's sex and 
 quality as to bury her. As bad as she was, she was a daughter, a king's 
 daughter, a king's wife, a king's mother: <I>Go and bury her,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 But, though he had forgotten what the prophet said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>,

 <I>Dogs shall eat Jezebel</I>), God had not forgotten it. While he was
 eating and drinking, the dogs had devoured her dead body, the dogs that 
 <I>went about the city</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:6">Ps. lix. 6</A>)

 and fed upon the carrion, so that there was nothing left but her bare
 skull (the painted face gone) and her feet and hands. The hungry dogs 
 had no respect to the dignity of her extraction; a king's daughter was 
 no more to them than a common person. When we pamper our bodies, and 
 use them deliciously, let us think how vile they are, and that shortly 
 they will be either a feast for worms under ground or beasts above 
 ground. When notice was brought of this to Jehu, he remembered the 
 threatening

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:23">1 Kings xxi. 23</A>),

 <I>The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.</I> Nothing
 should remain of her but the monuments of her infamy. She had been used 
 to appear on public days in great state, and the cry was, "This is 
 Jezebel. What a majestic port and figure! How great she looks!" But now 
 it shall be said no more. We have often seen the wicked buried 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:10">Eccl. viii. 10</A>),

 yet sometimes, as here, they have no burial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+6:3">Eccl. vi. 3</A>.

 Jezebel's name nowhere remained, but as stigmatized in sacred writ:
 they could not so much as say, "This is Jezebel's dust, This is 
 Jezebel's grave," or "This is Jezebel's seed." Thus the name of the 
 wicked shall rot--rot above ground.</P>
