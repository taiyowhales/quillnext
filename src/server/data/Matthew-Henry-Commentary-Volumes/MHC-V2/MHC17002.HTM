 Two things are recorded in this chapter, which were working towards the
 deliverance of the Jews from Haman's conspiracy:--

 I. The advancement of Esther to be queen instead of Vashti. Many others
 were candidates for the honour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>);

 but Esther, an orphan, a captive-Jewess

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>),

 recommended herself to the king's chamberlain first

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>)

 and then to the king

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:12-17">ver. 12-17</A>),

 who made her queen,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>.

 II. The good service that Mordecai did to the king in discovering a 
 plot against his life,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was
 appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what
 was decreed against her.
 &nbsp; 2  Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let
 there be fair young virgins sought for the king:
 &nbsp; 3  And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his
 kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins
 unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the
 custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and
 let their things for purification be given <I>them:</I>
 &nbsp; 4  And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead
 of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.
 &nbsp; 5  <I>Now</I> in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose
 name <I>was</I> Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son
 of Kish, a Benjamite;
 &nbsp; 6  Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity
 which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom
 Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
 &nbsp; 7  And he brought up Hadassah, that <I>is,</I> Esther, his uncle's
 daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid
 <I>was</I> fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and
 mother were dead, took for his own daughter.
 &nbsp; 8  So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his
 decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together
 unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was
 brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai,
 keeper of the women.
 &nbsp; 9  And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him;
 and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such
 things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, <I>which were</I> meet
 to be given her, out of the king's house: and he preferred her
 and her maids unto the best <I>place</I> of the house of the women.
 &nbsp; 10  Esther had not showed her people nor her kindred: for
 Mordecai had charged her that she should not show <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 11  And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the
 women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of
 her.
 &nbsp; 12  Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king
 Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to
 the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their
 purifications accomplished, <I>to wit,</I> six months with oil of
 myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with <I>other</I> things
 for the purifying of the women;)
 &nbsp; 13  Then thus came <I>every</I> maiden unto the king; whatsoever she
 desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the
 women unto the king's house.
 &nbsp; 14  In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into
 the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the
 king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto
 the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she
 were called by name.
 &nbsp; 15  Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the
 uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come
 to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the
 king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And
 Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon
 her.
 &nbsp; 16  So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal
 in the tenth month, which <I>is</I> the month Tebeth, in the seventh
 year of his reign.
 &nbsp; 17  And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she
 obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins;
 so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen
 instead of Vashti.
 &nbsp; 18  Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and
 his servants, <I>even</I> Esther's feast; and he made a release to the
 provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.
 &nbsp; 19  And when the virgins were gathered together the second time,
 then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.
 &nbsp; 20  Esther had not <I>yet</I> showed her kindred nor her people; as
 Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of
 Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 How God put down one that was high and mighty from her seat we read in 
 the chapter before, and are now to be told how he exalted one of low 
 degree, as the virgin Mary observes in her song 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:52">Luke i. 52</A>)

 and Hannah before her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:4-8">1 Sam. ii. 4-8</A>.

 Vashti being humbled for her height, Esther is advanced for her
 humility.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The extravagant course that was taken to please the king with 
 another wife instead of Vashti. Josephus says that when his anger was 
 over he was exceedingly grieved that the matter was carried so far, and 
 would have been reconciled to Vashti but that, by the constitution of 
 the government, the judgment was irrevocable--that therefore, to make
 him forget her, they contrived how to entertain him first with a great 
 variety of concubines, and then to fix him to the most agreeable of 
 them all for a wife instead of Vashti. The marriages of princes are 
 commonly made by policy and interest, for the enlarging of their 
 dominions and the strengthening of their alliances; but this must be 
 made partly by the agreeableness of the person to the king's fancy, 
 whether she was rich or poor, noble or ignoble. What pains were taken 
 to humour the king! As if his power and wealth were given him for no 
 other end than that he might have all the delights of the sense wound 
 up to the height of pleasurableness, and exquisitely refined, though at 
 the best they are but dross and dregs in comparison with divine and 
 spiritual pleasures. 

 1. All the provinces of his kingdom must be searched for fair young
 virgins, and officers appointed to choose them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 2. A house (a seraglio) was prepared on purpose for them, and a person
 appointed to have the charge of them, to see that they were well 
 provided for. 

 3. No less than twelve months was allowed them for their purification,
 some of them at least who were brought out of the country, that they 
 might be very clean, and perfumed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Even those who were the masterpieces of nature must yet have all this
 help from art to recommend them to a vain and carnal mind. 

 4. After the king had once taken them to his bed, they were made
 recluses ever after, except the king pleased at any time to send for 
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 they were looked upon as secondary wives, were maintained by the king
 accordingly, and might not marry. We may see, by this instance, to what 
 absurd practices those came who were destitute of divine revelation, 
 and who, as a punishment for their idolatry, were given up to vile 
 affections. Having broken through that law of creation which resulted 
 from God's making man, they broke through another law, which was 
 founded upon his making one man and one woman. See what need there was 
 of the gospel of Christ to purify men from the lusts of the flesh and 
 to reduce them to the original institution. Those that have <I>learned 
 Christ</I> will think it <I>a shame even to speak of such things as</I> 
 these which <I>were done of them,</I> not only <I>in secret,</I> but 
 avowedly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:12">Eph. v. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The overruling providence of God thus bringing Esther to be queen. 
 Had she been recommended to Ahasuerus for a wife, he would have 
 rejected the motion with disdain; but when she came in her turn, after 
 several others, and it was found that though many of them were 
 ingenious and discreet, graceful and agreeable, yet Esther excelled 
 them all, way was made for her, even by her rivals, into the king's 
 affections and the honours consequent thereupon. It is certain, as 
 bishop Patrick says, that those who suggest that she committed a great 
 sin to come at this dignity do not consider the custom of those times 
 and countries. Every one that the king took to his bed was married to 
 him, and was his wife of a lower rank, as Hagar was Abraham's; so that, 
 if Esther had not been made queen, the sons of Jacob need not say that 
 he <I>dealt with their sister as with a harlot.</I> Concerning Esther 
 we must observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Her original and character. 

 (1.) She was one of the <I>children of the captivity,</I> a Jewess and
 a sharer with her people in their bondage. Daniel and his fellows were 
 advanced in the land where they were captives; for they were of those 
 whom God sent thither <I>for their good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:5">Jer. xxiv. 5</A>.

 (2.) She was an orphan; her father and mother were both dead

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 but, when they had forsaken here, then the Lord took her up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:10">Ps. xxvii. 10</A>.

 When those whose unhappiness it is to be thus deprived of their parents 
 in their childhood yet afterwards come to be eminently pious and 
 prosperous, we ought to take notice of it to the glory of that God, and 
 his grace and providence, who has taken it among the titles of his 
 honour to be a <I>Father of the fatherless.</I>

 (3.) She was a beauty, <I>fair of form, good of countenance;</I> so it
 is in the margin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Her wisdom and virtue were her greatest beauty, but it is an advantage
 to be a diamond to be well set.

 (4.) Mordecai, her cousin-german, was her guardian, <I>brought her up,
 and took her for his own daughter.</I> The LXX. says that he designed 
 to make her his wife; if that were so, he was to be praised that he 
 opposed not her better preferment. Let God be acknowledged in raising
 up friends for the fatherless and motherless; let it be an 
 encouragement to that pious instance of charity that many who have 
 taken care of the education of orphans have lived to see the good fruit 
 of their care and pains, abundantly to their comfort. Dr.  Lightfoot 
 thinks that this Mordecai is the same with that mentioned in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:2">Ezra ii. 2</A>,

 who went up to Jerusalem with the first, and helped forward the 
 settlement of his people until the building of the temple was stopped, 
 and then went back to the Persian court, to see what service he could 
 do them there. Mordecai being Esther's guardian or pro-parent, we are 
 told,

 [1.] How tender he was of her, as if she had been his own child

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 he walked before her door every day, to know how she did, and what
 interest she had. Let those whose relations are thus cast upon them by 
 divine Providence be thus kindly affectioned to them and solicitous for 
 them. 

 [2.] How respectful she was to him.  Though in relation she was his
 equal, yet, being in age and dependence his inferior, she honoured him 
 as her father--<I>did his commandment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 This is an example to orphans; if they fall into the hands of those who
 love them and take care of them, let them make suitable returns of duty 
 and affection. The less obliged their guardians were in duty to provide 
 for them the more obliged they are in gratitude to honour and obey 
 their guardians. Here is an instance of Esther's obsequiousness t 
 Mordecai, that she did not <I>show her people of her kindred,</I> 
 because Mordecai had charged her that she should not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He did not bid her deny her country, nor tell a lie to conceal her
 parentage; if he had told her to do so, she must not have done it. But 
 he only told her not to proclaim her country. All truths are not to be 
 spoken at all times, though an untruth is not to be spoken at any time. 
 She being born in Shushan, and her parents being dead, all took her to 
 be of Persian extraction, and she was not bound to undeceive them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Her preferment. Who would have thought that a Jewess, a captive, and 
 orphan, was born to be a queen, an empress! Yet so it proved. 
 Providence sometimes <I>raiseth up the poor out of the dust, to set 
 them among princes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:8">1 Sam. ii. 8</A>.

 (1.) The king's chamberlain honoured her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 and was ready to serve her. Wisdom and virtue will gain respect. Those
 that make sure of God's favour shall find favour with man too as far as 
 it is good for them.  All that looked upon Esther admired her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 and concluded that she was the lady that would win the prize, and she
 did win it.

 (2.) The king himself fell in love with her. She was not solicitous, as
 the rest of the maidens were, to set herself off with artificial 
 beauty; she <I>required nothing</I> but just what was <I>appointed</I> 
 for her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 and yet she was most acceptable. The more natural beauty is the more
 agreeable. <I>The king loved Esther above all the women,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 Now he needed not to make any further trials, or take time to
 deliberate; he is soon determined to <I>set the royal crown upon her 
 head, and make her queen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 This was done in his seventh year

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)
 
 and Vashti was divorced in his third year

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:3"><I>ch.</I> i. 3</A>);

 so that he was four years without a queen.  Notice is taken, 

 [1.] Of the honours the king put upon Esther. He graced the solemnity
 of her coronation with a <I>royal feast</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 at which perhaps Esther, in compliance with the king, made a public
 appearance, which Vashti had refused to do, that she might have the 
 praise of obedience in the same instance in which the other incurred 
 the blot of disobedience. He also granted a <I>release to the 
 provinces,</I> either a remittance of the taxes in arrear or an act of 
 grace for criminals; as Pilate, at the feast, released a prisoner. This 
 was to add t the joy. 

 [2.] Of the deference Esther continued to pay to her former guardian.
 She still <I>did the commandment of Mordecai, as when she was brought 
 up with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Mordecai say <I>in the king's gate;</I> that was the height of his
 preferment: he was one of the porters or door-keepers of the court. 
 Whether he had this place before, or whether Esther obtained it for 
 him, we are not told; but there he sat contentedly, and aimed no 
 higher; and yet Esther who was advanced to the throne was observant of 
 him. This was an evidence of a humble and grateful disposition, that 
 she had a sense of his former kindnesses and his continued wisdom. It 
 is a great ornament to those that are advanced, and much to their 
 praise, to remember their benefactors, to retain the impressions of 
 their good education, to be diffident of themselves, willing to take 
 advice, and thankful for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of
 the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept
 the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king
 Ahasuerus.
 &nbsp; 22  And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told <I>it</I> unto
 Esther the queen; and Esther certified the king <I>thereof</I> in
 Mordecai's name.
 &nbsp; 23  And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found
 out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was
 written in the book of the chronicles before the king.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This good service which Mordecai did to the government, in discovering 
 a plot against the life of the king, is here recorded, because the 
 mention of it will again occur to his advantage. No step is yet taken 
 towards Haman's design of the Jews' destruction, but several steps are 
 taken towards God's design of their deliverance, and this for one. God 
 now gives Mordecai an opportunity of doing the king a good turn, that 
 he might have the fairer opportunity afterwards of doing the Jews a 
 good turn. 

 1. A design was laid against the king by two of his own servants, who
 sought <I>to lay hands on him,</I> not only to make him a prisoner, but 
 to take away his life,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Probably they resented some affront which they thought he had given
 them, or some injury which he had done them. Who would be great, to be 
 so much the object of envy?  Who would be arbitrary, to be so much the 
 object of ill-will? Princes, above any mortals, have their souls 
 continually in their hands, and often go down <I>slain to the pit,</I> 
 especially those who <I>caused terror in the land of the living.</I> 

 2.  Mordecai got notice of their treason, and, by Esther's means,
 discovered it to the king, hereby confirming her in and recommending 
 himself to the king's favour. How he came to the knowledge of it does 
 not appear. Whether he overheard their discourse, or whether they 
 offered to draw him in with them, so it was that <I>the thing was 
 known</I> to him. This ought to be a warning against all traitorous and 
 seditious practices: though men presume upon secresy, <I>a bird of the 
 air shall carry the voice.</I> Mordecai, as soon as he knew it, caused 
 it to be made known to the king, which ought to be an instruction and 
 example to all that would be found good subjects not to conceal any bad 
 design they know of against the prince or the public peace, for it is 
 making a confederacy with public enemies. 

 3. The traitors were hanged, as they deserved, but not till their
 treason was, upon search, fully proved against them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 and the whole matter was recorded in the king's journals, with a
 particular remark that Mordecai was the man who discovered the treason. 
 He was not rewarded presently, but a book of remembrance was written. 
 Thus with respect to those who serve Christ, though their recompence is 
 adjourned till the resurrection of the just, yet an account is kept of 
 their <I>work of faith and labour of love,</I> which <I>God is not 
 unrighteous to forget,</I>
