 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 More than once we have found the affairs of Israel, even when they were 
 in the happiest posture and gave the most hopeful prospects, perplexed 
 and embarrassed by sin, and a stop thereby put to the most promising 
 proceedings. The golden calf, the murmuring at Kadesh, and the iniquity 
 of Peor, had broken their measures and given them great disturbance; 
 and in this chapter we have such another instance of the interruption 
 given to the progress of their arms by sin. But it being only the sin 
 of one person or family, and soon expiated, the consequences were not 
 so mischievous as of those other sins; however it served to let them 
 know that they were still upon their good behaviour. We have here,

 I.  The sin of Achan in meddling with the accursed thing,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II.  The defeat of Israel before Ai thereupon,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+8:2-5">ver. 2-5</A>.

 III. Joshua's humiliation and prayer on occasion of that sad disaster, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+8:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.

 IV.  The directions God gave him for the putting away of the
 guilt which had provoked God thus to contend with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+8:10-15">ver. 10-15</A>.

 V.  The discovery, trial, conviction, condemnation, and execution, of
 the criminal, by which the anger of God was turned away, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+8:16-26">ver. 16-26</A>.

 And by this story it appears that, as the laws, so Canaan itself, "made
 nothing perfect," the perfection both of holiness and peace to God's 
 Israel is to be expected in the heavenly Canaan only.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the
 accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi,
 the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed
 thing: and the anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was kindled against the children
 of Israel.
 &nbsp; 2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which <I>is</I> beside
 Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them,
 saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and
 viewed Ai.
 &nbsp; 3 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all
 the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up
 and smite Ai; <I>and</I> make not all the people to labour thither;
 for they <I>are but</I> few.
 &nbsp; 4 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand
 men: and they fled before the men of Ai.
 &nbsp; 5 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for
 they chased them <I>from</I> before the gate <I>even</I> unto Shebarim, and
 smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people
 melted, and became as water.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The story of this chapter begins with a <I>but. The Lord was with 
 Joshua, and his fame was noised through all that country,</I> so the 
 foregoing chapter ends, and it left no room to doubt but that he would 
 go on as he had begun <I>conquering and to conquer.</I> He did right, 
 and observed his orders in every thing. <I>But the children of Israel 
 committed a trespass,</I> and so set God against them; and then even 
 Joshua's name and fame, his wisdom and courage, could do them no 
 service. If we lose our God, we lose our friends, who cannot help us 
 unless God be for us. Now here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Achan sinning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Here is only a general mention made of the sin; we shall afterwards
 have a more particular account of it from his own mouth. The sin is 
 here said to be <I>taking of the accursed thing,</I> in disobedience to 
 the command and in defiance of the threatening,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+6:18"><I>ch.</I> vi. 18</A>.

 In the sacking of Jericho orders were given that they should neither
 spare any lives nor take any treasure to themselves; we read not of the 
 breach of the former prohibition (there were none to whom they showed 
 any mercy), but of the latter: compassion was put off and yielded to 
 the law, but covetousness was indulged. The love of the world is that 
 root of bitterness which of all others is most hardly rooted up. Yet 
 the history of Achan is a plain intimation that he of all the thousands 
 of Israel was the only delinquent in this matter. Had there been more 
 in like manner guilty, no doubt we should have heard of it: and it is 
 strange there were no more. The temptation was strong. It was easy to 
 suggest what a pity it was that so many things of value should be 
 burnt; to what purpose is this waste? In plundering cities, every man 
 reckons himself entitled to what he can lay his hands on. It was easy 
 to promise themselves secrecy and impunity. Yet by the grace of God 
 such impressions were made upon the minds of the Israelites by the 
 ordinances of God, circumcision and the passover, which they had lately 
 been partakers of, and by the providences of God which had been 
 concerning them, that they stood in awe of the divine precept and 
 judgment, and generously denied themselves in obedience to their God.  
 And yet, though it was a single person that sinned, the children of 
 Israel are said <I>to commit the trespass,</I> because one of their 
 body did it, and he was not as yet separated from them, nor disowned by 
 them. They did it, that is, by what Achan did guilt was brought upon 
 the whole society of which he was a member. This should be a warning to 
 us to take heed of sin ourselves, lest by it many be defiled or 
 disquieted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:15">Heb. xii. 15</A>),

 and to take heed of having fellowship with sinners, and of being in
 league with them, lest we share in their guilt. Many a careful 
 tradesman has been broken by a careless partner.  And it concerns us to 
 watch over one another for the preventing of sin, because others' sins 
 may redound to our damage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The camp of Israel suffering for the same: <I>The anger of the Lord 
 was kindled against Israel;</I> he saw the offence, though they did 
 not, and takes a course to make them see it; for one way or other, 
 sooner or later, secret sins will be brought to light; and, if men 
 enquire not after them, God will, and with his enquiries will awaken 
 theirs. Many a community is under guilt and wrath and is not aware of it
 till the fire breaks out: here it broke out quickly. 

 1. Joshua sends a detachment to seize upon the next city that was in 
 their way, and that was Ai. Only 3000 men were sent, advice being 
 brought him by his spies that the place was inconsiderable, and needed 
 no greater force for the reduction of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 Now perhaps it was a culpable assurance, or security rather that led
 them to send so small a party on this expedition; it might also be an 
 indulgence of the people in the love of ease, for they will not have 
 all <I>the people to labour thither.</I> Perhaps the people were the 
 less forward to go upon this expedition because they were denied the 
 plunder of Jericho; and these spies were willing they should be 
 gratified. Whereas when the town was to be taken, though God by his own 
 power would throw down the walls, yet they must <I>all labour 
 thither</I> and <I>labour there</I> too, in walking round it. It did 
 not bode well at all that God's Israel began to think much of their 
 labour, and contrived how to spare their pains.  It is required that we 
 <I>work out our salvation,</I> though it is <I>God that works in 
 us.</I> It has likewise often proved of bad consequence to make too 
 light of an enemy. <I>They are but few</I> (say the spies), but, as few 
 as they were, they were too many for them. It will awaken our care and 
 diligence in our Christian warfare to consider that <I>we wrestle with 
 principalities and powers.</I>

 2. The party he sent, in their first attack upon the town, were 
 repulsed with some loss 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>):

 <I>They fled before the men of Ai,</I> finding themselves unaccountably
 dispirited, and their enemies to sally out upon them with more vigour 
 and resolution than they expected. In their retreat they had about 
 thirty-six men cut off: no great loss indeed out of such a number, but 
 a dreadful surprise to those who had no reason to expect any other in 
 any attack than clear, cheap, and certain victory. And now, as it 
 proves, it is well there were but 3000 that fell under this disgrace. 
 Had the body of the army been there, they would have been no more able 
 to keep their ground, now they were under guilt and wrath, than this 
 small party, and to them the defeat would have been much more grievous 
 and dishonourable. However, it was bad enough as it was, and served,

 (1.) To humble God's Israel, and to teach them always to <I>rejoice 
 with trembling. Let not him that girdeth on the harness boast as he 
 that putteth if off.</I> 

 (2.) To harden the Canaanites, and to make them the more secure 
 notwithstanding the terrors they had been struck with, that their ruin, 
 when it came, might be the more dreadful.

 (3.) To be an evidence of God's displeasure against Israel, and a call 
 to them to <I>purge out the old leaven.</I> And this was principally 
 intended in their defeat. 

 3. The retreat of this party in disorder put the whole camp of Israel 
 into a fright: <I>The hearts of the people melted,</I> not so much for 
 the loss as for the disappointment. Joshua had assured them that <I>the 
 living God would without fail drive out the Canaanites from before 
 them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:10"><I>ch.</I> iii. 10</A>.

 How can this event be reconciled to that promise? To every thinking man
 among them it appeared an indication of God's displeasure, and an omen 
 of something worse, and therefore no marvel it put them into such a 
 consternation; if <I>God turn to be their enemy and fight against 
 them,</I> what will become of them? True Israelites tremble when God is 
 angry.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his
 face before the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> until the eventide, he and the
 elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.
 &nbsp; 7 And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>, wherefore hast thou at all
 brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of
 the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content,
 and dwelt on the other side Jordan!
 &nbsp; 8 O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs
 before their enemies!
 &nbsp; 9 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall
 hear <I>of it,</I> and shall environ us round, and cut off our name
 from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the deep concern Joshua was in upon this sad 
 occasion. He, as a public person, interested himself more than any 
 other in this public loss, and is therein an example to princes and 
 great men, and teaches them to lay much to heart the calamities that 
 befal their people: he is also a type of Christ, to whom the blood of 
 his subjects is precious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:14">Ps. lxxii. 14</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he grieved: He <I>rent his clothes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 in token of great sorrow for this public disaster, and especially a
 dread of God's displeasure, which was certainly the cause of it. Had it 
 been but the common chance of war (as we are too apt to express it), it 
 would not have become a general to droop thus under it; but, when God 
 was angry, it was his duty and honour to feel thus. One of the bravest 
 soldiers that ever was owned that his <I>flesh trembled for fear of 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:120">Ps.  cxix. 120</A>.

 As one <I>humbling himself under the mighty had of God, he fell to the
 earth upon his face,</I> not thinking it any disparagement to him to 
 lie thus low before the great God, to whom he directed this token of 
 reverence, by keeping his eye towards <I>the ark of the Lord.</I> The 
 elders of Israel, being interested in the cause and influenced by his 
 example, prostrated themselves with him, and, in token of deep 
 humiliation, <I>put dust upon their heads,</I> not only as mourners, 
 but as penitents; not doubting but it was for some sin or other that 
 God did thus contend with them (though they knew not what it was), they 
 <I>humbled themselves</I> before God, and thus deprecated the progress 
 of his wrath. This they continued <I>until even-tide,</I> to show that 
 it was not the result of a sudden feeling, but proceeded from a deep 
 conviction of their misery and danger if God were any way provoked to 
 depart from them. Joshua did not fall foul upon his spies for their 
 misinformation concerning the strength of the enemy, nor upon the 
 soldiers for their cowardice, though perhaps both were blameworthy, but 
 <I>his eye is up to God;</I> for <I>is there any evil in the camp and 
 he has not done it?</I> His eye is upon God as displeased, and that 
 troubles him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he prayed, or pleaded rather, humbly expostulating the case 
 with God, not sullen, as David when <I>the Lord had made a breach upon 
 Uzzah,</I> but much affected; his spirit seemed to be somewhat ruffled 
 and discomposed, yet not so as to be put out of frame for prayer; but, 
 by giving vent to his trouble in a humble address to God, he keeps his 
 temper and it ends well. 

 1. Now he wishes they had all taken up with the lot of the two tribes 
 on the other side Jordan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He thinks it would have been better to have staid there and been cut
 short than come hither to be cut off.  This savours too much of 
 discontent and distrust of God, and cannot be justified, though the 
 surprise and disappointment to one deeply concerned for the public 
 interest may in part excuse it.  Those words, <I>wherefore hast thou 
 brought us over Jordan to destroy us?</I> are too like what the 
 murmurers often said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:11,12,16:3,17:3,Nu+14:2,3">Exod. xiv. 11, 12;
 xvi. 3; xvii. 3; Num. xiv. 2, 3</A>);

 but he that searches the heart knew they came from another spirit, and
 therefore was not extreme to mark what he said amiss. Had Joshua 
 considered that this disorder which their affairs were put into no 
 doubt proceeded from something amiss, which yet might easily be 
 redressed, and all set to rights again (as often in his predecessor's 
 time), he would not have spoken of it as a thing taken for granted that 
 they were <I>delivered into the hands of the Amorites to be 
 destroyed.</I> God knows what he does, though we do not; but this we 
 may be sure of, he never did nor ever will do us any wrong.  

 2. He speaks as one quite at a loss concerning the meaning of this 
 event 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:8"><I>v.</I>  8</A>):

 "<I>What shall I say,</I> what construction can I put upon it, <I>when
 Israel,</I> thy own people, for whom thou hast lately done such great 
 things and to whom thou hast promised the full possession of this land, 
 when they <I>turn their backs before their enemies</I>" (their 
 <I>necks,</I> so the word is), "when they not only flee before them, 
 but fall before them, and become a prey to them? What shall we think of 
 the divine power? Is the Lord's arm shortened? Of the divine promise?  
 Is his word yea and nay? Of what God has done for us?  Shall this be 
 all undone again and prove in vain?" Note, The methods of Providence 
 are often intricate and perplexing, and such as the wisest and best of 
 men know not what to say to; but <I>they shall know hereafter,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:7">John xiii. 7</A>.

 3. He pleads the danger Israel was now in of being ruined. He gives up
 all for lost: "<I>The Canaanites will environ us round,</I> concluding 
 that now our defence having departed, and the scales being turned in 
 their favour, we shall soon be as contemptible as ever we were 
 formidable, and they will <I>cut off our name from the earth,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Thus even good men, when things go against them a little, are too apt
 to fear the worst, and make harder conclusions than there is reason 
 for. But his comes in here as a plea: "Lord, let not Israel's name, 
 which has been so dear to thee and so great in the world, be cut off."

 4. He pleads the reproach that would be cast on God, and that if Israel 
 were ruined his glory would suffer by it. They will <I>cut off our 
 name,</I> says he, yet, as if he had corrected himself for insisting 
 upon that, it is no great matter (thinks he) what becomes of our little 
 name (the cutting off of that will be a small loss), but <I>what wilt 
 thou do for thy great name?</I> this he looks upon and laments as the 
 great aggravation of the calamity. He feared it would reflect on God, 
 his wisdom and power, his goodness and faithfulness; what would the 
 Egyptians say? Note, Nothing is more grievous to a gracious soul than 
 dishonour done to God's name. This also he insists upon as a plea for 
 the preventing of his fears and for a return of God's favour; it is the 
 only word in all his address that has any encouragement in it, and he 
 concludes with it, leaving it to this issue, <I>Father, glorify thy 
 name.</I> The name of God is a great name, above every name; and, 
 whatever happens, we ought to believe that he will, and pray that he 
 would, work for his own name, that <I>this may not be polluted.</I> 
 This should be our concern more than any thing else. On this we must 
 fix our eye as the end of all our desires, and from this we must fetch 
 our encouragement as the foundation of all our hopes. We cannot urge a 
 better plea than this, Lord, <I>What wilt thou do for thy great 
 name?</I> Let God in all be glorified, and then welcome his whole 
 will.</P>

 thou thus upon thy face?
 &nbsp; 11 Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my
 covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the
 accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and
 they have put <I>it</I> even among their own stuff.
 &nbsp; 12 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before
 their enemies, <I>but</I> turned <I>their</I> backs before their enemies,
 because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more,
 except ye destroy the accursed from among you.
 &nbsp; 13 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves
 against to morrow: for thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, <I>There
 is</I> an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst
 not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed
 thing from among you.
 &nbsp; 14 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to
 your tribes: and it shall be, <I>that</I> the tribe which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 taketh shall come according to the families <I>thereof;</I> and the
 family which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall take shall come by households; and

 thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because

 hath wrought folly in Israel.

 We have here God's answer to Joshua's address, which, we may suppose, 
 came from the oracle over the ark, before which Joshua had prostrated 
 himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Those that desire to know the will of God must attend with their
 desires upon the lively oracles, and wait at wisdom's gates for 
 wisdom's dictates,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:34">Prov. viii. 34</A>.

 And let those that find themselves under the tokens of God's
 displeasure never complain <I>of</I> him, but complain <I>to</I> him, 
 and they shall receive an answer of peace. The answer came immediately, 
 <I>while he was yet speaking</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:24">Isa. lxv. 24</A>),
 
 as that to Daniel,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:20">Dan. ix. 20</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God encourages Joshua against his present despondencies, and the 
 black and melancholy apprehensions he had of the present posture of 
 Israel's affairs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>Get thee up,</I> suffer not thy spirits to droop and sink thus;
 <I>wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?</I>" No doubt Joshua did 
 well to humble himself before God, and mourn as he did, under the 
 tokens of his displeasure; but now God told him it was enough, he would 
 not have him continue any longer in that melancholy posture, for God 
 delights not in the grief of penitents when they afflict their souls 
 further than as it qualifies them for pardon and peace; the days even 
 of that mourning must be ended. <I>Arise, shake thyself from the 
 dust,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:2">Isa. liii. 2</A>.
 
 Joshua continued his mourning <I>till eventide</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 so late that they could do nothing that night towards the discovery of
 the criminal, but were forced to put it off till next morning. Daniel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:21">Dan. ix. 21</A>),
 
 and Ezra
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:5,6">Ezra ix. 5, 6</A>),

 continued their mourning only <I>till the time of the evening
 sacrifice;</I> that revived them both: but Joshua went past that time, 
 and therefore is thus roused: "<I>Get thee up,</I> do not lie all night 
 there." Yet we find that Moses fell down before the Lord forty days and 
 forty nights, to make intercession for Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:18">Deut. ix. 18</A>.

 Joshua must get up because he has other work to do than to lie there;
 the accursed thing must be discovered and cast out, and the sooner the 
 better; Joshua is the man that must do it, and therefore it is time for 
 him to lay aside his mourning weeds, and put on his judge's robes, and 
 <I>clothe himself with zeal as a cloak.</I> Weeping must not hinder 
 sowing, nor one duty of religion jostle out another. Every thing is 
 beautiful in its season. Shechaniah perhaps had an eye to this in what 
 he said to Ezra upon a like occasion. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+10:2-4">Ezra x. 2-4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He informs him of the true and only cause of this disaster, and 
 shows him wherefore he contended with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Israel hath sinned.</I> "Think not that God's mind is changed, his
 arm shortened, or his promise about to fail; no, it is sin, it is sin, 
 that great mischief-maker, that has stopped the current of divine 
 favours and has made this breach upon you." The sinner is not named, 
 though the sin is described, but it is spoken of as the act of Israel 
 in general, till they have fastened it upon the particular person, and 
 their <I>godly sorrow</I> have so wrought a <I>clearing of 
 themselves,</I> as theirs did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:11">2 Cor. vii. 11</A>.

 Observe how the sin is here made to appear exceedingly sinful. 

 1.  <I>They have transgressed my covenant,</I> an express precept with 
 a penalty annexed to it. It was agreed that God should have all the 
 spoil of Jericho, and they should have the spoil of the rest of the 
 cities of Canaan; but, in robbing God of his part, they <I>transgressed 
 this covenant.</I> 

 2. <I>They have even taken of the devoted thing,</I> in contempt of the 
 curse which was so solemnly denounced against him that should dare to 
 break in upon God's property, as if that curse had nothing in it 
 formidable. 

 3. They <I>have also stolen;</I> they did it clandestinely, as if they 
 could conceal it from the divine omniscience, and they were ready to 
 say, <I>The Lord shall not see,</I> or will not miss so small a matter 
 out of so great a spoil. Thus <I>thou thoughtest I was altogether such 
 a one as thyself.</I> 

 4. They have <I>dissembled</I> also. Probably, when the action was 
 over, Joshua called all the tribes, and asked them whether they had 
 faithfully disposed of the spoil according to the divine command, and 
 charged them, if they knew of any transgression, that they should 
 discover it, but Achan joined with the rest in a general protestation 
 of innocency, and kept his countenance, like the adulterous woman that 
 <I>eats and wipes her mouth, and says, I have done no wickedness.</I> 
 Nay, 

 5. They have put the accursed thing <I>among their own goods,</I> as if 
 they had as good a title to that as to any thing they have, never 
 expecting to be called to an account, nor designing to make 
 restitution. All this Joshua, though a wise and vigilant ruler, knew 
 nothing of, till God told him, who knows all the secret wickedness that 
 is in the world, which men know nothing of God could at this time have 
 told him who the person was that had done this thing, but he does not,

 (1.) To exercise the zeal of Joshua and Israel, in searching out the 
 criminal. 

 (2.) To give the sinner himself space to repent and make confession.
 Joshua no doubt proclaimed it immediately throughout the camp that 
 there was such a transgression committed, upon which, if Achan had 
 surrendered himself, and penitently owned his guilt, and prevented the 
 scrutiny, who knows but he might have had the benefit of that law which 
 accepted of a trespass-offering, with restitution, from those that had 
 <I>sinned through ignorance in the holy things of the law?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+5:15,16">Lev. v. 15, 16</A>.

 But Achan never discovering himself till the lot discovered him
 evidenced the hardness of his heart, and therefore he found no 
 mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He awakens him to enquire further into it, by telling him, 

 1. That this was the only ground for the controversy God had with them, 
 this, and nothing else; so that when this accursed thing was put away 
 he needed not fear, all would be well, the stream of their successes, 
 when this one obstruction was removed, would run as strong as ever. 

 2.  That if this accursed thing were not destroyed they could not 
 expect the return of God's gracious presence; in plain terms, 
 <I>neither will I be with you any more as</I> I have been, <I>except 
 you destroy the accursed,</I> that is, the accursed person, who is made 
 so by the accursed thing. That which is accursed will be destroyed; and 
 those whom God has entrusted to bear the sword bear it in vain if they 
 make it not a terror to that wickedness which brings these judgments of 
 God on a land. By personal repentance and reformation, we destroy the 
 accursed thing in our own hearts, and, unless we do this, we must never 
 expect the favour of the blessed God. Let all men know that it is 
 nothing but sin that separates between them and God, and, if it be not 
 sincerely repented of and forsaken, it will separate eternally.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He directs him in what method to make this enquiry and prosecution. 
 
 1. He must <I>sanctify the people,</I> now over-night, that is, as it
 is explained, he must command them to <I>sanctify themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 And what can either magistrates or ministers do more towards
 sanctification? They must put themselves into a suitable frame to 
 appear before God and submit to the divine scrutiny, must examine 
 themselves, now that God was coming to examine them, must <I>prepare to 
 meet their God.</I> They were called to sanctify themselves when they 
 were to <I>receive the divine law</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:1-25">Exod. xix.</A>),

 and now also when they were to <I>come under the divine judgment;</I>
 for in both God is to be attended with the utmost reverence. "There is 
 <I>an accursed thing in the midst of you,</I> and therefore <I>sanctify 
 yourselves,</I>" that is, Let all that are innocent be able to clear 
 themselves, and be the more careful to cleanse themselves. The sin of 
 others may be improved by us as furtherances of our sanctification, as 
 the scandal of the incestuous Corinthian occasioned a blessed 
 reformation in that church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:11">2 Cor. vii. 11</A>.

 2. He must bring them all under the scrutiny of the lot 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:14"><I>v.</I>  14</A>);

 the tribe which the guilty person was of should first be discovered by
 lot, then the family, then the household, and last of all the person. 
 The conviction came upon him thus gradually that he might have some 
 space given him to come in and surrender himself; for God is <I>not 
 willing that any should perish, but that all should come to 
 repentance.</I> Observe, The Lord is said to take the tribe, and 
 family, and household, on which the lot fell, because <I>the disposal 
 of the lot is of the Lord,</I> and, however casual it seems, is under 
 the direction of infinite wisdom and justice; and to show that when the 
 sin of sinners finds them out God is to be acknowledged in it; it is he 
 that seizes them, and the arrests are in his name. <I>God hath found 
 out the iniquity of thy servants,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+44:16">Gen. xliv. 16</A>.

 It is also intimated with what a certain and unerring judgment the
 righteous God does and will distinguish between the innocent and the 
 guilty, so that though for a time they seem involved in the same 
 condemnation, as the whole tribe did when it was first taken by the 
 lot, yet he who has his fan in his hand will effectually provide for 
 the <I>taking out of the precious from the vile;</I> so that though the 
 righteous be of the same tribe, and family, and household, with the 
 wicked, yet they shall never be treated <I>as the wicked,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:25">Gen. xviii. 25</A>.

 3. When the criminal was found out he must be put to death <I>without 
 mercy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:28">Heb. x. 28</A>),

 and with all the expressions of a holy detestation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 He and all that he has must be burnt with fire, that there might be no
 remainders of the accursed thing among them; and the reason given for 
 this severe sentence is because the criminal has,

 (1.) Given a great affront to God: He has <I>transgressed the covenant 
 of the Lord,</I> who is jealous particularly for the honour of the holy 
 covenant. 

 (2.) He has done a great injury to the church of God: He has <I>wrought 
 folly in Israel,</I> has shamed that nation which is looked upon by all 
 its neighbours to be a <I>wise and understanding people,</I> has 
 infected that nation which is sanctified to God, and troubled that 
 nation of which he is the protector. These being crimes so heinous in 
 their nature, and of such pernicious consequence and example, the 
 execution, which otherwise would have come under the imputation of 
 cruelty, is to be applauded as a piece of necessary justice. It was 
 <I>sacrilege;</I> it was invading God's rights, alienating his 
 property, and converting to a private use that which was devoted to his 
 glory and appropriated to the service of his sanctuary--this was the
 crime to be thus severely punished, for warning to all people in all 
 ages to take heed how they rob God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel
 by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
 &nbsp; 17 And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family
 of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by
 man; and Zabdi was taken:
 &nbsp; 18 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son
 of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of
 Judah, was taken.
 &nbsp; 19 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory
 to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell
 me now what thou hast done; hide <I>it</I> not from me.
 &nbsp; 20 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned
 against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
 &nbsp; 21 When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and
 two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty
 shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold,
 they <I>are</I> hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the
 silver under it.
 &nbsp; 22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,
 behold, <I>it was</I> hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
 &nbsp; 23 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought
 them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid
 them out before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 24 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of
 Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold,
 and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and
 his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought
 them unto the valley of Achor.
 &nbsp; 25 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall
 trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and
 burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.
 &nbsp; 26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this
 day. So the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> turned from the fierceness of his anger.
 Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor,
 unto this day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The discovery of Achan by the lot, which proved a perfect lot, 
 though it proceeded gradually. Though we may suppose that Joshua slept 
 the better, and with more ease and satisfaction, when he knew the worst 
 of the disease of that body of which, under God, he was the head, and 
 was put into a certain method of cure, yet <I>he rose up early in the 
 morning</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 so much was his heart upon it, to put away the accursed thing. We have
 found Joshua upon other occasions an early riser; here it shows his 
 zeal and vehement desire to see Israel restored to the divine favour. 
 In the scrutiny observe,

 1. That the guilty tribe was that of Judah, which was, and was to be, 
 of all the tribes, the most honourable and illustrious; this was an 
 alloy to their dignity, and might serve as a check to their pride: many 
 there were who were its glories, but here was one that was its 
 reproach. Let not the best families think it strange if there be those 
 found in them, and descending from them, that prove their grief and 
 shame. Judah was to have the first and largest lot in Canaan; the more 
 inexcusable is one of that tribe it, not content to wait for his own 
 share, he break in upon God's property. The Jews' tradition is that 
 when the tribe of Judah was taken the valiant men of that tribe drew 
 their swords, and professed they would not sheathe them again till they 
 saw the criminal punished and themselves cleared who knew their own 
 innocency. 

 2. That the guilty person was at length fastened upon, and the language 
 of the lot was, <I>Thou art the man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 It was strange that Achan, being conscious to himself of guilt, when he
 saw the lot come nearer and nearer to him, had not either the wit to 
 make an escape or the grace to make a confession; but <I>his heart was 
 hardened through the deceitfulness of sin,</I> and it proved to be 
 <I>to his own destruction.</I> We may well imagine how his countenance 
 changed, and what horror and confusion seized him when he was singled 
 out as the delinquent, when the eyes of all Israel were fastened upon 
 him, and every one was ready to say, <I>Have we found thee, O our 
 enemy?</I> See here,

 (1.) The folly of those that promise themselves secrecy in sin: the 
 righteous God has many ways of bringing to light the hidden works of 
 darkness, and so bringing to shame and ruin those that continue their 
 fellowship with those unfruitful works. <I>A bird of the air,</I> when 
 God pleases, shall <I>carry the voice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:20">Eccl. x. 20</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:7">Ps. xciv. 7</A>,

 &c.

 (2.) How much it is our concern, when God is contending with us, to 
 find out what the cause of action is, what the particular sin is, that, 
 like Achan, troubles our camp. We must thus examine ourselves and 
 carefully review the records of conscience, that we may find out the 
 accursed thing, and pray earnestly with holy Job, <I>Lord, show me 
 wherefore thou contendest with me.</I> Discover the traitor and he 
 shall be no longer harboured.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His arraignment and examination, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Joshua sits judge, and, though abundantly satisfied of his guilt by the
 determination of the lot, yet urges him to make a penitent confession, 
 that his soul might be saved by it in the other world, though he could 
 not give him any encouragement to hope that he should save his life by 
 it. Observe,

 1.  How He accosts him with the greatest mildness and tenderness that 
 could be, like a true disciple of Moses. He might justly have called 
 him "thief," and "rebel," "Raca," and "thou fool," but he call him 
 "son;" he might have adjured him to confess, as the high priest did our 
 blessed Saviour, or threatened him with the torture to extort a 
 confession, but for love's sake he rather beseeches him: <I>I pray thee 
 make confession.</I> This is an example to all not to insult over those 
 that are in misery, though they have brought themselves into it by 
 their own wickedness, but to treat even offenders with the spirit of 
 meekness, not knowing, what we ourselves should have been and done if 
 God had put us into the hands of our own counsels. It is likewise an 
 example to magistrates, in executing justice, to govern their own 
 passions with a strict and prudent hand, and never suffer themselves to 
 be transported by them into any indecencies of behaviour or language, 
 no, not towards those that have given the greatest provocations. <I>The 
 wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</I> Let them 
 remember <I>the judgment is God's, who is Lord of his anger.</I> This 
 is the likeliest method of bringing offenders to repentance. 

 2. What he wishes him to do, to confess the fact, to confess it to God, 
 the party offended by the crime; Joshua was to him in god's stead, so 
 that in confessing to him he confessed to God. Hereby he would satisfy 
 Joshua and the congregation concerning that which was laid to his 
 charge; his confession would also be an evidence of his repentance, and 
 a warning to others to take heed of sinning after the similitude of his 
 transgression: but that which Joshua aims at herein is that God might 
 be honoured by it, as the Lord, the God of infinite knowledge and 
 power, from whom no secrets are hid; and as the God of Israel, who, as 
 he does particularly resent affronts given to his Israel, so he does 
 the affronts given him by Israel. Note, In confessing sin, as we take 
 shame to ourselves, so we give glory to God as righteous God, owning 
 him justly displeased with us, and as a good God, who will not improve 
 our confessions as evidences against us, but is faithful and just to 
 forgive when we are brought to own that he would be faithful and just 
 if he should punish. By sin we have injured God in his honour. Christ 
 by his death has made satisfaction for the injury; but it is required 
 that we by repentance show our good will to his honour, and, as far as 
 in us lies, give glory to him. Bishop Patrick quotes the Samaritan 
 chronicle, making Joshua to say here to Achan, <I>Lift up thy eyes to 
 the king of heaven and earth, and acknowledge that nothing can be 
 hidden from him who knoweth the greatest secrets.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His confession, which now at last, when he saw it was to no 
 purpose to conceal his crime, was free and ingenuous enough, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.
 
 Here is,

 1. A penitent acknowledgment of fault. "Indeed I have sinned; what I am 
 charged with is too true to be denied and too bad to be excused. I own 
 it, I lament it; the Lord is righteous in bringing it to light, for 
 indeed I have sinned." This is the language of a penitent that is sick 
 of his, and whose conscience is loaded with it. "I have nothing to 
 accuse any one else of, but a great deal to say against myself; it is 
 with me that the accursed thing is found; I am the man who has 
 <I>perverted that which was right and it profited me not.</I>" And that 
 wherewith he aggravates the sin is that it was committed <I>against the 
 Lord God of Israel.</I> He was himself an Israelite, a sharer with the 
 rest of that exalted nation in their privileges, so that, in offending 
 <I>the God of Israel,</I> he offended his own God, which laid him under 
 the guilt of the basest treachery and ingratitude imaginable. 

 2. A particular narrative of the fact: <I>Thus and thus have I 
 done.</I> God had told Joshua in general that a part of the devoted 
 things was alienated, but is to him to draw from Achan an account of 
 the particulars; for, one way or other, God will make sinners' <I>own 
 tongues to fall upon them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:8">Ps. lxiv. 8</A>);

 if ever he bring them to repentance, they will be their own accusers,
 and their awakened consciences will be instead of a thousand witnesses. 
 Note, It becomes penitents, in the confession of their sins to God, to 
 be very particular; not only, "I have sinned," but, "In this and that 
 instance I have sinned," reflecting with regret upon all the steps that 
 led to the sin and all the circumstances that aggravated it and made it 
 exceedingly sinful: <I>thus and thus have I done.</I> He confesses,

 (1.) To the things taken. In plundering a house in Jericho he found a 
 goodly Babylonish garment; the word signifies a robe, such as princes 
 wore when they appeared in state, probably it belonged to the King of 
 Jericho; it was far fetched, as we translate it, from Babylon. A 
 garment of divers colours, so some render it. Whatever it was, in his 
 eyes it made a very glorious show. "A thousand pities" (thinks Achan) 
 "that it should be burnt; then it will do nobody any good; if I take it 
 for myself, it will serve me many a year for my best garment." Under 
 these pretences, he makes bold with this first, and things it no harm 
 to save it from the fire; but, his hand being thus in, he proceeds to 
 take a bag of money, <I>two hundred shekels,</I> that is one hundred 
 ounces of silver, and a w<I>wedge of gold</I> which weighed <I>fifty 
 shekels,</I> that is twenty-five ounces. He could not plead that, in 
 taking these, he saved them <I>from the fire</I> (for the <I>silver and 
 gold</I> were to be laid up in <I>the treasury</I>); but those that 
 make a slight excuse to serve in daring to commit one sin will have 
 their hearts so hardened by it that they will venture upon the next 
 without such an excuse; for the way of sin is downhill. See what a peer 
 prize it was for which Achan ran this desperate hazard, and what an 
 unspeakable loser he was by the bargain. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:26">Matt. xvi. 26</A>.

 (2.) He confesses the manner of taking them.

 [1.] the sin began in the eye. He saw these fine things, as Eve saw
 the forbidden fruit, and was strangely charmed with the sight. See what 
 comes of suffering the heart to walk after the eyes, and what need we 
 have to make this covenant with our eyes, that if they wander they 
 shall be sure to weep for it. <I>Look not thou upon the wine that is
 red,</I> upon the woman that is fair; close the right eye that thus 
 offense thee, to prevent the necessity of plucking it out, and casting 
 it from thee, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:28,29">Matt. v. 28, 29</A>.

 [2.] It proceeded out of the heart. He owns, <I>I coveted them.</I> 
 thus lust conceived and brought forth this sin. Those that would be 
 kept from sinful actions must mortify and check in themselves sinful 
 desires, particularly the desire of worldly wealth, which we more 
 particularly call <I>covetousness.</I> O what a world of evil is the 
 love money the root of! Had Achan looked upon these things with an eye 
 of faith, he would have seen them accursed things, and would have 
 dreaded them, but, looking upon them with an eye of sense only, he saw 
 them goodly things, and coveted them. It was not the looking, but the 
 lusting that ruined him. 

 [3.] When he had committed it he was very industrious to conceal it. 
 Having taken of the forbidden treasures, fearing lest any search should 
 be made for prohibited goods, he <I>hid them in the earth,</I> as one 
 that resolved to keep what he had gotten, and never to make 
 restitution. Thus does Achan confess the whole matter, that God might 
 be justified in the sentence passed upon him. See the <I>deceitfulness
 of sin;</I> that which is pleasing in the commission is bitter in the 
 reflection; at the last it bites like a serpent. Particularly, see what 
 comes of ill-gotten goods, and how those will be cheated that rob God. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:15">Job xx. 15</A>,

 <I>He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up
 again.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His conviction. God had convicted him by the lot; he had convicted 
 himself by his own confession; but, that no room might be left for the 
 most discontented Israelite to object against the process, Joshua has 
 him further convicted by the searching of his tent, in which the goods 
 were found which he confessed to. Particular notice is taken of the 
 haste which the messengers made that were sent to search: They <I>ran 
 to the tent</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 not only to show their readiness to obey Joshua's orders, but to show
 how uneasy they were till the camp was cleared of the accursed thing, 
 that they might regain the divine favour. Those that feel themselves 
 under wrath find themselves concerned not to defer the putting away of 
 sin. Delays are dangerous, and it is not time to trifle. When the 
 stolen goods were brought they were <I>laid out before the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 that all Israel might see how plain the evidence was against Achan, and
 might adore the strictness of God's judgments in punishing so severely 
 the stealing of such small things, and yet the justice of his judgments 
 in maintaining his right to devoted things, and might be afraid of ever 
 offending in the like kind. In laying them out before the Lord they 
 acknowledged his title to them, and waited to receive his directions 
 concerning them.  Note, Those that think to put a cheat upon God do but 
 deceive themselves; what is taken from him he will recover

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:9">Hos. ii. 9</A>)

 and he will be a loser by no man at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. His condemnation. Joshua passes sentence upon him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>Why hast thou troubled us?</I> There is the ground of the sentence.
 <I>O, how much hast thou troubled us!</I> so some read it. He refers to 
 what was said when the warning was given not to meddle with the 
 accursed thing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+6:18"><I>ch.</I> vi. 18</A>),

 <I>lest you make the camp of Israel a curse and trouble it.</I> Note,
 Sin is a very troublesome thing, not only to the sinner himself, but to 
 all about him. <I>He that is greedy of gain,</I> as Achan was, 
 <I>troubles his own house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:27">Prov. xv. 27</A>)

 and all the communities he belongs to. Now (says Joshua) <I>God shall
 trouble thee.</I> See why Achan was so severely dealt with, not only 
 because he had robbed God, but because he had troubled Israel; over his 
 head he had (as it were) this accusation written, "Achan, <I>the 
 troubler of Israel,</I>" as Ahab,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:18">1 Kings xviii. 18</A>.

 This therefore is his doom: <I>God shall trouble thee.</I> Note, the
 righteous God will certainly <I>recompense tribulation to those that 
 trouble</I> his people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:6">2 Thess. i. 6</A>.

 Those that are troublesome shall be troubled. Some of the Jewish
 doctors, from that word which determines the troubling of him to 
 <I>this day,</I> infer that therefore he should not be troubled in the 
 world to come; the flesh was destroyed that spirit might be saved, and, 
 if so, the dispensation was really less severe than it seemed. In the 
 description both of his sin and of his punishment, by the trouble that 
 was in both, there is a plain allusion to his name Achan, or, as he is 
 called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:7">1 Chron. ii. 7</A>,

 <I>Achar,</I> which signifies <I>trouble.</I> He did too much answer
 his name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. His execution. No reprieve could be obtained; a gangrened member 
 must be cut off immediately. When he is proved to be an anathema, and 
 the troubler of the camp, we may suppose all the people cry out against 
 him, <I>Away with him, away with him! Stone him, stone him!</I> Here
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The place of execution. They brought him out of the camp, in token
 of their putting <I>far from them that wicked person,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:13">1 Cor. v. 13</A>.
 
 When our Lord Jesus was made a curse for us, that by his trouble we
 might have peace, he suffered as an accursed thing <I>without the 
 gate,</I> bearing our reproach, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:12,13">Heb. xiii. 12, 13</A>.

 The execution was at a distance, that the camp which was disturbed by
 Achan's sin might not be defiled by his death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The persons employed in his execution. It was the act of all Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.

 They were all spectators of it, that they might see and fear. Public
 executions are public examples. Nay, they were all consenting to his 
 death, and as many as could were active in it, in token of the 
 universal detestation in which they held his sacrilegious attempt, and 
 their dread of God's displeasure against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The partakers with him in the punishment; for <I>he perished not 
 alone in his iniquity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:20"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 20</A>.

 (1.) The stolen goods were destroyed with him, the garment burnt, as it 
 should have been with the rest of the combustible things in Jericho, 
 and the silver and gold defaced, melted, lost, and buried, in the ashes 
 of the rest of his goods under <I>the heap of stones,</I> so as never 
 to be put to any other use. 

 (2.) All his other goods were destroyed likewise, not only his tent, 
 and the furniture of that, but his <I>oxen, asses, and sheep,</I> to 
 show that goods gotten unjustly, especially if they be gotten by 
 sacrilege, will not only turn to no account, but will blast and waste 
 the rest of the possessions to which they are added. The eagle in the 
 fable, that stole flesh from the altar, brought a coal of fire with it, 
 which burnt her nest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:9,10,Zec+5:3">Hab. ii. 9, 10; Zech. v. 3, 4</A>.

 Those lose their own that grasp at more than their own.

 (3.) His sons and daughters were put to death with him. Some indeed 
 think that they were <I>brought out</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)

 only to be the spectators of their father's punishment, but most
 conclude that they died with him, and that they must be meant 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>,

 where it is said they <I>burned them with fire, after they had stoned 
 them with stones.</I> God had expressly provided that magistrates 
 should not put the children to death for the fathers'; but he did not 
 intend to bind himself by that law, and in this case he had expressly 
 ordered

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 that the criminal, and all that he had, should be burnt.  Perhaps his
 sons and daughters were aiders and abettors in the villany, had helped 
 to carry off the accursed thing. It is very probable that they assisted 
 in the concealment, and that he could not hide them in the midst of his 
 tent but they must know and keep his counsel, and so they became 
 accessaries <I>ex post facto--after the fact;</I> and, if they were 
 ever so little partakers in the crime, it was son heinous that they 
 were justly sharers in the punishment. However God was hereby 
 glorified, and the judgment executed was thus made the more 
 tremendous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The punishment itself that was inflicted on him. He was stoned (some 
 think as a sabbath breaker, supposing that the sacrilege was committed 
 on the sabbath day), and then his dead body was burnt, as an accursed 
 thing, of which there should be no remainder left. The concurrence of 
 all the people in this execution teaches us how much it is the interest 
 of a nation that all in it should contribute what they can, in their 
 places, to the suppression of vice and profaneness, and the reformation 
 of manners; <I>sin is a reproach to any people,</I> and therefore every 
 Israelite indeed will have a stone to throw at it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The pacifying of God's wrath hereby 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+7:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>The Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger.</I> The putting
 away of sin by true repentance and reformation, as it is the only way, 
 so it is a sure and most effectual way, to recover the divine favour. 
 Take away the cause, and the effect will cease.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The record of his conviction and execution. Care was taken to 
 preserve the remembrance of it, for warning and instruction to 
 posterity. 

 1. A heap of stones was raised on the place where Achan was executed, 
 every one perhaps of the congregation throwing a stone to the heap, in 
 token of his detestation of the crime. 

 2. A new name was given to the place; it was called the<I>Valley of 
 Achor,</I> or <I>trouble.</I> This was a perpetual brand of infamy upon 
 Achan's name, and a perpetual warning to all people not to invade God's 
 property. By this severity against Achan, the honour of Joshua's 
 government, now in the infancy of it, was maintained, and Israel, at 
 their entrance upon the promised Canaan, were reminded to observe, at 
 their peril, the provisos and limitations of the grant by which they 
 held it. The <I>Valley of Achor</I> is said to be given for a <I>door 
 of hope,</I> because when we put away the accursed thing then there 
 begins to be hope in Israel,
