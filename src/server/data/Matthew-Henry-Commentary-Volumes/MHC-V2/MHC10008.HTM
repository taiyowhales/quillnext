 David having sought first the kingdom of God and the righteousness 
 thereof, settling the ark as soon as he was himself well settled, we 
 are here told how all other things were added to him. Here is an 
 account, 
 
 I. Of his conquests. He triumphed, 
 
 1.  Over the Philistines,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:1">ver. 1</A>.

 2. Over the Moabites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:2">ver. 2</A>.

 3. Over the king of Zobah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.
 
 4.  Over the Syrians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:5-8,13">ver. 5-8, 13</A>.

 5. Over the Edomites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:14">ver. 14</A>.

 II.  Of the presents that were brought him and the wealth he got from
 the nations he subdued, which he dedicated to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.

 III. Of his court, the administration of his government 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:15">ver. 15</A>),

 and his chief officers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:16-18">ver. 16-18</A>.

 This gives us a general idea of the prosperity of David's reign.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And after this it came to pass, that David smote the
 Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Metheg-ammah out of
 the hand of the Philistines.
 &nbsp; 2 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting
 them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put
 to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And <I>so</I> the
 Moabites became David's servants, <I>and</I> brought gifts.
 &nbsp; 3 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,
 as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.
 &nbsp; 4 And David took from him a thousand <I>chariots,</I> and seven
 hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed
 all the chariot <I>horses,</I> but reserved of them <I>for</I> a hundred
 chariots.
 &nbsp; 5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer
 king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand
 men.
 &nbsp; 6 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the
 Syrians became servants to David, <I>and</I> brought gifts. And the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> preserved David whithersoever he went.
 &nbsp; 7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
 of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 8 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king
 David took exceeding much brass.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God had given David rest from all his enemies that opposed him and made 
 head against him; and he having made a good use of that rest, has now 
 commission given him to make war upon them, and to act offensively for 
 the avenging of Israel's quarrels and the recovery of their rights; for 
 as yet they were not in full possession of that country to which by the 
 promise of God they were entitled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He quite subdued the Philistines, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They had attacked him when they thought him weak

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:17"><I>ch.</I> v. 17</A>),

 and went by the worst then; but, when he found himself strong, he
 attacked them, and made himself master of their country. They had long 
 been vexatious and oppressive to Israel.  Saul got no ground against 
 them; but David completed Israel's deliverance out of their hands, 
 which Samson had begun long before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:5">Judg. xiii. 5</A>.

 <I>Metheg-ammah</I> was <I>Gath</I> (the chief and royal city of the
 Philistines) and the towns belonging to it, among which there was a 
 constant garrison kept by the Philistines on the hill Ammah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+2:24">2 Sam. ii. 24</A>),

 which was <I>Metheg,</I> a <I>bridle</I> (so it signifies) or
 <I>curb</I> upon the people of Israel; this David took out of their 
 hand and used it as a curb upon them. Thus, when the strong man is 
 disarmed, the armour wherein he trusted is taken from him, and used 
 against him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:22">Luke xi. 22</A>.

 And after the long and frequent struggles which the saints have had
 with the powers of darkness, like Israel with the Philistines, the Son 
 of David shall tread them all under their feet and make the saints more 
 than conquerors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He smote the Moabites, and made them tributaries to Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He divided the country into three parts, two of which he destroyed,
 casting down the strong-holds, and putting all to the sword; the third 
 part he spared, to till the ground and be servants to Israel. Dr.  
 Lightfoot says, "He laid them on the ground and measured them with a 
 cord, who should be slain and who should live;" and this is called 
 <I>meting out the valley of Succoth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:6">Ps. lx. 6</A>.

 The Jews say he used this severity with the Moabites because they had
 slain his parents and brethren, whom he put under the protection of the 
 king of Moab during his exile,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:3,4">1 Sam. xxii. 3, 4</A>.

 He did it in justice, because they had been dangerous enemies to the
 Israel of God; and in policy, because, if left in their strength, they 
 still would have been so. But observe, Though it was necessary that 
 two-thirds should be cut off, yet the line that was to keep alive, 
 though it was but one, is ordered to be a full line.  Be sure to give 
 that length enough; let the line of mercy be stretched to the utmost 
 <I>in favorem vit&aelig;--so as to favour life.</I> Acts of indemnity must 
 be construed so as to enlarge the favour. Now Balaam's prophecy was 
 fulfilled, <I>A sceptre shall arise out of Israel, and shall smite the 
 corners of Moab,</I> to the utmost of which the fatal line extended, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:17">Num. xxiv. 17</A>.

 The Moabites continued tributaries to Israel till after the death of
 Ahab,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:4,5">2 Kings iii. 4, 5</A>.

 Then they rebelled and were never reduced.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He smote the Syrians or Aramites. Of them there were two distinct 
 kingdoms, as we find them spoken of in the title of the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:1-12">60th Psalm</A>:

 <I>Aram Naharaim,--Syria of the rivers,</I> whose head city was Damascus
 (famed for its rivers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+5:12">2 Kings v. 12</A>),

 and <I>Aram Zobah,</I> which joined to it, but extended to Euphrates.
 These were the two northern crowns.  

 1. David began with the Syrians of Zobah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 As he went to settle his border at the river Euphrates (for so far the
 land conveyed by the divine grant to Abraham and his seed did extend,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:18">Gen. xv. 18</A>),

 the king of Zobah opposed him, being himself possessed of those
 countries which belonged to Israel; but David routed his forces, and 
 took his chariots and horsemen. The horsemen are here said to be 700, 
 but

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:4">1 Chron. xviii. 4</A>

 they are said to be 7000. If they divided their horse by ten in a
 company, as it is probable they did, the captains and companies were 
 700, but the horsemen were 7000. David houghed the horses, cut the 
 sinews of their hams, and so lamed them, and made them unserviceable, 
 at least in war, God having forbidden them to <I>multiply horses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:16">Deut. xvii. 16</A>.

 David reserved only 100 chariots out of 1000 for his own use: for he
 placed his strength not in chariots nor horses, but in the living God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:7">Ps.  xx. 7</A>),

 and wrote it from his own observation that a <I>horse is a vain thing
 for safety,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:16,17">Ps. xxxiii. 16, 17</A>.

 2. The Syrians of Damascus coming in to the relief of the king of Zobah
 fell with him.  22,000 were slain in the field, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 So that it was easy for David to make himself master of the country,
 and garrison it for himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The enemies of God's church, that think to secure themselves, will
 prove, in the end, to ruin themselves, by their confederacies with each 
 other.  <I>Associate yourselves, and you shall be broken in pieces,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:9">Isa.  viii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. In all these wars, 

 1. David was protected: <I>The Lord preserved him whithersoever he
 went.</I> It seems, he went in person, and, in the cause of God and 
 Israel, jeoparded his own life in the high places of the field; but God 
 covered his head in the day of battle, which he often speaks of, in his 
 psalms, to the glory of God. 

 2. He was enriched. He took the shields of gold which the servants of
 Hadadezer had in their custody

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)
 
 and much brass from several cities of Syria
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 which he was entitled to, not only <I>jure belli--by the uncontrollable
 right of the longest sword</I> ("Get it, and take it"); but by 
 commission from heaven, and the ancient entail of these countries on 
 the seed of Abraham.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the
 host of Hadadezer,
 &nbsp; 10 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him,
 and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and
 smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And <I>Joram</I> brought
 with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of
 brass:
 &nbsp; 11 Which also king David did dedicate unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, with the
 silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he
 subdued;
 &nbsp; 12 Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of
 the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer,
 son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
 &nbsp; 13 And David gat <I>him</I> a name when he returned from smiting of
 the Syrians in the valley of salt, <I>being</I> eighteen thousand
 <I>men.</I>
 &nbsp; 14 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he
 garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> preserved David whithersoever he went.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The court made to David by the king of Hamath, who, it seems was at
 this time at war with the king of Zobah. He hearing of David's success 
 against his enemy, sent his own son ambassador to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>),

 to congratulate him on his victory, to return him thanks for the favour
 he had done him in breaking the power of one he was in fear of, and to 
 beg his friendship. Thus he not only secured but strengthened himself. 
 And David lost nothing by taking this little prince under his 
 protection, any more than the old Romans did by the like policy; for 
 the wealth he had from the countries he conquered by way of spoil he 
 had from this by way of present or gratuity: <I>Vessels of silver and 
 gold.</I> Better get by composition than by compulsion.  

 2.  The offering David made to God of the spoils of the nations and all
 the rich things that were brought him. He dedicated all to the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 This crowned all his victories, and made them far to out-shine
 Alexander's or Caesar's, that they sought their own glory, but he aimed 
 at the glory of God. All the precious things he was master of were 
 dedicated things, that is, they were designed for the building of the 
 temple; and a good omen it was of kindness to the Gentiles in the 
 fulness of time, and of the making of God's house a house of prayer for 
 all people, that the temple was built of the spoils and presents of 
 Gentile nations, in allusion to which we find <I>the kings of the 
 earth</I> bringing <I>their glory and honour into the new 
 Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:24">Rev. xxi. 24</A>.
 
 Their gods of gold David burnt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:21">2 Sam. v. 21</A>),
 
 but their vessels of gold he dedicated. Thus in the conquest of a soul,
 by the grace of the Son of David, what stands in opposition to God must 
 be destroyed, every lust mortified and crucified, but what may glorify 
 him must be dedicated and the property of it altered. Even the 
 merchandise and the hire must be <I>holiness to the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:18">Isa. xxiii. 18</A>),
 
 the gain <I>consecrated to the Lord of the whole earth</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:13">Mic. iv. 13</A>),

 and then it is truly our own and that most comfortably. 

 3.  The reputation he got, in a particular manner, by his victory over
 the Syrians and their allies the Edomites, who acted in conjunction 
 with them, as appears by comparing the title of the 60th Psalm, which 
 was penned on this occasion, with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 <I>He got himself a name</I> for all that conduct and courage which are
 the praise of a great and distinguished general. Something 
 extraordinary, it is likely, there was in that action, which turned 
 very much to his honour, yet he is careful to transfer the honour to 
 God, as appears by the psalm he penned on this occasion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It is through God that we do valiantly. 

 4. His success against the Edomites. They all became David's servants,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Now, and not till now, Isaac's blessing was accomplished, by which
 Jacob was made Esau's Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:37-40">Gen. xxvii. 37-40</A>)

 and the Edomites continued long tributary to the kings of Judah, as the
 Moabites were to the kings of Israel, till, in Joram's time, they 
 revolted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+21:8">2 Chron. xxi. 8</A>)

 as Isaac had there foretold that Esau should, in process of time, break
 the yoke from off his neck. Thus David by his conquests, 

 (1.) Secured peace to his son, that he might have time to build the
 temple. And,

 (2.) Procured wealth for his son, that he might have wherewith to build
 it.  God employs his servants variously, some in one employment, others 
 in another, some in the spiritual battles, others in the spiritual 
 buildings; and one prepares work for the other, that God may have the 
 glory of all. All David's victories were typical of the success of the 
 gospel against the kingdom of Satan, in which the Son of David rode 
 forth, conquering and to conquer, and he shall reign till he has 
 brought down all opposing rule, principality, and power: and he has, as 
 David had 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 a line to kill and a line to save; for the same gospel is to some a
 savour of life unto life, to others a savour of death unto death.</P>

 Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief
 rulers.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David was not so engaged in his wars abroad as to neglect the 
 administration of the government at home.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His care extended itself to all the parts of his dominion: <I>He 
 reigned over all Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 not only he had a right to reign over all the tribes, but he did so;
 they were all safe under his protection, and shared in the fruits of 
 his good government.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He did justice with an unbiased unshaken hand: <I>He executed 
 judgment unto all his people,</I> neither did wrong nor denied or 
 delayed right to any. This intimates, 

 1. His industry and close application to business, his easiness of
 access and readiness to admit all addresses and appeals made to him. 
 All his people, even the meanest, and those too of the meanest tribes, 
 were welcome to his council-board. 

 2. His impartiality and the equity of his proceedings, in administering
 justice. He never perverted justice through favour or affection, nor 
 had respect of persons in judgment. Herein he was a type of Christ, who 
 was faithful and true, and who doth <I>in righteousness both judge and 
 make war,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:11">Rev. xix. 11</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:1,2">Ps. lxxii. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He kept good order and good officers in his court. David being the 
 first king that had an established government (for Saul's reign was 
 short and unsettled) he had the modelling of the administration. In 
 Saul's time we read of no other great officer than Abner, that was 
 captain of the host. But David appointed more officers: Joab that was 
 general of the forces in the field, and Banaiah that was over the 
 Cherethites and Pelethites, who were either the city train-bands 
 (<I>archers and slingers,</I> so the Chaldee), or rather the 
 life-guards, or standing force, that attended the king's person, the 
 pretorian band, the militia. They were ready to do service at home, to 
 assist in the administering of justice, and to preserve the public 
 peace. We find them employed in proclaiming Solomon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:38">1 Kings i. 38</A>.

 2. Two ecclesiastical officers: <I>Zadok and Ahimelech were
 priests,</I> that is, they were most employed in the priests' work 
 under Abiathar, the high priest. 

 3. Two civil officers: one that was recorder, or remembrancer, to put 
 the king in mind of business in its season (he was prime minister of 
 state, yet not entrusted with the custody of the king's conscience, as 
 they say of our lord chancellor, but only of the king's memory; let the 
 king be put in mind of business and he would do it himself); another 
 that was scribe, or secretary of state, that drew up public orders and 
 despatches, and recorded judgments given. 

 4.  David's sons, as they grew up to be fit for business, were made
 chief rulers; they had places of honour and trust assigned them, in the 
 household, or in the camp, or in the courts of justice, according as 
 their genius led them. They were chief about the king (so it is 
 explained,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:17">1 Chron. xviii. 17</A>),

 employed near him, that they might be under his eye. Our Lord Jesus has
 appointed officers in his kingdom, for his honour and the good of the 
 community; when he ascended on high <I>he gave these gifts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:8-11">Eph. iv. 8-11</A>),

 <I>to every man his work,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+13:34">Mark  xiii. 34</A>.

 David made his sons chief rulers; but all believers, Christ's spiritual
 seed, are better preferred, for they are <I>made to our God kings and 
 priests,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:6">Rev. i. 6</A>.</P>
