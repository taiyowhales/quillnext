 It is now time to enquire what has become of the ark of God; we cannot 
 but think that we shall hear more of that sacred treasure. I should 
 have thought the next news would have been that all Israel, from Dan to 
 Beersheba, had gathered together as one man, with a resolution to bring 
 it back, or die in the attempt; but we find not any motion made of that 
 kind, so little was there of zeal or courage left among them. Nay, we 
 do not find that they desired a treaty with the Philistines about the 
 ransom of it, or offered any thing in lieu of it. "It is gone, and let 
 it go." Many have softness enough to lament the loss of the ark that 
 have not hardiness enough to take one step towards the recovery of it, 
 any more than Israel here. If the ark will help itself it may, for they 
 will not help it. Unworthy they were of the name of Israelites that 
 could thus tamely part with the glory of Israel. God would therefore 
 take the work into his own hands and plead his own cause, since men 
 would not appear for him. We are told in this chapter, 

 I. How the Philistines triumphed over the ark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 and,

 II. How the ark triumphed over the Philistines, 
 
 1. Over Dagon their god,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 2. Over the Philistines themselves, who were sorely plagued with emerods,
 and made weary of the ark; the men of Ashdod first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>),

 then the men of Gath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>), 

 and lastly those of Ekron, which forced them at length upon a
 resolution to send the ark back to the land of Israel; for when God 
 judgeth he will overcome.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from
 Ebenezer unto Ashdod.
 &nbsp; 2 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it
 into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
 &nbsp; 3 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold,
 Dagon <I>was</I> fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
 &nbsp; 4 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold,
 Dagon <I>was</I> fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands
 <I>were</I> cut off upon the threshold; only <I>the stump of</I> Dagon was
 left to him.
 &nbsp; 5 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come
 into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod
 unto this day.

 Here is, 

 I. The Philistines' triumph over the ark, which they were the more 
 pleased, the more proud, to be now masters of, because before the 
 battle they were possessed with a great fear of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:7"><I>ch.</I> iv. 7</A>.

 When they had it in their hands God restrained them, that they did not
 offer any violence to it, did not break it to pieces, as the Israelites 
 were ordered to do by the idols of the heathen, but showed some respect 
 to it, and carefully carried it to a place of safety. Whether their 
 curiosity led them to open it, and to read what was written with the 
 finger of God on the two tables of stone that were in it, we are not 
 told; perhaps they looked no further than the golden outside and the 
 cherubim that covered it, like children that are more affected with the 
 fine binding of their bibles than with the precious matter contained in 
 them. They carried it to Ashdod, one of their five cities, and that in 
 which Dagon's temple was; there they placed the ark of God, <I>by 
 Dagon</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 either 

 1. As a sacred thing, which they designed to pay some religious respect
 to, in conjunction with Dagon; for the gods of the heathen were never 
 looked upon as averse to partners. Though the nations would not change 
 their gods, yet they would multiply them and add to them.  But they 
 were mistaken in the God of Israel when, in putting his ark by Dagon's 
 image, they intended to do him honour; for he is not worshipped at all 
 if he is not worshipped alone. <I>The Lord our God is one Lord.</I> Or 
 rather, 

 2. They placed it there as a trophy of victory, in honour of Dagon
 their god, to whom no doubt they intended to offer a great sacrifice, 
 as they had done when they had taken Samson

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:23,24">Judg. xvi. 23, 24</A>),

 boasting that as then they had triumphed over Israel's champion so now
 over Israel's God. What a reproach was this to God's great name! what a 
 <I>disgrace to the throne of his glory!</I> Shall the ark, the symbol 
 of God's presence, be a prisoner to Dagon, a dunghill deity? 

 (1.) So it is, because God will show of how little account the ark of
 the covenant is if the covenant itself be broken and neglected; even 
 sacred signs are not things that either he is tied to or we can trust 
 to.

 (2.) So it is for a time, that God may have so much the more glory, in
 reckoning with those that thus affront him, and get him honour upon 
 them. Having punished Israel, that betrayed the ark, by giving it into 
 the hands of the Philistines, he will next deal with those that abused 
 it, and will fetch it out of their hands again. Thus even the <I>wrath 
 of man shall praise him;</I> and he is bringing about his own glory 
 even when he seems to neglect it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:10">Ps. lxxvi. 10</A>.

 Out of the eater shall come forth meat.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The ark's triumph over Dagon. Once and again Dagon was made to fall 
 before it. If they designed to do honour to the ark, God thereby showed 
 that he valued not their honour, nor would he accept it; for he will be 
 worshipped, not <I>with</I> any god, but <I>above</I> all gods. <I>He 
 owes a shame</I> (as bishop Hall expresses it) <I>to those who will be 
 making matches betwixt himself and Belial.</I> But they really designed 
 to affront it, and though for some hours Dagon stood by the ark, and it 
 is likely stood above it (the ark, as its footstool), yet the next 
 morning, when the worshippers of Dagon came to pay their devotions to 
 his shrine, they found their triumphing short, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:5">Job xx. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Dagon, that is, the image (for that was all the god), had <I>fallen 
 upon his face to the earth before the ark,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 God had seemed to forget the ark, but see how the Psalmist speaks of
 his appearing, at last, to vindicate his own honour. When he had 
 delivered his strength into captivity, and all seemed going to ruin, 
 <I>then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that 
 shouteth by reason of wine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:59-65">Ps. lxxviii. 59-65</A>.

 And therefore he prevented the utter desolations of the Jewish church,
 because he <I>feared the wrath of the enemy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:26,27">Deut. xxxii. 26, 27</A>.

 Great care was taken, in setting up the images of their gods, to fix
 them. The prophet takes notice of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:7">Isa.  xli. 7</A>,

 <I>He fastened it with nails that it should not be moved;</I> and
 again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:7">Isa. xlvi. 7</A>.

 And yet Dagon's fastenings stood him in no stead. The ark of God
 triumphs over him upon his own dunghill, in his own temple.  Down he 
 comes before the ark, directly towards it (though the ark was set on 
 one side of him), as it were, pointing to the conqueror, to whom he is 
 constrained to yield and do homage. Note, The kingdom of Satan will 
 certainly fall before the kingdom of Christ, error before truth, 
 profaneness before godliness, and corruption before grace in the hearts 
 of the faithful. When the interests of religion seem to be run down and 
 ready to sink, yet even then we may be confident that the day of their 
 triumph will come. Great is the truth, and will prevail. Dagon by 
 falling prostrate before the ark of God, which was a posture of 
 adoration, did as it were direct his worshippers to pay their homage to 
 the God of Israel, as <I>greater than all gods.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:11">Exod.  xviii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The priests, finding their idol on the floor, make all the haste 
 they can, before it be known, to set him in his place again. A sorry 
 silly thing it was to make a god of, which, when it was down, wanted 
 help to get up again; and sottish wretches those were that could pray 
 for help from that idol that needed, and in effect implored, their 
 help. How could they attribute their victory to the power of Dagon when 
 Dagon himself could not keep his own ground before the ark? But they 
 are resolved Dagon shall be their god still, and therefore set him in 
 his place. Bishop Hall observes hence, It is just with God that those 
 who want grace shall want wit too; and it is the work of superstition 
 to turn men into the stocks and stones they worship. <I>Those that make 
 them are like unto them.</I> What is it that the great upholders of the 
 antichristian kingdom are doing at this day but heaving Dagon up, and 
 labouring to set him in his place again, and healing the deadly wound 
 that has been given to the beast? but if the reformation be the cause 
 of God, before which it has begun to fall, it shall not prevail, but 
 shall surely fall before it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The next night Dagon fell the second time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They rose early, either, as usual, to make their addresses to their
 god, or earlier than usual, being impatient to know whether Dagon had 
 kept his standing this night; and, to their great confusion, they find 
 his case worse now than before. Whether the matter of which the image 
 was made was apt to break or no, so it was that the head and hands were 
 <I>cut off upon the threshold,</I> so that nothing remained but the 
 stump, or, as the margin reads it, <I>the fishy part of</I> Dagon; for 
 (as many learned men conjecture) the upper part of this image was in a 
 human shape, the lower in the shape of a fish, as mermaids are painted. 
 Such strong delusions were idolaters given up to, so vain were they in 
 their imaginations, and so wretchedly darkened were their foolish 
 hearts, as to worship the images, not only of creatures, but of 
 nonentities, the mere figments of fancy. Well, the misshapen monster is 
 by this fall made to appear,

 (1.) Very ridiculous, and worthy to be despised. A pretty figure Dagon
 made now, when the fall had anatomized him, and shown how the human 
 part and the fishy part were artificially put together, which perhaps 
 the ignorant devotees had been made to believe was done by miracle!

 (2.) Very impotent, and unworthy to be prayed to or trusted in; for his
 losing his head and hands proved him utterly destitute both of wisdom 
 and power, and for ever disabled either to advise or act for his 
 worshippers. This they got by setting Dagon in his place again; they 
 had better have let him alone when he was down.  But those can speed no 
 better that contend with God, and will set up that which he is throwing 
 down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:4">Mal. i. 4</A>.

 God, by this, magnified his ark and made it honourable, when they
 vilified and made it contemptible. He also showed what will be the end 
 of all that which is set up in opposition to him. <I>Gird 
 yourselves,</I> but <I>you shall be broken to pieces,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:9">Isa. viii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The threshold of Dagon's temple was ever looked upon as sacred, and 
 not to be trodden on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Some think that reference is had to this superstitious usage of Dagon's
 worshippers in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:9">Zeph. i. 9</A>,

 where God threatens to punish those who, in imitation of them, leaped
 over the threshold. One would have thought that this incontestable 
 proof of the ark's victory over Dagon would convince the Philistines of 
 their folly in worshipping such a senseless thing, and that 
 henceforward they would pay their homage to the conqueror; but, instead 
 of being reformed, they were hardened in their idolatry, and, as evil 
 men and seducers are wont to do, became worse and worse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:13">2 Tim. iii. 13</A>.

 Instead of despising Dagon, for the threshold's sake that beheaded him,
 they were almost ready to worship the threshold because it was the 
 block on which he was beheaded, and will never set their feet on that 
 on which Dagon lost his head, shaming those who <I>tread under foot the 
 blood of the covenant</I> and trample on things truly sacred. Yet this 
 piece of superstition would help to perpetuate the remembrance of 
 Dagon's disgrace; for, with the custom, the reason would be transmitted 
 to posterity, and the children that should be born, enquiring why the 
 threshold of Dagon's temple must not be trodden on, would be told that 
 Dagon fell before the ark of the Lord. Thus God would have honour even 
 out of their superstition. We are not told that they repaired the 
 broken image; it is probable that they sent the art of God away first, 
 and then they patched it up again, and set it in its place; for, it 
 seems, they <I>cannot deliver their souls, nor say, Is there not a lie 
 in our right hand?</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  But the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and
 he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, <I>even</I> Ashdod and
 the coasts thereof.
 &nbsp; 7 And when the men of Ashdod saw that <I>it was</I> so, they said,
 The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his
 hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.
 &nbsp; 8 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the
 Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of
 the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of
 Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of
 the God of Israel about <I>thither.</I>
 &nbsp; 9 And it was <I>so,</I> that, after they had carried it about, the
 hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was against the city with a very great
 destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and
 great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.
 &nbsp; 10 Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to
 pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried
 out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel
 to us, to slay us and our people.
 &nbsp; 11 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
 Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel,
 and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and
 our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the
 city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
 &nbsp; 12 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and
 the cry of the city went up to heaven.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The downfall of Dagon (if the people had made a good use of it, and had 
 been brought by it to repent of their idolatries and to humble 
 themselves before the God of Israel and seek his face) might have 
 prevented the vengeance which God here proceeds to take upon them for 
 the indignities done to his ark, and their obstinate adherence to their 
 idol, in defiance of the plainest conviction. <I>Lord, when thy hand is 
 lifted up they will not see, but they shall see,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:11">Isa. xxvi. 11</A>.

 And, if they will not see the glory, they shall feel the weight, of
 God's hand, for so the Philistines did. <I>The hand of the Lord was 
 heavy upon them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and he not only convinced them of their folly, but severely chastised
 their insolence. 

 1. <I>He destroyed them,</I> that is, cut many of them off by sudden
 death, those, we may suppose, that had most triumphed in the captivity 
 of the ark. This is distinguished from the disease with which others 
 were smitten. At Gath it is called <I>a great destruction</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>a deadly destruction,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 And it is expressly said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 that those who were <I>smitten with the emerods were the men that died
 not</I> by the other <I>destruction,</I> which probably was the 
 pestilence. They boasted of the great slaughter which their sword had 
 made among the Israelites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:10"><I>ch.</I> iv. 10</A>.

 But God lets them know that though he does not see fit to draw Israel's
 sword against them (they were unworthy to be employed), yet God had a 
 sword of his own, with which he could make a no less dreadful execution 
 among them, which if he whet, and <I>his hand take hold on judgment, he 
 will render vengeance to his enemies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:41,42">Deut. xxxii. 41, 42</A>.

 Note, Those that contend with God, his ark, and his Israel, will
 infallibly be ruined at last. If conviction conquer not, destruction 
 shall. 
 
 2. Those that were not destroyed <I>he smote with emerods</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>in their secret parts</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 so grievous that
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)
 
 the <I>cry went up to heaven,</I> that is, it might be heard a great
 way off, and perhaps, in the extremity of their pain and misery, they 
 cried, not to Dagon, but to the God of heaven.  The Psalmist, speaking 
 of this sore judgment upon the Philistines, describes it thus: God 
 <I>smote his enemies in the hinder parts,</I> and <I>put them to a 
 perpetual reproach,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:66">Ps. lxxviii. 66</A>.

 The emerods (which we call the piles, and perhaps it was then a more
 grievous disease than it is now) is threatened among the judgments that 
 would be the fruit of the curse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:27">Deut. xxviii. 27</A>.

 It was both a painful and shameful disease; a vile disease for vile
 deserts. By it God would humble their pride, and put contempt upon 
 them, as they had done upon his ark. The disease was epidemical, and 
 perhaps, among them, a new disease.  <I>Ashdod was smitten, and the 
 coasts thereof,</I> the country round.  For contempt of God's 
 ordinances, <I>many are weak and sick, and many sleep,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:30">1 Cor. xi. 30</A>.
 
 3. The men of Ashdod were soon aware that it was <I>the hand of God,
 the God of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Thus they were constrained to acknowledge his power and dominion, and
 confess themselves within his jurisdiction, and yet they would not 
 renounce Dagon and submit to Jehovah; but rather, now that he touched 
 their bone and their flesh, and in a tender part, they were ready to 
 curse him to his face, and instead of making their peace with him, and 
 courting the stay of his ark upon better terms, they desired to get 
 clear of it, as the Gadarenes, who, when they had lost their swine, 
 desired Christ to <I>depart out of their coasts.</I> Carnal hearts, 
 when they smart under the judgments of God, would rather, if it were 
 possible, put him far from them than enter into covenant and communion 
 with him, and make him their friend. Thus the men of Ashdod resolve, 
 <I>The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us.</I>

 4. It is resolved to change the place of its imprisonment. A great
 council was called, and the question proposed to all the lords was, 
 "What shall be we with the ark?" And at last it was agreed that it 
 should be carried to Gath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Some superstitious conceit they had that the fault was in the place,
 and that the ark would be better pleased with another lodging, further 
 off from Dagon's temple; and therefore, instead of returning it, as 
 they should have done, to its own place, they contrive to send it to 
 another place.  <I>Gath</I> is pitched upon, a place famed for a race 
 of giants, but their strength and stature are no fence against the 
 pestilence and the emerods: the men of that city were smitten, <I>both 
 great and small</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:9">(<I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 both dwarfs and giants, all alike to God's judgments; none so great as
 to over-top them, none so small as to be over-looked by them.  

 5. They were all at last weary of the ark, and very willing to get rid
 of it.  It was sent from Gath to Ekron, and, coming by order of 
 council, the Ekronites could not refuse it, but were much exasperated 
 against their great men for sending them such a fatal present

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>They have sent it to us to slay us and our people.</I> The ark had
 the tables of the law in it; and nothing more welcome to faithful 
 Israelites than the word of God (to them it is <I>a savour of life unto 
 life</I>), but to uncircumcised Philistines, that persist in enmity to 
 God, nothing more dreadful nor unwelcome: to them it is <I>a savour of 
 death unto death.</I> A general assembly is instantly called, to advise 
 about <I>sending the ark again to its place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 While they are consulting about it, the hand of God is doing execution;
 and their contrivances to evade the judgment do but spread it. Many 
 drop down dead among them. Many more are raging ill of the emerods,
