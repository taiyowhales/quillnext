 In the close of the foregoing book we read how God magnified Solomon
 and Israel obeyed him; God and Israel concurred to honour him. Now here
 we have an account,

 I. How he honoured God by sacrifice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>)

 and by prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:7-12">ver. 7-12</A>.

 II. How he honoured Israel by increasing their strength, wealth, and
 trade, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:13-17">ver. 13-17</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom,
 and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God <I>was</I> with him, and magnified him
 exceedingly.
 &nbsp; 2  Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of
 thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every
 governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.
 &nbsp; 3  So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the
 high place that <I>was</I> at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of
 the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had
 made in the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 4  But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim to
 <I>the place which</I> David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a
 tent for it at Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 5  Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the
 son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.
 &nbsp; 6  And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which <I>was</I> at the tabernacle of the congregation, and
 offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.
 &nbsp; 7  In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him,
 Ask what I shall give thee.
 &nbsp; 8  And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto
 David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.
 &nbsp; 9  Now, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God, let thy promise unto David my father be
 established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the
 dust of the earth in multitude.
 &nbsp; 10  Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come
 in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, <I>that
 is so</I> great?
 &nbsp; 11  And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart,
 and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life
 of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast
 asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my
 people, over whom I have made thee king:
 &nbsp; 12  Wisdom and knowledge <I>is</I> granted unto thee; and I will give
 thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings
 have had that <I>have been</I> before thee, neither shall there any
 after thee have the like.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. Solomon's great prosperity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Though he had a contested title, yet, God being with him, he was
 <I>strengthened in his kingdom;</I> his heart and hands were 
 strengthened, and his interest in the people. God's presence will be 
 our strength.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His great piety and devotion. His father was a prophet, a psalmist, 
 and kept mostly to the ark; but Solomon, having read much in his Bible 
 concerning the tabernacle which Moses built and the altars there, paid 
 more respect to them than, it should seem, David had done. Both did 
 well, and let neither be censured. If the zeal of one be carried out 
 most to one instance of religion, and of another to some other 
 instance, let them not judge nor despise each other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. All his great men must thus far be good men that they must join with 
 him in worshipping God. He spoke to the captains and judges, the 
 governors and chief of the fathers, to go with him to Gibeon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.
 
 Authority and interest are well bestowed on those that will thus use
 them for the glory of God, and the promoting of religion. It is our 
 duty to engage all with whom we have influence in the solemnities of 
 religion, and it is very desirable to have many join with us in those 
 solemnities--the more the better; it is the more like heaven. Solomon
 began his reign with this public pious visit to God's altar, and it was 
 a very good omen. Magistrates are then likely to do well for themselves 
 and their people when they thus take God along with them at their 
 setting out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He offered abundance of sacrifices to God there 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 1000 <I>burnt-offerings,</I> and perhaps a greater number of
 peace-offerings, on which he and his company <I>feasted before the 
 Lord.</I> Where God sows plentifully he expects to reap accordingly.  
 His father David had left him flocks and herds in abundance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:29,31">1 Chron. xxvii. 29, 31</A>),

 and thus he gave God his dues out of them. The ark was at Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 but the altar was at Gibeon
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and thither he brought his sacrifices; for <I>it is the altar that
 sanctifieth every gift.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He prayed a good prayer to God: this, with the answer to it, we had 
 before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:5-15">1 Kings iii. 5</A>,

 &c.

 (1.) God bade him ask what he would; not only that he might put him in
 the right way of obtaining the favours that were intended him (<I>Ask, 
 and you shall receive, that your joy may be full</I>), but that he
 might try him, how he stood affected, and might discover what was in 
 his heart. Men's characters appear in their choices and desires. What 
 wouldst thou <I>have?</I> tries a man as much as, What wouldst thou 
 <I>do?</I> Thus God tried whether Solomon was one of the <I>children of 
 this world,</I> that say, <I>Who will show us any good,</I> or of the 
 children of light, that say, <I>Lord, lift up the light of thy 
 countenance upon us.</I> As we choose we shall have, and that is likely 
 to be our portion to which we give the preference, whether the wealth 
 and pleasure of this world or spiritual riches or delights. 

 (2.) Like a genuine son of David, he chose spiritual blessings rather
 than temporal. His petition here is, <I>Give me wisdom and 
 knowledge.</I> He owns those to be desirable gifts, and God to be the 
 giver of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:6">Prov. ii. 6</A>.

 God gave the faculty of understanding, and to him we must apply for the
 furniture of it. Two things are here pleaded which we had not in 
 Kings:--

 [1.] <I>Thou hast made me reign in my father's stead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 "Lord, thou hast put me into this place, and therefore I can in faith
 ask of thee grace to enable me to do the duty of it." What service we 
 have reason to believe God calls us to we have reason to hope he will 
 qualify us for. But that is not all. "Lord, thou hast put me into this 
 place in the stead of David, the great and good man that filled it up 
 so well; therefore give me wisdom, that Israel may not suffer damage by 
 the change. Must I reign in my father's stead?  Lord, give me my 
 father's spirit." Note, The eminency of those that went before us, and 
 the obligation that lies upon us to keep up and carry on the good work 
 they were engaged in, should provoke us to a gracious emulation, and 
 quicken our prayers to God for wisdom and grace, that we may do the 
 work of God in our day as faithfully and well as they did in theirs.

 [2.] <I>Let thy promise to David my father be established,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He means the promise of concerning his successor. "In performance of
 that promise, <I>Lord, give me wisdom.</I>" We do not find that wisdom 
 was any of the things promised, but it was necessary in order to the 
 accomplishment of what was promised,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:13-15">2 Sam. vii. 13-15</A>.

 The promise was, <I>He shall build a house for my name, I will
 establish his throne, he shall be my son,</I> and <I>my mercy shall not 
 depart from him.</I> "Now, Lord, unless thou give me wisdom, thy house 
 will not be built, nor my throne established; I shall behave in a 
 manner unbecoming my relation to thee as a Father, shall forfeit thy 
 mercy, and fool it away; therefore, <I>Lord, give me wisdom.</I>" Note, 
 <I>First,</I> God's promises are our best pleas in prayer. <I>Remember 
 thy word unto thy servant. Secondly,</I> Children may take the comfort 
 of the promises of that covenant which their parents, in their baptism, 
 laid claim to, and took hold of, for them.  <I>Thirdly,</I> The best 
 way to obtain the benefit of the promises and privileges of the 
 covenant is to be earnest in prayer with God for wisdom and grace to do 
 the duties of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He received a gracious answer to this prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 (1.) God gave him the wisdom that he asked for because he asked for it.
 Wisdom is a gift that God gives as freely and liberally as any gift to 
 those that value it, and wrestle for it; and will resolve to make use 
 of it; and he upbraids not the poor petitioners with their folly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:5">James i. 5</A>.

 God's grace shall never be wanting to those who sincerely desire to
 know and do their duty.

 (2.) God gave him the wealth and honour which he did not ask for
 because he asked not for them. Those that pursue present things most 
 earnestly are most likely to miss of them; while those that refer 
 themselves to the providence of God, if they have not the most of those 
 things, have the most comfort in them. Those that make this world their 
 end come short of the other and are disappointed in this too; but those 
 that make the other world their end shall not only obtain that, and 
 full satisfaction in it, but shall enjoy as much as is convenient of 
 this world in their way.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  Then Solomon came <I>from his journey</I> to the high place that
 <I>was</I> at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the
 congregation, and reigned over Israel.
 &nbsp; 14  And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a
 thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen,
 which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at
 Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 15  And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem <I>as
 plenteous</I> as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycamore
 trees that <I>are</I> in the vale for abundance.
 &nbsp; 16  And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
 the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
 &nbsp; 17  And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a
 chariot for six hundred <I>shekels</I> of silver, and a horse for an
 hundred and fifty: and so brought they out <I>horses</I> for all the
 kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their
 means.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 1. Solomon's entrance upon the government
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 He came <I>from before the tabernacle, and reigned over Israel.</I> He
 would not do any acts of government till he had done his acts of 
 devotion, would not take honour to himself till he had given honour to 
 God--first the tabernacle, and then the throne. But, when he had 
 obtained wisdom from God, he did not bury his talent, but as he 
 received the gift ministered the same, did not give up himself to ease 
 and pleasure, but minded business: he reigned over Israel. 

 2. The magnificence of his court

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>He gathered chariots and horsemen.</I> Shall we praise him for this?
 We praise him not; for the king was forbidden to multiply horses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:16">Deut. xvii. 16</A>.

 I do not remember that ever we find his good father in a chariot or on
 horseback; a mule was the highest he mounted. We should endeavor to 
 excel those that went before us in goodness rather than in grandeur. 

 3.  The wealth and trade of his kingdom. He made silver and gold very
 cheap and common, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The increase of gold lowers the value of it; but the increase of grace
 advances its price; the more men have of that the more they value it.  
 <I>How much better</I> therefore <I>is it to get wisdom than gold!</I> 
 He opened also a trade with Egypt, whence he imported horses and 
 linen-yarn, which he exported again to the kings of Syria, with great 
 advantage no doubt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 This we had before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:28,29">1 Kings x. 28, 29</A>.

 It is the wisdom of princes to promote industry and encourage trade in
 their dominions.  Perhaps Solomon took the hint of setting up the 
 linen-manufacture, bringing linen-yarn out of Egypt, working it into 
 cloth, and then sending that to other nations, from what his mother 
 taught when she specified this as one of the characteristics of the 
 virtuous woman, <I>She maketh fine linen, and selleth it, and 
 delivereth girdles</I> of it <I>to the merchant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:24">Prov. xxxi. 24</A>.

 <I>In all labour there is profit.</I></P>
