 The story is here repeated of David's war with the Ammonites and the 
 Syrians their allies, and the victories he obtained over them, which we 
 read just as it is here related, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:1-19">2 Sam. x.</A>

 Here is, 

 I. David's civility to the king of Ammon, in sending an embassy of
 condolence to him on occasion of his father's death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+19:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. His great incivility to David, in the base usage he gave to his
 ambassadors,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+19:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III. David's just resentment of it, and the war which broke out
 thereupon, in which the Ammonites acted with policy in bringing the
 Syrians to their assistance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+19:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>), 
 
 Joab did bravely 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+19:8-13">ver. 8-13</A>),

 and Israel was once and again victorious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+19:14-19">ver. 14-19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the
 children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.
 &nbsp; 2  And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
 Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent
 messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants
 of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to
 comfort him.
 &nbsp; 3  But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun,
 Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath
 sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee
 for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?
 &nbsp; 4  Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and
 cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and
 sent them away.
 &nbsp; 5  Then there went <I>certain,</I> and told David how the men were
 served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly
 ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be
 grown, and <I>then</I> return.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us here observe, 

 1. That is becomes good people to be neighbourly, and especially to be
 grateful. David will pay respect to Hanun because he is his neighbour; 
 and religion teaches us to be civil and obliging to all, to honour all 
 men, and to be ready to do all offices of kindness to those we live 
 among; nor must difference in religion be any obstruction to this. But, 
 besides this, David remembered the kindness which his father showed to 
 him. Those that have received kindness must return it as they have 
 ability and opportunity: those that have received it from the parents 
 must return it to the children when they are gone. 

 2. That, as saith the proverb of the ancients, <I>Wickedness proceedeth
 from the wicked,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:13">1 Sam. xxiv. 13</A>.

 The vile person will speak villany, and the instruments of the churl
 will be evil, to <I>destroy those with lying words that speak 
 right,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:6,7">Isa. xxxii. 6, 7</A>.

 Those that are base, and design ill themselves, are apt to be jealous
 and to suspect ill of others without cause. Hanun's servant suggested 
 that David's ambassadors came as spies, as if so great and mighty a man 
 as David needed to do so mean a thing (if he had any design upon the 
 Ammonites, he could effect it by open force, and had no occasion for 
 any fraudulent practices), or as if a man of such virtue and honour 
 would do so base a thing. Yet Hanun hearkened to the suggestion, and, 
 against the law of nations, treated David's ambassadors villainously.

 3. Masters ought to protect their servants, and with the greatest
 tenderness to concern themselves for them if they come by any loss or 
 damage in their service. David did so for his ambassadors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+19:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Christ will do so for his ministers; and let all masters thus <I>give
 unto their servants that which is just and equal.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made
 themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent
 a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen
 out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.
 &nbsp; 7  So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king
 of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba.
 And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their
 cities, and came to battle.
 &nbsp; 8  And when David heard <I>of it,</I> he sent Joab, and all the host
 of the mighty men.
 &nbsp; 9  And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in
 array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come
 <I>were</I> by themselves in the field.
 &nbsp; 10  Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before
 and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put
 <I>them</I> in array against the Syrians.
 &nbsp; 11  And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of
 Abishai his brother, and they set <I>themselves</I> in array against
 the children of Ammon.
 &nbsp; 12  And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
 shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
 thee, then I will help thee.
 &nbsp; 13  Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly
 for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 do <I>that which is</I> good in his sight.
 &nbsp; 14  So Joab and the people that <I>were</I> with him drew nigh before
 the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.
 &nbsp; 15  And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were
 fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered
 into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 16  And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse
 before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians
 that <I>were</I> beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the
 host of Hadarezer <I>went</I> before them.
 &nbsp; 17  And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and
 passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set <I>the battle</I> in
 array against them. So when David had put the battle in array
 against the Syrians, they fought with him.
 &nbsp; 18  But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the
 Syrians seven thousand <I>men which fought in</I> chariots, and forty
 thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.
 &nbsp; 19  And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to
 the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became
 his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of
 Ammon any more.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may see here, 

 1. How the hearts of sinners that are marked for ruin are hardened to
 their destruction. The children of Ammon saw that <I>they had made 
 themselves odious to David</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+19:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and then it would have been their wisdom to desire conditions of peace,
 to humble themselves and offer any satisfaction for the injury they had 
 done him, the rather because they had made themselves not only odious 
 to David, but obnoxious to the justice of God, who is <I>King of 
 nations,</I> and will assert the injured rights and maintain the 
 violated laws of nations. But, instead of this, they prepared for war, 
 and so brought upon themselves, by David's hand, those desolations 
 which he never intended them. 

 2. How the courage of brave men is heightened and invigorated by
 difficulties. When Joab saw that the battle was set against him before 
 and behind

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 instead of meditating a retreat, he doubled his resolution; and, though
 he could not double, he divided his army, and not only spoke, but 
 acted, like a gallant man, that had great presence of mind when he saw 
 himself surrounded. He engaged with his brother for mutual assistance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+19:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 excited himself and the rest of the officers to act vigorously in their
 respective posts, with an eye to God's glory and their country's good, 
 not to any honour and advantage of their own, and then left the issue 
 to God: <I>Let the Lord do that which is right in his sight.</I> 

 3. How vain the greatest art and strength are against justice and
 equity. The Ammonites did their utmost to make the best of their 
 position: they brought as good a force into the field, and disposed it 
 with as much policy as possible; yet, having a bad cause, and acting in 
 defence of wrong, it would not do; they were put to the worst. Right 
 will prevail and triumph at last. 

 4.  To how little purpose it is for those to rally again, and reinforce
 themselves, that have not God on their side. The Syrians, though in no 
 way concerned in the merits of the cause, but serving only as 
 mercenaries to the Ammonites, when they were beaten, thought themselves 
 concerned to retrieve their honour, and therefore called in the 
 assistance of the Syrians on the other side Euphrates; but to no 
 purpose, for still they <I>fled before Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+19:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 they lost 7000 men, who are said to be the men of 700 chariots,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:18">2 Sam. x. 18</A>.

 For, as now in a man of war for sea-service they allot ten men to a
 gun, so then, in land-service, ten men to a chariot. 

 5. those who have <I>meddled with strife that belongs not to them,</I>
 and have found that they <I>meddled to their own heart,</I> do well to 
 learn wit at length and meddle no further. The Syrians, finding that 
 Israel was the conquering side, not only broke off their alliance with 
 the Ammonites and would help them no more

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+19:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 <I>but made peace with David and became his servants.</I> Let those who
 have in vain stood it out against God be thus wise for themselves, and 
 <I>agree with him quickly, while they are in the way.</I> Let them 
 become his servants; for they cannot but see themselves undone if they 
 be his enemies.</P>
