 Ezra's precious name saluted us, at first, in the title of the book, 
 but in the history we have not met with it till this chapter introduces 
 him into public action in another reign, that of Artaxerxes. Zerubbabel 
 and Jeshua we will suppose, by this time, to have grown old, if not 
 gone off; nor do we hear any more of Haggai and Zechariah; they have 
 finished their testimony. What shall become of the cause of God and 
 Israel when these useful instruments are laid aside? Trust God, who has 
 the residue of the Spirit, to raise up others in their room. Ezra here, 
 and Nehemiah in the next book, are as serviceable in their days as 
 those were in theirs. Here is, 

 I. An account, in general, of Ezra himself, and of his expedition to 
 Jerusalem for the public good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:1-10">ver.  1-10</A>.

 II. A copy of the commission which Artaxerxes gave him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:11-26">ver.  11-26</A>.

 III. His thankfulness to God for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:27,28">ver. 27, 28</A>.

 The next chapter will give us a more particular narrative of his
 associates, his journey, and his arrival at Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of
 Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of
 Hilkiah,
 &nbsp; 2  The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
 &nbsp; 3  The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
 &nbsp; 4  The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
 &nbsp; 5  The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,
 the son of Aaron the chief priest:
 &nbsp; 6  This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he <I>was</I> a ready scribe
 in the law of Moses, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel had given: and
 the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God upon him.
 &nbsp; 7  And there went up <I>some</I> of the children of Israel, and of
 the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters,
 and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of
 Artaxerxes the king.
 &nbsp; 8  And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which <I>was</I> in
 the seventh year of the king.
 &nbsp; 9  For upon the first <I>day</I> of the first month began he to go up
 from Babylon, and on the first <I>day</I> of the fifth month came he
 to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
 &nbsp; 10  For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and to do <I>it,</I> and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Ezra's pedigree. He was one of the sons of Aaron, a priest.  Him God 
 chose to be an instrument of good to Israel, that he might put honour 
 upon the priesthood, the glory of which had been much eclipsed by the 
 captivity. He is said to be <I>the son of Seraiah,</I> that Seraiah, as 
 is supposed, whom the king of Babylon put to death when he sacked 
 Jerusalem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:18,21">2 Kings xxv. 18, 21</A>.

 If we take the shortest computation, it was seventy-five years since
 Seraiah died; many reckon it much longer, and, because they suppose 
 Ezra called out in the prime of his time to public service, do 
 therefore think that Seraiah was not his immediate parent, but his 
 grandfather or great-grandfather, but that he was the first eminent 
 person that occurred in his genealogy upwards, which is carried up here 
 as high as Aaron, yet leaving out many for brevity-sake, which may be 
 supplied from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:4-81">1 Chron. vi. 4</A>,

 &c. He was a
 younger brother, or his father was Jozadak, the father of Jeshua, so 
 that he was not high priest, but nearly allied to the high priest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His character. Though of the younger house, his personal 
 qualifications made him very eminent. 

 1. He was a man of great learning, a scribe, a <I>ready scribe, in the 
 law of Moses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He was very much conversant with the scriptures, especially the
 writings of Moses, had the words ready and was well acquainted with the 
 sense and meaning of them. It is to be feared that learning ran low 
 among the Jews in Babylon; but Ezra was instrumental to revive it. The 
 Jews say that he collected and collated all the copies of the law he 
 could find out, and published an accurate edition of it, with all the 
 prophetical books, historical and poetical, that were given by divine 
 inspiration, and so made up the canon of the Old Testament, with the 
 addition of the prophecies and histories of his own time. If he was 
 raised up of God, and qualified and inclined to do this, all 
 generations have reason to call him blessed, and to bless God for him.  
 God sent to the Jews <I>prophets and scribes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:34">Matt. xxiii. 34</A>.

 Ezra went under the latter denomination. Now that prophecy was about to
 cease it was time to promote scripture-knowledge, pursuant to the 
 counsel of God by the last of the prophets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:4">Mal. iv. 4</A>.

 <I>Remember the law of Moses.</I> Gospel ministers are called
 <I>scribes instructed to the kingdom of heaven</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:52">Matt. xiii. 52</A>),

 New-Testament scribes. It was a pity that such a worthy name as this
 should be worn, as it was in the degenerate ages of the Jewish church, 
 by men who were professed enemies to Christ and his gospel (<I>Woe unto 
 you, scribes and Pharisees</I>), who were learned in the letter of the 
 law, but strangers to the spirit of it. 

 2. He was a man of great piety and holy zeal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>He had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord,</I> &c.

 (1.) That which he chose for his study was <I>the law of the Lord.</I>
 The Chaldeans, among whom he was born and bred, were famed for 
 literature, especially the study of the stars, to which, being a 
 studious man, we may suppose that Ezra was tempted to apply himself.  
 But he got over the temptation; the law of his God was more to him than 
 all the writings of their magicians and astrologers, which he knew 
 enough of with good reason to despise them.

 (2.) He <I>sought the law of the Lord,</I> that is, he made it his
 business to enquire into it, searched the scriptures, and sought the 
 knowledge of God, of his mind and will, in the scriptures, which is to 
 be found there, but not without seeking.

 (3.) He made conscience of doing according to it; he set it before him
 as his rule, formed his sentiments and temper by it, and managed 
 himself in his whole conversation according to it. This use we must 
 make of our knowledge of the scriptures; for happy are we if we do what 
 we know of the will of God.

 (4.) He set himself <I>to teach Israel the statutes and judgments</I>
 of that law. What he knew he was willing to communicate for the good of 
 others; for <I>the ministration of the Spirit is given to every man to 
 profit withal.</I> But observe the method: he first learned and then 
 taught, sought the law of the Lord and so laid up a good treasure, and 
 then instructed others and laid out what he had laid up. He also first 
 did and then taught, practised the commandments himself and then 
 directed others in the practice of them; thus his example confirmed his 
 doctrine.

 (5.) He <I>prepared his heart</I> to do all this, or he fixed his
 heart. He took pains in his studies, and thoroughly furnished himself 
 for what he designed, and then put on resolution to proceed and 
 persevere in them, and thus he became a ready scribe. Moses in Egypt, 
 Ezra in Babylon, and both in captivity, were wonderfully fitted for 
 eminent services to the church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His expedition to Jerusalem for the good of his country: <I>He 
 went up from Babylon</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and, in four months' time, came to Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It was strange that such a man as he staid so long in Babylon after his
 brethren had gone up; but God sent him not thither till he had work for 
 him to do there; and none went but those <I>whose spirits God 
 raised</I> to go up. Some think that this Artaxerxes was the same with 
 that Darius whose decree we had

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:1-12"><I>ch.</I> vi.</A>),

 and that Ezra came the very year after the temple was finished: that
 was the sixth year, this the seventh 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 so Dr. Lightfoot. My worthy and learned friend, lately deceased, Mr.
 Talents, in his chronological tables, places it about fifty-seven years 
 after the finishing of the temple; others further on. I have only to 
 observe, 

 1.  How kind the king was to him. He <I>granted him all his 
 request,</I> whatever he desired to put him into a capacity to serve 
 his country. 

 2.  How kind his people were to him. When he went many more went with 
 him, because they desired not to stay in Babylon when he had gone 
 thence, and because they would venture to dwell in Jerusalem when he 
 had gone thither. 

 3. How kind his God was to him. He obtained this favour from his king
 and country by <I>the good hand of the Lord that was upon him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:6,9"><I>v.</I> 6, 9</A>.

 Note, Every creature is that to us which God makes it to be, and from
 him our judgment proceeds. As we must see the events that <I>shall</I> 
 occur in the hand of God, so we must see the hand of God in the events 
 that <I>do</I> occur, and acknowledge him with thankfulness when we 
 have reason to call it his <I>good hand.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Now this <I>is</I> the copy of the letter that the king
 Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, <I>even</I> a scribe
 of the words of the commandments of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and of his statutes
 to Israel.
 &nbsp; 12  Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of
 the law of the God of heaven, perfect <I>peace,</I> and at such a
 time.
 &nbsp; 13  I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and
 <I>of</I> his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of
 their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.
 &nbsp; 14  Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven
 counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according
 to the law of thy God which <I>is</I> in thine hand;
 &nbsp; 15  And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his
 counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose
 habitation <I>is</I> in Jerusalem,
 &nbsp; 16  And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the
 province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people,
 and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God
 which <I>is</I> in Jerusalem:
 &nbsp; 17  That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks,
 rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings,
 and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which <I>is</I>
 in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 18  And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren,
 to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the
 will of your God.
 &nbsp; 19  The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the
 house of thy God, <I>those</I> deliver thou before the God of
 Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 20  And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy
 God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow <I>it</I> out of
 the king's treasure house.
 &nbsp; 21  And I, <I>even</I> I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all
 the treasurers which <I>are</I> beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra
 the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall
 require of you, it be done speedily,
 &nbsp; 22  Unto a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred
 measures of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to an
 hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing <I>how much.</I>
 &nbsp; 23  Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be
 diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why
 should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
 &nbsp; 24  Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and
 Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house
 of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or
 custom, upon them.
 &nbsp; 25  And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that <I>is</I> in
 thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the
 people that <I>are</I> beyond the river, all such as know the laws of
 thy God; and teach ye them that know <I>them</I> not.
 &nbsp; 26  And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of
 the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether <I>it
 be</I> unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or
 to imprisonment.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the commission which the Persian emperor granted to Ezra, 
 giving him authority to act for the good of the Jews; and it is very 
 ample and full, and beyond what could have been expected. The 
 commission runs, we suppose, in the usual form: <I>Artaxerxes, King of 
 kings.</I> This however is too high a title for any mortal man to 
 assume; he was indeed king of some kings, but to speak as if he were 
 king of all kings was to usurp <I>his</I> prerogative who hath <I>all 
 power both in heaven and in earth.</I> He sends greeting to his trusty 
 and well-beloved Ezra, whom he calls a <I>scribe of the law of the God 
 of heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 a title which (it seems by this) Ezra valued himself by, and desired no
 other, no, not when he was advanced to the proconsular dignity. He 
 reckoned it more his honour to be a <I>scribe of God's law</I> than to 
 be a peer or prince of the empire. Let us observe the articles of this 
 commission.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He gives Ezra leave to go up to Jerusalem, and as many of his 
 countrymen as pleased to go up with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He and they were captives, and therefore they would not quit his
 dominions without his royal license.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives him authority to enquire into the affairs of Judah and 
 Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The rule of his enquiry was to be <I>the law of his God, which was in
 his hand.</I> He must enquire whether the Jews, in their religion, had 
 and did according to that law--whether the temple was built, the 
 priesthood was settled, and the sacrifices were offered conformably to 
 the divine appointment. If, upon enquiry, he found any thing amiss, he 
 must see to get it amended, and, like Titus in Crete, must <I>set in 
 order the things that were wanting,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:5">Tit. i. 5</A>.

 Thus is God's law magnified and made honourable, and thus are the Jews
 restored to their ancient privilege of governing themselves by that 
 law, and are no longer under <I>the statutes that were not good,</I> 
 the statutes of their oppressors,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:25">Ezek. xx. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He entrusts him with the money that was freely given by the king 
 himself and his counsellors, and collected among his subjects, for the 
 service of the house of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let this be taken notice of, 

 (1.) To the honour of God, as the one only living and true God;' for
 even those that worshipped other gods were so convinced of the 
 sovereignty of the God of Israel that they were willing to incur 
 expenses in order to recommend themselves to his favour. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:12,68:26">Ps. xlv. 12; lxviii. 26</A>.

 (2.) To the praise of this heathen king, that he honoured the God of
 Israel though his worshippers were a despicable handful of poor men, 
 who were not able to bear the charges of their own religion and were 
 now his vassals, and that, though he was not wrought upon to quit his 
 own superstitions, yet he protected and encouraged the Jews in their 
 religion, and did not only say, <I>Be you warmed, and be you 
 filled,</I> but gave them such things as they needed.

 (3.) To the reproach of the memory of the wicked kings of Judah. Those
 that had been trained up in the knowledge and worship of the <I>God of 
 Israel,</I> and had his law and his prophets, often plundered and 
 impoverished the temple; but here a heathen prince enriched it. Thus 
 afterwards the gospel was rejected by the Jews, but welcomed by the 
 Gentiles. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:11">Rom. xi. 11</A>,

 <I>Through their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:46">Acts xiii. 46</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We are here told that Ezra was entrusted, 

 (1.) To receive this money and to carry it to Jerusalem; for he was a
 man of known integrity, whom they could confide in, that he would not 
 convert to his own use the least part of that which was given to the 
 public. We find Paul going to Jerusalem upon such an errand, <I>to 
 bring alms to his nation and offerings,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:17">Acts xxiv. 17</A>.

 (2.) To lay out this money in the best manner, in sacrifices to be
 offered upon the altar of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 and in whatever else he or his brethren thought fit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 with this limitation only that it should be <I>after the will of their
 God,</I> which they were better acquainted with than the king was. Let 
 the <I>will of our God</I> be always our rule in our expenses, and 
 particularly in what we lay out for his service. God's work must always 
 be done according to his will. Besides money, he had vessels also given 
 him for the service of the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Cyrus restored what of right belonged to the temple, but these were
 given over and above: thus it <I>receiveth its own with usury.</I> 
 These he must <I>deliver before the God of Jerusalem,</I> as intended 
 for his honour, there where he had <I>put his name.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He draws him a bill, or warrant rather, upon the <I>treasurers on 
 that side the river,</I> requiring them to furnish him with what he had 
 occasion for out of the king's revenues, and to place it to the king's 
 account, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:20,22"><I>v.</I> 20, 22</A>.

 This was considerately done; for Ezra, having yet to enquire into the
 sate of things, knew not what he should have occasion for and was 
 modest in his demand. It was also kindly done, and evinced a great 
 affection to the temple and a great confidence in Ezra.  It is the 
 interest of princes and great men to use their wealth and power for the 
 support and encouragement of religion. What else are great revenues 
 good for but that they enable men to do much good of this kind if they 
 have but hearts to do it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He charges him to let nothing be wanting that was requisite to be 
 done in or about the temple for the honour of the God of Israel. 
 Observe, in this charge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 1. How honourably he speaks of God. He had called him before <I>the God
 of Jerusalem;</I> but here, lest it should be thought that he looked 
 upon him as a local deity, he calls him twice, with great veneration, 
 the <I>God of heaven.</I> 

 2. How strictly he eyes the word and law of God, which, it is likely, 
 he had read and admired: "Whatsoever is <I>commanded by your God</I>" 
 (whose institutions, though he wrote himself <I>King of kings,</I> he 
 would not presume in the least iota or tittle to alter or add to) "let 
 it be done, let it be diligently done, with care and speed." And, 

 3.  How solicitously he deprecates the wrath of God: <I>Why should
 there be wrath against the realm?</I> The neglect and contempt of 
 religion bring the judgments of God upon kings and kingdoms; and the 
 likeliest expedient to turn away his wrath, when it is ready to break 
 out against a people, is to support and encourage religion. Would we 
 secure our peace and prosperity? Let us take care that the cause of God 
 be not starved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He exempts all the ministers of the temple from paying taxes to the 
 government. From the greatest of the priests to the least of the 
 Nethinim, <I>it shall not be lawful</I> for the king's officers <I>to 
 impose</I> that <I>toll, tribute, or custom upon them,</I> which the 
 rest of the king's subjects paid, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 This put a great honour upon them as free denizens of the empire, and
 would gain them respect as favourites of the crown; and it gave them 
 liberty to attend their ministry with more cheerfulness and freedom. We 
 suppose it was only what they needed for themselves and their families, 
 and the maintenance of their ministry, that was hereby allowed to come 
 to them custom-free.  If any of them should take occasion from this 
 privilege to meddle in trade and merchandise, they justly lost the 
 benefit of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. He empowers Ezra to nominate and appoint judges and magistrates 
 for all the Jews on that side the river, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 It was a great favour to the Jews to have such nobles of themselves,
 and especially to have them of Ezra's nomination.

 1. All that <I>knew the laws of Ezra's God</I> (that is, all that 
 professed the Jewish religion) were to be under the jurisdiction of 
 these judges, which intimates that they were exempted from the 
 jurisdiction of the heathen magistrates. 

 2. These judges were allowed and encouraged to make proselytes: Let 
 them <I>teach the laws of God</I> to <I>those that do not know 
 them.</I> Though he would not turn Jew himself, he cared not how many 
 of his subjects did. 

 3. They were authorized to enforce the judgments they gave, and the
 orders they made, conformable to <I>the law of God</I> (which was 
 hereby made <I>the law of the king</I>), with severe 
 penalties--imprisonment, banishment, fine, or death, according as their 
 law directed. They were not allowed to make new laws, but must see the 
 laws of God duly executed; and they were entrusted with the sword in 
 order that they might be <I>a terror to evil doers.</I> What could 
 Jehoshaphat, or Hezekiah, or David himself, as king, have done more for 
 the honour of God and the furtherance of religion?</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  Blessed <I>be</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of our fathers, which hath put

 Ezra cannot proceed in his story without inserting his thankful 
 acknowledgement of the goodness of God to him and his people in this 
 matter. As soon as he has concluded the king's commission, instead of 
 subjoining, <I>God save the king</I> (though that would have been 
 proper enough), he adds, <I>Blessed be the Lord;</I> for we must <I>in
 every thing give thanks,</I> and, whatever occurrences please us, we 
 must own God's hand in them, and praise his name. Two things Ezra 
 blessed God for:--

 1. For his commission. We suppose he kissed the king's hand for it, but
 that was not all: <I>Blessed be God</I> (says he) <I>that put such a 
 thing as this into the king's heart.</I> God can put things into men's 
 hearts which would not arise there of themselves, and into their heads 
 too, both by his providence and by his grace, in things <I>pertaining 
 both to life and godliness.</I> If any good appear to be in our own 
 hearts, or in the hearts of others, we must own it was God that put it 
 there, and bless him for it; for it is he that <I>worketh in us both to 
 will and to do</I> that which is good. When princes and magistrates act 
 for the suppression of vice, and the encouragement of religion, we must 
 thank God that <I>put it into their hearts</I> to do so, as much as if 
 they had granted us some particular favour. When God's house was built 
 Ezra rejoiced in what was done to beautify it. We read not of any 
 orders given to paint or gild it, or to garnish it with precious 
 stones, but to be sure that the ordinances of God were administered 
 there constantly, and carefully, and exactly according to the 
 institution; and that was indeed the beautifying of the temple. 

 2. For the encouragement he had to act in pursuance of his commission

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>He has extended mercy to me.</I> The king, in the honour he did him,
 we may suppose, had an eye to his merit, and preferred him because he 
 looked upon him to be a very sensible ingenious man; but he himself 
 ascribes his preferment purely to God's mercy. It was this that 
 recommended him to the favour of his prince.  Ezra himself was a man of 
 courage, yet he attributed his encouragement not to his own heart, but 
 to God's hand: "I was strengthened to undertake the services, <I>as the 
 hand of the Lord my God was upon me</I> to direct and support me." If 
 God gives us his hand, we are bold and cheerful; if he withdraws it, we 
 are weak as water. Whatever service we are enabled to do for God and 
 our generation, God must have all the glory of it. Strength for it is 
 derived from him, and therefore the praise of it must be given to 
 him.</P>
