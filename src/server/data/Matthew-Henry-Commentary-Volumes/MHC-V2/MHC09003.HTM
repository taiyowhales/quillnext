 In the foregoing chapter we had Samuel a young priest, though by birth
 a Levite only, for he ministered before the Lord in a linen ephod; in
 this chapter we have him a young prophet, which was more, God in an
 extraordinary manner revealing himself to him, and in him reviving, if
 not commencing, prophecy in Israel. Here is, 

 I. God's first manifestation of himself in an extraordinary manner to
 Samuel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:1-10">ver.  1-10</A>.

 II. The message he sent by him to Eli,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>.

 III. The faithful delivery of that message to Eli, and his submission
 to the righteousness of God in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:15-18">ver. 15-18</A>.

 IV. The establishment of Samuel to be a prophet in Israel,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the child Samuel ministered unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> before Eli. And
 the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was precious in those days; <I>there was</I> no
 open vision.
 &nbsp; 2 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli <I>was</I> laid down in
 his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, <I>that</I> he could not
 see;
 &nbsp; 3 And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 where the ark of God <I>was,</I> and Samuel was laid down <I>to sleep;</I>
 &nbsp; 4 That the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> called Samuel: and he answered, Here <I>am</I> I.
 &nbsp; 5 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here <I>am</I> I; for thou calledst
 me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and
 lay down.
 &nbsp; 6 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and
 went to Eli, and said, Here <I>am</I> I; for thou didst call me. And
 he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.
 &nbsp; 7 Now Samuel did not yet know the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, neither was the word of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> yet revealed unto him.
 &nbsp; 8 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> called Samuel again the third time. And he arose
 and went to Eli, and said, Here <I>am</I> I; for thou didst call me.
 And Eli perceived that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had called the child.
 &nbsp; 9 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall
 be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for thy
 servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
 &nbsp; 10 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came, and stood, and called as at other times,
 Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant
 heareth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To make way for the account of God's revealing himself first to Samuel, 
 we are here told, 

 1. How industrious Samuel was in serving God, according as his place 
 and capacity were 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>The child Samuel,</I> though but a child, <I>ministered unto the
 Lord before Eli.</I> It was an aggravation of the wickedness of Eli's 
 sons that the child Samuel shamed them. They rebelled against the Lord, 
 but Samuel ministered to him; they slighted their father's admonitions, 
 but Samuel was observant of them; he ministered before Eli, under his 
 eye and direction. It was the praise of Samuel that he was so far from 
 being influenced by their bad example that he did not in the least fall 
 off, but improved and went on. And it was a preparative for the honours 
 God intended him; he that was thus faithful in a little was soon after 
 entrusted with much more. Let those that are young be humble and 
 diligent, which they will find the surest way to preferment. Those are 
 fittest to rule who have learnt to obey.

 2. How scarce a thing prophecy then was, which made the call of Samuel
 to be the greater surprise to himself and the greater favour to Israel: 
 <I>The word of the Lord was precious in those days.</I> Now and then a 
 man of God was employed as a messenger upon an extraordinary occasion 
 (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:27"><I>ch.</I> ii. 27</A>),

 but there were no settled prophets, to whom the people might have
 recourse for counsel, nor from whom they might expect the discoveries 
 of the divine will. And the rarity of prophecy made it the more 
 precious in the account of all those that knew how to put a right value 
 upon it. It was precious, for what there was (it seems) was private: 
 <I>There was no open vision,</I> that is, there were none that were 
 publicly known to have visions. Perhaps the impiety and impurity that 
 prevailed in the tabernacle, and no doubt corrupted the whole nation, 
 had provoked God, as a token of his displeasure, to withdraw the Spirit 
 of prophecy, till the decree had gone forth for the raising up of a 
 more faithful priest, and then, as an earnest of that, this faithful 
 prophet was raised up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The manner of God's revealing himself to Samuel is here related very 
 particularly, for it was uncommon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Eli had retired. Samuel had waited on him to his bed, and the rest 
 that attended the service of the sanctuary had gone, we may suppose, to 
 their several apartments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Eli had laid down in his place;</I> he went to bed betimes, being
 unfit for business and soon weary of it, and perhaps loving his ease 
 too well. Probably he kept his chamber much, which gave his sons the 
 greater liberty. And he sought retirement the more because his eyes 
 began to wax dim, an affliction which came justly upon him for winking 
 at his sons' faults.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Samuel had laid down to sleep, in some closet near to Eli's room, 
 as his page of the back-stairs, ready within call if the old man should 
 want any thing in the night, perhaps to read to him if he could not 
 sleep. He chose to take Samuel into this office rather than any of his 
 own family, because of the towardly disposition he observed in him. 
 When his own sons were a grief to him, his little servitor was his joy. 
 Let those that are afflicted in their children thank God if they have 
 any about them in whom they are comforted. <I>Samuel had laid down ere 
 the lamp of God went out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It should seem he lay somewhere so near the holy place that he went to
 bed by that light, before any of the lamps in the branches of the 
 candlestick went out (for the main lamp never went out), which probably 
 was towards midnight. Till that time Samuel had been employing himself 
 in some good exercise or other, reading and prayer, or perhaps cleaning 
 or making ready the holy place; and then went softly to his bed.  Then 
 we may expect God's gracious visits, when we are constant and diligent 
 in our duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God called him by name, and he took it for Eli's call, and ran to 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 Samuel lay awake in his bed, his thoughts, no doubt, well employed (as
 David's 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:6">Ps. lxiii. 6</A>),

 when the Lord called to him, bishop Patrick thinks out of the most holy
 place, and so the Chaldee paraphrase reads it, <I>A voice was heard out 
 of the temple of the Lord;</I> but Eli, though it is likely he lay 
 nearer, heard it not; yet possibly it might come some other way. 
 Hereupon we have an instance,

 1.  Of Samuel's industry, and readiness to wait on Eli; supposing it 
 was he that called him, he hastened out of his warm bed and ran to him, 
 to see if he wanted any thing, and perhaps fearing he was not well. 
 "Here am I," said he--a good example to servants, to come when they are 
 called; and to the younger, not only to submit to the elder, but to be 
 careful and tender of them. 

 2. Of his infirmity, and unacquaintedness with the visions of the
 Almighty, that he took that to be only Eli's call which was really the 
 call of God. Such mistakes as these we make oftener than we think of. 
 God calls to us by his word, and we take it to be only the call of the 
 minister, and answer it accordingly; he calls to us by his providences, 
 and we look only at the instruments.  His voice cries, and it is but 
 here and there a man of wisdom that understands it to be his voice. Eli 
 assured him he did not call him, yet did not chide him for disturbing 
 him with being over-officious, did not call him a <I>fool,</I> and tell 
 him he dreamed, but mildly bade him lie down again, he had nothing for 
 him to do. If servants must be ready at their masters' call, masters 
 also must be tender of their servants' comfort: that thy <I>man-servant 
 and thy maid-servant</I> may <I>rest as well as thou.</I> So <I>Samuel 
 went and lay down.</I> God calls many by the ministry of the word, and 
 they say, as Samuel did, "Here am I;" but not looking at God, nor 
 discerning his voice in the call, the impressions of it are soon lost; 
 they lie down again, and their convictions come to nothing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The same call was repeated, and the same mistake made, a second and 
 third time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:6-9"><I>v.</I> 6-9</A>.

 1. God continued to call the child <I>yet again</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and <I>again the third time,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Note, The call which divine grace designs to make effectual shall be
 repeated till it is so, that is, till we come at the call; for the 
 purpose of God, according to which we are called, shall certainly 
 stand.

 2. Samuel was still ignorant that it was the Lord that called him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Samuel did not yet know the Lord.</I> He knew the written word, and
 was acquainted with the mind of God in that, but he did not yet 
 apprehend the way in which God reveals himself to his servants the 
 prophets, especially by a <I>still small voice;</I> this was altogether 
 new and strange to him.  Perhaps he would have been sooner aware of a 
 divine revelation had it come in a dream or a vision; but this was a 
 way he had not only not known himself, but not heard of. Those that 
 have the greatest knowledge of divine things must remember the time 
 when they were as babes, unskilful in the word of righteousness.  
 <I>When I was a child I understood as a child.</I> Yet let us not 
 despise the day of small things. <I>Thus did Samuel</I> (so the margin 
 reads it) <I>before he knew the Lord, and before the word of the Lord 
 was revealed unto him;</I> thus he blundered one time after another, 
 but afterwards he understood his duty better. The witness of the Spirit 
 in the hearts of the faithful is often thus mistaken, by which means 
 they lose the comfort of it; and the strivings of the Spirit with the 
 consciences of sinners are likewise often mistaken, and so the benefit 
 of their convictions is lost. <I>God speaketh once, yea, twice, but man 
 perceiveth it not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:14">Job xxxiii. 14</A>.

 3. Samuel went to Eli this second and third time, the voice perhaps
 resembling his, and the child being very near to him; and he tells Eli, 
 with great assurance, "<I>Thou didst call me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>),

 it could be no one else." Samuel's disposition to come when he was
 called, though but by Eli, proving him dutiful and active, qualified 
 him for the favour now to be shown him; God chooses to employ such. But 
 there was a special providence in it, that he should go thus often to 
 Eli; for hereby, at length, <I>Eli perceived that the Lord had called 
 the child,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 And,

 (1.) This would be a mortification to him, and he would apprehend it to
 be a step towards his family's being degraded, that when God had 
 something to say he should choose to say it to the child Samuel, his 
 servant that waited on him, and not to him.  And it would humble him 
 the more when afterwards he found it was a message to himself, and yet 
 sent to him by a child.  He had reason to look upon this as a further 
 token of God's displeasure. 

 (2.) This would put him upon enquiring what it was that God said to
 Samuel, and would abundantly satisfy him of the truth and certainty of 
 what should be delivered, and no room would be left for him to suggest 
 that it was but a fancy of Samuel's; for before the message was 
 delivered he himself perceived that God was about to speak to him, and 
 yet must not know what it was till he had it from Samuel himself. Thus 
 even the infirmities and mistakes of those whom God employs are 
 overruled by infinite Wisdom, and made serviceable to his purposes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. At length Samuel was put into a posture to receive a message from 
 God, not to be lodged with himself and go no further, but, that he 
 might be a complete prophet, to be published and made an open vision. 
 
 1. Eli, perceiving that it was the voice of God that Samuel heard, gave 
 him instructions what to say, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 This was honestly done, that though it was a disgrace to him for God's
 call to pass him by, and be directed to Samuel, yet he put him in the 
 way how to entertain it. Had he been envious of this honour done to 
 Samuel, he would have done what he could to deprive him of it, and, 
 since he did not perceive it himself, would have bidden him lie down 
 and sleep, and never heed it, it was but a dream; but he was of a 
 better spirit than to act so; he gave him the best advice he could, for 
 the forwarding of his advancement. Thus the elder should, without 
 grudging, do their utmost to assist and improve the younger that are 
 rising up, though they see themselves likely to be darkened and 
 eclipsed by them.  Let us never be wanting to inform and instruct those 
 that are coming after us, even such as will soon be preferred before 
 us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:30">John i. 30</A>.

 The instruction Eli gave him was, when God called the next time, to
 say, <I>Speak, Lord, for they servant heareth.</I> He must call himself 
 God's servant, must desire to know the mind of God. "<I>Speak, 
 Lord,</I> speak to me, speak now:" and he must prepare to hear, and 
 promise to attend: <I>Thy servant heareth.</I> Note, Then we may expect 
 that God will speak to us, when we set ourselves to hearken to what he 
 says, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:8,Hab+2:1">Ps. lxxxv. 8; Hab. ii. 1</A>.

 When we come to read the word of God, and to attend on the preaching of
 it, we should come thus disposed, submitting ourselves to the 
 commanding light and power of it: <I>Speak, Lord, for thy servant 
 heareth.</I> 

 2.  It should seem that God spoke the fourth time in a way somewhat
 different from the other; though the call was, as at other times, a 
 call to him by name, yet now <I>he stood and called,</I> which 
 intimates that there was now some visible appearance of the divine 
 glory to Samuel, a vision that stood before him, like that before 
 Eliphaz, though he <I>could not discern the form thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:16">Job iv. 16</A>.
 
 This satisfied him that it was not Eli that called; for he now <I>saw
 the voice that spoke with him,</I> as it is expressed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:12">Rev. i. 12</A>.

 Now also the call was doubled--<I>Samuel, Samuel,</I> as if God
 delighted in the mention of his name, or to intimate that now he should 
 be made to understand who spoke to him.  <I>God hath spoken once, twice 
 have I heard this,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:11">Ps. lxii. 11</A>.

 It was an honour to him that God was pleased to <I>know him by name</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:12">Exod. xxxiii. 12</A>),

 and then his call was powerful and effectual when he called him by
 name, and so brought it particularly to him, as <I>Saul, Saul.</I> Thus 
 God called to Abraham by name, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:1">Gen. xxii. 1</A>.

 3. Samuel said, as he was taught, <I>Speak, for thy servant
 heareth.</I> Note, Good words should be put into children's mouths 
 betimes, and apt expressions of pious and devout affections, by which 
 they may be prepared for a better acquaintance with divine things, and 
 trained up to a holy converse with them. Teach young people what they 
 shall say, for <I>they cannot order their speech by reason of 
 darkness.</I> Samuel did not now rise and run as before when he thought 
 Eli called, but lay still and listened. The more sedate and composed 
 our spirits are the better prepared they are for divine discoveries.  
 Let all tumultuous thoughts and passions be kept under, and every thing 
 be quiet and serene in the soul, and then we are fit to hear from God.  
 All must be silent when he speaks. But observe, Samuel left out one 
 word; he did not say, <I>Speak, Lord,</I> but only, <I>Speak, for thy 
 servant heareth,</I> way was made for the message he was now to 
 receive, and Samuel was brought acquainted with the words of God and 
 visions of the Almighty, and this <I>ere the lamp of God went out</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 <I>in the temple of the Lord,</I> which some of the Jewish writers put
 a mystical sense upon; before the fall of Eli, and the eclipsing of the 
 Urim and Thummim for some time thereby, God called Samuel, and made him 
 an oracle, whence they have an observation among their doctors, <I>That 
 the sun riseth, and the sun goeth down</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:5">Eccl. i. 5</A>),

 that is, say they, Ere God maketh the sun of one righteous man to set,
 he makes the sun of another righteous man to rise. <I>Smith ex 
 Kimchi.</I></P>

 the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.

 and more also, if thou hide <I>any</I> thing from me of all the things

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The message which, after all this introduction, God delivered to 
 Samuel concerning Eli's house. God did not come to him now to tell him 
 how great a man he should be in his day, what a figure he should make, 
 and what a blessing he should be in Israel. Young people have commonly 
 a great curiosity to be told their fortune, but God came to Samuel, not 
 to gratify his curiosity, but to employ him in his service and send him 
 on an errand to another person, which was much better; and yet the 
 matter of this first message, which no doubt made a very great 
 impression upon him, might be of good use to him afterwards, when his 
 own sons proved, though not so bad as Eli's, yet not so good as they 
 should have been,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:3"><I>ch.</I> viii. 3</A>.

 The message is short, not nearly so long as that which the man of God
 brought, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:27"><I>ch.</I> ii. 27</A>.

 For, Samuel being a child, it could not be expected that he should
 remember a long message, and God considered his frame.  The memories of 
 children must not be overcharged, no, not with divine things. But it is 
 a sad message, a message of wrath, to ratify the message in the former 
 chapter, and to bind on the sentence there pronounced, because perhaps 
 Eli did not give so much regard to that as he ought to have done.  
 Divine threatenings, the less they are heeded, the surer they will come 
 and the heavier they will fall. Reference is here had to what was there 
 said concerning both the sin and the punishment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Concerning the sin: it is the <I>iniquity that he knoweth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The man of God told him of it, and many a time his own conscience had
 told him of it. O what a great deal of guilt and corruption is there in 
 us concerning which we may say, "It is the iniquity <I>which our own 
 heart knoweth,</I> we are conscious to ourselves of it!" In short, the 
 iniquity was this: <I>His sons made themselves vile, and he restrained 
 them not.</I> Or, as it is in the Hebrew, he <I>frowned not upon 
 them.</I> If he did show his dislike of their wicked courses, yet not 
 to that degree that he ought to have done: he did reprove them, but he 
 did not punish them, for the mischief they did, nor deprive them of 
 their power to do mischief, which as a father, high priest, and judge, 
 he might have done. Note,

 (1.) Sinners do by their own wickedness make themselves vile. They
 debauch themselves (for <I>every man is tempted when he is drawn aside 
 of his own lusts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:14">Jam. i. 14</A>)

 and thereby they debase themselves, and make themselves not only mean,
 but odious to the holy God and holy men and angels. Sin is a vile 
 thing, and degrades men more than any thing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+15:4">Ps. xv. 4</A>.

 Eli's sons made light of God, and made his offerings vile in the
 people's eyes; but the shame returned into their own bosom: they 
 <I>made themselves vile.</I>

 (2.) Those that do not restrain the sins of others, when it is in the
 power of their hand to do it, make themselves partakers of the guilt, 
 and will be charged as accessaries: Those in authority will have a 
 great deal to answer for if they make not the sword they bear a 
 <I>terror to evil workers.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Concerning the punishment: it is <I>that which I have spoken 
 concerning his house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12 and 13</A>.

 <I>I have told him that I will judge his house for ever,</I> that is,
 that a curse should be entailed upon his family from generation to 
 generation.  The particulars of this curse we had before; they are not 
 here repeated, but it is added,

 (1.) That when that sentence began to be executed it would be very
 dreadful and amazing to all Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Both the ears of every one that hears it shall tingle.</I> Every
 Israelite would be struck with terror and astonishment to hear of the 
 slaying of Eli's sons, the breaking of Eli's neck, and the dispersion 
 of Eli's family. Lord, how terrible art thou in thy judgments! If this 
 be done in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry? Note, God's 
 judgments upon others should affect us with a holy fear,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:120">Ps. cxix. 120</A>.

 (2.) That these direful first-fruits of the execution would be certain
 earnests of the progress and full accomplishment of it: <I>When I begin 
 I will</I> proceed and <I>make an end</I> of all that I have 
 threatened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It is intimated that it might possibly be some time before he would
 begin, but let them not call that forbearance an acquittance, nor that 
 reprieve a pardon; for when at length he does begin he will make 
 thorough work of it, and, though he stay long, he will strike home.  
 
 (3.) That no room should be left for hope that this sentence might be
 reversed and the execution stayed or mitigated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 [1.] God would not revoke the sentence, for he backed it with an oath:
 <I>I have sworn to the house of Eli;</I> and God will not go back from 
 what he has sworn either in mercy or judgment. 

 [2.] He would never come to a composition for the forfeiture: "The
 <I>iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor 
 offering for ever.</I> No atonement shall be made for the sin, nor any 
 abatement of the punishment." This was the imperfection of the legal 
 sacrifices, that there were iniquities which they did not reach, which 
 they would not purge; <I>but the blood of Christ cleanseth from all 
 sin,</I> and secures all those that by faith are interested in it from 
 that eternal death which is the wages of sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The delivery of this message to Eli.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Samuel's modest concealment of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 (1.) He <I>lay till the morning,</I> and we may well suppose he lay
 awake pondering on what he had heard, repeating it to himself, and 
 considering what use he must make of it. After we have received the 
 spiritual food of God's word, it is good to compose ourselves, and give 
 it time to digest. 

 (2.) <I>He opened the doors of the house of the Lord,</I> in the
 morning, as he used to do, being up first in the tabernacle. That he 
 should do so at other times was an instance of extraordinary 
 towardliness in a child, but that he should do so this morning was an 
 instance of great humility. God had highly honoured him above all the 
 children of his people, yet he was not proud of the honour, nor puffed 
 up with it, did not think himself too great and too good to be employed 
 in these mean and servile offices, but, as cheerfully as ever, went and 
 opened the doors of the tabernacle. Note, Those to whom God manifests 
 himself he makes and keeps low in their own eyes, and willing to stoop 
 to any thing by which they may be serviceable to his glory, though but 
 as door-keepers in his house. One would have expected that Samuel would 
 be so full of his vision as to forget his ordinary service, that he 
 would go among his companions, as one in an ecstasy, to tell them what 
 converse he had had with God this night; but he modestly keeps it to 
 himself, tells the vision to no man, but silently goes on in his 
 business. Our secret communion with God is not to be proclaimed upon 
 the house-tops. 

 (3.) <I>He feared to show Eli the vision.</I> If he was afraid Eli
 would be angry with him and chide him, then we have cause to suspect 
 that Eli used to be as severe with this towardly child as he was 
 indulgent to his own wicked sons, and this will bear hard upon him.  
 But we will suppose it was rather because he was afraid to grieve and 
 trouble the good old man that he was so shy. If he had run immediately 
 with the tidings to Eli, this would have looked as if he desired the 
 woeful day and hoped to build his own family upon the ruin of Eli's; 
 therefore it became him not to be forward to declare the vision. No 
 good man can take pleasure in bringing evil tidings, especially not 
 Samuel to Eli, the pupil to the tutor whom he loves and honours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Eli's careful enquiry into it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 As soon as ever he heard Samuel stirring he called for him, probably to
 his bed-side; and, having before perceived that God had spoken to him, 
 he obliged him, not only by importunity (<I>I pray thee, hide it not 
 from me</I>), but, finding him timorous and backward, by an adjuration
 likewise--<I>God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing 
 from me!</I> He had reason enough to fear that the message prophesied 
 no good concerning him, but evil; and yet, because it was a message 
 from God, he could not contentedly be ignorant of it. A good man 
 desires to be acquainted with all the will of God, whether it make for 
 him or against him. His adjuration--<I>God do so to thee, if thou hide 
 any thing from me</I>--may intimate the fearful doom of unfaithful 
 watchmen; if they warn not sinners, they bring upon themselves that 
 wrath and curse which they should have denounced, in God's name, 
 against those that <I>go on still in their trespasses.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Samuel's faithful delivery of his message at last 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>He told him every whit.</I> When he saw that he must tell him he 
 never minced the matter, nor offered to make it better than it was, to 
 blunt that which was sharp, or to gild the bitter pill, but delivered 
 the message as plainly and fully as he received it, <I>not shunning to 
 declare the whole counsel of God.</I> Christ's ministers must deal thus 
 faithfully.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Eli's pious acquiescence in it. He did not question Samuel's 
 integrity, was not cross with him, nor had he any thing to object 
 against the equity of the sentence. He did not complain of the 
 punishment, as Cain did, that it was greater than he either deserved or 
 could bear, but patiently submitted, and accepted the punishment of his 
 iniquity. <I>It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good.</I> He 
 understood the sentence to intend only a temporal punishment, and the 
 entail of disgrace and poverty upon his posterity, and not a final 
 separation of them from the favour of God, and therefore he cheerfully 
 submitted, did not repine, because he knew the demerits of his family; 
 nor did he now intercede for the reversing of the sentence, because God 
 had ratified it with a solemn oath, of which he would not repent. He 
 therefore composes himself into a humble resignation to God's will, as 
 Aaron, in a case not much unlike. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:3">Lev. x. 3</A>,

 <I>He held his peace.</I> In a few words,

 (1.) He lays down this satisfying truth, "<I>It is the Lord;</I> it is
 he that pronounces the judgment, from whose bar there lies no appeal 
 and against whose sentence there lies no exception. It is he that will 
 execute the judgment, whose power cannot be resisted, his justice 
 arraigned, nor his sovereignty contested. <I>It is the Lord,</I> who 
 will thus sanctify and glorify himself, and it is highly fit he should. 
 <I>It is the Lord,</I> with whom there is no unrighteousness, who never 
 did nor ever will do any wrong to any of his creatures, nor exact more 
 than their iniquity deserves." 

 (2.) He infers from it this satisfying conclusion: "<I>Let him do what
 seemeth him good.</I> I have nothing to say against his proceedings. He 
 is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works, and therefore 
 <I>his will be done. I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I 
 have sinned against him.</I>" Thus we ought to quiet ourselves under 
 God's rebuke, and never to strive with our Maker.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Samuel being thus brought acquainted with the visions of God, we have 
 here an account of the further honour done him as a prophet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God did him honour. Having begun to favour him, he carried on and 
 crowned his own work in him: <I>Samuel grew, for the Lord was with 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 All our increase in wisdom and grace is owing to the presence of God
 with us; this is all in all to our growth. God honoured Samuel,

 1. By further manifestations of himself to him. Samuel had faithfully
 delivered the message he was entrusted with, and therefore God employed 
 him again in his service: <I>The Lord revealed himself again to Samuel 
 in Shiloh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Note, God will graciously repeat his visits to those that receive them
 aright. 

 2. By fulfilling what he spoke by him: <I>God did let none of his words
 fall to the ground,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Whatever Samuel said, as a prophet, it proved true, and was
 accomplished in its season. Probably there were some remarkable 
 instances of the truth of Samuel's predictions that happened soon 
 after, which confirmed those that were afterwards to be fulfilled, and 
 gave general satisfaction as to his mission. God will <I>confirm the 
 word of his servants,</I> and <I>perform the counsel of his 
 messengers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26">Isa. xliv. 26</A>),
 
 and will do what he hath said.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Israel did him honour. They all knew and owned <I>that Samuel was 
 established to be a prophet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 1. He grew famous; all that came up to Shiloh to worship took notice of
 him, and admired him, and talked of him when they returned home.  Early 
 piety will be the greatest honour of young people, and bring them, as 
 much as any thing, and as soon, into reputation. Those that honour God 
 he will honour. 

 2.  He grew useful and very serviceable to his generation. He that
 began betimes to <I>be</I> good soon came to <I>do</I> good. His 
 established commission from God, and established reputation with the 
 people, gave him a great opportunity of shining as a light in Israel. 
 When old Eli was rejected, young Samuel was established; for God will 
 never leave himself without a witness nor his church without a 
 guide.</P>
