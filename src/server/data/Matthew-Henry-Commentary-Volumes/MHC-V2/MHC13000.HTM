 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In common things repetition is thought needless and nauseous; but, in 
 sacred things, <I>precept must be upon precept and line upon line. To 
 me,</I> says the apostle, <I>to write the same things is not grievous, 
 but for you it is safe,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1">Phil. iii. 1</A>.

 These books of Chronicles are in a great measure repetition; so are
 much of the second and third of the four evangelists: and yet there are 
 no tautologies either here or there no <I>vain repetitions.</I> We may 
 be ready to think that of all the books of holy scripture we could best 
 spare these two books of Chronicles. Perhaps we might, and yet we could 
 ill spare them: for there are many most excellent useful things in 
 them, which we find not elsewhere. And as for what we find here which 
 we have already met with,

 1. It might be of great use to those who lived when these books were
 first published, before the canon of the Old Testament was completed 
 and the particles of it put together; for it would remind them of what 
 was more fully related in the other books. Abstracts, abridgments, and 
 references, are of use in divinity as well as law. That, perhaps, may 
 not be said in vain which yet has been said before. 

 2. It is still of use, that <I>out of the mouth of two witnesses every
 word may be established,</I> and, being inculcated, may be remembered. 
 The penman of these books is supposed to be Ezra, that <I>ready scribe 
 in the law of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:6">Ezra vii. 6</A>.

 It is a groundless story of that apocryphal writer

 (<U>2 Esdr. xiv. 21</U>,

 &c.) that, all the law being burnt, Ezra was divinely inspired to write
 it all over again, which yet might take rise from the books of 
 Chronicles, where we find, though not all the same story repeated, yet 
 the names of all those who were the subjects of that story. These books 
 are called in the Hebrew <I>words of days</I>--journals or annals, 
 because, by divine direction, collected out of some public and 
 authentic records. The collection was made after the captivity, and yet 
 the language of the originals, written before, it sometimes retained, 
 as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:9">2 Chron. v. 9</A>,

 <I>there it is unto this day,</I> which must have been written before
 the destruction of the temple. The LXX. calls it a book 
 <B><I>Paraleipomenon</I></B>--of <I>things left,</I> or overlooked, by 
 the preceding historians; and several such things there are in it. It 
 is the rereward, the gathering host, of this sacred camp, which gathers 
 up what remained, that nothing might be lost. In this first book we 
 have, 

 I. A collection of sacred genealogies, from Adam to David: and they are 
 none of those which the apostle calls <I>endless genealogies,</I> but 
 have their use and end in Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+1:1-9:44"><I>ch.</I> i.-ix.</A>

 Divers little passages of history are here inserted which we had not
 before.  

 II. A repetition of the history of the translation of the kingdom from
 Saul to David, and of the triumph of David's reign, with large 
 additions,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+10:1-21:30"><I>ch.</I> x.-xxi.</A>

 III. An original account of the settlement David made of the
 ecclesiastical affairs, and the preparation he made for the building of 
 the temple,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:1-29:30"><I>ch.</I> xxii-xxix.</A>

 These are <I>words of days,</I> of the oldest days, of the best days,
 of the Old-Testament church. The reigns of kings and dates of kingdoms, 
 as well as the lives of common persons, are reckoned by <I>days;</I> 
 for a little time often gives a great turn, and yet all time is nothing 
 to eternity.</P>
