 The temple being built and furnished for God, we have here,

 I.  Possession given to him, by bringing in the dedicated things

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:1">ver. 1</A>),

 but especially the ark, the token of his presence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:2-10">ver. 2-10</A>.

 II.  Possession taken by him, in a cloud, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>.

 For if any man open the door of his heart to God he will come in,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 was finished: and Solomon brought in <I>all</I> the things that David
 his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all
 the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.
 &nbsp; 2  Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the
 heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
 Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> out of the city of David, which <I>is</I> Zion.
 &nbsp; 3  Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the
 king in the feast which <I>was</I> in the seventh month.
 &nbsp; 4  And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up
 the ark.
 &nbsp; 5  And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the
 congregation, and all the holy vessels that <I>were</I> in the
 tabernacle, these did the priests <I>and</I> the Levites bring up.
 &nbsp; 6  Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that
 were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and
 oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
 &nbsp; 7  And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most
 holy <I>place, even</I> under the wings of the cherubims:
 &nbsp; 8  For the cherubims spread forth <I>their</I> wings over the place
 of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves
 thereof above.
 &nbsp; 9  And they drew out the staves <I>of the ark,</I> that the ends of
 the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they
 were not seen without. And there it is unto this day.
 &nbsp; 10  <I>There was</I> nothing in the ark save the two tables which
 Moses put <I>therein</I> at Horeb, when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> made <I>a covenant</I>
 with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This agrees with what we had 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:2-10">1 Kings viii. 2</A>,

 &c., where an account was given
 of the solemn introduction of the ark into the new-erected temple. 

 1. There needed no great solemnity for the bringing in of the dedicated
 things,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They added to the wealth, and perhaps were so disposed as to add to the
 beauty of it; but they could not add to the holiness, for it was the 
 <I>temple that sanctified the gold,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:17">Matt. xxiii. 17</A>.

 See how just Solomon was both to God and to his father. Whatever David
 had dedicated to God, however much he might have liked it himself, he 
 would by no means alienate it, but put it among the treasures of the 
 temple.  Those children that would inherit their godly parents' 
 blessing must religiously pursue their pious intentions and not defeat 
 them. When Solomon had made all the vessels of the temple in abundance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+4:18"><I>ch.</I> iv. 18</A>),

 many of the materials were left, which he would not convert to any
 other use, but laid up in the treasury for a time of need. Dedicated 
 things must not be alienated. It is sacrilege to do it. 

 2. But it was fit that the ark should be brought in with great
 solemnity; and so it was. All the other vessels were made new, and 
 larger, in proportion to the house, than they had been in the 
 tabernacle. But the ark, with the mercy-seat and the cherubim, was the 
 same; for the presence and the grace of God are the same in little 
 assemblies that they are in large ones, in the poor condition of the 
 church that they are in its prosperous estate. Wherever two or three 
 are gathered together in Christ's name there is he as truly present 
 with them as if there were 2000 or 3000. The ark was brought in 
 attended by a very great assembly of the elders of Israel, who came to 
 grace and solemnity; and a very sumptuous appearance no doubt they 
 made, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>.
 
 It was carried by the priests

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 brought into the most holy place, and put under the wings of the great
 cherubim which Solomon had set up there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 <I>There they are unto this day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 not the day when this book was written after the captivity, but when
 that was written out of which this story was transcribed. Or they were 
 there (so it might be read) unto this day, the day of Jerusalem's 
 desolations, that fatal day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:7">Ps. cxxxvii. 7</A>.

 The ark was a type of Christ, and, as such, a token of the presence of
 God. That gracious promise, <I>Lo, I am with you always, even unto the 
 end of the world,</I> does in effect bring the ark into our religious 
 assemblies if we by faith and prayer put that promise in suit; and this 
 we should be most solicitous and earnest for. <I>Lord, if thy presence 
 go not up with us,</I> wherefore should we go up? The temple itself, if 
 Christ leave it, is a desolate place,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:38">Matt. xxiii. 38</A>.

 3.  With the ark they brought up the tabernacle and all the <I>holy
 vessels that were in the tabernacle,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Those were not alienated, because they had been dedicated to God, were
 not altered or melted down for the new work, though there was no need 
 of them; but they were carefully laid up as monuments of antiquity, and 
 probably as many of the vessels as were fit for use were still used.

 4. This was done with great joy. They kept a holy feast upon the
 occasion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 
 and <I>sacrificed sheep and oxen without number,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) The establishment of the public worship of God according to his
 institution, and with the tokens of his presence, is, and ought to be, 
 matter of great joy to any people.

 (2.) When Christ is formed in a soul, the law written in the heart, the
 ark of the covenant settled there, so that it becomes the temple of the 
 Holy Ghost, there is true satisfaction in that soul.

 (3.) Whatever we have the comfort of we must, by the sacrifice of
 praise, give God the glory of, and not be straitened therein; <I>for 
 with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</I> If God favour us with his 
 presence, we must honour him with our services, the best we have.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
 holy <I>place:</I> (for all the priests <I>that were</I> present were
 sanctified, <I>and</I> did not <I>then</I> wait by course:
 &nbsp; 12  Also the Levites <I>which were</I> the singers, all of them of
 Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren,
 <I>being</I> arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and
 harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an
 hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)
 &nbsp; 13  It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers <I>were</I>
 as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and when they lifted up <I>their</I> voice with the trumpets
 and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 <I>saying,</I> For <I>he is</I> good; for his mercy <I>endureth</I> for ever:
 that <I>then</I> the house was filled with a cloud, <I>even</I> the house
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 &nbsp; 14  So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of
 the cloud: for the glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had filled the house of God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon, and the elders of Israel, had done what they could to grace 
 the solemnity of the introduction of the ark; but God, by testifying 
 his acceptance of what they did, put the greatest honour upon it. The 
 cloud of glory that filled the house beautified it more than all the 
 gold with which it was overlaid or the precious stones with which it 
 was garnished; and yet that was no glory in comparison with the glory 
 of the gospel dispensation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:8-10">2 Cor. iii. 8-10</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How God took possession of the temple: He <I>filled it with a 
 cloud,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 1. Thus he signified his acceptance of this temple to be the same to
 him that the tabernacle of Moses was, and assured them that he would be 
 the same in it; for it was by a cloud that he made his public entry 
 into that,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+40:34">Exod. xl. 34</A>.

 2. Thus he considered the weakness and infirmity of those to whom he
 manifested himself, who could not bear the dazzling lustre of the 
 divine light: it would have overpowered them; he therefore <I>spread 
 his cloud upon it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:9">Job xxvi. 9</A>.

 Christ revealed things unto his disciples as they were able to bear
 them, and in parables, which wrapped up divine things as in a cloud.

 3. Thus he would affect all that worshipped in his courts with holy
 reverence and fear. Christ's disciples were afraid when they entered 
 into a cloud,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:34">Luke ix. 34</A>.

 4. Thus he would intimate the darkness of that dispensation, by reason
 of which they could not stedfastly look to the end of those things 
 which were now abolished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:13">2 Cor. iii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. When he took possession of it. 

 1. <I>When the priests had come out of the holy place,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This is the way of giving possession. All must come out, that the
 rightful owner may come in. Would we have God dwell in our hearts? We 
 must leave room for him; let every thing else give way. We are here 
 told that upon this occasion the whole family of the priests attended, 
 and not any one particular course: <I>All the priests that were present 
 were sanctified</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 because there was work enough for them all, when such a multitude of
 sacrifices were to be offered, and because it was fit that they should 
 all be eye-witnesses of this solemnity and receive the impressions of 
 it. 

 2.  When the singers and musicians praised God, then the house was
 filled with a cloud. This is very observable; it was not when they 
 <I>offered sacrifices,</I> but when they <I>sang the praises of 
 God,</I> that God gave them this token of his favour; for the sacrifice 
 of praise <I>pleaseth the Lord</I> better than that of <I>an ox or 
 bullock,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:31">Ps. lxix. 31</A>.

 All the singers and musicians were employed, those of all the three
 families; and, to complete the concert, 120 priests, with their 
 trumpets, joined with them, all standing at the east end of the altar, 
 on that side of the court which lay outmost towards the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 And, when this part of the service began, the glory of God appeared.
 Observe,

 (1.) It was when they were unanimous, when they were as one, to make
 one sound. The Holy God descended on the apostles when they met with 
 one accord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:1-4">Acts ii. 1-4</A>.
 
 Where unity is the Lord commands the blessing.

 (2.) It was when they were lively and hearty, and <I>lifted up their
 voice to praise the Lord.</I> Then we serve God acceptably when we are 
 fervent in spirit serving him.

 (3.) It was when they were, in their praises, celebrating the
 everlasting mercy and goodness of God. As there is one saying oftener 
 repeated in scripture than this, <I>his mercy endureth for ever</I>
 (twenty-six times in one psalm,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:1-26">Ps. cxxxvi.</A>,

 and often elsewhere), so there is none more signally owned from heaven;
 for it was not the expression of some rapturous flights that the 
 priests were singing when the glory of God appeared, but this plain 
 song, <I>He is good, and his mercy endureth for ever.</I> God's 
 goodness is his glory, and he is pleased when we give him the glory of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What was the effect of it. The <I>priests themselves could not 
 stand to minister, by reason of the cloud</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 which, as it was an evidence that the law made men priests that had
 infirmity, so (as bishop Patrick observes) it was a plain intimation 
 that the Levitical priesthood should cease, and stand no longer to 
 minister, when the Messiah should come, in whom <I>the fulness of the 
 godhead should dwell bodily.</I> In him the glory of God dwelt among 
 us, but covered with a cloud. The Word was made flesh; and when he 
 comes to his temple, like a refiner's fire, <I>who may abide the day of 
 his coming?</I> And <I>who shall stand when he appeareth?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:1,2">Mal. iii. 1, 2</A>.</P>
