 At this chapter begins the story of Samson, the last of the judges of 
 Israel whose story is recorded in this book, and next before Eli. The 
 passages related concerning him are, from first to last, very 
 surprising and uncommon. The figure he makes in this history is really 
 great, and yet vastly different from that of his predecessors. We never 
 find him at the head either of a court or of an army, never upon the 
 throne of judgment nor in the field of battle, yet, in his own proper 
 person, a great patriot of his country, and a terrible scourge and 
 check to its enemies and oppressors; he was an eminent believer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:32">Heb. xi. 32</A>)

 and a glorious type of him who with his own arm wrought salvation. The 
 history of the rest of the judges commences from their advancement to 
 that station, but Samson's begins with his birth, nay, with his 
 conception, no less than an angel from heaven ushers him into the 
 world, as a pattern of what should be afterwards done to John Baptist 
 and to Christ. This is related in this chapter.  

 I. The occasion of raising up this deliverer was the oppression of 
 Israel by the Philistines,

 II. His birth is foretold by an angel to his mother,

 IV. They both together have it again from the angel

 whom they treat with respect

 and who, to their great amazement, discovers his dignity at parting,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> delivered them into the hand of the
 Philistines forty years.
 &nbsp; 2 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the
 Danites, whose name <I>was</I> Manoah; and his wife <I>was</I> barren, and
 bare not.
 &nbsp; 3 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> appeared unto the woman, and said
 unto her, Behold now, thou <I>art</I> barren, and bearest not: but
 thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
 &nbsp; 4 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor
 strong drink, and eat not any unclean <I>thing:</I>
 &nbsp; 5 For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor
 shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto
 God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of
 the hand of the Philistines.
 &nbsp; 6 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of
 God came unto me, and his countenance <I>was</I> like the countenance
 of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he
 <I>was,</I> neither told he me his name:
 &nbsp; 7 But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a
 son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any
 unclean <I>thing:</I> for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from
 the womb to the day of his death.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first verse gives us a short account, such as we have too often met 
 with already, of the great distress that Israel was in, which gave 
 occasion for the raising up of a deliverer. They did evil, as they had 
 done, <I>in the sight of the Lord,</I> and then God delivered them, as 
 he had done, into the hands of their enemies. If there had been no sin, 
 there would have needed no Saviour; but sin was suffered to abound, 
 that grace might much more abound. The enemies God now sold them to 
 were the Philistines, their next neighbours, that lay among them, the 
 first and chief of the nations which were devoted to destruction, but 
 which God <I>left to prove them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+3:1,3"><I>ch.</I> iii. 1, 3</A>),

 <I>the five lords of the Philistines,</I> an inconsiderable people in
 comparison with Israel (they had but five cities of any note), and yet, 
 when God made use of them as the staff in his hand, they were very 
 oppressive and vexatious.  And this trouble lasted longer than any yet: 
 it continued forty years, though probably not always alike violent. 
 When Israel was in this distress Samson was born; and here we have his 
 birth foretold by an angel.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His extraction. He was of the tribe of Dan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 <I>Dan</I> signifies a <I>judge</I> or <I>judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:6">Gen. xxx. 6</A>.

 And probably it was with an eye to Samson that dying Jacob foretold,
 <I>Dan shall judge his people,</I> that is, "he shall produce a judge 
 for his people, though one of the sons of the handmaids, as one, as 
 well as any one, of the tribes of Israel," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:16">Gen. xlix. 16</A>.

 The lot of the tribe of Dan lay next to the country of the Philistines,
 and therefore one of that tribe was most fit to be made a bridle upon 
 them. His parents had been long childless. Many eminent persons were 
 born of mothers that had been kept a great while in the want of the 
 blessing of children, as Isaac, Joseph, Samuel, and John Baptist, that 
 the mercy might be the more acceptable when it did come. <I>Sing, O 
 barren! thou that didst not bear,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1">Isa. liv. 1</A>.

 Note, Mercies long waited for often prove signal mercies, and it is
 made to appear that they were worth waiting for, and by them others may 
 be encouraged to continue their hope in God's mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The glad tidings brought to his mother, that she should have a son. 
 The messenger was an <I>angel of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 yet appearing as a man, with the aspect and garb of a prophet, or man 
 of God. And this angel (as the learned bishop Patrick supposes, on 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:18"><I>v.</I>  18</A>)

 was the Lord himself, that is, the <I>Word of the Lord,</I> who was to 
 be the Messiah, for his name is called <I>Wonderful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>,

 and <I>Jehovah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The great Redeemer did in a particular manner concern himself about 
 this typical redeemer. It was not so much for the sake of Manoah and 
 his wife, obscure Danites, that this extraordinary message was sent, 
 but for Israel's sake, whose deliverer he was to be, and not only so 
 (his services to Israel not seeming to answer to the grandeur of his 
 entry) but for the Messiah's sake, whose type he was to be, and whose 
 birth must be foretold by an angel, as his was. The angel, in the 
 message he delivers, 

 1. Takes notice of her affliction: <I>Behold now, thou art barren and
 bearest not.</I> Hence she might gather he was a prophet, that though a 
 stranger to her, and one she had never seen before, yet he knew this to 
 be her grievance. He tells her of it, not to upbraid her with it, but 
 because perhaps at this time she was actually thinking of this 
 affliction and bemoaning herself as one written childless. God often 
 sends in comfort to his people very seasonably, when they feel most 
 from their troubles.  "<I>Now</I> thou art barren, but thou shalt not 
 be always so," as she feared, "nor long so."

 2. He assures her that she should <I>conceive and bear a son</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 and repeats the assurance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 To show the power of a divine word, the strongest man that ever was was 
 a child of promise, as Isaac, born by force and virtue of a promise, 
 and faith in that promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:11,Ga+4:23">Heb. xi. 11; Gal. iv. 23</A>.

 Many a woman, after having been long barren, has borne a son by
 providence, but Samson was by promise, because a figure of the promised 
 seed, so long expected by the faith of the Old-Testament saints,

 3. He appoints that the child should be a Nazarite from his birth, and
 therefore that the mother should be subject to the law of the Nazarites 
 (though not under the vow of a Nazarite) and should <I>drink no wine or 
 strong drink</I> so long as this child was to have its nourishment from 
 her, either in the womb or at the breast,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 Observe, This deliverer of Israel must be in the strictest manner 
 devoted to God and an example of holiness. It is spoken of as a 
 kindness to the people that God raised up of their young men for 
 Nazarites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:11">Amos ii. 11</A>.

 Other judges had corrected their apostasies from God, but Samson must
 appear as one, more than any of them, consecrated to God; and, 
 notwithstanding what we read of his faults, we have reason to think 
 that being a Nazarite of God's making he did, in the course of his 
 conversation, exemplify, not only the ceremony, but the substance of 
 that <I>separation to the Lord</I> in which the Nazariteship did 
 consist, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:2">Num. vi. 2</A>.

 Those that would save others must by singular piety distinguish
 themselves. Samuel, who carried on Israel's deliverance from the 
 Philistines, was a Nazarite by his mother's vow

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:11">1 Sam. i. 11</A>),

 as Samson by the divine appointment. The mother of this deliverer must
 therefore deny herself, and not eat any unclean thing; what was lawful 
 at another time was now to be forborne.  As the promise tried her 
 faith, so this precept tried her obedience; for God requires both from 
 those on whom he will bestow his favours.  Women with child ought 
 conscientiously to avoid whatever they have reason to think will be any 
 way prejudicial to the health or good constitution of the fruit of 
 their body. And perhaps Samson's mother was to refrain from wine and 
 strong drink, not only because he was designed for a Nazarite, but 
 because he was designed for a man of great strength, which his mother's 
 temperance would contribute to. 

 4. He foretels the service which this child should do to his country:
 <I>He shall begin to deliver Israel.</I> Note, It is very desirable 
 that our children may be not only devoted entirely to God themselves, 
 but instrumental for the good of others, and the service of their 
 generation--not recluses, candles <I>under a bushel,</I> but <I>on a 
 candlestick.</I> Observe, <I>He shall begin</I> to deliver Israel.  
 This intimated that the oppression of the Philistines should last long, 
 for Israel's deliverance from it should not so much as begin, not one 
 step be taken towards it, till this child, who was now unborn, should 
 have grown up to a capacity of beginning it.  And yet he must not 
 complete the deliverance: he shall only <I>begin</I> to deliver Israel, 
 which intimates that the trouble should still be prolonged. God chooses 
 to carry on his work gradually and by several hands. One lays the 
 foundation of a good work, another builds, and perhaps a third brings 
 forth the top stone. Now herein Samson was a type of Christ,

 (1.) As a Nazarite to God, a Nazarite from the womb. For, though our 
 Lord Jesus was not a Nazarite himself, yet he was typified by the 
 Nazarites, as being perfectly pure from all sin, not so much as 
 conceived in it, and entirely devoted to his Father's honour. Of the 
 Jewish church, <I>as concerning the flesh, Christ came,</I> because to 
 them pertained the promise of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4,5">Rom. ix. 4, 5</A>.

 By virtue of that promise, he long lay as it were in the womb of that
 church, which for many ages was pregnant of him, and therefore, like 
 Samson's mother, during that pregnancy was made a holy nation and a 
 peculiar people, and strictly forbidden to <I>touch any unclean thing 
 for his sake,</I> who in the fulness of time was to come from them.

 (2.) As a deliverer of Israel; for he is Jesus a Saviour, who saves his 
 people from their sins. But with this difference: Samson did only begin 
 to deliver Israel (David was afterwards raised up to complete the 
 destruction of the Philistines), but our Lord Jesus is both Samson and 
 David too, both the <I>author and finisher of our faith.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The report which Manoah's wife, in a transport of joy, brings in 
 all haste to her husband, of this surprising message 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 The glad tidings were brought her when she was alone, perhaps 
 religiously employed in meditation or prayer; but she could not, she 
 would not, conceal them from her husband, but gives him an account, 

 1.  Of the messenger. It was a man of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 His countenance she could describe; it was very awful: he had such a 
 majesty in his looks, such a sparkling eye, such a shining face, so 
 powerfully commanding reverence and respect, that according to the idea 
 she had of an angel he had the very countenance of one. But his name 
 she can give no account of, nor to what tribe or city of Israel he 
 belonged, for he did not think fit to tell her, and, for her part, the 
 very sight of him struck such an awe upon her that she durst not ask 
 him. She was abundantly satisfied that he was a servant of God; his 
 person and message she thought carried their own evidence along with 
 them, and she enquired no further. 

 2. Of the message. She gives him a particular account both of the
 promise and of the precept

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 that he also might believe the promise and might on all occasions be a 
 monitor to her to observe the precept. Thus should yoke-fellows 
 communicate to each other their experiences of communion with God, and 
 their improvements in acquaintance with him, that they may be helpful 
 to each other in <I>the way that is called holy.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 Then Manoah intreated the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and said, O my Lord, let the
 man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us
 what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.
 &nbsp; 9 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of
 God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah
 her husband <I>was</I> not with her.
 &nbsp; 10 And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband,
 and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that
 came unto me the <I>other</I> day.
 &nbsp; 11 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the
 man, and said unto him, <I>Art</I> thou the man that spakest unto the
 woman? And he said, I <I>am.</I>
 &nbsp; 12 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall
 we order the child, and <I>how</I> shall we do unto him?
 &nbsp; 13 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Manoah, Of all that I
 said unto the woman let her beware.
 &nbsp; 14 She may not eat of any <I>thing</I> that cometh of the vine,
 neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean
 <I>thing:</I> all that I commanded her let her observe.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of a second visit which the angel of God made 
 to Manoah and his wife.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Manoah earnestly prayed for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He was not incredulous of the story his wife told him; he knew she was 
 a virtuous woman, and therefore the <I>heart of her husband did safely 
 trust in her;</I> he knew she would not go about to impose upon him, 
 much less was he, as Josephus unworthily represents him, jealous of his 
 wife's conversation with this stranger; but, 

 1. He takes it for granted that this child of promise shall in due time
 be given them, and speaks without hesitation of <I>the child that shall 
 be born.</I> There was <I>not found so great faith,</I> no, not in 
 Zechariah, a priest, then in waiting at the altar of the Lord, and to 
 whom the angel himself appeared, as was in this honest Danite. Things 
 hidden from the wise and prudent, who value themselves upon the 
 niceness of their enquiries, are often revealed unto babes, who know 
 how to prize God's gifts and to take God's word.  <I>Blessed are those 
 that have not seen and yet,</I> as Manoah here, <I>have believed.</I> 
 
 2. All his care is <I>what they should do to the child</I> that should
 be born. Note, Good men are more solicitous and desirous to know the 
 duty that is to be done by them than to know the events that shall 
 occur concerning them; for duty is ours, events are God's. Solomon 
 enquires concerning the good men should <I>do,</I> not the good they 
 should <I>have,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:3">Eccl. ii. 3</A>.

 3. He therefore prays to God to send the same blessed messenger again,
 to give them further instructions concerning the management of this 
 Nazarite, fearing lest his wife's joy for the promise might have made 
 her forget some part of the precept, in which he was desirous to be 
 fully informed, and lie under no mistake: "<I>Lord, let the man of God 
 come again unto us,</I> for we desire to be better acquainted with 
 him." Note, Those that have heard from heaven cannot but wish to hear 
 more thence, again and again to meet with the man of God. Observe, He 
 does not go or send his servants abroad, to find out this man of God, 
 but seeks him upon his knees, prays to God to send him, and, thus 
 seeking, finds him. Would we have God's messengers, the ministers of 
 his gospel, to bring a word proper for us, and for our instruction?  
 <I>Entreat the Lord</I> to send them to us, to teach us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:30,32">Rom. xv. 30, 32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God graciously granted it: <I>God hearkened to the voice of 
 Manoah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Note, God will not fail some way or other to guide those by his counsel 
 that are sincerely desirous to know their duty, and apply themselves to 
 him to teach them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:8,9">Ps. xxv. 8, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The angel appears the second time also to the wife, when she is 
 sitting alone, probably tending the flocks, or otherwise well employed 
 in the field where she has retired. Solitude is often a good 
 opportunity of communion with God; good people have thought themselves 
 never less alone than when alone, if God be with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She goes in all haste to call her husband, doubtless humbly 
 beseeching the stay of this blessed messenger till she should return 
 and her husband with her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 She did not desire him to go with her to her husband, but would fetch 
 her husband to him. Those that would meet with God must attend where he 
 is pleased to manifest himself. "Oh," says she, overjoyed, "my dear 
 love, thy prayers are answered--yonder is the man of God, come to make 
 us another visit--he that came the other day," or, as some read it, 
 <I>this</I> day, for <I>other</I> is not in the original, and it is 
 probable enough that both these visits were on the same day, and at the 
 same place, and that the second time she sat expecting him. The man of 
 God is very willing she should call her husband,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:16">John iv. 16</A>.

 Those that have an acquaintance with the things of God themselves
 should invite others to the same acquaintance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:45,46">John i. 45, 46</A>.

 Manoah is not disgusted that the angel did not this second time appear
 to him, but very willingly goes after his wife to the man of God. To 
 atone (as it were) for the first fatal miscarriage, when Eve earnestly 
 pressed Adam to that which was evil, and he too easily yielded to her, 
 let yoke-fellows excite one another to love and good works; and, if the 
 wife will lead, let not the husband think it any disparagement to him 
 to follow her in that which is virtuous and praiseworthy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Manoah having come to the angel, and being satisfied by him that he 
 was the same that had appeared to his wife, does, with all humility, 
 
 (1.) Welcome the promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Now let thy words come to pass;</I> this was the language, not only 
 of his desire, but of his faith, like that of the blessed Virgin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:38">Luke i. 38</A>.

 "<I>Be it according to thy word.</I> Lord, I lay hold on what thou hast
 said, and depend upon it; <I>let it come to pass.</I>" 

 (2.) Beg that the prescriptions given might be repeated: <I>How shall 
 we order the child?</I> The directions were given to his wife, but he 
 looks upon himself as concerned to assist her in the careful management 
 of this promised seed, according to order; for the utmost care of both 
 the parents, and their constant joint endeavour, are little enough to 
 be engaged for the good ordering of children that are devoted to God 
 and to be brought up for him. Let not one devolve it on the other, but 
 both do their best.  Observe from Manoah's enquiry, 

 [1.] In general, that, when God is pleased to bestow any mercy upon us,
 our great care must be how to use it well, and as we ought, because it 
 is then only a mercy indeed when it is rightly managed. God has given 
 us bodies, souls, estates; how shall we order them, that we may answer 
 the intent of the donor, and give a good account of them? 

 [2.] In particular, those to whom God has given children must be very
 careful how they order them, and what they do unto them, that they may 
 drive out the foolishness that is <I>bound up in their hearts,</I> form 
 their minds and manners well betimes, and <I>train them in the way 
 wherein they should go.</I> Herein pious parents will beg divine 
 assistance.  "Lord, teach us how we may order our children, that they 
 may be Nazarites, and living sacrifices to thee."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The angel repeats the directions he had before given 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>):
 
 <I>Of all</I> that I forbad <I>let her beware;</I> and <I>all that I 
 commanded her let her observe.</I> Note, There is need of a good deal 
 both of caution and observation, for the right ordering both of 
 ourselves and of our children. Beware and observe; take heed not only 
 of drinking <I>wine</I> or <I>strong drink,</I> but of <I>eating any 
 thing that cometh of the vine.</I> Those that would preserve themselves 
 pure must keep at a distance from that which borders upon sin or leads 
 to it. When she was with child of a Nazarite, she must not eat <I>any 
 unclean thing;</I> so those <I>in whom Christ is formed</I> must 
 carefully <I>cleanse themselves from all filthiness of flesh and 
 spirit,</I> and do nothing to the prejudice of that new man.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And Manoah said unto the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I pray thee, let
 us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.
 &nbsp; 16 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Manoah, Though thou
 detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a
 burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. For Manoah knew
 not that he <I>was</I> an angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 17 And Manoah said unto the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, What <I>is</I> thy
 name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?
 &nbsp; 18 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto him, Why askest thou
 thus after my name, seeing it <I>is</I> secret?
 &nbsp; 19 So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered <I>it</I>
 upon a rock unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and <I>the angel</I> did wondrously; and
 Manoah and his wife looked on.
 &nbsp; 20 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven
 from off the altar, that the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> ascended in the
 flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on <I>it,</I> and
 fell on their faces to the ground.
 &nbsp; 21 But the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> did no more appear to Manoah and
 to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he <I>was</I> an angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 22 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because
 we have seen God.
 &nbsp; 23 But his wife said unto him, If the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> were pleased to kill
 us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat
 offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these
 <I>things,</I> nor would as at this time have told us <I>such things</I> as
 these.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of what further passed between Manoah and the angel at this 
 interview. It was in kindness to him that while the angel was with him 
 it was concealed from him that he was an angel; for, had he known it, 
 it would have been such a terror to him that he durst not have 
 conversed with him as he did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>He knew not that he was an angel.</I> So Christ <I>was in the world, 
 and the world knew him not.  Verily thou art a God that hidest 
 thyself.</I> We could not bear the sight of the divine glory unveiled. 
 God having determined to speak to us by men like ourselves, prophets 
 and ministers, even when he spoke by his angels, or by his Son, they 
 appeared in the likeness of men, and were taken but for men of God.  
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The angel declined to accept his treat, and appointed him to turn it 
 into a sacrifice. Manoah, being desirous to show some token of respect 
 and gratitude to this venerable stranger who had brought them these 
 glad tidings, begged he would take some refreshment with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 We will soon <I>make ready a kid for thee.</I> Those that welcome the 
 message will be kind to the messengers for his sake that sends them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:13">1 Thess. v. 13</A>.

 But the angel told him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 he would <I>not eat of his bread,</I> any more than he would of 
 Gideon's, but, as there, directed him to offer it to God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:20,21"><I>ch.</I> vi. 20, 21</A>.

 Angels need not meat nor drink; but the glorifying of God is their meat
 and drink, and it was Christ's, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:34">John iv. 34</A>.

 And we in some measure do the will of God as they do it if, though we
 cannot live without meat and drink, yet we eat and drink to the glory 
 of God, and so turn even our common meals into sacrifices.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The angel declined telling him his name, and would not so far 
 gratify his curiosity. Manoah desired to know his name 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 and of what tribe he was, not as if he doubted the truth of his 
 message, but that they might return his visit, and be better acquainted 
 with him (it is good to increase and improve our acquaintance with good 
 men and good ministers); and he has a further design: "<I>That when thy 
 sayings come to pass, we may do thee honour,</I> celebrate thee as a 
 true prophet, and recommend others to thee for divine 
 instructions,--that we may call the child that shall be born after thy 
 name, and so do thee honour,--or that we may send thee a present, 
 honouring one whom God has honoured." But the angel denies his request 
 with something of a check to his curiosity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Why askest thou thus after my name?</I> Jacob himself could not 
 prevail for this favour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:29">Gen. xxxii. 29</A>.

 Note, We have not what we ask when we ask we know not what. Manoah's
 request was honestly meant and yet was denied. God told Moses his name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:13,14">Exod. iii. 13, 14</A>),

 because there was a particular occasion for his knowing it, but here
 there was no occasion. What Manoah asked for instruction in his duty he 
 was readily told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>),

 but what he asked to gratify his curiosity was denied. God has in his 
 word given us full directions concerning our duty, but never designed 
 to answer all the enquiries of a speculative head. He gives him a 
 reason for his refusal: <I>It is secret.</I> The names of angels were 
 not as yet revealed, to prevent the idolizing of them. After the 
 captivity, when the church was cured of idolatry, angels made 
 themselves known to Daniel by their names, Michael and Gabriel; and to 
 Zacharias the angel told his name unasked

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:19">Luke i. 19</A>):

 <I>I am Gabriel.</I> But here it is <I>secret,</I> or it is
 <I>wonderful,</I> too wonderful for us. One of Christ's names is 
 <I>Wonderful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:6">Isa. ix. 6</A>.

 His name was long a secret, but by the gospel it is brought to light:
 <I>Jesus a Saviour.</I> Manoah must not ask because he must not know. 
 Note,

 (1.) There are secret things which belong not to us, and which we must 
 content ourselves to be in the dark about while we are here in this 
 world. 

 (2.) We must therefore never indulge a vain curiosity in our enquiries 
 concerning these things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:18">Col. ii. 18</A>.

 <I>Nescire velle quae Magister maximus docere non vult erudita inscitia
 est--To be willingly ignorant of those things which our great Master 
 refuses to teach us is to be at once ignorant and wise.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The angel assisted and owned their sacrifice, and, at parting, gave 
 them to understand who he was. He had directed them to offer their 
 burnt-offering to the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Praises offered up to God are the most acceptable entertainment of the 
 angels; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:9">Rev. xxii. 9</A>,

 <I>worship God.</I> And Manoah, having so good a warrant, though he was 
 no priest and had no altar, turned his meat into a meat offering, and 
 <I>offered it upon a rock to the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 that is, he brought and laid it to be offered.  "Lord, here it is, do 
 what thou pleasest with it." Thus we must bring our hearts to God as 
 living sacrifices, and submit them to the operation of his Spirit. All 
 things being now ready, 

 (1.) <I>The angel did wondrously,</I> for his name was 
 <I>Wonderful.</I> Probably the wonder he did was the same with what he 
 had done for Gideon, he made fire to come either down from heaven or up 
 out of the rock to consume the sacrifice. 

 (2.) He ascended up towards heaven <I>in the flame of the 
 sacrifice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 By this it appeared that he was not, as they thought, a mere man, but a 
 messenger immediately from heaven. Thence certainly he descended, for 
 thither he ascended,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:13,6:62">John iii. 13; vi. 62</A>.

 This signified God's acceptance of the offering and intimates to what
 we owe the acceptance of all our offerings, even to the mediation of 
 the angel of the covenant, that other angel, who puts <I>much incense 
 to the prayers of saints</I> and <I>so offers them before the 
 throne,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:3">Rev. viii. 3</A>.

 Prayer is the ascent of the soul to God.  But it is Christ in the heart 
 by faith that makes it an offering of a sweet-smelling savour: without 
 him our services are offensive smoke, but, in him, acceptable flame. We 
 may apply it to Christ's sacrifice of himself for us; he ascended in 
 the flame of his own offering, for <I>by his own blood he entered in 
 once into the holy place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:12">Heb. ix. 12</A>.

 While the angel did this, it is twice said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:19,20"><I>v.</I>  19, 20</A>)

 <I>that Manoah and his wife looked on.</I> This is a proof of the 
 miracle: the matter of fact was true, for out of the mouth of these two 
 eye-witnesses the report of it is established. The angel did all that 
 was done in the sacrifice; they did but look on; yet doubtless, when 
 the angel ascended towards heaven, their hearts ascended with him in 
 thanksgiving for the promise which came thence and in expectation of 
 the performance to come thence too. Yet, when the angel has ascended, 
 they dared not, as those that were the witnesses of Christ's ascension, 
 stand gazing up into heaven, but in holy fear and reverence they fell 
 on their faces to the ground. And now, 

 [1.] They <I>knew that it was an angel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 It was plain it was not the body of a man they saw, since it was not 
 chained to the earth, nor prejudiced by fire; but ascended, and 
 ascended in flame, and therefore with good reason they conclude it was 
 an angel; for he <I>maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a 
 flame of fire.</I> 

 [2.] But he did not any more appear to them; it was for a particular
 occasion, now over, that he was sent, not to settle a constant 
 correspondence, as with prophets. They must remember and observe what 
 the angel had said and not expect to hear more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have an account of the impressions which this vision made upon 
 Manoah and his wife. While the angel did wondrously, they looked on, 
 and said nothing (so it becomes us carefully to observe the wondrous 
 works of God, and to be silent before him); but when he had gone, 
 having finished his work, they had time to make their reflections. 

 1.  In Manoah's reflection upon it there is <I>great fear,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 He had spoken with great assurance of the son they should shortly be 
 the joyful parents of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:8,12"><I>v.</I>  8, 12</A>),

 and yet is now put into such a confusion by that very thing which 
 should have strengthened and encouraged his faith that he counts upon 
 nothing but their being both cut off immediately: <I>We shall surely 
 die.</I> It was a vulgar opinion generally received among the ancient 
 Jews that it was present death to see God or an angel; and this notion 
 quite overcome his faith for the present, as it did Gideon's,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:22"><I>ch.</I> vi. 22</A>.

 2. In his wife's reflection upon it there is great faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Here the weaker vessel was the stronger believer, which perhaps was the 
 reason why the angel chose once and again to appear to her. Manoah's 
 heart began to fail him, but his wife, as a help meet for him, 
 encouraged him. Two are better than one, for, if one fall into 
 dejections and despondencies, the other will help to raise him up.  
 Yoke-fellows should piously assist each other's faith and joy as there 
 is occasion. None could argue better than Manoah's wife does here: 
 <I>We shall surely die,</I> said her husband; "Nay," said she, "we need 
 not fear that; let us never turn that against us which is really for 
 us. We shall not die unless God be pleased to kill us: our death must 
 come from his hand and his pleasure. Now the tokens of his favour which 
 we have received forbid us to think that he designs our destruction.  
 Had he thought fit to kill us,

 (1.) He would not have accepted our sacrifice, and signified to us his 
 acceptance of it by <I>turning it to ashes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:3">Ps. xx. 3</A>,

 <I>margin.</I> The sacrifice was the ransom of our lives, and the fire 
 fastening upon that was a plain indication of the turning away of his 
 wrath from us. The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination, but you 
 see ours is not so. 

 (2.) He would not have shown us all these things, these strange sights, 
 now at a time when there is little or no open vision

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:1">1 Sam. iii. 1</A>),

 nor would he have given these exceedingly great and precious promises
 of a son that shall be a Nazarite and a deliverer of Israel--he would 
 not have told us such things as these if he had been pleased to kill 
 us. We need not fear the withering of those roots out of which such a 
 branch is yet to spring." Note, Hereby it appears that God designs not 
 the death of sinners that he has accepted the great sacrifice which 
 Christ offered up for their salvation, has put them in a way of 
 obtaining his favour, and has assured them of it upon their repentance. 
 Had he been pleased to kill them, he would not have done so. And let 
 those good Christians who have had communion with God in the word and 
 prayer, to whom he has graciously manifested himself, and who have had 
 reason to think God has accepted their works, take encouragement thence 
 in a cloudy and dark day. "God would not have done what he has done for 
 my soul if he had designed to forsake me, and leave me to perish at 
 last; for his work is perfect, nor will he mock his people with his 
 favours." Learn to reason as Manoah's wife did, "If God had designed me 
 to perish under his wrath, he would not have given me such
 distinguishing tokens of his favour." <I>O woman! great is thy
 faith.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and
 the child grew, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> blessed him.
 &nbsp; 25 And the Spirit of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> began to move him at times in the
 camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. Samson's birth. The woman that had been long barren bore a son,
 according to the promise; for no word of God shall fall to the ground. 
 Hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? 

 2. His name, <I>Samson,</I> has been derived by some, from <I>Shemesh,
 the sun,</I> turned into a diminutive, <I>sol exiguus</I>--<I>the sun 
 in miniature,</I> perhaps because, being born like Moses to be a 
 deliverer, he was like him exceedingly fair, his face shone like a 
 little sun; or his parents so named him in remembrance of the shining 
 countenance of that man of God who brought them the notice of him; 
 though they knew not his name, yet thus, now that his sayings had come 
 to pass, they did him honour. A little sun, because a Nazarite born 
 (for the Nazarites were as <I>rubies</I> and <I>sapphires,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:7">Lam. iv. 7</A>,

 and because of his great strength. The sun is compared to a <I>strong 
 man</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:5">Ps. xix. 5</A>);

 why should not a strong man then be compared to the sun when he goes
 forth in his strength? A little sun, because the glory of, and a light 
 to, his people Israel, a type of Christ, the Sun of righteousness. 

 3.  His childhood. He grew more than is usual in strength and stature,
 far out-grew other children of his age; and not in that only, but in 
 other instances, it appeared that the Lord blessed him, qualified him, 
 both in body and mind, for something great and extraordinary. Children 
 of promise shall have the blessing.  

 4. His youth. When he grew up a little <I>the Spirit of the Lord began
 to move him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 This was an evidence that the Lord blessed him. Where God gives his 
 blessing he gives his Spirit to qualify for the blessing.  Those are 
 blessed indeed in whom the Spirit of grace begins to work betimes, in 
 the days of their childhood. If the <I>Spirit be poured out upon our 
 offspring,</I> they will spring up as <I>willows by the water 
 courses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:3,4">Isa. xliv. 3, 4</A>.

 The Spirit of God moved Samson in the camp of Dan, that is, in the
 general muster of the trained bands of that tribe, who probably had 
 formed a camp between Zorah and Eshtaol, near the place where he lived, 
 to oppose the incursions of the Philistines; there Samson, when a 
 child, appeared among them, and signalized himself by some very brave 
 actions, excelling them all in manly exercises and trials of strength: 
 and probably he showed himself more than ordinarily zealous against the 
 enemies of his country, and discovered more of a public spirit than 
 could be expected in a child. The Spirit moved him <I>at times,</I> not 
 at all times, but as the wind blows, when he listed, to show that what 
 he did was not from himself, for then he could have done it at any 
 time. Strong men think themselves greatly animated by wine

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:65">Ps. lxxviii. 65</A>),

 but Samson drank no wine, and yet excelled in strength and courage, and 
 every thing that was bold and brave, for he had the Spirit of God 
 moving him; therefore <I>be not drunk with wine, but be filled with the 
 Spirit,</I> who will come to those that are sober and temperate.</P>
