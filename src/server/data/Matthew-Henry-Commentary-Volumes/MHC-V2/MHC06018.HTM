 1 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel
 assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the
 congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the midst of the story of the dividing of the land comes in this 
 account of the setting up of the tabernacle, which had hitherto 
 continued in its old place in the centre of their camp; but now that 
 three of the four squadrons that used to surround it in the wilderness 
 were broken and diminished, those of Judah, Ephraim, and Reuben, by the 
 removal of those tribes to their respective possessions, and that of 
 Dan only remained entire, it was time to think of removing the
 tabernacle itself into a city.  Many a time the priests and Levites had
 taken it down, carried it, and set it up again in the wilderness,
 according to the directions given them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:5-33">Num. iv. 5</A>,

 &c.); but now they
 must do it for good and all, not one of the stakes thereof must any 
 more be removed, nor any of the cords thereof broken, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:20">Isa. xxxiii. 20</A>.

 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The place to which the tabernacle was removed, and in which it was 
 set up. It was <I>Shiloh,</I> a city in the lot of Ephraim, but lying 
 close upon the lot of Benjamin. Doubtless God himself did some way or 
 other direct them to this place, for he had promised to <I>choose the 
 place</I> where he would make <I>his name to dwell,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:11">Deut. xii. 11</A>.

 It is most probable God made known his mind in this matter by the
 judgment of Urim. This place was pitched upon, 

 1. Because it was in the heart of the country, nearer the centre than 
 Jerusalem was, and therefore the more convenient for the meeting of all 
 Israel there from the several parts of the country; it had been in the 
 midst of their camp in the wilderness, and therefore must now be in the 
 midst of their nation, as that which sanctified the whole, and was 
 <I>the glory in the midst of them.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:5">Ps. xlvi. 5</A>.

 2. Because it was in the lot of that tribe of which Joshua was, who was 
 now their chief magistrate, and it would be both for his honour and 
 convenience and for the advantage of the country to have it near him. 
 The testimony of Israel and the thrones of judgment do well together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:4,5">Ps. cxxii. 4, 5</A>.

 3. Some think there was an eye to the name of the place, <I>Shiloh</I>
 being the name by which the Messiah was known in dying Jacob's prophecy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>),

 which prophecy, no doubt, was well known among the Jews; the setting up
 of the tabernacle in Shiloh gave them a hint that in that Shiloh whom 
 Jacob spoke of all the ordinances of this worldly sanctuary should have 
 their accomplishment in a greater and more perfect tabernacle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:1,11">Heb. ix. 1, 11</A>.

 And Dr. Lightfoot thinks that the place where the tabernacle was set up
 was therefore called <I>Shiloh,</I> because of the peaceableness of the 
 land at this time; as afterwards in Salem was his temple, which also 
 signifies <I>peaceable.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The solemn manner of doing it: <I>The whole congregation assembled 
 together</I> to attend the solemnity, to do honour to the ark of God, 
 as the token of his presence, and to bid it welcome to its settlement. 
 Every Israelite was interested in it, and therefore all testified their 
 joy and satisfaction upon this occasion. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:15">2 Sam. vi. 15</A>.

 It is probable those tribes that were yet encamped when the tabernacle
 was removed to Shiloh decamped from Gilgal and pitched about Shiloh, 
 for every true Israelite will desire to fix where God's tabernacle 
 fixed. Mention is made, on this occasion, of the land being subdued 
 before them, to intimate that the country, hereabouts at least, being 
 thoroughly reduced, they met with no opposition, nor were they 
 apprehensive of any danger, but thought it time to make this grateful 
 acknowledgment of God's goodness to them in the constant series of 
 successes with which he had blessed them. It was a good presage of a 
 comfortable settlement to themselves in Canaan, when their first care 
 was to see the ark well settled as soon as they had a safe place ready 
 to settle it in. Here the ark continued about 300 years, till the sins 
 of Eli's house forfeited the ark, lost it and ruined Shiloh, and its 
 ruins were long after made use of as warnings to Jerusalem. <I>Go, see 
 what I did to Shiloh,</I>

 &nbsp; 2 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
 which had not yet received their inheritance.
 &nbsp; 3 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long <I>are</I>
 ye slack to go to possess the land, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of your
 fathers hath given you?
 &nbsp; 4 Give out from among you three men for <I>each</I> tribe: and I
 will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and
 describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall
 come <I>again</I> to me.
 &nbsp; 5 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide
 in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide
 in their coasts on the north.
 &nbsp; 6 Ye shall therefore describe the land <I>into</I> seven parts, and
 bring <I>the description</I> hither to me, that I may cast lots for
 you here before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God.
 &nbsp; 7 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half
 the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond
 Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> gave
 them.
 &nbsp; 8 And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them
 that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the
 land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast
 lots for you before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in Shiloh.
 &nbsp; 9 And the men went and passed through the land, and described
 it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came <I>again</I> to
 Joshua to the host at Shiloh.
 &nbsp; 10 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and
 there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel
 according to their divisions.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Joshua reproves those tribes which were yet unsettled that they did 
 not bestir themselves to gain a settlement in the land which God had 
 given them. Seven tribes were yet unprovided for, though sure of an 
 inheritance, yet uncertain where it should be, and it seems in no great 
 care about it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 And with them Joshua reasons

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>How long are you slack?</I> 

 1. They were too well pleased with their present condition, liked well 
 enough to live in a body together, the more the merrier, and, like the 
 Babel-builders, had no mind to be scattered abroad and break good 
 company. The spoil of the cities they had taken served them to live 
 plentifully upon for the present, and they banished the thoughts of 
 time to come. Perhaps the tribes of Judah and Joseph, who had already 
 received their inheritance in the countries next adjoining, were 
 generous in entertaining their brethren who were yet unprovided for, so 
 that they went from one good house to another among their friends, with 
 which, instead of grudging that they were postponed, they were so well 
 pleased that they cared not for going to houses of their own.

 2. They were slothful and dilatory.  It may be they wished the thing 
 done, but had not spirit to stir in it, or move towards the doing of 
 it, though it was so much for their own advantage; like the sluggard, 
 that <I>hides his hand in his bosom, and it grieves him to bring it to 
 his mouth again.</I> The countries that remained to be divided lay at a 
 distance, and some parts of them in the hands of the Canaanites. If 
 they go to take possession of them, the cities must be rebuilt or 
 repaired, they must drive their flocks and herds a great way, and carry 
 their wives and children to strange places, and this will not be done 
 without care and pains, and breaking through some hardships; thus <I>he 
 that observes the wind shall not sow, and he that regards the clouds 
 shall not reap,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:4">Eccl. xi. 4</A>.

 Note, Many are diverted from real duties, and debarred from real
 comforts, by seeming difficulties. God by his grace has given us a 
 title to a good land, the heavenly Canaan, but we are <I>slack to take 
 possession;</I> we enter not into that rest, as we might by faith, and 
 hope, and holy joy; we live not in heaven, as we might by setting our 
 affections on things above and having our conversation there. How long 
 shall it be thus with us? How long shall we thus stand in our own 
 light, and <I>forsake our own mercies</I> for lying vanities? Joshua 
 was sensible of the inconveniences of this delay, that, while they 
 neglected to take possession of the land that was conquered, the 
 Canaanites were recovering strength and spirit, and fortifying 
 themselves in the places that were yet in their hands, which would make 
 the total expulsion of them the more difficult. They would lose their 
 advantages by not following their blow; and therefore, <I>as an eagle 
 stirreth up her nest,</I> so Joshua stirs them up to take possession of 
 their lot. He is ready to do his part, if they will but do theirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He puts them in a way to settle themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The land that remained must be surveyed, an account taken of the 
 cities, and the territories belonging to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 These must be divided into seven equal parts, as near as they could 
 guess at their true value, which they must have an eye to, and not 
 merely to the number of the cities and extent of the country. Judah is 
 fixed on the south and Joseph on the north of Shiloh, to protect the 
 tabernacle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and therefore they need not describe their country, but those countries 
 only that were yet undisposed of. He gives a reason 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 why they must divide it into seven parts only, because the Levites were 
 to have no temporal estate (as we say), but their benefices only, which 
 were entailed upon their families: <I>The priesthood of the Lord is 
 their inheritance,</I> and a very honourable, comfortable, plentiful 
 inheritance it was. Gad and Reuben, with half of the tribe of Manasseh, 
 were already fixed, and needed not to have any further care taken of 
 them. Now, 

 (1.) The surveyors were three men out of each of the seven tribes that 
 were to be provided for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 one-and-twenty in all, who perhaps for greater expedition, because they 
 had already lost time, divided themselves into three companies, one of 
 each tribe in each company, and took each their district to survey. The 
 matter was thus referred equally, that there might be neither any 
 partiality used in making up the seven lots, nor any shadow of 
 suspicion given, but all might be satisfied that they had right done 
 them. 
 
 (2.) The survey was accordingly made, and brought in to Joshua,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 Josephus says it was seven months in the doing. And we must in it 
 observe, 

 [1.] The faith and courage of the persons employed: abundance of
 Canaanites remained in the land, and all raging against Israel, <I>as a 
 bear robbed of her whelps;</I> the business of these surveyors would 
 soon be known, and what could they expect but to be way-laid, and have 
 their brains knocked out by the fierce observers?  But in obedience to 
 Joshua's command, and in dependence upon God's power, they thus put 
 their lives in their hands to serve their country.

 [2.] The good providence of God in protecting them from the many deaths
 they were exposed to, and bringing them all safely again to the host at 
 Shiloh.  When we are in the way of our duty we are under the special 
 protection of the Almighty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When it was surveyed, and reduced to seven lots, then Joshua would, 
 by appeal to God, and direction from him, determine which of these lots 
 should belong to each tribe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>That I may cast lots for you here</I> at the tabernacle (because it 
 was a sacred transaction) <I>before the Lord our God,</I> to whom each 
 tribe must have an eye, with thankfulness for the conveniences and 
 submission to the inconveniences of their allotment. What we have in 
 the world we must acknowledge God's property in, and dispose of it as 
 before him, with justice, and charity, and dependence upon Providence. 
 The heavenly Canaan is described to us in a book, the book of the 
 scriptures, and there are in it mansions and portions sufficient for 
 all God's spiritual Israel.  Christ is our Joshua that divides it to 
 us. On him we must attend, and to him we must apply for an inheritance 
 with the saints in light. See

 &nbsp; 11 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
 according to their families: and the coast of their lot came
 forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.
 &nbsp; 12 And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the
 border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went
 up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof
 were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.
 &nbsp; 13 And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side
 of Luz, which <I>is</I> Beth-el, southward; and the border descended to
 Ataroth-adar, near the hill that <I>lieth</I> on the south side of the
 nether Beth-horon.
 &nbsp; 14 And the border was drawn <I>thence,</I> and compassed the corner
 of the sea southward, from the hill that <I>lieth</I> before Beth-horon
 southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath-baal, which
 <I>is</I> Kirjath-jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this <I>was</I>
 the west quarter.
 &nbsp; 15 And the south quarter <I>was</I> from the end of Kirjath-jearim,
 and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of
 waters of Nephtoah:
 &nbsp; 16 And the border came down to the end of the mountain that
 <I>lieth</I> before the valley of the son of Hinnom, <I>and</I> which <I>is</I>
 in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the
 valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and
 descended to En-rogel,
 &nbsp; 17 And was drawn from the north, and went forth to En-shemesh,
 and went forth toward Geliloth, which <I>is</I> over against the going
 up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of
 Reuben,
 &nbsp; 18 And passed along toward the side over against Arabah
 northward, and went down unto Arabah:
 &nbsp; 19 And the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah
 northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay
 of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this <I>was</I> the south
 coast.
 &nbsp; 20 And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This <I>was</I>
 the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts
 thereof round about, according to their families.
 &nbsp; 21 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
 according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and the
 valley of Keziz,
 &nbsp; 22 And Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el,
 &nbsp; 23 And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah,
 &nbsp; 24 And Chephar-haammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities
 with their villages:
 &nbsp; 25 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,
 &nbsp; 26 And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,
 &nbsp; 27 And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,
 &nbsp; 28 And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which <I>is</I> Jerusalem, Gibeath,
 <I>and</I> Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This <I>is</I> the
 inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their
 families.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the lot of the tribe of Benjamin, which Providence cast 
 next to Joseph on the one hand, because Benjamin was own and only 
 brother to Joseph, and was little Benjamin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:27">Ps. lxviii. 27</A>),

 that needed the protection of great Joseph, and yet had a better
 protector, for <I>the Lord shall cover him all the day long,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:12">Deut. xxxiii. 12</A>.

 And it was next to Judah on the other hand, that this tribe might
 hereafter unite with Judah in an adherence to the throne of David and 
 the temple at Jerusalem. Here we have, 

 1. The exact borders and limits of this tribe, which we need not be 
 exact in the explication of. As it had Judah on the south and Joseph on 
 the north, so it had Jordan on the east and Dan on the west. The 
 western border is said to <I>compass the corner of the sea 
 southward</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 whereas no part of the lot of this tribe came near to the great sea. 
 Bishop Patrick thinks the meaning is that it ran along in a parallel 
 line to the great sea, though at a distance.  Dr. Fuller suggests that 
 since it is not called <I>the great sea,</I> but only <I>the sea,</I> 
 which often signifies any lake or mere, it may be meant of the pool of 
 Gibeon, which may be called <I>a corner</I> or <I>canton</I> of the 
 sea; it is called the <I>great waters of Gibeon</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:12">Jer. xli. 12</A>),

 and it is compassed by the western border of this tribe.

 2. The particular cities in this tribe, not all, but the most 
 considerable. Twenty-six are here named. Jericho is put first, though 
 dismantled, and forbidden to be rebuilt as a city with gates and walls, 
 because it might be built and inhabited as a country village, and so 
 was not useless to this tribe. Gilgal, where Israel first encamped when 
 Saul was made king

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:15">1 Sam. xi. 15</A>),

 was in this tribe. It was afterwards a very profane place. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:15">Hos.  ix. 15</A>,

 <I>All their wickedness is in Gilgal.</I> Beth-el was in this tribe, a 
 famous place.  Though Benjamin adhered to the house of David, yet 
 Beth-el, it seems, was in the possession of the house of Joseph 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:23-25">Judg. i. 23-25</A>),

 and there Jeroboam set up one of his calves. In this tribe was Gibeon,
 where the altar was in the beginning of Solomon's time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:3">2 Chron. i. 3</A>.

 Gibeah likewise, that infamous place where the Levite's concubine was
 abused.  Mizpeh, and near it Samuel's Ebenezer, and also Anathoth, 
 Jeremiah's city, were in this tribe, as was the northern part of 
 Jerusalem. Paul was the honour of this tribe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1,Php+3:5">Rom. xi. 1; Phil. iii. 5</A>);

 but where his land lay we know not: he sought the better country.</P>
