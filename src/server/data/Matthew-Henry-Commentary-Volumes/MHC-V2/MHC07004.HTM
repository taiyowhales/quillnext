 The method of the history of Deborah and Barak (the heroes in this
 chapter) is the same with that before Here is,

 I. Israel revolted from God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. Israel oppressed by Jabin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 III. Israel judged by Deborah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 IV. Israel rescued out of the hands of Jabin. 

 1.  Their deliverance is concerted between Deborah and Barak,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:6,9">ver. 6, 9</A>.

 2.  It is accomplished by their joint-agency. Barak takes the field, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:10">ver. 10</A>.

 Sisera, Jabin's general, meets him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:12,13">ver. 12, 13</A>.

 Deborah encourages him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:14">ver.  14</A>.

 And God gives him a complete victory.  The army routed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:15,16">ver.  15, 16</A>.

 The general forced to flee, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:17">ver.  17</A>.

 And where he expected shelter he had his life stolen from him by Jael
 while he was asleep 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:18-21">ver. 18-21</A>),

 which completes Barak's triumph

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:22">ver. 22</A>)

 and Israel's deliverance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:23,24">ver.  23, 24</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when Ehud was dead.
 &nbsp; 2 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan,
 that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host <I>was</I> Sisera,
 which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
 &nbsp; 3 And the children of Israel cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for he had
 nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily
 oppressed the children of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Israel backsliding from God: They again <I>did evil in his
 sight,</I> forsook his service, and worshipped idols; for this was the 
 sin which now most easily beset them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 See in this,

 1. The strange strength of corruption, which hurries men into sin
 notwithstanding the most frequent experience of its fatal consequences. 
 The bent to backslide is with great difficulty restrained. 

 2. The common ill effects of a long peace. The land had rest eighty 
 years, which should have confirmed them in their religion; but, on the 
 contrary, it made them secure and wanton, and indulgent of those lusts 
 which the worship of the false gods was calculated for the 
 gratification of. Thus <I>the prosperity of fools destroys them.  
 Jeshurun waxeth fat and kicketh.</I> 

 3. The great loss which a people sustains by the death of good
 governors. <I>The did evil, because Ehud was dead.</I> So it may be 
 read. He kept a strict eye upon them, restrained and punished every 
 thing that looked towards idolatry, and kept them close to God's 
 service. But, when he was gone, they revolted, fearing him more than 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Israel oppressed by their enemies. When they forsook God, he 
 forsook them; and then they became an easy prey to every spoiler. They 
 alienated themselves from God as if he were none of theirs; and then 
 God alienated them as none of his. Those that threw themselves out of 
 God's service threw themselves out of his protection. <I>What has my 
 beloved to do in my house</I> when she has thus played the harlot? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:15">Jer. xi. 15</A>.

 He <I>sold them into the hand of Jabin,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 This Jabin reigned in Hazor, as another of the same name, and perhaps
 his ancestor, had done before him, whom Joshua routed and slew, and 
 burnt his city,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:1,10">Josh. xi. 1, 10</A>.

 But it seems, in process of time, the city was rebuilt, the power
 regained, the loss retrieved, and, by degrees, the king of Hazor 
 becomes able to tyrannize over Israel, who by sin had lost all their 
 advantage against the Canaanites. This servitude was longer than either 
 of the former, and much more grievous. Jabin, and his general Sisera, 
 did mightily oppress Israel.  That which aggravated the oppression was, 
 
 1. That this enemy was nearer to them than any of the former, in their
 borders, in their bowels, and by this means had the more opportunity to 
 do them a mischief. 

 2. That they were the natives of the country, who bore an implacable
 enmity to them, for invading and dispossessing them, and when they had 
 them in their power would be so much the more cruel and mischievous 
 towards them in revenge of the old quarrel. 

 3. That these Canaanites had formerly been conquered and subdued by
 Israel, were of old sentenced to be their servants

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:25">Gen. ix. 25</A>),

 and might now have been under their feet, and utterly incapable of
 giving them any disturbance, if their own slothfulness, cowardice, and 
 unbelief, had not suffered them thus to get head. To be oppressed by 
 those whom their fathers had conquered, and whom they themselves had 
 foolishly spared, could not but be very grievous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Israel returning to their God: They <I>cried unto the Lord,</I> 
 when distress drove them to him, and they saw no other way of relief. 
 Those that slight God in their prosperity will find themselves under a 
 necessity of seeking him when they are in trouble.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged
 Israel at that time.
 &nbsp; 5 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah
 and Beth-el in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up
 to her for judgment.
 &nbsp; 6 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
 Kedesh-naphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of
 Israel commanded, <I>saying,</I> Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and
 take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and
 of the children of Zebulun?
 &nbsp; 7 And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the
 captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and
 I will deliver him into thine hand.
 &nbsp; 8 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will
 go: but if thou wilt not go with me, <I>then</I> I will not go.
 &nbsp; 9 And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the
 journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah
 arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The year of the redeemed at length came, when Israel was to be 
 delivered out of the hands of Jabin, and restored again to their 
 liberty, which we may suppose the northern tribes, that lay nearest to 
 the oppressors and felt most the effects of his fury, did in a 
 particular manner cry to God for. <I>For the oppression of the poor, 
 and the sighing of the needy, now will</I> God <I>arise.</I> Now here 
 we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preparation of the people for their deliverance, by the 
 prophetic conduct and government of Deborah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 Her name signifies a <I>bee;</I> and she answered her name by her
 industry, sagacity, and great usefulness to the public, her sweetness 
 to her friends and sharpness to her enemies. She is said to be <I>the 
 wife of Lapidoth;</I> but, the termination not being commonly found in 
 the name of a man, some make this the name of a place: she was <I>a 
 woman of Lapidoth.</I> Others take it appellatively, Lapidoth signifies 
 <I>lamps.</I> The Rabbin say she had employed herself in making wicks 
 for the lamps of the tabernacle; and, having stooped to that mean 
 office for God, she was afterwards thus preferred. Or she was a woman 
 of <I>illuminations,</I> or of <I>splendours,</I> one that was 
 extraordinarily knowing and wise, and so came to be very eminent and 
 illustrious. Concerning her we are here told,

 1. That she was intimately acquainted with God; she was <I>a
 prophetess,</I> one that was instructed in divine knowledge by the 
 immediate inspiration of the Spirit of God, and had gifts of wisdom, to 
 which she attained not in an ordinary way: she <I>heard the words of 
 God,</I> and probably <I>saw the visions of the Almighty.</I> 

 2. That she was entirely devoted to the service of Israel. She judged
 Israel at the time that Jabin oppressed them; and perhaps, being a 
 woman, she was the more easily permitted by the oppressor to do it. She 
 judged, not as a princess, by an civil authority conferred upon her, 
 but as a prophetess, and as God's mouth to them, correcting abuses and 
 redressing grievances, especially those which related to the worship of 
 God. The children of Israel came up to her from all parts for judgment, 
 not so much for the deciding of controversies between man and man as 
 for advice in the reformation of what was amiss in things pertaining to 
 God. Those among them who before had secretly lamented the impieties 
 and idolatries of their neighbours, but knew not where to apply for the 
 restraining of them, now made their complaints to Deborah, who, by the 
 sword of the Spirit, showing them the judgment of God, reduced and 
 reclaimed many, and excited and animated the magistrates in their 
 respective districts to put the laws in execution. It is said she 
 <I>dwelt,</I> or, as some read it, she <I>sat</I> under a palm-tree, 
 called ever after from her <I>the palm-tree of Deborah.</I> Either she 
 had her house under that tree, a mean habitation which would couch 
 under a tree, or she had her judgment-seat in the open air, under the 
 shadow of that tree, which was an emblem of the justice she sat there 
 to administer, which will thrive and grow against opposition, as palms 
 under pressures. Josephus says that the children of Israel came to 
 Deborah, to desire her to pray to God for them, that they might be 
 delivered out of the hand of Jabin; and Samuel is said at one 
 particular time to judge Israel in Mizpeh, that is, to bring them back 
 again to God, when they made the same address to him upon a like 
 occasion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:6,8">1 Sam. vii. 6, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The project laid for their deliverance. When the children of Israel 
 <I>came to her for judgment,</I> with her they found salvation. So 
 those that seek to God for grace shall have grace and peace, grace and 
 comfort, grace and glory. She was not herself fit to command an army in 
 person, being a woman; but she nominated one that was fit, Barak of 
 Naphtali, who, it is probable, had already signalized himself in some 
 rencounters with the forces of the oppressor, living near him (for 
 Hazor and Harosheth lay within the lot of that tribe), and thereby had 
 gained a reputation and interest among his people. Some struggles, we 
 may suppose, that brave man had made towards the shaking off of the 
 yoke, but could not effect it till he had his commission and 
 instructions from Deborah. He could do nothing without her head, nor 
 she without his hands; but both together made a complete deliverer, and 
 effected a complete deliverance. The greatest and best are not 
 self-sufficient, but need one another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By God's direction, she orders Barak to raise an army, and engage 
 Jabin's forces, that were under Sisera's command, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 Barak, it may be, had been meditating some great attempt against the
 common enemy; a spark of generous fire was glowing in his breast, and 
 he would fain do something to the purpose for his people and for the 
 cities of his God. But two things discouraged him:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He wanted a commission to levy forces; this therefore Deborah here 
 gives him under the broad seal of heaven, which, as a prophetess, she 
 had a warrant to affix to it: "<I>Hath not the Lord God of Israel 
 commanded it?</I> Yet, certainly he has; take my word for it." Some 
 think she intends this as an appeal to Barak's own heart. "Has not God, 
 by a secret whisper to thyself, given thee some intimation of his 
 purpose to make use of thee as an instrument in his hands to save 
 Israel? Hast not thou felt some impulse of this kind upon thy own 
 spirit?" If so, the spirit of prophesy in Deborah confirms the spirit 
 of a soldier in Barak: <I>Go and draw towards Mount Tabor.</I> 

 [1.] She directs him what number of men to raise-10,000; and let him 
 not fear that these will be too few, when God hath said he will by them 
 save Israel. 

 [2.] Whence he should raise them--only out of his own tribe, and that of
 Zebulun next adjoining. These two counties should furnish him with an 
 army sufficient; he need not stay to go further.  And, 

 [3.] She orders him where to make his rendezvous--at Mount Tabor, in his
 own neighbourhood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) When he had an army raised, he knew not how he should have an 
 opportunity of engaging the enemy, who perhaps declined fighting, 
 having heard that Israel, if they had but courage enough to make head 
 against any enemy, seldom failed of success.  "Well," says Deborah, in 
 the name of "God, <I>I will draw unto thee Sisera and his army.</I>" 
 She assured him that the matter should be determined by one pitched 
 battle, and should not be long in the doing. 

 [1.] In mentioning the power of the enemy, Sisera, a celebrated 
 general, bold and experienced, his chariots, his iron chariots, and his 
 multitude of soldiers, she obliged Barak to fortify himself with the 
 utmost degree of resolution; for the enemy he was to engage was a very 
 formidable one. It is good to know the worst, that we may provide 
 accordingly. But, 

 [2.] In fixing the very place to which Sisera would draw his army, she 
 gave him a sign, which might help to confirm his faith when he came to 
 engage. it was a contingent things, and depended upon Sisera's own 
 will; but, when afterwards Barak should see the event falling out just 
 as Deborah had foretold, he might thence infer that certainly in the 
 rest she said she spoke under a divine direction, which would be a 
 great encouragement to him, especially because with this, 

 [3.] She gave him an express promise of success <I>I will</I> (that is, 
 God will, in whose name I speak) <I>deliver them into thy hand;</I> so 
 that when he saw them drawn up against him, according to Deborah's 
 word, he might be confident that, according to her word, he should soon 
 see them fallen before him.  Observe, God <I>drew them to him</I> only 
 that he might <I>deliver them into his hand.</I> When Sisera drew his 
 forces together, he designed the destruction of Israel; but God 
 <I>gathered them as sheaves into the floor,</I> for their own 
 destruction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:11,12">Mic. iv. 11, 12</A>.

 <I>Assemble yourselves, and you shall be broken to pieces,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:9">Isa. viii. 9</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:17,18">Rev. xix. 17, 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. At Barak's request, she promises to go along with him to the field 
 of battle. 

 (1.) Barak insisted much upon the necessity of her presence, which 
 would be to him better than a council of war 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>If thou wilt go with me</I> to direct and advise me, and in every
 difficult case to let me know God's mind, <I>then I will go</I> with 
 all my heart, and not fear the chariots of iron; otherwise not." Some 
 make this to be the language of a weak faith; he could not take her 
 word unless he had her with him in pawn, as it were, for performance. 
 It seems rather to arise from a conviction of the necessity of God's 
 presence and continual direction, a pledge and earnest of which he 
 would reckon Deborah's presence to be, and therefore begged thus 
 earnestly for it. "<I>If thou go not up with me,</I> in token of God's 
 going with me, <I>carry me not up hence.</I>" Nothing would be a 
 greater satisfaction to him than to have the prophetess with him to 
 animate the soldiers and to be consulted as an oracle upon all 
 occasions.

 (2.) Deborah promised to go with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 No toil nor peril shall discourage her from doing the utmost that
 becomes her to do for the service of her country. She would not send 
 him where she would not go herself. Those that in God's name call 
 others to their duty should be very ready to assist them in it.  
 Deborah was the weaker vessel, yet had the stronger faith. But though 
 she agrees to go with Barak, if he insists upon it, she gives him a 
 hint proper enough to move a soldier not to insist upon it: <I>The 
 journey thou undertakest</I> (so confident was she of the success that 
 she called his engaging in war but the undertaking of a journey) 
 <I>shall not be for thy honour;</I> not so much for thy honour as if 
 thou hadst gone by thyself; for <I>the Lord shall sell Sisera</I> (now 
 his turn comes to be sold as Israel was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>,

 by way of reprisal) "<I>into the hands of a woman;</I>" that is,

 [1.] The world would ascribe the victory to the hand of Deborah: this 
 he might himself foresee. 

 [2.] God (to correct his weakness) would complete the victory by the 
 hand of Jael, which would be some eclipse to his glory. But Barak 
 values the satisfaction of his mind, and the good success of his 
 enterprise, more than his honour; and therefore will by no means drop 
 his request. He dares not fight unless he have Deborah with him, to 
 direct him and pray for him.  She therefore stood to her word with a 
 masculine courage; this noble heroine <I>arose and went with 
 Barak.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went
 up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with
 him.
 &nbsp; 11 Now Heber the Kenite, <I>which was</I> of the children of Hobab
 the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites,
 and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which <I>is</I> by
 Kedesh.
 &nbsp; 12 And they showed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was
 gone up to mount Tabor.
 &nbsp; 13 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, <I>even</I> nine
 hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that <I>were</I> with
 him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.
 &nbsp; 14 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this <I>is</I> the day in
 which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor,
 and ten thousand men after him.
 &nbsp; 15 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> discomfited Sisera, and all <I>his</I> chariots, and
 all <I>his</I> host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that
 Sisera lighted down off <I>his</I> chariot, and fled away on his feet.
 &nbsp; 16 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host,
 unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell
 upon the edge of the sword; <I>and</I> there was not a man left.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Barak beats up for volunteers, and soon has his quota of men ready,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Deborah had appointed him to raise an army of 10,000 men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and so many he has presently <I>at his feet,</I> following him, and
 subject to his command. God is said to call us <I>to his feet</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:2">Isa. xli. 2</A>),

 that is, into obedience to him. Some think it intimates that they were
 all footmen, and so the armies of the Jews generally were, which made 
 the disproportion of strength between them and the enemy (who had 
 horses and chariots) very great, and the victory the more illustrious; 
 but the presence of God and his prophetess was abundantly sufficient to 
 balance that disproportion. Barak had his men <I>at his feet,</I> which 
 intimates their cheerfulness and readiness to attend him whithersoever 
 he went, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:4">Rev. xiv. 4</A>.

 Though the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali were chiefly depended on, yet
 it appears by Deborah's song that some had come in to him from other 
 tribes (Manasseh and Issachar), and more were expected that came not, 
 from Reuben, Dan, and Asher,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:14-17"><I>ch.</I> v. 14-17</A>.

 But these are overlooked here; and we are only told that to make his
 10,000 men effective indeed <I>Deborah went up with him.</I> The 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:11">11th verse</A>,

 concerning the removal of Heber, one of the families of the Kenites,
 out of the wilderness of Judah, in the south, where those families had 
 fixed themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:16"><I>ch.</I> i. 16</A>),

 into the northern country, comes in for the sake of what was to follow
 concerning the exploit of Jael, a wife of that family.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Sisera, upon notice of Barak's motions, takes the field with a very 
 numerous and powerful army 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>):

 <I>They showed Sisera,</I> that is, it was shown to him. Yet some think
 it refers to the Kenites, mentioned immediately before,

 They gave Sisera notice of Barak's rendezvous, there being peace at
 this time between Jabin and that family, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Whether they intended it as a kindness to him or no, it served to
 accomplish what God had said by Deborah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>I will draw unto thee Sisera.</I> Sisera's confidence was chiefly in
 his chariots; therefore particular notice is taken of them, 900 
 <I>chariots of iron,</I> which, with the scythes fastened to their 
 axle-trees, when they were driven into an army of footmen, did terrible 
 execution.  So ingenious have men been in inventing methods of 
 destroying one another, to gratify those lusts <I>from which come wars 
 and fightings.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Deborah gives orders to engage the enemy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Josephus says that when Barak saw Sisera's army drawn up, and
 attempting to surround the mountain on the top of which he and his 
 forces lay encamped, his heart quite failed him, and he determined to 
 retire to a place of greater safety; but Deborah animated him to make a 
 descent upon Sisera, assuring him that this was the day marked out in 
 the divine counsels for his defeat. "Now they appear most threatening 
 they are ripe for ruin. The thing is as sure to be done as if it were 
 done already: <I>The Lord hath delivered Sisera into thy hand.</I>" See 
 how the work and honour of this great action are divided between 
 Deborah and Barak; she, as the head, <I>gives the word,</I> he, as the 
 hand, <I>does the work.</I> Thus does God dispense his gifts variously,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:4-11">1 Cor. xii. 4</A>,

 &c.  But, though ordinarily <I>the head of the woman is the man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:3">1 Cor. xi. 3</A>),

 he that has the residue of the Spirit was pleased to cross hands, and
 to put the head upon the woman's shoulders, choosing the weak things of 
 the world to shame the mighty, that no flesh might glory in his 
 presence. It was well for Barak that he had Deborah with him; for she 
 made up what was defective, 

 1. In his conduct, by telling him, <I>This is the day.</I> 

 2. In his courage, by assuring him of God's presence: "<I>Has not the
 Lord gone out before thee?</I> Darest not thou follow when thou hast 
 God himself for thy leader?" Note,

 (1.) In every undertaking it is good to be satisfied that God goes 
 before us, that we are in the way of our duty and under his direction. 
 
 (2.) If we have ground to hope that God goes before us, we ought to go 
 on with courage and cheerfulness. Be not dismayed at the difficulties 
 thou meetest with in resisting Satan, in serving God, or suffering for 
 him; for <I>has not the Lord gone out before thee?</I> Follow him fully 
 then.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. God himself routs the enemy's army, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Barak, in obedience to Deborah's orders, went down into the valley,
 though there upon the plain the iron chariots would have so much the 
 more advantage against him, quitting his fastnesses upon the mountain 
 in dependence upon the divine power; for <I>in vain is salvation hoped 
 for from hills and mountains; in the Lord alone is the salvation of his 
 people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:23">Jer. iii. 23</A>.

 And he was not deceived in his confidence: <I>The Lord discomfited
 Sisera.</I> It was not so much the bold and surprising alarm which 
 Barak gave their camp that dispirited and dispersed them, but God's 
 terror seized their spirits and put them into an unaccountable 
 confusion. <I>The stars,</I> it seems, fought against them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:20"><I>ch.</I> v. 20</A>.

 Josephus says that a violent storm of hail which beat in their faces
 gave them this rout, disabled them, and drove them back; so that they 
 became a very easy prey to the army of Israel, and Deborah's words were 
 made good: "<I>The Lord has delivered them into thy hand;</I> it is now 
 in thy power to do what thou wilt with them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Barak bravely improves his advantage, follows the blow with 
 undaunted resolution and unwearied diligence, prosecutes the victory, 
 pursues the scattered forces, even to their general's head-quarters at 
 Harosheth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 and spares none whom God had delivered into his hand to be destroyed:
 <I>There was not a man left.</I> When God goes before us in our 
 spiritual conflicts we must bestir ourselves; and, when by grace he 
 gives us some success against the enemies of our souls, we must improve 
 it by watchfulness and resolution, and carry on the holy war with 
 vigour.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the
 wife of Heber the Kenite: for <I>there was</I> peace between Jabin the
 king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
 &nbsp; 18 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn
 in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in
 unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.
 &nbsp; 19 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water
 to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and
 gave him drink, and covered him.
 &nbsp; 20 Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and
 it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say,
 Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.
 &nbsp; 21 Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an
 hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail
 into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was
 fast asleep and weary. So he died.
 &nbsp; 22 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet
 him, and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom
 thou seekest. And when he came into her <I>tent,</I> behold, Sisera
 lay dead, and the nail <I>was</I> in his temples.
 &nbsp; 23 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before
 the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 24 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and
 prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had
 destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have seen the army of the Canaanites totally routed. It is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:9,10">Ps. lxxxiii. 9, 10</A>,

 where the defeat of this army is pleaded as a precedent for God's doing
 the like in after times) that they became <I>as dung for the earth.</I> 
 Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The fall of their general, Sisera, captain of the host, in whom, it 
 is likely, Jabin their king put an entire confidence, and therefore was 
 not himself present in the action. Let us trace the steps of this 
 mighty man's fall.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He quitted his chariot, and took to his feet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:15,17"><I>v.</I> 15, 17</A>.

 His chariots had been his pride and his confidence; and we may suppose
 he had therefore despised and defied the armies of the living God, 
 because they were all on foot, and had neither chariot nor horse, as he 
 had.  Justly therefore is he thus made ashamed of his confidence, and 
 forced to quit it, and thinks himself then most safe and easy when he 
 has got clear of his chariot, though we may well suppose it the best 
 made, and best drawn, of any of them. Thus are those disappointed who 
 rest on the creature; like a broken reed, it not only breaks under 
 them, but runs into their hand, and pierceth them with many sorrows. 
 The idol may quickly become a burden

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:1">Isa. xlvi. 1</A>),

 and what we were sick for God can make us sick of. How miserable doth
 Sisera look now he is dismounted!  It is hard to say whether he 
 blusheth or trembleth more. Put not your trust in princes, if they may 
 so soon be brought to this, if he who but lately trusted to his arms 
 with so much assurance must now trust to his heels only with so 
 little.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He fled for shelter to the tents of the Kenites, having no 
 strong-hold, nor any place of is own in reach to retire to. The mean 
 and solitary way of the Kenites' living, perhaps, he had formerly 
 despised and ridiculed, and the more because religion was kept up among 
 them; yet now he is glad to put himself under the protection of one of 
 these tents: and he chooses the wife's tent or apartment, either 
 because less suspected, or because it happened to be next to him, and 
 the first he came to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 And that which encouraged him to go thither was that at this time there
 was peace between his master and the house of Heber: not that there was 
 any league offensive and defensive between them, only at present there 
 were no indications of hostility. Jabin did them no harm, did not 
 oppress them as he did the Israelites, their plain, quiet, harmless way 
 of living making them not suspected nor feared, and perhaps God so 
 ordering it as a recompence for their constant adherence to the true 
 religion. Sisera thought he might therefore be safe among them; not 
 considering that, though they themselves suffered not by Jabin's power, 
 they heartily sympathized with the Israel of God that did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Jael invited him in, and bade him very welcome. Probably she stood 
 at the tent door, to enquire what news from the army, and what the 
 success of the battle which was fought not far off. 

 (1.) She invited him in. Perhaps she stood waiting for an opportunity 
 to show kindness to any distressed Israelite, if there should be 
 occasion for it; but seeing Sisera come in great haste, panting and out 
 of breath, she invited him to come and repose himself in her tent, in 
 which, while she seemed to design the relieving of his fatigue, perhaps 
 she really intended the retarding of his flight, that he might fall 
 into the hands of Barak, who was not in a hot chase after him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 and it may well questioned whether she had at first any thought of
 taking away his life, but rather God afterwards put it into her heart. 
 
 (2.) She made very much of him, and seemed mighty careful to have him 
 easy, as her invited guest. Was he weary? she finds him a very 
 convenient place to repose himself in, and recruit his strength.  Was 
 he thirsty? well he might. Did he want a little water to cool his 
 tongue? the best liquor her tent afforded was at his service, and that 
 was milk 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 which, we may suppose, he drank heartily of, and, being refreshed with
 it, was the better disposed to sleep. Was he cold, or afraid of 
 catching cold?  or did he desire to be hid from the pursuers, if they 
 should search that tent? she covered him with a mantle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 All expressions of care for his safety. Only when he desired her to
 tell a lie for him, and to say he was not there, she declined making 
 any such promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:20"><I>v.</I>  20</A>.

 We must not sin against God, no, not to oblige those we would show
 ourselves most observant of.  <I>Lastly,</I> We must suppose she kept 
 her tent as quiet as she could, and free from noise, that he might 
 sleep the sooner and the faster. And now was Sisera least safe when he 
 was most secure. How uncertain and precarious is human life! and what 
 assurance can we have of it, when it may so easily be betrayed by those 
 with whom it is trusted, and those may prove its destroyers who we 
 hoped would be its protectors! It is best making God our friend, for he 
 will not deceive us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. When he lay fast asleep she drove a long nail through his temples, 
 so fastened his head to the ground, and killed him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 And, though this was enough to do the business, yet, to make sure work
 (if we translate it rightly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:26"><I>ch.</I> v. 26</A>),

 she cut off his head, and left it nailed there. Whether she designed
 this or no when she invited him into her tent does not appear; probably 
 the thought was darted into her mind when she saw him lie so 
 conveniently to receive such a fatal blow; and, doubtless, the thought 
 brought with it evidence sufficient that it came not from Satan as a 
 murderer and destroyer, but from God as a righteous judge and avenger, 
 so much of brightness and heavenly light did she perceive in the 
 inducements to it that offered themselves, the honour of God and the 
 deliverance of Israel, and nothing of the blackness of malice, hatred, 
 or personal revenge. 

 (1.) It was a divine power that enabled her to do it, and inspired her 
 with a more than manly courage.  What if her hand should shake, and she 
 should miss her blow? What if he should awake when she was attempting 
 it? Or suppose some of his own attendants should follow him, and 
 surprise her in the face, how dearly would she and all hers be made to 
 pay for it? Yet, obtaining help of God, she did it effectually. 

 (2.) It was a divine warrant that justified her in the doing of it; and 
 therefore, since no such extraordinary commissions can now be 
 pretended, it ought not in any case to be imitated. The laws of 
 friendship and hospitality must be religiously observed, and we must 
 abhor the thought of betraying any whom we have invited and encouraged 
 to put a confidence in us. And, as to this act of Jael (like that of 
 Ehud in the chapter before), we have reason to think she was conscious 
 of such a divine impulse upon her spirit to do it as did abundantly 
 satisfy herself (and it ought therefore to satisfy us) that it was well 
 done. God's judgments are a great deep. The instrument of this 
 execution was a nail of the tent, that is, one of the great pins with 
 which the tent, or the stakes of it, were fastened. They often removing 
 their tents, she had been used to drive these nails, and therefore knew 
 how to do it the more dexterously on this great occasion. he that 
 thought to destroy Israel with his many iron chariots is himself 
 destroyed with one iron nail.  Thus do the weak things of the world 
 confound the mighty. See here Jael's glory and Sisera's shame. The 
 great commander dies, 

 [1.] In his sleep, fast asleep, and weary. It comes in as a reason why 
 he stirred not, to make resistance. So fettered was he in the chains of 
 sleep that he could not find his hands. Thus <I>the stout-hearted are 
 spoiled at thy rebuke, O God of Jacob! they are cast into a dead 
 sleep,</I> and so are made to sleep their last, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:5,6">Ps.  lxxvi. 5, 6</A>.

 Let not the strong man then glory in his strength; for when he sleeps
 where is it? It is weak, and he can do nothing; a child may insult him 
 then, and steal his life from him; and yet if he sleep not he is soon 
 spent and weary, and can do nothing either. Those words which we here 
 put in a parenthesis (<I>for he was weary</I>) all the ancient versions 
 read otherwise: <I>he struggled</I> (or started, as we say) <I>and 
 died,</I> so the Syriac and Arabic, <I>Exagitans sese mortuus est. He 
 fainted and died,</I> so the LXX.  <I>Consocians morte soporem,</I> so 
 the vulgar Latin, joining sleep and death together, seeing they are so 
 near akin.  <I>He fainted and died.</I> He dies,

 [2.] With his head nailed to the ground, an emblem of his 
 earthly-mindedness. <I>O curve in terram anim&aelig;!</I> His ear (says
 bishop Hall) was fastened close to the earth, as if his body had been 
 listening what had become of his soul. He dies, 

 [3.] By the hand of a woman. This added to the shame of his death 
 before men; and had he but known it, as Abimelech

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:54"><I>ch.</I> ix. 54</A>),

 we may well imagine how much it would have added to the vexation of his
 own heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The glory and joy of Israel hereupon. 

 1. Barak their leader finds his enemy dead,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 and no doubt, he was very well pleased to find his work done so well to
 his hand, and so much to the glory of God and the confusion of his 
 enemies. had he stood too nicely upon a point of honour, he would have 
 resented it as an affront to have the general slain by any hand but 
 his; but now he remembered that this diminution of his honour he was 
 sentenced to undergo, for insisting upon Deborah's going with him 
 (<I>the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman</I>), though
 then it was little thought that the prediction would be fulfilled in 
 such a way as this. 

 2. Israel is completely delivered out of the hands of Jabin king of
 Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 They not only shook off his yoke by this day's victory, but they
 afterwards prosecuted the war against him, till they had destroyed him, 
 he and his nation being by the divine appointment devoted to ruin and 
 not to be spared. The Israelites, having soundly smarted for their 
 foolish pity in not doing it before, resolved now it is in their power 
 to indulge them no longer, but to make a thorough riddance of them, as 
 a people to whom to show mercy was as contrary to their own interest as 
 it was to God's command; and probably it is with an eye to the sentence 
 they were under that this enemy is named three times here in these 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:23,24">last two verses</A>,

 and called <I>king of Canaan;</I> for as such he was to be destroyed;
 and so thoroughly was he destroyed that I do not remember to read of 
 the kings of Canaan any more after this. The children of Israel would 
 have prevented a great deal of mischief if they had sooner destroyed 
 these Canaanites, as God had both commanded and enabled them; but 
 better be wise late, and buy wisdom by experience, than never wise.</P>
