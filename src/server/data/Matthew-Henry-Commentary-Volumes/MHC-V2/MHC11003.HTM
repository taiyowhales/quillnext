 Solomon's reign looked bloody in the foregoing chapter, but the 
 necessary acts of justice must not be called cruelty; in this chapter 
 it appears with another face. We must not think the worse of God's 
 mercy to his subjects for his judgments on rebels.  We have here, 

 I.  Solomon's marriage to Pharaoh's daughter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. A general view of his religion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>.

 III. A particular account of his prayer to God for wisdom, and the
 answer to that prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:5-15">ver.  5-15</A>.

 IV. A particular instance of his wisdom in deciding the controversy
 between the two harlots, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:16-28">ver. 16-28</A>.

 And very great he looks here, both at the altar and on the bench, and 
 therefore on the bench because at the altar.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
 took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David,
 until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
 &nbsp; 2 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was
 no house built unto the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, until those days.
 &nbsp; 3 And Solomon loved the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, walking in the statutes of David
 his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.
 &nbsp; 4 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that
 <I>was</I> the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did
 Solomon offer upon that altar.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told concerning Solomon,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Something that was unquestionably good, for which he is to be 
 praised and in which he is to be imitated. 

 1. He <I>loved the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Particular notice was taken of God's love to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:24">2 Sam. xii. 24</A>.

 He had his name from it: <I>Jedidiah--beloved of the Lord.</I> And here
 we find he returned that love, as John, the beloved disciple, was most 
 full of love. Solomon was a wise man, a rich man; yet the brightest 
 encomium of him is that which is the character of all the saints, even 
 the poorest, He <I>loved the Lord,</I> so the Chaldee; all that love 
 God love his worship, love to hear from him and speak to him, and so to 
 have communion with him. 

 2. He <I>walked in the statutes of David his father,</I> that is, in
 the statutes that David gave him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:2,3"><I>ch.</I> ii. 2, 3</A>;
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:9,10">1 Chron. xxviii. 9, 10</A>

 (his dying father's charge was sacred, and as a law to him), or in
 God's statutes, which David his father walked in before him; he kept 
 close to God's ordinances, carefully observed them and diligently 
 attended them. Those that truly<I>love God</I> will make conscience of 
 <I>walking in his statutes.</I> 

 3. He was very free and generous in what he did for the honour of God.
 When he offered sacrifice he offered like a king, in some proportion to 
 his great wealth, a <I>thousand burnt-offerings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Where God sows plentifully he expects to reap accordingly; and those
 that truly love God and his worship will not grudge the expenses of 
 their religion. We may be tempted to say, <I>To what purpose is this 
 waste?</I> Might not these cattle have been given to the poor? But we 
 must never think that wasted which is laid out in the service of God.  
 It seems strange how so many beasts should be burnt upon one altar in 
 one feast, though it continued seven days; but the fire on the altar is 
 supposed to be more quick and devouring than common fire, for it 
 represented that fierce and mighty wrath of God which fell upon the 
 sacrifices, that the offerers might escape.  <I>Our God is a consuming 
 fire.</I> Bishop Patrick quotes it as a tradition of the Jews that the 
 smoke of the sacrifices ascended directly in a straight pillar, and was 
 not scattered, otherwise it would have choked those that attended, when 
 so many sacrifices were offered as were here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is something concerning which it may be doubted whether it was 
 good or no. 
 
 1. His marrying Pharaoh's daughter,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 We will suppose she was proselyted, otherwise the marriage would not
 have been lawful; yet, if so, surely it was not advisable. He that 
 <I>loved the Lord</I> should, for his sake, have fixed his love upon 
 one of the Lord's people. Unequal matches of the sons of God with the 
 daughters of men have often been of pernicious consequence; yet some 
 think that he did this with the advice of his friends, that she was a 
 sincere convert (for the gods of the Egyptians are not reckoned among 
 the strange gods which his strange wives drew him in to the worship of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:5,6"><I>ch.</I> xi. 5, 6</A>),
 
 and that the book of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ca+1:1">Canticles</A>

 and the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:1-17">45th Psalm</A>

 were penned on this occasion, by which these nuptials were made typical
 of the mystical espousals of the church to Christ, especially the 
 Gentile church.

 2.  His worshipping in the high places, and thereby tempting the people
 to do so too, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.
 
 Abraham built his altars on mountains
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:8,22:2">Gen. xii. 8; xxii. 2</A>),

 and worshipped in a grove, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:33">Gen. xxi. 33</A>.

 Thence the custom was derived, and was proper, till the divine law
 confined them to one place,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:5,6">Deut. xii. 5, 6</A>.

 David kept to the ark, and did not care for the high places, but
 Solomon, though in other things he <I>walked in the statutes of his 
 father,</I> in this came short of him. He showed thereby a great zeal 
 for sacrificing, but to obey would have been better. This was an 
 irregularity. Though there was as yet no house built, there was a tent 
 pitched, to the name of the Lord, and the ark ought to have been the 
 centre of their unity. It was so by divine institution; from it the 
 high places separated; yet while they worshipped God only, and in other 
 things according to the rule, he graciously overlooked their weakness, 
 and accepted their services; and it is owned that <I>Solomon loved the 
 Lord,</I> though he <I>burnt incense in the high places,</I> and let 
 not men be more severe than God is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 In Gibeon the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> appeared to Solomon in a dream by night:
 and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.
 &nbsp; 6 And Solomon said, Thou hast showed unto thy servant David my
 father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth,
 and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and
 thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given
 him a son to sit on his throne, as <I>it is</I> this day.
 &nbsp; 7 And now, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God, thou hast made thy servant king
 instead of David my father: and I <I>am but</I> a little child: I know
 not <I>how</I> to go out or come in.
 &nbsp; 8 And thy servant <I>is</I> in the midst of thy people which thou
 hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted
 for multitude.
 &nbsp; 9 Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge
 thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is
 able to judge this thy so great a people?
 &nbsp; 10 And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this
 thing.
 &nbsp; 11 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing,
 and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked
 riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but
 hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;
 &nbsp; 12 Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given
 thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none
 like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like
 unto thee.
 &nbsp; 13 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked,
 both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the
 kings like unto thee all thy days.
 &nbsp; 14 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
 commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen
 thy days.
 &nbsp; 15 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, <I>it was</I> a dream. And he
 came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace
 offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of a gracious visit which God paid to Solomon, 
 and the communion he had with God in it, which put a greater honour 
 upon Solomon than all the wealth and power of his kingdom did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The circumstances of this visit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 1. The place. It was in Gibeon; that was the great high place, and
 should have been the only one, because there the tabernacle and the 
 brazen altar were,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1:3">2 Chron. i. 3</A>.

 There Solomon offered his great sacrifices, and there God owned him
 more than in any other of the high places. The nearer we come to the 
 rule in our worship the more reason we have to expect the tokens of 
 God's presence. Where God records his name, there he will meet us and 
 bless us. 

 2. The time.  It was by night, the night after he had offered that
 generous sacrifice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The more we abound in God's work the more comfort we may expect in him;
 if the day has been busy for him, the night will be easy in him. 
 Silence and retirement befriend our communion with God. His kindest 
 visits are often in the night,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:3">Ps. xvii. 3</A>.

 3. The manner. It was in a dream, when he was asleep, his senses locked
 up, that God's access to his mind might be the more free and immediate. 
 In this way God used to speak to the prophets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:6">Num. xii. 6</A>)
 
 and to private persons, for their own benefit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:15,16">Job xxxiii. 15, 16</A>.

 These divine dreams, no doubt, were plainly distinguishable from those
 in which there are divers vanities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:7">Eccl. v. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The gracious offer God made him of the favour he should choose, 
 whatever it might be, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He saw the glory of God shine about him, and heard a voice saying,
 <I>Ask what I shall give thee.</I> Not that God was indebted to him for 
 his sacrifices, but thus he would testify his acceptance of them, and 
 signify to him what great mercy he had in store for him, if he were not 
 wanting to himself. Thus he would try his inclinations and put an 
 honour upon the prayer of faith. God, in like manner, condescends to 
 us, and puts us in the ready way to be happy by assuring us that we 
 shall have what we will for the asking,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:23,1Jo+5:14">John xvi. 23; 1 John v. 14</A>.

 What would we more? <I>Ask, and it shall be given you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The pious request Solomon hereupon made to God. He readily laid 
 hold of this offer. Why do we neglect the like offer made to us, like 
 Ahaz, who said, <I>I will not ask?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:12">Isa. vii. 12</A>.

 Solomon prayed in his sleep, God's grace assisting him; yet it was a
 lively prayer. What we are most in care about, and which makes the 
 greatest impression upon us when we are awake, commonly affects us when 
 we are asleep; and by our dreams, sometimes, we may know what our 
 hearts are upon and how our pulse beats.  Plutarch makes virtuous 
 dreams one evidence of increase in virtue. Yet this must be attributed 
 to a higher source. Solomon's making such an intelligent choice as this 
 when he was asleep, and the powers of reason were least active, showed 
 that it came purely from the grace of God, which wrought in him these 
 gracious desires. If his <I>reins</I> thus <I>instruct him in the night 
 season,</I> he must <I>bless the Lord</I> who <I>gave him counsel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:7">Ps. xvi. 7</A>.
 
 Now, in this prayer,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He acknowledges God's great goodness to his father David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He speaks honourably of his father's piety, that he had <I>walked
 before God in uprightness of heart,</I> drawing a veil over his faults. 
 It is to be hoped that those who praise their godly parents will 
 imitate them. But he speaks more honourably of God's goodness to his 
 father, the mercy he had shown to him while he lived, in giving him to 
 be sincerely religious and then recompensing his sincerity and the 
 great kindness he had kept for him, to be bestowed on the family when 
 he was gone, in <I>giving him a son to sit on his throne.</I> Children 
 should give God thanks for his mercies to their parents, for the sure 
 mercies of David. God's favours are doubly sweet when we observe them 
 transmitted to us through the hands of those that have gone before us.  
 The way to get the entail perpetuated is to bless God that it has 
 hitherto been preserved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He owns his own insufficiency for the discharge of that great trust 
 to which he is called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 And here is a double plea to enforce his petition for wisdom:--

 (1.) That his place required it, as he was successor to David ("<I>Thou
 hast made me king instead of David,</I> who was a very wise and good 
 man: Lord, give me wisdom, that I may keep up what he wrought, and 
 carry on what he began") and as he was ruler over Israel: "Lord, give 
 me wisdom to rule well; for they are a numerous people, that will not 
 be managed without much care, and they are thy people, whom thou hast 
 chosen, and therefore to be ruled for thee, and the more wisely they 
 are ruled the more glory thou wilt have from them."

 (2.) That he wanted it. As one that had a humble sense of his own
 deficiency, he pleads, "<I>Lord, I am but a little child</I> (so he 
 calls himself, a child in understanding, though his father called him 
 <I>a wise man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:9"><I>ch.</I> ii. 9</A>);

 <I>I know not how to go out or come in</I> as I should, nor to do so
 much as the common daily business of the government, much less what to 
 do in a critical juncture." Note, Those who are employed in public 
 stations ought to be very sensible of the weight and importance of 
 their work and their own insufficiency for it, and then they are 
 qualified for receiving divine instruction.  Paul's question (<I>Who is 
 sufficient for these things?</I>) is much like Solomon's here, <I>Who 
 is able to judge this thy so great a people?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Absalom, who was a wise man, trembles at the undertaking and suspects
 his own fitness for it. The more knowing and considerate men are the 
 better acquainted they are with their own weakness and the more jealous 
 of themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He begs of God to give him wisdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 <I>Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart.</I> He calls
 himself <I>God's servant,</I> pleased with that relation to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:16">Ps. cxvi. 16</A>)

 and pleading it with him: "I am devoted to thee, and employed for thee;
 give me that which is requisite to the services in which I am 
 employed." Thus his good father prayed, and thus he pleaded. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:125">Ps. cxix. 125</A>,

 <I>I am thy servant, give me understanding.</I> An understanding heart
 is God's gift,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:6">Prov. ii. 6</A>.
 
 We must pray for it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:5">James i. 5</A>),

 and pray for it with application to our particular calling and the
 various occasions we have for it; as Solomon, <I>Give me an 
 understanding,</I> not to please my own curiosity with, or puzzle my 
 neighbours, but <I>to judge thy people.</I> That is the best knowledge 
 which will be serviceable to us in doing our duty; and such that 
 knowledge is which enables us to <I>discern between good and bad,</I> 
 right and wrong, sin and duty, truth and falsehood, so as not to be 
 imposed upon by false colours in judging either of others' actions or 
 of our own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The favourable answer God gave to his request. It was a pleasing 
 prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>The speech pleased the Lord.</I> God is well pleased with his own
 work in his people, the desires of his own kindling, the prayers of his 
 Spirit's inditing. By this choice Solomon made it appear that he 
 desired to be good more than great, and to serve God's honour more than 
 to advance his own. Those are accepted of God who prefer spiritual 
 blessings to temporal, and are more solicitous to be found in the way 
 of their duty than in the way to preferment. But that was not all; it 
 was a prevailing prayer, and prevailed for more than he asked.

 (1.) God gave him wisdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He fitted him for all that great work to which he had called him, gave
 him such a right understanding of the law which he was to judge by, and 
 the cases he was to judge of, that he was unequalled for a clear head, 
 a solid judgment, and a piercing eye.  Such an insight, and such a 
 foresight, never was prince so blessed with.

 (2.) He gave him riches and honour over and above into the bargain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and it was promised that in these he should as much exceed his
 predecessors, his successors, and all his neighbours, as in wisdom. 
 These also are God's gift, and, as far as is good for them, are 
 promised to all that <I>seek first the kingdom of God and the 
 righteousness thereof,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:33">Matt. vi. 33</A>.

 Let young people learn to prefer grace to gold in all that they choose,
 because <I>godliness has the promise of the life that now is,</I> but 
 <I>the life that now is</I> has not <I>the promise of godliness.</I> 
 How completely blessed was Solomon, that had both wisdom and wealth! He 
 that has wealth and power without wisdom and grace is in danger of 
 doing hurt with them; he that has wisdom and grace without wealth and 
 power is not capable of doing so much good with them as he that has 
 both. Wisdom is good, is so much the better, with an inheritance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:11">Eccles. vii. 11</A>.

 But, if we make sure of wisdom and grace, these will either bring
 outward prosperity with them or sweeten the want of it.  God promised 
 Solomon riches and honour absolutely, but long life upon condition

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>).

 <I>If thou wilt walk in my ways, as David did, then I will lengthen thy
 days.</I> He failed in the condition; and therefore, though he had 
 riches and honour, he did not live so long to enjoy them as in the 
 course of nature he might have done. Length of days is wisdom's 
 right-hand blessing, typical of eternal life; but it is in her left 
 hand that riches and honour are, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:16">Prov. iii. 16</A>.
 
 Let us see here,

 [1.] That the way to obtain spiritual blessings is to be importunate
 for them, to wrestle with God in prayer for them, as Solomon did for 
 wisdom, asking that only, as the <I>one thing needful.</I> 

 [2.] That the way to obtain temporal blessings is to be indifferent to
 them and to refer ourselves to God concerning them.  Solomon had wisdom 
 given him because he did ask it and wealth because he did not ask 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The grateful return Solomon made for the visit God was pleased to 
 pay him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 He awoke, we may suppose in a transport of joy, awoke, and <I>his sleep
 was sweet to him,</I> as the prophet speaks

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:26">Jer. xxxi. 26</A>);

 being satisfied of God's favour, he was satisfied with it, and he began
 to think <I>what he should render to the Lord.</I> He had made his 
 prayer at the high place at Gibeon, and there God had graciously met 
 him; but he comes to Jerusalem to give thanks <I>before the ark of the 
 covenant,</I> blaming himself, as it were, that he had not prayed 
 there, the ark being the token of God's presence, and wondering that 
 God had met him any where else. God's passing by our mistakes should 
 persuade us to amend them. There he,

 (1.) Offered a great sacrifice to God. We must give God praise for his
 gifts in the promise, though not yet fully performed. David used to 
 <I>praise God's word,</I> as well as his <I>works</I>

 and particularly,

 and Solomon trod in his steps. 

 (2.) He made a great feast upon the sacrifice, that those about him
 might rejoice with him in the grace of God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 Then came there two women, <I>that were</I> harlots, unto the
 king, and stood before him.
 &nbsp; 17 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in
 one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
 &nbsp; 18 And it came to pass the third day after that I was
 delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we <I>were</I>
 together; <I>there was</I> no stranger with us in the house, save we
 two in the house.
 &nbsp; 19 And this woman's child died in the night; because she
 overlaid it.
 &nbsp; 20 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me,
 while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid
 her dead child in my bosom.
 &nbsp; 21 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck,
 behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning,
 behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.
 &nbsp; 22 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living <I>is</I> my son,
 and the dead <I>is</I> thy son. And this said, No; but the dead <I>is</I>
 thy son, and the living <I>is</I> my son. Thus they spake before the
 king.
 &nbsp; 23 Then said the king, The one saith, This <I>is</I> my son that
 liveth, and thy son <I>is</I> the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but
 thy son <I>is</I> the dead, and my son <I>is</I> the living.
 &nbsp; 24 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a
 sword before the king.
 &nbsp; 25 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give
 half to the one, and half to the other.
 &nbsp; 26 Then spake the woman whose the living child <I>was</I> unto the
 king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my
 lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the
 other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, <I>but</I> divide <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 27 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child,
 and in no wise slay it: she <I>is</I> the mother thereof.
 &nbsp; 28 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had
 judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of
 God <I>was</I> in him, to do judgment.

 An instance is here given of Solomon's wisdom, to show that the grant 
 lately made him had a real effect upon him. The proof is fetched, not 
 from the mysteries of state and the policies of the council-board, 
 though there no doubt he excelled, but from the trial and determination 
 of a cause between party and party, which princes, though they devolve 
 them upon their judges, must not think it below them to take cognizance 
 of.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The case opened, not by lawyers, but by the parties themselves, 
 though they were women, which made it the easier to such a piercing eye 
 as Solomon had to discern between right and wrong by their own showing. 
 These two women were harlots, kept a public house, and their children, 
 some think, were born of fornication, because here is no mention of 
 their husbands. It is probable the cause had been heard in the inferior 
 courts, before it was brought before Solomon, and had been found 
 special, the judges being unable to determine it, that Solomon's wisdom 
 in deciding it at last might be the more taken notice of. These two 
 women, who lived in a house together, were each of them delivered of a 
 son within three days of one another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 They were so poor that they had no servant or nurse to be with them, so
 slighted, because harlots, that they had no friend or relation to 
 accompany them. One of them overlaid her child, and, in the night, 
 exchanged it with the other

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>),

 who was soon aware of the cheat put upon her, and appealed to public
 justice to be righted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 See,

 1. What anxiety is caused by little children, how uncertain their lives
 are, and to how many dangers they are continually exposed. The age of 
 infancy is the valley of the shadow of death; and the lamp of life, 
 when first lighted, is easily blown out. It is a wonder of mercy that 
 so few perish in the perils of nursing. 

 2. How much better it was in those times with children born in
 fornication than commonly it is now.  harlots then loved their 
 children, nursed them, and were loth to part with them; whereas now 
 they are often sent to a distance, abandoned, or killed.  But thus is 
 was foretold that <I>in the last days perilous times should come,</I> 
 when people should be without natural affection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:1,3">2 Tim. iii. 1, 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The difficulty of the case. The question was, Who was the mother of 
 this living child, which was brought into court, to be finally adjudged 
 either to the one or to the other? Both mothers were vehement in their 
 claim, and showed a deep concern about it. Both were peremptory in 
 their asseverations: "It is mine," says one. "Nay, it is mine," says 
 the other. Neither will own the dead child, though it would be cheaper 
 to bury that than to maintain the other: but it is the living one they 
 strive for.  The living child is therefore the parent's joy because it 
 is their hope; and may not the dead children be so? See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:17">Jer. xxxi. 17</A>.

 Now the difficulty of the case was that there was no evidence on either
 side. The neighbours, though it is probable that some of them were 
 present at the birth and circumcision of the children, yet had not 
 taken so much notice of them as to be able to distinguish them. To put 
 the parties to the rack would have been barbarous; not she who had 
 justice on her side, but she who was most hardy, would have had the 
 judgment in her favour. Little stress is to be laid on extorted 
 evidence. Judges and juries have need of wisdom to find out truth when 
 it thus lies hid.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The determination of it. Solomon, having patiently heard what both 
 sides had to say, sums up the evidence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 And now the whole court is in expectation what course Solomon's wisdom
 will take to find out the truth. One knows not what to say to it; 
 another, perhaps, would determine it by lot. Solomon calls for a sword, 
 and gives orders to divide the living child between the two contenders. 
 Now,

 1. This seemed a ridiculous decision of the case, and a brutal cutting
 of the knot which he could not untie. "Is this," think the sages of the 
 law, "the wisdom of Solomon?" little dreaming what he aimed at in it. 
 <I>The hearts of kings,</I> such kings, <I>are unsearchable,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:3">Prov. xxv. 3</A>.

 There was a law concerning the dividing of a living ox and a dead one.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:35">Exod. xxi. 35</A>),

 but that did not reach this case. But, 

 2. It proved an effectual discovery of the truth. Some think that
 Solomon did himself discern it, before he made this experiment, by the 
 countenances of the women and their way of speaking: but by this he 
 gave satisfaction to all the company, and silenced the pretender. To 
 find out the true mother, he could not try which the child loved best, 
 and must therefore try which loved the child best; both pretended to a 
 motherly affection, but their sincerity will be tried when the child is 
 in danger.

 (1.) She that knew the child was not her own, but in contending for it
 stood upon a point of honour, was well content to have it divided. She 
 that had overlaid her own child cared not what became of this, so that 
 the true mother might not have it: <I>Let it be neither mine nor thine, 
 but divide it.</I> By this it appeared that she knew her own title to 
 be bad, and feared Solomon would find it so, though she little 
 suspected she was betraying herself, but thought Solomon in good 
 earnest. If she had been the true mother she would not have forfeited 
 her interest in the child by agreeing so readily to this bloody 
 decision. But,

 (2.) She that knew the child was her own, rather than the child should
 be butchered, gives it up to her adversary. How feelingly does she cry 
 out, <I>O, my lord!  give her the living child,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 "Let me see it hers, rather than not see it at all." By this tenderness
 towards the child it appeared that she was not the careless mother that 
 had overlaid the dead child, but was the true mother of the living one, 
 that could not endure to see its death, having compassion on the son of 
 her womb. "The case is plain," says Solomon; "what need of witnesses?  
 <I>Give her the living child;</I> for you all see, by this undissembled 
 compassion, <I>she is the mother of it.</I>" Let parents show their 
 love to their children by taking care of them, especially by taking 
 care of their souls, and, with a holy violence, snatching them as 
 brands out of the burning.  Those are most likely to have the comfort 
 of children that do their duty to them. Satan pretends to the heart of 
 man, but by this it appears that he is only a pretender, that he would 
 be content to divide with God, whereas the rightful sovereign of the 
 heart will have all or none.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We are told what a great reputation Solomon got among his people by 
 this and other instances of his wisdom, which would have a great 
 influence upon the ease of his government: <I>They feared the king</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 highly reverenced him, durst not in any thing oppose him, and were
 afraid of doing an unjust thing; for they knew, if ever it came before 
 him, he would certainly discover it, <I>for they saw that the wisdom of 
 God was in him,</I> that is, that wisdom with which God had promised to 
 endue him. This <I>made his face to shine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:1">Eccl. viii. 1</A>.

 This <I>strengthened him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:19">Eccl. vii. 19</A>.

 This was better to him <I>than weapons of war,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:18">Eccl. ix. 18</A>.

 For this he was both feared and loved.</P>
