 This book, and that which follows it, bear the name of <I>Samuel</I> in
 the title, not because he was the penman of them (except of so much of 
 them as fell within his own time, to the twenty-fifth chapter of the 
 first book, in which we have an account of his death), but because the 
 first book begins with a large account of him, his birth and childhood, 
 his life and government; and the rest of these two volumes that are 
 denominated from him contains the history of the reigns of <I>Saul</I> 
 and <I>David,</I> who were both anointed by him. And, because the 
 history of these two kings takes up the greatest part of these books, 
 the Vulgar Latin calls them the <I>First</I> and <I>Second Books of the
 Kings,</I> and the two that follow the <I>Third</I> and <I>Fourth,</I> 
 which the titles in our English Bibles take notice of with an <I>alias: 
 otherwise called the First Book of the Kings,</I> &c. The LXX.  calls 
 them the first and second Book <I>of the Kingdoms.</I> It is needless 
 to contend about it, but there is no occasion to vary from the Hebrew 
 verity. These two books contain the history of the last two of the 
 judges, <I>Eli</I> and <I>Samuel,</I> who were not, as the rest, men of 
 war, but priests (and so much of them is an appendix to the book of 
 Judges), and of the first two of the kings, <I>Saul</I> and 
 <I>David,</I> and so much of them is an entrance upon the history of 
 the kings. They contain a considerable part of the sacred history, are
 sometimes referred to in the New Testament, and often in the titles of
 David's Psalms, which, if placed in their order, would fall in these
 books. It is uncertain who was the penman of them; it is probable that
 Samuel wrote the history of his own time, and that, after him, some of
 the prophets that were with David (Nathan as likely as any) continued
 it. This first book gives us a full account of Eli's fall and Samuel's
 rise and good government,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:1-8:22"><I>ch.</I> i.-viii.</A>

 Of Samuel's resignation of the government and Saul's advancement and
 mal-administration,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:1-15:35"><I>ch.</I> ix.-xv.</A>

 The choice of David, his struggles with Saul, Saul's ruin at last, and
 the opening of the way for David to the throne,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+16:1-31:13"><I>ch.</I> xvi.-xxxi.</A>

 And these things are written for our learning.</P>
