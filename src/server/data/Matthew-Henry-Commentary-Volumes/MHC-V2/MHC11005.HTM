 The great work which Solomon was raised up to do was the building of 
 the temple; his wealth and wisdom were given him to qualify him for 
 that. In this, especially, he was to be a type of Christ, for "he shall 
 build the temple of the Lord," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:12">Zech. vi. 12</A>.

 In this chapter we have an account of the preparations he made for that
 and his other buildings. Gold and silver his good father had prepared
 in abundance, but timber and stones he must get ready; and about these 
 we have him treating with Hiram king of Tyre. 

 I. Hiram congratulated him on his accession to the throne, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. Solomon signified to him his design to build the temple and desired
 him to furnish him with workmen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:2-6">ver. 2-6</A>.

 III. Hiram agreed to do it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 IV. Solomon's work was accordingly well done and Hiram's workmen were
 well paid,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he
 had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his
 father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.
 &nbsp; 2 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
 &nbsp; 3 Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an
 house unto the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God for the wars which were
 about him on every side, until the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> put them under the soles
 of his feet.
 &nbsp; 4 But now the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God hath given me rest on every side, <I>so
 that there is</I> neither adversary nor evil occurrent.
 &nbsp; 5 And, behold, I purpose to build a house unto the name of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto David my father, saying, Thy
 son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build
 a house unto my name.
 &nbsp; 6 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out
 of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto
 thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou
 shalt appoint: for thou knowest that <I>there is</I> not among us any
 that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.
 &nbsp; 7 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,
 that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed <I>be</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> this
 day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great
 people.
 &nbsp; 8 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the
 things which thou sentest to me for: <I>and</I> I will do all thy
 desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
 &nbsp; 9 My servants shall bring <I>them</I> down from Lebanon unto the
 sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that
 thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged
 there, and thou shalt receive <I>them:</I> and thou shalt accomplish
 my desire, in giving food for my household.

 We have here an account of the amicable correspondence between Solomon 
 and Hiram. Tyre was a famous trading city, that lay close upon the sea, 
 in the border of Israel; its inhabitants (as should seem) were none of 
 the devoted nations, nor ever at enmity with Israel, and therefore 
 David never offered to destroy them, but lived in friendship with them. 
 It is here said of Hiram their king that he was <I>ever a lover of 
 David;</I> and we have reason to think he was a worshipper of the true 
 God, and had himself renounced, though he could not reform, the 
 idolatry of his city. David's character will win the affections even of 
 those that are without. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Hiram's embassy of compliment to Solomon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He sent, as is usual among princes, to condole with him on the death of 
 David, and to renew his alliances with him upon his succession to the 
 government. It is good keeping up friendship and communion with the 
 families in which religion is uppermost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Solomon's embassy of business to Hiram, sent, it is likely, by 
 messengers of his own. In wealth, honour, and power, Hiram was very 
 much inferior to Solomon, yet Solomon had occasion to be beholden to 
 him and begged his favour. Let us never look with disdain on those 
 below us, because we know not how soon we may need them. Solomon, in 
 his letter to Hiram, acquaints him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. With his design to build a temple to the honour of God. Some think 
 that temples among the heathen took their first rise and copy from the 
 tabernacle which Moses erected in the wilderness, and that there were 
 none before that; however there were many houses built in honour of the 
 false gods before this was built in honour of the God of Israel, so 
 little is external splendour a mark of the true church. Solomon tells 
 Hiram, who was himself no stranger to the affair, 

 (1.) That David's wars were an obstruction to him, that he could not 
 build this temple, though he designed it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They took up much of his time, and thoughts, and cares, were a constant 
 expense to him and a constant employment of his subjects; so that he 
 could not do it so well as it must be done, and therefore, it not being 
 essential to religion, he must leave it to be done by his successor. 
 See what need we have to pray that God will <I>give peace in our 
 time,</I> because, in time or war, the building of the gospel temple 
 commonly goes on slowly.

 (2.) That peace gave him an opportunity to build it, and therefore he 
 resolved to set about it immediately: <I>God has given me rest</I> both 
 at home and abroad, and there is no adversary 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 no <I>Satan</I> (so the word is), no instrument of Satan to oppose it,
 or to divert us from it. Satan does all he can to hinder temple work

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:18,Zec+3:1">1 Thess. ii. 18; Zech. iii. 1</A>),

 but when he is bound 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:2">Rev. xx. 2</A>)

 we should be busy. When there is <I>no evil occurrent,</I> then let us
 be vigorous and zealous in that which is good and get it forward. When 
 the churches have rest let them be edified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:31">Acts ix. 31</A>.

 Days of peace and prosperity present us with a fair gale, which we must
 account for if we improve not. As God's providence excited Solomon to 
 think of building the temple, by giving him wealth and leisure, so his 
 promise encouraged him. God had told David that his <I>son should build 
 him a house,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He will take it as a pleasure to be thus employed, and will not lose 
 the honour designed him by that promise. It may stir us up much to
 good undertakings to be assured of good success in them. Let God's 
 promise quicken our endeavours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. With his desire that Hiram would assist him herein. Lebanon was the 
 place whence timber must be had, a noble forest in the north of Canaan, 
 particularly expressed in the grant of that land to Israel--<I>all
 Lebanon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:5">Josh. xiii. 5</A>.

 So that Solomon was proprietor of all its productions. The <I>cedars of
 Lebanon</I> are spoken of as, in a special manner, the <I>planting of 
 the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+109:16">Ps. cix. 16</A>),

 being designed for Israel's use and particularly for temple service. 
 But Solomon owned that though the trees were his the Israelites had not 
 <I>skill to hew timber</I> like the Sidonians, who were Hiram's 
 subjects. Canaan was <I>a land of wheat and barley</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:8">Deut. viii. 8</A>),

 which employed Israel in the affairs of husbandry, so that they were
 not at all versed in manufactures: in them the Sidonians excelled.
 Israel, in the things of God, are a <I>wise and understanding 
 people;</I> and yet, in curious arts, inferior to their neighbours.
 True piety is a much more valuable gift of heaven than the highest 
 degree of ingenuity. Better be an Israelite skilful in the law than a 
 Sidonian skilful to hew timber. But, the case being thus, Solomon 
 courts Hiram to send him workmen, and promises 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 both to <I>assist</I> them (<I>my servants shall be with thy
 servants,</I> to work under them), and to <I>pay</I> them (<I>unto thee 
 will I give hire for thy servants</I>); for the labourer, even in
 church-work, though it be indeed its own wages, <I>is worthy of his 
 hire,</I> The evangelical prophet, foretelling the glory of the church
 in the days of the Messiah, seems to allude to this story, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:1-22">Isa. 60</A>,

 where he prophesies,

 (1.) That the <I>sons of strangers</I> (such were the Tyrians and
 Sidonians) shall <I>build up the wall</I> of the gospel temple,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Ministers were raised up among the Gentiles for the edifying of the 
 body of Christ. 

 (2.) That <I>the glory of Lebanon</I> shall be brought to it to 
 <I>beautify it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 All external endowments and advantages shall be made serviceable to the 
 interests of Christ's kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Hiram's reception of, and return to, this message.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He received it with great satisfaction to himself: He <I>rejoiced 
 greatly</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 that Solomon trod in his father's steps, and carried on his designs,
 and was likely to be so great a blessing to his kingdom. In this 
 Hiram's generous spirit rejoiced, and not merely in the prospect he had 
 of making an advantage to himself by Solomon's employing him. What he 
 had the pleasure of he gave God the praise of: <I>Blessed be the Lord, 
 who has given to David</I> (who was himself a wise man) <I>a wise 
 son</I> to rule <I>over this great people.</I> See here,

 [1.] With what pleasure Hiram speaks of Solomon's wisdom and the extent
 of his dominion. Let us learn not to envy others either those secular 
 advantages or those endowments of the mind wherein they excel us. What 
 a great comfort it is to those that wish well to the Israel of God to 
 see religion and wisdom kept up in families from one generation to 
 another, especially in great families and those that have great 
 influence on others! where it is so, God must have the glory of it. If 
 to godly parents be given a godly seed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:15">Mal. ii. 15</A>),

 it is a token for good, and a happy indication that the entail of the
 blessing shall not be cut off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He answered it with great satisfaction to Solomon, granting him
 what he desired, and showing himself very forward to assist him in this 
 great and good work to which he was laying his hand. We have here his 
 articles of agreement with Solomon concerning this affair, in which we 
 may observe Hiram's prudence. 

 [1.] He deliberated upon the proposal, before he returned an answer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>I have considered the things.</I> It is common for those that make
 bargains rashly afterwards to wish them unmade again. The virtuous 
 woman <I>considers a field</I> and then <I>buys it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:16">Prov. xxxi. 16</A>.
 
 Those do not lose time who take time to consider.

 [2.] He descended to particulars in the articles, that there might be
 no misunderstanding afterwards, to occasion a quarrel. Solomon had 
 spoken of hewing the trees 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and Hiram agrees to what he desired concerning that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 but nothing had been said concerning carriage, and this matter
 therefore must be settled. Land-carriage would be very troublesome and
 chargeable; he therefore undertakes to bring all the timber down from 
 Lebanon by sea, a coasting voyage. Conveyance by water is a great 
 convenience to trade, for which God is to have praise, who taught man 
 that discretion. Observe what a definite bargain Hiram made. Solomon
 must appoint the place where the timber shall be delivered, and thither 
 Hiram will undertake to bring it and be responsible for its safety. As 
 the Sidonians excelled the Israelites in timber-work, so they did in 
 sailing; for Tyre and Sidon were <I>situate at the entry of the sea</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:3">Ezek. xxvii. 3</A>):

 they therefore were fittest to take care of the water-carriage.
 <I>Tractant fabrilia fabri--Every artist has his trade assigned.</I> 
 And, 

 [3.] If Hiram undertake for the work, and <I>do all Solomon's desire
 concerning the timber</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 he justly expects that Solomon shall undertake for the wages: "<I>Thou
 shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my household</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 not only for the workmen, but for my own family." If Tyre supply Israel
 with craftsmen, Israel will supply Tyre with corn,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+27:17">Ezek. xxvii. 17</A>.

 Thus, by the wise disposal of Providence, one country has need of
 another and is benefited by another, that there may be mutual 
 correspondence and dependence, to the glory of God our common 
 parent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees <I>according
 to</I> all his desire.
 &nbsp; 11 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat
 <I>for</I> food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil:
 thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
 &nbsp; 12 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and
 there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a
 league together.
 &nbsp; 13 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the
 levy was thirty thousand men.
 &nbsp; 14 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by
 courses: a month they were in Lebanon, <I>and</I> two months at home:
 and Adoniram <I>was</I> over the levy.
 &nbsp; 15 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare
 burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;
 &nbsp; 16 Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which <I>were</I> over the
 work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the
 people that wrought in the work.
 &nbsp; 17 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones,
 costly stones, <I>and</I> hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the
 house.
 &nbsp; 18 And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew <I>them,</I>
 and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to
 build the house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The performance of the agreement between Solomon and Hiram. Each of
 the parties made good his engagement.

 1. Hiram delivered Solomon the timber, according to his bargain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 The trees were Solomon's, but perhaps--<I>Materiam superabat opus--The 
 workmanship was of more value than the article.</I> Hiram is therefore 
 said to deliver the trees. 

 2. Solomon conveyed to Hiram the corn which he had promised him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Thus let justice be followed (as the expression is,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+16:20">Deut. xvi. 20</A>),

 justice on both sides, in every bargain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The confirmation of the friendship that was between them hereby. 
 <I>God gave Solomon wisdom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 which was more and better than any thing Hiram did or could give him;
 but this made Hiram love him, and enabled Solomon to improve his 
 kindness, so that they were both willing to ripen their mutual love 
 into a mutual league, that it might be lasting. It is wisdom to 
 strengthen our friendship with those whom we find to be honest and 
 fair, lest new friends prove not so firm and so kind as old ones.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The labourers whom Solomon employed in preparing materials for the 
 temple. 

 1. Some were Israelites, who were employed in the more easy and 
 honourable part of the work, felling trees and helping to square them, 
 in conjunction with Hiram's servants; for this he appointed 30,000, but 
 employed only 10,000 at a time, so that for one month's work they had 
 two months' vacation, both for rest and for the despatch of their own 
 affairs at home, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 It was temple service, yet Solomon takes care that they shall not be 
 over-worked. Great men ought to consider that their servants must rest 
 as well as they.

 2. Others were captives of other nations, who were to bear burdens and
 to hew stone 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and we read not that these had their resting times as the other had,
 for they were doomed to servitude.

 3. There were some employed as directors and overseers 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 3300 that ruled over the people, and they were as necessary and useful
 in their place as the labourers in theirs; here were many hands and
 many eyes employed, for preparation was now to be made, not only for
 the temple, but for all the rest of Solomon's buildings, at Jerusalem,
 and here in the forest of Lebanon, and in other places of his dominion,
 of which see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+9:17-19"><I>ch.</I> ix. 17-19</A>.

 He speaks of the vastness of his undertakings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:4">Eccl. ii. 4</A>,

 <I>I made me great works</I>), which required this vast number of
 workmen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The laying of the foundation of the temple; for that is the 
 building his heart is chiefly upon, and therefore he begins with that, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 It should seem, Solomon was himself present, and president, at the 
 founding of the temple, and that the first stone (as has been usual in 
 famous buildings) was laid with some solemnity. <I>Solomon commanded 
 and they brought costly stones</I> for the foundation; he would do 
 every thing like himself, generously, and therefore would have some of 
 the costliest stones laid, or buried rather, in the foundation, though, 
 being out of sight, worse might have served. Christ, who is laid for a 
 foundation, is an elect and precious stone 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:16">Isa. xxviii. 16</A>),

 and the foundations of the church are said to be <I>laid with
 sapphires,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:11">Isa. liv. 11</A>,
 
 compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:19">Rev. xxi. 19</A>.

 That sincerity which is our gospel perfection obliges us to lay our
 foundation firm and to bestow most pains on that part of our religion 
 which lies out of the sight of men.</P>
