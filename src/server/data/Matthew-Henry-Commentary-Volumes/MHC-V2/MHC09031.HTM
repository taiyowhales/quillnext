 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the foregoing chapter we had David conquering, yea, more than a
 conqueror. In this chapter we have Saul conquered and worse than a
 captive. Providence ordered it that both these things should be doing
 just at the same time. The very same day; perhaps, that David was
 triumphing over the Amalekites, were the Philistines triumphing over
 Saul. One is set over against the other, that men may see what comes of
 trusting in God and what comes of forsaking him. We left Saul ready to
 engage the Philistines, with a shaking hand and an aching heart, having
 had his doom read him from hell, which he would not regard when it was
 read him from heaven. Let us now see what becomes of him. Here is, 

 I.  His army routed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. His three sons slain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:2">ver. 2</A>.

 III.  Himself wounded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:3">ver. 3</A>),
 
 and slain by his own hand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:4">ver. 4</A>.

 The death of his armour-bearer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:5">ver. 5</A>)
 
 and all his men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:6">ver. 6</A>.

 IV. His country possessed by the Philistines, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:7">ver.  7</A>.

 His camp plundered, and his dead body deserted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:8">ver. 8</A>.

 His fall triumphed in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:9">ver.  9</A>.

 His body publicly exposed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:10">ver. 10</A>)

 and with difficulty rescued by the men of Jabesh-Gilead, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>.

 Thus fell the man that was rejected of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of
 Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in
 mount Gilboa.
 &nbsp; 2 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his
 sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and
 Melchi-shua, Saul's sons.
 &nbsp; 3 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
 him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.
 &nbsp; 4 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and
 thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and
 thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not;
 for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell
 upon it.
 &nbsp; 5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
 likewise upon his sword, and died with him.
 &nbsp; 6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and
 all his men, that same day together.
 &nbsp; 7 And when the men of Israel that <I>were</I> on the other side of
 the valley, and <I>they</I> that <I>were</I> on the other side Jordan, saw
 that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were
 dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came
 and dwelt in them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The day of recompence has now come, in which Saul must account for the 
 blood of the Amalekites which he had sinfully spared, and that of the 
 priests which he had more sinfully spilt; that of David too, which he 
 would have spilt, must come into the account. Now his day has come to 
 fall, as David foresaw, when he should descend into battle and perish, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+26:10"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 10</A>.
 
 Come and see the <I>righteous judgments of God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He sees his soldiers fall about him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Whether the Philistines were more numerous, better posted, and better
 led on, or what other advantages they had, we are not told; but it 
 seems they were more vigorous, for they made the onset; they fought 
 against Israel, and the Israelites fled and fell. The best of the 
 troops were put into disorder, and multitudes slain, probably those 
 whom Saul had employed in pursuing David. Thus those who had followed 
 him and served him in his sin went before him in his fall and shared 
 with him in his plagues.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He sees his sons fall before him. The victorious Philistines 
 pressed most forcibly upon the king of Israel and those about him. His 
 three sons were next him, it is probable, and they were all three slain 
 before his face, to his great grief (for they were the hopes of his 
 family) and to his great terror, for they were now the guard of his 
 person, and he could conclude no other than that his own turn would 
 come next. His sons are named 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and it grieves us to find Jonathan among them: that wise, valiant, good
 man, who was as much David's friend as Saul was his enemy, yet falls 
 with the rest. Duty to his father would not permit him to stay at home, 
 or to retire when the armies engaged; and Providence so orders it that 
 he falls in the common fate of his family, though he never involved 
 himself in the guilt of it; so that the observation of Eliphaz does not 
 hold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:7">Job iv. 7</A>),

 <I>Who ever perished being innocent?</I> For here was one. What shall
 we say to it? 

 1. God would hereby complete the vexation of Saul in his dying moments,
 and the judgment that was to be executed upon his house.  If the family 
 must fall, Jonathan, that is one of it, must fall with it.  

 2. He would hereby make David's way to the crown the more clear and
 open. For, though Jonathan himself would have cheerfully resigned all 
 his title and interest to him (we have no reason to suspect any other), 
 yet it is very probable that many of the people would have made use of 
 his name for the support of the house of Saul, or at least would have 
 come in but slowly to David. If Ish-bosheth (who was now left at home as 
 one unfit for action, and so escaped) had so many friends, what would 
 Jonathan have had, who had been the darling of the people and had never 
 forfeited their favour? Those that were so anxious to have a king like 
 the nations would be zealous for the right line, especially if that 
 threw the crown upon such a head as Jonathan's. This would have 
 embarrassed David; and, if Jonathan could have prevailed to bring in 
 all his interest to David, then it would have been said that Jonathan 
 had made him king, whereas God was to have all the glory. <I>This is 
 the Lord's doing.</I> So that though the death of Jonathan would be a 
 great affliction to David, yet, by making him mindful of his own 
 frailty, as well as by facilitating his accession to the throne, it 
 would be an advantage to him. 

 3. God would hereby show us that the difference between good and bad is
 to be made in the other world, not in this. <I>All things come alike to 
 all.</I> We cannot judge of the spiritual or eternal state of any by 
 the manner of their death; for in that <I>there is one event to the 
 righteous and to the wicked.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He himself is sorely wounded by the Philistines and then slain by 
 his own hand. The archers hit him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 so that he could neither fight nor fly, and therefore must inevitably
 fall into their hands.  Thus, to make him the more miserable, 
 destruction comes gradually upon him, and he dies so as to feel himself 
 die. To such an extremity was he now reduced that, 

 1. He was desirous to die by the hand of his own servant rather than by
 the hand of the Philistines, lest they should abuse him as they had 
 abused Samson.  Miserable man! He finds himself dying, and all his care 
 is to keep his body out of the hands of the Philistines, instead of 
 being solicitous to resign his soul into the hands of God who gave it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:7">Eccl. xii. 7</A>.

 As he lived, so he died, proud and jealous, and a terror to himself and
 all about him. Those who rightly understand the matter think it of 
 small account, in comparison, how it is with them in death, so it may 
 but be well with them after death. Those are in a deplorable condition 
 indeed who, being <I>bitter in soul, long for death, but it cometh 
 not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:20,21">Job iii. 20, 21</A>),
 
 especially those who, despairing of the mercy of god, like Judas, leap
 into a hell before them, to escape a hell within them. 

 2. When he could not obtain that favour he became his own executioner,
 thinking hereby to avoid shame, but running upon a heinous sin, and 
 with it entailing upon his own name a mark of perpetual infamy, as 
 <I>felo de se--a self-murderer.</I> Jonathan, who received his 
 death-wound from the hand of the Philistines and bravely yielded to the 
 fate of war, died on the bed of honour; but Saul died as a fool dieth, 
 as a coward dieth--a proud fool, a sneaking coward; he died as a man 
 that had neither the fear of God nor hope in God, neither the reason of 
 a man nor the religion of an Israelite, much less the dignity of a 
 prince or the resolution of a soldier. Let us all pray, <I>Lord, lead 
 us not into temptation,</I> this temptation. His armour-bearer would 
 not run him through, and he did well to refuse it; for no man's servant 
 ought to be a slave to his master's lusts or passions of any kind. The 
 reason given is that <I>he was sorely afraid,</I> not of death, for he 
 himself ran wilfully upon that immediately; but, having a profound 
 reverence for the king his master, he could not conquer that so far as 
 to do him any hurt; or perhaps he feared lest his trembling hand should 
 give him but half a blow, and so put him to the greater misery.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His armour-bearer who refused to kill him refused not to die with 
 him, but <I>fell likewise upon his sword,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 This was an aggravating circumstance of the death of Saul, that, by the
 example of his wickedness in murdering himself, he drew in his servant 
 to be guilty of the same wickedness, and <I>perished not alone in his 
 iniquity.</I> The Jews say that Saul's armour-bearer was Doeg, whom he 
 preferred to that dignity for killing the priests, and, if so, justly 
 does his <I>violent dealing return on his own head.</I> David had 
 foretold concerning him that God would <I>destroy him for ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:5">Ps. lii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The country was put into such confusion by the rout of Saul's army 
 that the inhabitants of the neighbouring cities (<I>on that side 
 Jordan,</I> as it might be read) quitted them, and the Philistines, for 
 a time, had possession of them, till things were settled in Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 to such a sad pass had Saul by his wickedness brought his country,
 which might have remained in the hands of the uncircumcised if David 
 had not been raised up to repair the breaches of it. See what a king he 
 proved for whom they rejected God and Samuel. They had still done 
 wickedly (it is to be feared) as well as he, and therefore <I>were 
 consumed both they and their king,</I> as the prophet had foretold 
 concerning them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:25"><I>ch.</I> xii. 25</A>.
 
 And to this reference is had long after.
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+13:10,11">Hos. xiii. 10, 11</A>,

 "<I>Where are thy saviours in all thy cities, of whom thou saidst, Give
 me a king and princes? I gave thee a king in my anger, and took him 
 away in my wrath;</I> that is, he was a plague to thee living and 
 dying; thou couldst expect no other."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came
 to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons
 fallen in mount Gilboa.
 &nbsp; 9 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and
 sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish <I>it
 in</I> the house of their idols, and among the people.
 &nbsp; 10 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they
 fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.
 &nbsp; 11 And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which
 the Philistines had done to Saul;
 &nbsp; 12 All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the
 body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of
 Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.
 &nbsp; 13 And they took their bones, and buried <I>them</I> under a tree at
 Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scripture makes no mention of the souls of Saul and his sons, what 
 became of them after they were dead (secret things belong not to us), 
 but of their bodies only.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How they were basely abused by the Philistines. The day after the 
 battle, when they had recovered their fatigue, they came to strip the 
 slain, and, among the rest, found the bodies of Saul and his three 
 sons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Saul's armour-bearer perhaps intended to honour his master by following
 the example of his self-murder, and to show thereby how well he loved 
 him; but, if he had consulted his reason more than his passions, he 
 would have spared that foolish compliment, not only in justice to his 
 own life, but in kindness to his master, to whom, by the opportunity of 
 survivorship, he might have done all the service that could be done him 
 by any man after he was dead; for he might, in the night, have conveyed 
 away his body, and those of his sons, and buried them decently. But 
 such false and foolish notions these vain men have (though they would 
 be wise) of giving and receiving honour. Nay, it should seem, Saul 
 might have saved himself the fatal thrust and have made his escape: for 
 the pursuers (in fear of whom he slew himself) came not to the place 
 where he was till the next day. But whom God will destroy he infatuates 
 and utterly <I>consumes with his terrors.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:5-21">Job xviii. 5</A>,

 &c. Finding Saul's body (which now that it lay extended on
 the bloody turf was distinguishable from the rest by its length, as it 
 was, while erect, by its height, when he proudly overlooked the 
 surrounding crowd), they will, in that, triumph over Israel's crown, 
 and meanly gratify a barbarous and brutish revenge by insulting the 
 deserted corpse, which, when alive, they had stood in awe of. 

 1. They cut off his head. Had they designed in this to revenge the
 cutting off of Goliath's head they would rather have cut off the head 
 of David, who did that execution, when he was in their country. They 
 intended it, in general, for a reproach to Israel, who promised 
 themselves that a crowned and an anointed head would save them from the 
 Philistines, and a particular reproach to Saul, who was taller by the 
 head than other men (which perhaps he was wont to boast of), but was 
 now shorter by the head. 
 
 2. They stripped him of his armour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 and sent that to be set up as a trophy of their victory, in the house
 of Ashtaroth their goddess

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);
 
 and we are told,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+10:10">1 Chron. x. 10</A>

 (though it is omitted here), that they fastened his head in the temple
 of Dagon. Thus did they ascribe the honour of their victory, not as 
 they ought to have done to the real justice of the true God, but to the 
 imaginary power of their false gods, and by this respect paid to 
 pretended deities shame those who give not the praise of their 
 achievements to the living God.  Ashtaroth, the idol that Israel had 
 many a time gone a whoring after, now triumphs over them. 

 3. They sent expresses throughout their country, and ordered public
 notice to be given in the houses of their gods of the victory they had 
 obtained

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 that public rejoicings might be made and thanks given to their gods.
 This David regretted sorely,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:20">2 Sam. i. 20</A>.

 <I>Tell it not in Gath.</I> 

 4. They fastened his body and the bodies of his sons (as appears,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 to the wall of <I>Beth-shan,</I> a city that lay not far from Gilboa and
 very near to the river Jordan. Hither the dead bodies were dragged and 
 here hung up in chains, to be devoured by the birds of prey. Saul slew 
 himself to avoid being abused by the Philistines, and never was royal 
 corpse so abused as his was, perhaps the more if they understood that 
 he slew himself for that reason. He that thinks to save his honour by 
 sin will certainly lose it. See to what a height of insolence the 
 Philistines had arrived just before David was raised up, who perfectly 
 subdued them. Now that they had slain Saul and his sons they thought 
 the land of Israel was their own for ever, but they soon found 
 themselves deceived. When God has accomplished his whole work by them 
 he will accomplish it upon them.  See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:6,7">Isa. x. 6, 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they were bravely rescued by the men of Jabesh-Gilead. Little 
 more than the river Jordan lay between Beth-shan and Jabesh-Gilead, and 
 Jordan was in that place passable by its fords; a bold adventure was 
 therefore made by the valiant men of that city, who in the night passed 
 the river, took down the dead bodies, and gave them decent burial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:11,13"><I>v.</I> 11, 13</A>.
 
 This they did,

 1. Out of a common concern for the honour of Israel, or the land of
 Israel, which ought not to be defiled by the exposing of any dead 
 bodies, and especially of the crown of Israel, which was thus profaned 
 by the uncircumcised. 

 2. Out of a particular sense of gratitude to Saul, for his zeal and
 forwardness to rescue them from the Ammonites when he first came to the 
 throne,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:1-27"><I>ch.</I> xi.</A>

 It is an evidence of a generous spirit and an encouragement to
 beneficence when the remembrance of kindnesses is thus retained, and 
 they are thus returned in an extremity. The men of Jabesh-Gilead would 
 have done Saul better service if they had sent their valiant men to him 
 sooner, to strengthen him against the Philistines. But his day had come 
 to fall, and now this is all the service they can do him, in honour to 
 his memory. We find not that any general mourning was made for the 
 death of Saul, as was for the death of Samuel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:1"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 1</A>),

 only those Gileadites of Jabesh did him honour at his death; for, 

 (1.) They made a burning for the bodies, to perfume them. So some
 understand the burning of them. They burnt spices over them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 And that it was usual thus to do honour to their deceased friends, at
 least their princes, appears by the account of Asa's funeral

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:14">2 Chron. xvi. 14</A>),

 that <I>they made a very great burning for him.</I> Or (as some think)
 they burnt the flesh, because it began to putrefy. 

 (2.) They buried the bodies, when, by burning over them, they had
 sweetened them (or, if they burnt them, they buried the bones and 
 ashes), under a tree, which served for a grave-stone and monument. And,

 (3.) They <I>fasted seven days,</I> that is, each day of the seven they
 fasted till the evening; thus they lamented the death of Saul and the 
 present distracted state of Israel, and perhaps joined prayers with 
 their fasting for the re-establishment of their shattered state. 
 Though, <I>when the wicked perish there is shouting</I> (that is, it is 
 to be hoped a better state of things will ensue, which will be matter 
 of joy), yet humanity obliges us to show a decent respect to dead 
 bodies, especially those of princes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This book began with the birth of Samuel, but now it ends with the 
 burial of Saul, the comparing of which two together will teach us to
 prefer the honour that comes from God before any of the honours which 
 this world pretends to have the disposal of.</P>
