 How solemnly the foundation of the temple was laid we read in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:1-13"><I>ch.</I> iii.</A>

 How slowly the building went on, and with how much difficulty, we found
 in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:1-5:17"><I>ch.</I> iv. and v.</A>

 But how gloriously the topstone was at length brought forth with
 shoutings we find in this chapter; and even we, at this distance of 
 time, when we read of it, may cry, "Grace, grace to it." As for God, 
 his work is perfect; it may be slow work, but it will be sure work. We 
 have here, 

 I. A recital of the decree of Cyrus for the building of the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. The enforcing of that decree by a new order from Darius for the 
 perfecting of that work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:6-12">ver. 6-12</A>.

 III.  The finishing of it thereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:13-15">ver. 13-15</A>.

 IV. The solemn dedication of it when it was built 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:16-18">ver. 16-18</A>),

 and the handselling of it (as I may say) with the celebration of the
 passover,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:19-22">ver. 19-22</A>.

 And now we may say that in Judah and Jerusalem things went well, very
 well.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in
 the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in
 Babylon.
 &nbsp; 2  And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that <I>is</I> in
 the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein <I>was</I> a record
 thus written:
 &nbsp; 3  In the first year of Cyrus the king <I>the same</I> Cyrus the king
 made a decree <I>concerning</I> the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the
 house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and
 let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof
 threescore cubits, <I>and</I> the breadth thereof threescore cubits;
 &nbsp; 4  <I>With</I> three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber:
 and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:
 &nbsp; 5  And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of
 God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which <I>is</I>
 at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought
 again unto the temple which <I>is</I> at Jerusalem, <I>every one</I> to his
 place, and place <I>them</I> in the house of God.
 &nbsp; 6  Now <I>therefore,</I> Tatnai, governor beyond the river,
 Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which <I>are</I>
 beyond the river, be ye far from thence:
 &nbsp; 7  Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of
 the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in
 his place.
 &nbsp; 8  Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of
 these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the
 king's goods, <I>even</I> of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith
 expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.
 &nbsp; 9  And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and
 rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven,
 wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the
 priests which <I>are</I> at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day
 without fail:
 &nbsp; 10  That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God
 of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
 &nbsp; 11  Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this
 word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up,
 let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill
 for this.
 &nbsp; 12  And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy
 all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter <I>and</I>
 to destroy this house of God which <I>is</I> at Jerusalem. I Darius
 have made a decree; let it be done with speed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, 

 I. The decree of Cyrus for the building of the temple repeated. To this 
 the Samaritans referred because the Jews pleaded it, and perhaps hoped 
 it would not be found, and then their plea would be over-ruled and a 
 stop put to their work.  Search was ordered to be made for it among the 
 records; for, it seems, the tribes had not taken care to provide 
 themselves with an authentic copy of it, which might have stood them in 
 good stead, but they must appeal to the original. It was looked for in 
 Babylon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 where Cyrus was when he signed it. But, when it was not found there,
 Darius did not make that a pretence to conclude that therefore there 
 was no such decree, and thereupon to give judgment against the Jews; 
 but it is probable, having himself heard that such a decree was 
 certainly made, he ordered the rolls in other places to be searched, 
 and at length it was found at Achmetha, in the province of the Medes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Perhaps some that durst not destroy it, yet hid it there, out of ill 
 will to the Jews, that they might lose the benefit of it. But 
 Providence so ordered that it came to light; and it is here inserted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>.

 1. Here is a warrant for the building of the temple: <I>Let the house 
 of God at Jerusalem,</I> yea, <I>let that house be built</I> (so it may 
 be read), within such and such dimensions, and with such and such 
 materials. 

 2. A warrant for the taking of the expenses of the building out of the 
 king's revenue, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 We do not find that they had received what was here ordered them, the
 face of things at court being soon changed.

 3. A warrant for the restoring of the vessels and utensils of the
 temple, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken away

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 with an order that the priests, the Lord's ministers, should return
 them all to their places in the house of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The confirmation of it by a decree of Darius, grounded upon it and 
 in pursuance of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The decree of Darius is very explicit and satisfactory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He forbids his officers to do any thing in opposition to the 
 building of the temple. The manner of expression intimates that he knew 
 they had a mind to hinder it: <I>Be you far hence</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 <I>let the work of this house of God alone,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Thus was the wrath of the enemy <I>made to praise God</I> and the
 remainder thereof did he restrain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He orders them out of his own revenue to assist the builders with 
 money, 

 [1.] For carrying on the building, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Herein he pursues the example of Cyrus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 [2.] For maintaining the sacrifices there when it was built, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He ordered that they should be supplied with every thing they wanted
 both for burnt-offerings and meat-offerings. He was content it should 
 be a rent-charge upon his revenue, and ordered it to be paid every day, 
 and this without fail, that they might offer sacrifices and prayers 
 with them (for the patriarchs, when they offered sacrifice, <I>called 
 on the name of the Lord,</I> so did Samuel, Elijah, and others) for the 
 life (that is, the happiness and prosperity) of the king and his sons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:10"><I>v.</I>  10</A>.

 See here how he gives honour, <I>First,</I> To Israel's God, whom he
 calls once and again the <I>God of heaven.  Secondly,</I> To his 
 ministers, in ordering his commissioners to give out supplies for the 
 temple service at the appointment of the priests.  Those that thought 
 to control them must now be, in this matter, at their command.  It was 
 a new thing for God's priests to have such an interest in the public 
 money. <I>Thirdly,</I> To prayer: <I>That they may pray for the life of 
 the king.</I> He knew they were a praying people, and had heard that 
 God was nigh to them in all that which they called upon him for.  He 
 was sensible he needed their prayers and might receive benefit by them, 
 and was kind to them in order that he might have an interest in their 
 prayers. It is the duty of God's people to pray for those that are in 
 authority over them, not only for the good and gentle, but also for the 
 forward; but they are particularly bound in gratitude to pray for their 
 protectors and benefactors; and it is the wisdom of princes to desire 
 their prayers, and to engage them. Let not the greatest princes despise 
 the prayers of the meanest saints; it is desirable to have them for us, 
 and dreadful to have them against us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He enforces his decree with a penalty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "Let none either oppose the work and service of the temple or withhold
 the supports granted to it by the crown upon pain of death. If any 
 alter this decree, let him be (<I>hanged before his own door</I> as we 
 say), hanged upon a beam of his own house, and, as an execrable man, 
 <I>let his house be made a dunghill.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He entails a divine curse upon all those kings and people that 
 should ever have any hand in the destruction of this house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 What he would not do himself for the protection of the temple he 
 desired that God, <I>to whom vengeance belongs,</I> would do. This 
 bespeaks him zealous in the cause; and though this temple was, at 
 length, most justly destroyed by the righteous hand of God, yet perhaps 
 the Romans, who were the instruments of that destruction, felt the 
 effects of this curse, for that empire sensibly declined ever 
 after.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. From all this we learn, 

 (1.) That the heart of kings is in the hand of God, and he turns it
 which way soever he pleases; what they are he makes them to be, for he 
 is <I>King of kings.</I>

 (2.) That when God's time has come for the accomplishing of his
 gracious purposes concerning his church he will raise up instruments to 
 promote them from whom such good service was not expected. <I>The earth 
 sometimes helps the woman</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:16">Rev. xii. 16</A>),

 and those are made use of for the defence of religion who have little
 religion themselves.

 (3.) That what is intended for the prejudice of the church has often,
 by the overruling providence of God, been made serviceable to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:12">Phil. i. 12</A>.

 The enemies of the Jews, in appealing to Darius, hoped to get an order
 to suppress them, but, instead of that, they got an order to supply 
 them. Thus <I>out of the eater comes forth meat.</I> The apocryphal 
 Esdras (or Ezra), <U>Book I. <I>ch.</I> iii. and iv.</U>, gives another 
 account of this decree in favour of the Jews, that Darius had vowed 
 that if ever he came to the kingdom he would build the temple at 
 Jerusalem, and that Zerubbabel, who was one of his attendants (whereas 
 it is plain here that he was now at Jerusalem), for making an ingenious 
 discourse before him on that subject (<I>Great is the truth and will 
 prevail</I>), was told to ask what recompence he would, and asked only
 for this order, in pursuance of the king's vow.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai,
 and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had
 sent, so they did speedily.
 &nbsp; 14  And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered
 through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the
 son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished <I>it,</I> according to
 the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the
 commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.
 &nbsp; 15  And this house was finished on the third day of the month
 Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the
 king.
 &nbsp; 16  And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites,
 and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the
 dedication of this house of God with joy,
 &nbsp; 17  And offered at the dedication of this house of God an
 hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a
 sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the
 number of the tribes of Israel.
 &nbsp; 18  And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites
 in their courses, for the service of God, which <I>is</I> at
 Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.
 &nbsp; 19  And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the
 fourteenth <I>day</I> of the first month.
 &nbsp; 20  For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all
 of them <I>were</I> pure, and killed the passover for all the children
 of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for
 themselves.
 &nbsp; 21  And the children of Israel, which were come again out of
 captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them
 from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 God of Israel, did eat,
 &nbsp; 22  And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy:
 for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the
 king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work
 of the house of God, the God of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. The Jews' enemies made their friends. When they received this order 
 from the king they came with as much haste to encourage and assist the 
 work as their predecessors had done to put a stop to it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:23"><I>ch.</I> iv. 23</A>.

 What the king ordered they did, and, because they would not be thought
 to do it with reluctance, they <I>did it speedily,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The king's moderation made them, contrary to their own inclination,
 moderate too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The building of the temple carried on, and finished in a little 
 time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 Now the <I>elders of the Jews built</I> with cheerfulness. For aught I
 know, the elders themselves laboured at it <I>with their own hands;</I> 
 and, if they did, it was no disparagement to their eldership, but an 
 encouragement to the other workmen.

 1. They found themselves bound to it <I>by the commandment of the God
 of Israel,</I> who had given them power that they might use it in his 
 service. 

 2. They found themselves shamed into it by the commandment of the
 heathen kings, Cyrus formerly, Darius now, and Artaxerxes some time 
 after. Can the elders of the Jews be remiss in this good work when 
 these foreign princes appear so warm in it? Shall native Israelites 
 grudge their pains and care about this building when strangers grudge 
 not to be at the expense of it? 

 3. They found themselves encouraged in it by the prophesying of Haggai
 and Zechariah, who, it is likely, represented to them (as bishop 
 Patrick suggests) the wonderful goodness of God in inclining the heart 
 of the king of Persia to favour them thus. And now the work went on so 
 prosperously that, in four hears' time, it was brought to perfection. 
 <I>As for God, his work is perfect.</I> The gospel church, that 
 spiritual temple, is long in the building, but it will be finished at 
 last, when the mystical body is completed. Every believer is a 
 <I>living temple, building up himself in his most holy faith.</I> Much 
 opposition is given to this work by Satan and our own corruptions. We 
 trifle, and proceed in it with many stops and pauses; but he that has 
 <I>begun the good work</I> will see it performed, and will <I>bring 
 forth judgment unto victory. Spirits of just men</I> will be <I>made 
 perfect.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The dedication of the temple. When it was built, being designed 
 only for sacred uses, <I>they showed by an example how it should be 
 used,</I> which (says bishop Patrick) is the proper sense of the word 
 <I>dedicate.</I> They entered upon it with solemnity and probably with 
 a public declaration of the separating of it from common uses and the 
 surrender of it to the honour of God, to be employed in his worship. 

 1.  The persons employed in this service were not only <I>the priests
 and Levites</I> who officiated, but <I>the children of Israel,</I> some 
 of each of the <I>twelve tribes,</I> though Judah and Benjamin were the 
 chief, and <I>the rest of the children of the captivity</I> or 
 <I>transportation,</I> which intimates that there were many besides the 
 children of Israel, of other nations, who transported themselves with 
 them, and became proselytes to their religion, unless we read it, 
 <I>even the remnant of the children of the captivity,</I> and then, we 
 may suppose, notice is hereby taken of their mean and afflicted 
 condition, because the consideration of that helped to make them devout 
 and serious in this and other religious exercises. A sad change! The 
 <I>children of Israel</I> have become <I>children of the captivity,</I> 
 and there appears but a remnant of <I>them,</I> according to that 
 prediction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:3">Isa. vii. 3</A>),

 <I>Shear-jashub--The remnant shall return.</I> 

 2.  The sacrifices that were offered upon this occasion were 
 <I>bullocks, rams, and lambs</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 for burnt-offerings and peace-offerings; not to be compared, in number,
 with what had been offered at the dedication of Solomon's temple, but, 
 being according to their present ability, they were accepted, for, 
 <I>after a great trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy, and 
 their deep poverty, abounded to the riches of their liberality,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:2">2 Cor. viii. 2</A>.

 These hundreds were more to them than Solomon's thousands were to him.
 But, besides these, they offered twelve he-goats for sin-offerings, one 
 for every tribe, to make atonement for their sins, which they looked 
 upon as necessary in order to the acceptance of their services. Thus, 
 by getting iniquity taken away, they would free themselves from that 
 which had been the sting of their late troubles, and which, if not 
 removed, would be a worm at the root of their present comforts. 

 3. This service was performed with joy.  They were all glad to see the
 temple built and the concerns of it in so good a posture. Let us learn 
 to welcome holy ordinances with joy and attend on them with pleasure. 
 Let us serve the Lord with gladness.  Whatever we dedicate to God, let 
 it be done with joy that he will please to accept of it. 

 4. When they dedicated the house they settled the household. Small
 comfort could they have in the temple without the temple service, and 
 therefore they <I>set the priests in their divisions</I> and <I>the 
 Levites in their courses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Having set up the worship of God in this dedication, they took care to
 keep it up, and made <I>the book of Moses</I> their rule, to which they 
 had an eye in this establishment.  Though the temple service could not 
 now be performed with so much pomp and plenty as formerly, because of 
 their poverty, yet perhaps it was performed with as much purity and 
 close adherence to the divine institution as ever, which was the true 
 glory of it. No beauty like the beauty of holiness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The celebration of the passover in the newly-erected temple. Now 
 that they were newly delivered out of their bondage in Babylon it was 
 seasonable to commemorate their deliverance out of their bondage in 
 Egypt. Fresh mercies should put us in mind of former mercies. We may 
 suppose that they had kept the passover, after a sort, every year since 
 their return, for they had an altar and a tabernacle. But they were 
 liable to frequent disturbances from their enemies, were straitened for 
 room, and had not conveniences about them, so that they could not do it 
 with due solemnity till the temple was built; and now they made a 
 joyful festival of it, it falling out in the next month after the 
 temple was finished and dedicated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 Notice is here taken,

 1. Of the purity of the priests and Levites that <I>killed the
 passover,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 In Hezekiah's time the priests were many of them under blame for not
 purifying themselves. But now it is observed, to their praise, that 
 <I>they were purified together, as one man</I> (so the word is); they 
 were unanimous both in their resolutions and in their endeavours to 
 make and keep themselves ceremonially clean for this solemnity; they 
 joined together in their preparations, that they might help one 
 another, so that all of them were pure, to a man. The purity of 
 ministers adds much to the beauty of their ministrations; so does their 
 unity.

 2. Of the proselytes that communicated with them in this ordinance:
 <I>All such as had separated themselves unto them,</I> had left their 
 country and the superstitions of it and cast in their lot with the 
 Israel of God, and had <I>turned from the filthiness of the heathen of 
 the land,</I> both their idolatries and immoralities, <I>to seek the 
 Lord God of Israel</I> as their God, did eat the passover. See how the 
 proselytes, the converts, are described. They separated themselves from 
 the filthiness of sin and fellowship with sinners, joined themselves 
 with the Israel of God in conformity and communion, and set themselves 
 to seek the God of Israel; and those that do so in sincerity, though 
 strangers and foreigners, are welcome to eat of the gospel feast, as 
 <I>fellow-citizens with the saints and of the household of God.</I> 

 3.  Of the great pleasure and satisfaction wherewith they <I>kept the
 feast of unleavened bread,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 <I>The Lord had made them joyful,</I> had given them both cause to
 rejoice and hearts to rejoice. It was now about twenty years since the 
 foundation of this temple was laid, and we may suppose the old men that 
 then wept at the remembrance of the first temple were most of them dead 
 by this time, so that now there were no tears mingled with their joys. 
 Those that are, upon good grounds, joyful, have therefore reason to be 
 thankful, because it is God that <I>makes them to rejoice.</I> He is 
 the fountain whence all the streams of our joy flow. God has promised 
 to all those who take hold of his covenant that <I>he will make them 
 joyful in his house of prayer.</I> The particular occasion they had for 
 joy at this time was that God had <I>turned the heart</I> of the 
 emperor to them, to <I>strengthen their hands.</I> If those that have 
 been, or who we feared would have been, against us, prove to be for us, 
 we may rejoice in it as a token for good, that <I>our ways please the 
 Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:7">Prov. xvi. 7</A>),
 
 and he must have the glory of it.</P>
