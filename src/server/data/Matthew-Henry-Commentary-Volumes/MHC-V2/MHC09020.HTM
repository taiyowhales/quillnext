 David, having several times narrowly escaped Saul's fury, begins to
 consider at last whether it may not be necessary for him to retire into
 the country and to take up arms in his own defence. But he will not do
 so daring a thing without consulting his faithful friend Jonathan; how
 he did this, and what passed between them, we have an account in this
 chapter, where we have as surprising instances of supernatural love as
 we had in the chapter before of unnatural hatred. 

 I. David complains to Jonathan of his present distress, and engages him
 to be his friend, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. Jonathan faithfully promises to get and give him intelligence how
 his father stood affected to him, and renews the covenant of friendship 
 with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:9-23">ver. 9-23</A>.

 III. Jonathan, upon trial, finds, to his grief, that his father was
 implacably enraged against David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:24-34">ver. 24-34</A>.

 IV. He gives David notice of this, according to the appointment between
 them,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before
 Jonathan, What have I done? what <I>is</I> mine iniquity? and what
 <I>is</I> my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?
 &nbsp; 2 And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold,
 my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will
 shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it
 <I>is</I> not <I>so.</I>
 &nbsp; 3 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly
 knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let
 not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly <I>as</I> the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth, and <I>as</I> thy soul liveth, <I>there is</I> but a step
 between me and death.
 &nbsp; 4 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth,
 I will even do <I>it</I> for thee.
 &nbsp; 5 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow <I>is</I> the new
 moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let
 me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third <I>day</I>
 at even.
 &nbsp; 6 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked
 <I>leave</I> of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for <I>there
 is</I> a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.
 &nbsp; 7 If he say thus, <I>It is</I> well; thy servant shall have peace:
 but if he be very wroth, <I>then</I> be sure that evil is determined
 by him.
 &nbsp; 8 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou
 hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with thee:
 notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for
 why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. David makes a representation to Jonathan of his present troubles. 
 While Saul lay bound by his trance at Naioth David escaped to the 
 court, and got to speak with Jonathan. And it was happy for him that he 
 had such a friend at court, when he had such an enemy on the throne. If 
 there be those that hate and despise us, let us not be disturbed at 
 that, for there are those also that love and respect us.  God hath set 
 the one over against the other, and so must we. Jonathan was a friend 
 that loved at all times, loved David as well now in his distress, and 
 bade him as welcome into his arms, as he had done when he was in his 
 triumph

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:1"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 1</A>),

 and he was <I>a brother that was born for adversity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:17">Prov. xvii. 17</A>.
 
 Now,

 1. David appeals to Jonathan himself concerning his innocency, and he
 needed not say much to him for the proof of it, only he desired him 
 that if he knew of any just offence he had given his father he would 
 tell him, that he might humble himself and beg his pardon: <I>What have 
 I done?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 2. He endeavors to convince him that, notwithstanding his innocency,
 Saul sought his life. Jonathan, from a principal of filial respect to 
 his father, was very loth to believe that he designed or would ever do 
 so wicked a thing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He the rather hoped so because he knew nothing of any such design, and
 he had usually been made privy to all his counsels. Jonathan, as became 
 a dutiful son, endeavored to cover his father's shame, as far as was 
 consistent with justice and fidelity to David. Charity is not forward 
 to think evil of any, especially of a parent,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:5">1 Cor. xiii. 5</A>.

 David therefore gives him the assurance of an oath concerning his own
 danger, swears the peace upon Saul, that he was in fear of his life by 
 him: "<I>As the Lord liveth,</I> than which nothing more sure in 
 itself, and as <I>thy soul liveth,</I> than which nothing more certain 
 to thee, whatever thou thinkest, <I>there is but a step between me and 
 death,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 And, as for Saul's concealing it from Jonathan, it was easy to account
 for that; he knew the friendship between him and David, and therefore, 
 though in other things he advised with him, yet not in that. None more 
 fit than Jonathan to serve him in every design that was just and 
 honourable, but he knew him to be a man of more virtue than to be his 
 confidant in so base a design as the murder of David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jonathan generously offers him his service 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Whatsoever thou desirest,</I> he needed not insert the proviso of
 lawful and honest (for he knew David too well to think he would ask any 
 thing that was otherwise), <I>I will even do it for thee.</I> This is 
 true friendship. Thus Christ testifies his love to us: <I>Ask, and it 
 shall be done for you;</I> and we must testify ours to him by keeping 
 his commandments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. David only desires him to satisfy himself, and then to satisfy him 
 whether Saul did really design his death or no. Perhaps David proposed 
 this more for Jonathan's conviction than his own, for he himself was 
 well satisfied. 

 1. The method of trial he proposed was very natural, and would
 certainly discover how Saul stood affected to him. The two next days 
 Saul was to dine publicly, upon occasion of the solemnities of the new 
 moon, when extraordinary sacrifices were offered and feasts made upon 
 the sacrifices. Saul was rejected of God, and the Spirit of the Lord 
 had departed from him, yet he kept up his observance of the holy 
 feasts. There may be the remains of external devotion where there is 
 nothing but the ruins of real virtue. At these solemn feasts Saul had 
 either all his children to sit with him, and David had a seat as one of 
 them, or all his great officers, and David had a seat as one of 
 <I>them.</I> However it was, David resolved his seat should be empty 
 (and that it never used to be at a sacred feast) those two days

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 
 and he would abscond till the solemnity was over, and put it upon this
 issue: if Saul admitted an excuse for his absence, and dispensed with 
 it, he would conclude he had changed his mind and was reconciled to 
 him; but if he resented it, and was put into a passion by it, it was 
 easy to conclude he designed him a mischief, since it was certain he 
 did not love him so well as to desire his presence for any other end 
 than that he might have an opportunity to do him a mischief, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 2.  The excuse he desired Jonathan to make for his absence, we have
 reason to think, was true, that he was invited by his elder brother to 
 Bethlehem, his own city, to celebrate this new moon with his relations 
 there, because, besides the monthly solemnity in which they held 
 communion with all Israel, they had now a yearly sacrifice, and a holy 
 feast upon it, for <I>all the family,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 They kept a day of thanksgiving in their family for the comforts they
 enjoyed, and of prayer for the continuance of them. By this it appears 
 that the family David was of was a very religious family, a house that 
 had a church in it.

 3. The arguments he used with Jonathan to persuade him to do this
 kindness for him were very pressing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 (1.) That he had entered into a league of friendship with him, and it
 was Jonathan's own proposal: <I>Thou hast brought thy servant into a 
 covenant of the Lord with thee.</I>

 (2.) That he would by no means urge him to espouse his cause if he was
 not sure that it was a righteous cause: "<I>If there be iniquity in 
 me,</I> I am so far from desiring or expecting that the covenant 
 between us should bind thee to be a confederate with me in that 
 iniquity that I freely release thee from it, and wish that my hand may 
 be first upon me: <I>Slay me thyself.</I>" No honest man will urge his 
 friend to do a dishonest thing for his sake.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew
 certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon
 thee, then would not I tell it thee?
 &nbsp; 10 Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what <I>if</I>
 thy father answer thee roughly?
 &nbsp; 11 And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into
 the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
 &nbsp; 12 And Jonathan said unto David, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, when I
 have sounded my father about to morrow any time, <I>or</I> the third
 <I>day,</I> and, behold, <I>if there be</I> good toward David, and I then
 send not unto thee, and shew it thee;
 &nbsp; 13 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please
 my father <I>to do</I> thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send
 thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> be with
 thee, as he hath been with my father.
 &nbsp; 14 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the
 kindness of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that I die not:
 &nbsp; 15 But <I>also</I> thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house
 for ever: no, not when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath cut off the enemies of David
 every one from the face of the earth.
 &nbsp; 16 So Jonathan made <I>a covenant</I> with the house of David,
 <I>saying,</I> Let the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> even require <I>it</I> at the hand of David's
 enemies.
 &nbsp; 17 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved
 him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
 &nbsp; 18 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow <I>is</I> the new moon:
 and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.
 &nbsp; 19 And <I>when</I> thou hast stayed three days, <I>then</I> thou shalt go
 down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself
 when the business was <I>in hand,</I> and shalt remain by the stone
 Ezel.
 &nbsp; 20 And I will shoot three arrows on the side <I>thereof,</I> as
 though I shot at a mark.
 &nbsp; 21 And, behold, I will send a lad, <I>saying,</I> Go, find out the
 arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows <I>are</I>
 on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for <I>there is</I>
 peace to thee, and no hurt; <I>as</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth.
 &nbsp; 22 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows
 <I>are</I> beyond thee; go thy way: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath sent thee away.
 &nbsp; 23 And <I>as touching</I> the matter which thou and I have spoken
 of, behold, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>be</I> between thee and me for ever.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Jonathan protests his fidelity to David in his distress.  
 Notwithstanding the strong confidence David had in Jonathan, yet, 
 because he might have some reason to fear that his father's influence, 
 and his own interest, should make him warp, or grow cool towards him, 
 Jonathan thought it requisite solemnly to renew the professions of his 
 friendship to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Far be it from thee</I> to think that I suspect thee of any crime
 for which I should either slay thee myself or deliver thee to my 
 father; no, if thou hast any jealousy of that, <I>Come let us go into 
 the field</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and talk it over more fully." He did not challenge him to the field to
 fight him for an affront, but to fix him in his friendship. He 
 faithfully promised him that he would let him know how, upon trial, he 
 found his father affected towards him, and would make the matter 
 neither better nor worse than it was. "If there be <I>good towards 
 thee,</I> I will <I>show it thee,</I> that thou mayest be easy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 if evil, I will <I>send thee away,</I> that thou mayest be safe"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 and thus he would help to deliver him from the evil if it were real and
 from the fear of evil if it were but imaginary. For the confirmation of 
 his promise he appeals to God, 
 
 1. As a witness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>O Lord God of Israel,</I> thou knowest I mean sincerely, and think
 as I speak." The strength of his passion made the manner of his 
 speaking concise and abrupt. 

 2. As a judge: "<I>The Lord do so and much more to Jonathan</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 if I speak deceitfully, or break my word with my friend." He expressed
 himself thus solemnly that David might be abundantly assured of his 
 sincerity. And thus God has confirmed his promises to us, that we might 
 have <I>strong consolation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:17,18">Heb. vi. 17, 18</A>.

 Jonathan adds to his protestations his hearty prayers: "<I>The Lord be
 with thee,</I> to protect and prosper thee, <I>as he has been</I> 
 formerly <I>with my father,</I> though now he has withdrawn." Thus he 
 imitates his belief that David would be in his father's place, and his 
 good wishes that he might prosper in it better than his father now 
 did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He provides for the entail of the covenant of friendship with David 
 upon his posterity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:14-16"><I>v.</I> 14-16</A>.

 He engages David to be a friend to his family when he was gone

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt</I> promise that thou wilt <I>not cut off thy kindness
 from my house for ever.</I> This he spoke from a natural affection he 
 had to his children, whom he desired it might go well with after his 
 decease, and for whose future welfare he desired to improve his present 
 interest. It also intimates his firm belief of David's advancement, and 
 that it would be in the power of his hand to do a kindness or 
 unkindness to his seed; for, in process of time, <I>the Lord would cut 
 off his enemies,</I> Saul himself was not expected; then "<I>Do not 
 thou cut off thy kindness from my house,</I> nor revenge my father's 
 wrongs upon my children." The house of David must likewise be bound to 
 the house of Jonathan from generation to generation; he <I>made a 
 covenant</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 <I>with the house of David.</I> Note, True friends cannot but covet to
 transmit to theirs after them their mutual affections. <I>Thy own 
 friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not.</I> This kindness, 

 1. He calls <I>the kindness of the Lord,</I> because it is such
 kindness as God shows to those he takes into covenant with himself; for 
 he is a God to them and to their seed; they are <I>beloved for the 
 fathers' sakes.</I> 
 
 2. He secures it by an imprecation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>The Lord require it at the hand of David's seed</I> (for of David
 himself he had no suspicion) if they prove so far David's enemies as to 
 deal wrongfully with the posterity of Jonathan, David's friend. He 
 feared lest David, or some of his, should hereafter be tempted, for the 
 clearing and confirming of their title to the throne, to do by his seed 
 as Abimelech had done by the sons of Gideon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:5">Judg. ix. 5</A>),

 and this he would effectually prevent; but the reason given 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 why Jonathan was so earnest to have the friendship entailed is purely
 generous, and has nothing of self in it; it was because <I>he loved him 
 as he loved his own soul,</I> and therefore desired that he and his 
 might be beloved by him. David, though now in disgrace at court and in 
 distress, was as amiable in the eyes of Jonathan as ever he had been, 
 and he loved him never the less for his father's hating him, so pure 
 were the principles on which his friendship was built. Having himself 
 sworn to David, he caused David to swear to him, and (as we read it) 
 <I>to swear again,</I> which David consented to (for he that bears an 
 honest mind does not startle at assurances), to swear by his love to 
 him, which he looked upon as a sacred thing. Jonathan's heart was so 
 much upon it that, when they parted this time, he concluded with a 
 solemn appeal to God: <I>The Lord be between me and thee for ever</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 that is, "God himself be judge between us and our families for ever, if
 on either side this league of friendship be violated." It was in 
 remembrance of this covenant that David was kind to Mephibosheth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+9:7,21:7">2 Sam. ix. 7; xxi. 7</A>.

 It will be a kindness to ourselves and ours to secure an interest in
 those whom God favours and to make his friends ours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He settles the method of intelligence, and by what signs and 
 tokens he would give him notice how his father stood affected towards 
 him. David would be missed the first day, or at least the second day, 
 of the new moon, and would be enquired after, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 On the third day, by which time he would have returned from Bethlehem,
 he must be at such a place

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and Jonathan would come towards that place with his bow and arrows to
 shoot for diversion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 would send his lad to fetch his arrows, and, if they were shot short of
 the lad, David must take it for a signal of safety, and not be afraid 
 to show his head

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 but, if he shot beyond the lad, it was a signal of danger, and he must
 shift for his safety, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 This expedient he fixed lest he should not have the opportunity, which
 yet it proved he had, of talking with David, and making the report by 
 word of mouth.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was
 come, the king sat him down to eat meat.
 &nbsp; 25 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, <I>even</I>
 upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by
 Saul's side, and David's place was empty.
 &nbsp; 26 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he
 thought, Something hath befallen him, he <I>is</I> not clean; surely
 he <I>is</I> not clean.
 &nbsp; 27 And it came to pass on the morrow, <I>which was</I> the second
 <I>day</I> of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said
 unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to
 meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?
 &nbsp; 28 And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked <I>leave</I> of
 me <I>to go</I> to Bethlehem:
 &nbsp; 29 And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a
 sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me <I>to
 be there:</I> and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me
 get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh
 not unto the king's table.
 &nbsp; 30 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said
 unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious <I>woman,</I> do not I
 know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own
 confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?
 &nbsp; 31 For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou
 shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and
 fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.
 &nbsp; 32 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,
 Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?
 &nbsp; 33 And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby
 Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.
 &nbsp; 34 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did
 eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for
 David, because his father had done him shame.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jonathan is here effectually convinced of that which he was so loth to 
 believe, that his father had an implacable enmity to David, and would 
 certainly be the death of him if it were in his power; and he had like 
 to have paid very dearly himself for the conviction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David is missed from the feast on the first day, but nothing is said 
 of him. <I>The king sat upon his seat,</I> to feast upon the 
 peace-offerings <I>as at other times</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 and yet had his heart as full of envy and malice against David as it
 could hold. He should first have been reconciled to him, and then have 
 come and offered his gift; but, instead of that, he hoped, at this 
 feast, to drink the blood of David. What an abomination was that 
 sacrifice which was brought with such a wicked mind as this! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:27">Prov. xxi. 27</A>.

 When the king came to take his seat Jonathan arose, in reverence to him
 both as a father and as his sovereign; every one knew his place, but 
 David's was empty. It did not use to be so. None more content than he 
 in attending holy duties; nor had he been absent now but that he must 
 have come at the peril of his life; self-preservation obliged him to 
 withdraw. In imminent peril present opportunities may be waived, nay, 
 we ought not to throw ourselves into the mouth of danger. Christ him 
 self absconded often, till he knew that his hour had come. But that day 
 Saul took no notice that he missed David, but said within himself, 
 "<I>Surely he is not clean,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Some ceremonial pollution has befallen him, which forbids him to eat of
 the holy things till he has <I>washed his clothes, and bathed his flesh 
 in water, and been unclean until the evening.</I>" Saul knew what 
 conscience David made of the law, and that he would rather keep away 
 from the holy feast than come in his uncleanness.  Blessed be God, no 
 uncleanness is now a restraint upon us, but what we may by faith and 
 repentance be washed from in the fountain opened, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:6">Ps. xxvi. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is enquired for the second day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Saul asked Jonathan, who he knew was his confidant, <I>Wherefore cometh
 not the son of Jesse to meat?</I> He was his own son by marriage, but 
 he calls him in disdain, <I>the son of Jesse.</I> He asks for him as if 
 he were not pleased that he should be absent from a religious feast; 
 and so it should be example to masters of families to see to it that 
 those under their charge be not absent from the worship of God, either 
 in public or in the family.  It is a bad thing for us, except in case 
 of necessity, to omit an opportunity of statedly attending on God in 
 solemn ordinances. Thomas lost a sight of Christ by being once absent 
 from a meeting of the disciples. But that which displeased Saul was 
 that hereby he missed the opportunity he expected of doing David a 
 mischief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Jonathan makes his excuse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>.

 1. That he was absent upon a good occasion, keeping the feast in
 another place, though not here, sent for by his elder brother, who was 
 now more respectful to him than he had been

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:28"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 28</A>),

 and that he had gone to pay his respects to his relations, for the
 keeping up of brotherly love; and no master would deny a servant 
 liberty to do that in due time. He pleads, 

 2. That he did not go without leave humbly asked and obtained from
 Jonathan, who, as his superior officer, was proper to be applied to for 
 it. Thus he represents David as not wanting in any instance of respect 
 and duty to the government.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Saul hereupon breaks out into a most extravagant passion, and rages 
 like a lion disappointed of his prey. David was out of his reach, but 
 he falls upon Jonathan for his sake 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>),

 gives him base language, not fit for a gentleman, a prince, to give to
 any man, especially his own son, heir apparent to his crown, a son that 
 served him, the greatest stay and ornament of his family, before a 
 great deal of company, at a feast, when all should be in good humour, 
 at a sacred feast, by which all irregular passions should be mortified 
 and subdued; yet he does in effect call him, 

 1. A bastard: <I>Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman;</I> that
 is, according to the foolish filthy language of men's brutish passion 
 now a day, "Thou son of a whore." He tells him he was born <I>to the 
 confusion of his mother,</I> that is, he had given the world cause to 
 suspect that he was not the legitimate son of Saul, because he loved 
 him whom Saul hated and supported him who would be the destruction of 
 their family. 

 2. A traitor: <I>Thou son of a perverse rebellion</I> (so the word is),
 that is, "thou perverse rebel." At other times he reckoned no 
 counsellor or commander that he had more trusty and well-beloved than 
 Jonathan; yet now in this passion he represents him as dangerous to his 
 crown and life. 

 3. A fool: <I>Thou hast chosen the son of Jesse</I> for thy friend
 <I>to thy own confusion,</I> for while he lives <I>thou shalt never be 
 established.</I> Jonathan indeed did wisely and well for himself and 
 family to secure an interest in David, whom Heaven had destined to the 
 throne, yet, for this, he is branded as most impolitic.  It is good 
 taking God's people for our people and going with those that have him 
 with them. It will prove to our advantage at last, however for the 
 present it may be thought a disparagement, and a prejudice to our 
 secular interest. It is probable Saul knew that David was anointed to 
 the kingdom by the same hand that anointed him, and then not Jonathan, 
 but himself, was the fool, to think to defeat the counsels of God. Yet 
 nothing will serve him but David must die, and Jonathan must fetch him 
 to execution. See how ill Saul's passion looks, and let it warn us 
 against the indulgence of any thing like it in ourselves. Anger is 
 madness, and <I>he that hates his brother is a murderer.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Jonathan is sorely grieved and put into disorder by his father's
 barbarous passion, and the more because he had hoped better things,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He was troubled for his father, that he should be such a brute,
 troubled for his friend, whom he knew to be a friend of God, that he 
 should be so basely abused; he was <I>grieved for David</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),
 
 and troubled for himself too, because <I>his father had done him
 shame,</I> and, though most unjustly, yet he must submit to it. One 
 would pity Jonathan to see how he was put, 

 1. Into the peril of sin.  Much ado that wise and good man had to keep
 his temper, upon such a provocation as this. His father's reflections 
 upon himself made no return to; it becomes inferiors to bear with 
 meekness and silence the contempts put upon them in wrath and passion. 
 <I>When thou art the anvil lie thou still.</I> But his dooming David to 
 die he could not bear: to that he replied with some heat

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 <I>Wherefore shall he be slain?</I> <I>What has he done?</I> Generous
 spirits can much more easily bear to be abused themselves than to hear 
 their friends abused.  

 2. Into the peril of death. Saul was now so outrageous that he threw
 his javelin at Jonathan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.
 
 He seemed to be in great care

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>)

 than Jonathan should be established in his kingdom, and yet now he
 himself aims at his life. What fools, what savage beasts and worse does 
 anger make men! How necessary it is to put a hook in its nose and a 
 bridle in its jaws! Jonathan was fully satisfied that evil was 
 determined against David, which put him out of frame exceedingly: he 
 <I>rose from table,</I> thinking it high time when his life was struck 
 at, and <I>would eat no meat,</I> for they were not to eat of the holy 
 things in their mourning. All the guests, we may suppose, were 
 discomposed, and the mirth of the feast was spoiled. <I>He that is 
 cruel troubles his own flesh,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>35  And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out
 into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad
 with him.
 &nbsp; 36 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which
 I shoot. <I>And</I> as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
 &nbsp; 37 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
 Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, <I>Is</I>
 not the arrow beyond thee?
 &nbsp; 38 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay
 not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his
 master.
 &nbsp; 39 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew
 the matter.
 &nbsp; 40 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto
 him, Go, carry <I>them</I> to the city.
 &nbsp; 41 <I>And</I> as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of <I>a
 place</I> toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and
 bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept
 one with another, until David exceeded.
 &nbsp; 42 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we
 have sworn both of us in the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for
 ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. Jonathan's faithful performance of his promise to give David notice
 of the success of his dangerous experiment. He went at the time and to 
 the place appointed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 within sight of which he knew David lay hid, sent his footboy to fetch
 his arrows, which he would shoot at random

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 and gave David the fatal signal by shooting an arrow beyond the lad

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 <I>Is not the arrow beyond thee?</I> That word [<I>beyond</I>] David
 knew the meaning of better than the lad.  Jonathan dismissed the lad, 
 who knew nothing of the matter, and, finding the coast clear and no 
 danger of a discovery, he presumed upon one minute's personal 
 conversation with David after he had bidden him flee for his life. 

 2.  The most sorrowful parting of these two friends, who, for aught
 that appears, never came together again but once, and that was by 
 stealth <I>in a wood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:16"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 16</A>.

 (1.) David addressed himself to Jonathan with the reverence of a
 servant rather than the freedom of a friend: <I>He fell on his face to 
 the ground, and bowed himself three times,</I> as one deeply sensible 
 of his obligations to him for the good services he had done him. 

 (2.) They took leave of each other with the greatest affection
 imaginable, with kisses and tears; they wept on each other's neck 
 <I>till David exceeded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 The separation of two such faithful friends was equally grievous to
 them both, but David's case was the more deplorable; for, when Jonathan 
 was returning to his family and friends, David was leaving all his 
 comforts, even those of God's sanctuary, and therefore his grief 
 exceeded Jonathan's, or perhaps it was because his temper was more 
 tender and his passions were stronger.

 (3.) They referred themselves to the covenant of friendship that was
 between them, both of them comforting themselves with this in this 
 mournful separation: "<I>We have sworn both of us in the name of the 
 Lord,</I> for ourselves and our heirs, that we and they will be 
 faithful and kind to each other from generation to generation." Thus, 
 while we are at home in the body and absent from the Lord, this is our 
 comfort, that he has <I>made with us an everlasting covenant.</I></P>
