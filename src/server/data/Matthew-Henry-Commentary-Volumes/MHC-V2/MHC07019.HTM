 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The three remaining chapters of this book contain a most tragical story 
 of the wickedness of the men of Gibeah, patronised by the tribe of 
 Benjamin, for which that tribe was severely chastised and almost 
 entirely cut off by the rest of the tribes.  This seems to have been 
 done not long after the death of Joshua, for it was when there was no 
 king, no judge, in Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:1,21:25">ver. 1, and <I>ch.</I> xxi. 25</A>),

 and Phinehas was then high priest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:28"><I>ch.</I> xx. 28</A>.

 These particular iniquities, the Danites' idolatry, and the Benjamites'
 immorality, let in that general apostasy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+3:7"><I>ch.</I> iii. 7</A>.

 The abuse of the Levite's concubine is here very particularly related.

 I.  Her adulterous elopement from him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. His reconciliation to her, and the journey he took to fetch her
 home, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:3">ver. 3</A>.

 III. Her father's kind entertainment of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:4-9">ver. 4-9</A>.

 IV.  The abuse he met with at Gibeah, where, being benighted, he was
 forced to stop. 
 
 1.  He was neglected by the men of Gibeah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:10-15">ver. 10-15</A>)

 and entertained by an Ephraimite that sojourned among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:16-21">ver. 16-21</A>.
 
 2.  They set upon him in his quarters, as the Sodomites did on Lot's
 quests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:22-24">ver. 22-24</A>.

 3.  They villainously forced his concubine to death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:25-28">ver.  25-28</A>.

 V. The course he took to send notice of this to all the tribes of 
 Israel,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass in those days, when <I>there was</I> no king
 in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side
 of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of
 Beth-lehem-judah.
 &nbsp; 2 And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away
 from him unto her father's house to Beth-lehem-judah, and was there
 four whole months.
 &nbsp; 3 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly
 unto her, <I>and</I> to bring her again, having his servant with him,
 and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's
 house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to
 meet him.
 &nbsp; 4 And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and
 he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and
 lodged there.
 &nbsp; 5 And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early
 in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's
 father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a
 morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.
 &nbsp; 6 And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them
 together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be
 content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be
 merry.
 &nbsp; 7 And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged
 him: therefore he lodged there again.
 &nbsp; 8 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart:
 and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee.
 And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.
 &nbsp; 9 And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine,
 and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said
 unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you
 tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here,
 that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on
 your way, that thou mayest go home.
 &nbsp; 10 But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and
 departed, and came over against Jebus, which <I>is</I> Jerusalem; and
 <I>there were</I> with him two asses saddled, his concubine also <I>was</I>
 with him.
 &nbsp; 11 <I>And</I> when they <I>were</I> by Jebus, the day was far spent; and
 the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us
 turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.
 &nbsp; 12 And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither
 into the city of a stranger, that <I>is</I> not of the children of
 Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.
 &nbsp; 13 And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to
 one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.
 &nbsp; 14 And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down
 upon them <I>when they were</I> by Gibeah, which <I>belongeth</I> to
 Benjamin.
 &nbsp; 15 And they turned aside thither, to go in <I>and</I> to lodge in
 Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the
 city: for <I>there was</I> no man that took them into his house to
 lodging.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The domestic affairs of this Levite would not have been related thus 
 largely but to make way for the following story of the injuries done 
 him, in which the whole nation interested themselves. Bishop Hall's 
 first remark upon this story is, <I>That there is no complain of a 
 public ordered state but there is a Levite at one end of it, either as 
 an agent or as a patient.</I> In Micah's idolatry a Levite was active; 
 in the wickedness of Gibeah a Levite was passive; <I>no tribe shall 
 sooner feel the want of government than that of Levi;</I> and, in all 
 the book of Judges, no mention is made of any of that tribe, but of 
 these two. This Levite was of Mount Ephraim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He married a wife of Bethlehem-Judah. She is called his 
 <I>concubine,</I> because she was not endowed, for perhaps he had 
 nothing to endow her with, being himself a sojourner and not settled; 
 but it does not appear that he had any other wife, and the margin calls 
 her <I>a wife, a concubine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:1"><I>v.</I>  1</A>.

 She came from the same city that Micah's Levite came from, as if 
 Bethlehem-Judah owed a double ill turn to Mount Ephraim, for she was as 
 bad for a Levite's wife as the other for a Levite.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. This Levite's concubine played the whore and eloped from her 
 husband, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The Chaldee reads it only that she <I>carried herself insolently to 
 him,</I> or <I>despised him,</I> and, he being displeased at it, <I>she 
 went away from him,</I> and (which was not fair) was received and 
 entertained at her father's house. Had her husband turned her out of 
 doors unjustly, her father ought to have pitied her affliction; but, 
 when she treacherously departed from her husband to embrace the bosom 
 of a stranger, her father ought not to have countenanced her sin. 
 Perhaps she would not have violated her duty to her husband if she had 
 not known too well where she should be kindly received. Children's ruin 
 is often owing very much to parents' indulgence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The Levite went himself to court her return. It was a sign there 
 was no king, no judge, in Israel, else she would have been prosecuted 
 and put to death as an adulteress; but, instead of that, she is 
 addressed in the kindest manner by her injured husband, who takes a 
 long journey on purpose to beseech her to be reconciled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 If he had put her away, it would have been a crime in him to return to 
 her again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:1">Jer. iii. 1</A>.

 But, she having gone away, it was a virtue in him to forgive the 
 offence, and, though the party wronged, to make the first motion to her 
 to be friends again. It is part of the character of the wisdom from 
 above that it is gentle and easy to be entreated. He spoke 
 <I>friendly</I> to her, or <I>comfortably</I> (for so the Hebrew phrase 
 of <I>speaking to the heart</I> commonly signifies), which intimates 
 that she was in sorrow, penitent fore what she had done amiss, which 
 probably he heard of when he came to fetch her back. Thus God promises 
 concerning adulterous Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:14">Hos. ii. 14</A>),

 <I>I will bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to 
 her.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Her father made him very welcome, and, by his extraordinary 
 kindness to him, endeavoured to atone for the countenance he had given 
 his daughter in withdrawing from him, and to confirm him in his 
 disposition to be reconciled to her. 

 1. He entertains him kindly, <I>rejoices to see him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 treats him generously for three days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 And the Levite, to show that he was perfectly reconciled, accepted his
 kindness, and we do not find that he upbraided him or his daughter with 
 what had been amiss, but was as easy and as pleasant as at his first 
 wedding-feast. It becomes all, but especially Levites, to forgive as 
 God does. Every thing among them gave a hopeful prospect of their 
 living comfortably together for the future; but, could they have 
 foreseen what befel them within one day or two, how would all their 
 mirth have been embittered and turned into mourning! When the affairs 
 of our families are in the best posture we ought to rejoice with 
 trembling, because we know not what troubles one day may bring forth.  
 We cannot foresee what evil is near us, but we ought to consider what 
 may be, that we may not be secure, as if to-morrow must needs be as 
 this day and <I>much more abundant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:12">Isa. lvi. 12</A>.

 2. He is very earnest for his stay, as a further demonstration of his 
 hearty welcome.  The affection he had for him, and the pleasure he took 
 in his company, proceeded,

 (1.) From a civil regard to him as his son-in-law and an ingrafted 
 branch of his own house. Note, Love and duty are due to those to whom 
 we are related by marriage as well as to those who are bone of our 
 bone: and those that show kindness as this Levite did may expect to 
 receive kindness as he did. And, 

 (2.) From a pious respect to him as a Levite, a servant of God's house; 
 if he was such a Levite as he should be (and nothing appears to the 
 contrary) he is to be commended for courting his stay, finding his 
 conversation profitable, and having opportunity to learn from him the 
 <I>good knowledge of the Lord,</I> hoping also that <I>the Lord will do 
 him good because he has a Levite</I> to be his son-in-law, and will 
 bless him for his sake. 

 [1.] He forces him to stay the fourth day, and this was kind; not 
 knowing when they might be together again, he engages him to stay as 
 long as he possibly could. The Levite, though nobly treated, was very 
 urgent to be gone. A good man's heart is where his business is; for 
 <I>as a bird that wanders from her nest so is the man that wanders form 
 his place.</I> It is a sign a man has either little to do at home, or 
 little heart to do what he has to do, when he can take pleasure in 
 being long abroad where he has nothing to do. It is especially good to 
 see a Levite willing to go home to his few sheep in the wilderness. Yet 
 this Levite was overcome by importunity and kind persuasion to stay 
 longer than he intended,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.

 We ought to avoid the extreme of an over-easy yielding, to the neglect 
 of our duty on the one hand, and that of moroseness and wilfulness, to 
 the neglect of our friends and their kindness on the other hand. Our 
 Saviour, after his resurrection, was prevailed upon to stay with his 
 friends longer than he at first intimated to be his purpose,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:28,29">Luke xxiv. 28, 29</A>.

 [2.] He forces him to stay till the afternoon of the fifth day, and
 this, as it proved, was unkind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 He would by no means let him go before dinner, promises him he shall 
 have dinner early, designing thereby, as he had done the day before, to 
 detain him another night; but the Levite was intent on the <I>house of 
 the Lord at Shiloh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 and, being impatient to get thither, would stay no longer. Had they set 
 out early, they might have reached some better lodging-place than that 
 which they were now constrained to take up with, nay, they might have 
 got to Shiloh. Note, Our friends' designed kindnesses often prove, in 
 the event, real injuries; what is meant for our welfare becomes a trap.  
 <I>Who knows what is good for a man in this life?</I> The Levite was 
 unwise in setting out so late; he might have got home better if he had 
 staid a night longer and taken the day before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. In his return home he was forced to lodge at Gibeah, a city in the 
 tribe of Benjamin, afterwards called <I>Gibeah of Saul,</I> which lay 
 on his road towards Shiloh and Mount Ephraim. When it drew towards 
 night, and the shadows of the evening were stretched out, they began to 
 think (as it behoves us to do when we observe the day of our life 
 hastening towards a period) where they must lodge. When night came they 
 could not pursue their journey. <I>He that walketh in darkness knoweth 
 not whither he goes.</I> They could not but desire rest, for which the 
 night was intended, as the day for labour. 

 1. The servant proposed that they should lodge in Jebus, afterwards 
 Jerusalem, but as yet in the possession of Jebusites. "Come," said the 
 servant, "let us lodge in this city of the Jebusites,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 And, if they had done so, it is probable they would have had much 
 better usage than they met with in Gibeah of Benjamin. Debauched and 
 profligate Israelites are worse and much more dangerous than Canaanites 
 themselves. But the master, as became one of God's tribe, would by no 
 means quarter, no, not one night, in a city of strangers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 not because he questioned his safety among them, but he was not 
 willing, if he could possibly avoid it, to have so much intimacy and 
 familiarity with them as a night's lodging came to, nor to be so much 
 beholden to them. By shunning this place he would witness against the 
 wickedness of those that contracted friendship and familiarity with 
 these devoted nations. Let Israelites, Levites especially, associate 
 with Israelites, and not with the <I>sons of the stranger.</I> 

 2.  Having passed by Jebus, which was about five or six miles from 
 Bethlehem (the place whence they came), and not having daylight to 
 bring them to Ramah, they stopped at Gibeah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:13-15"><I>v.</I> 13-15</A>);

 there they sat down in the street, nobody offering them a lodging. In 
 these countries, at that time, there were no inns, or public-houses, in 
 which, as with us, travellers might have entertainment for their money, 
 but they carried entertainment along with them, as this Levite did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and depended upon the courtesy and hospitality of the inhabitants for a 
 lodging. Let us take occasion hence, when we are in journeys, to thank 
 God for this, among other conveniences of travelling, that there are 
 inns to entertain strangers, and in which they may be welcome and well 
 accommodated for their money. Surely there is no country in the world 
 wherein one may stay at home with more satisfaction, or go abroad with 
 more comfort, than in our own nation. This traveller, though a Levite 
 (and to those of that tribe God had particularly commanded his people 
 to be kind upon all occasions), met with very cold entertainment at 
 Gibeah: <I>No man took them into his house.</I> If they had any reason 
 to think he was a Levite perhaps that made those ill-disposed people 
 the more shy of him. There are those who will have this laid to their 
 charge at the great day, <I>I was a stranger and you took me not 
 in.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the
 field at even, which <I>was</I> also of mount Ephraim; and he
 sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place <I>were</I> Benjamites.
 &nbsp; 17 And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man
 in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest
 thou? and whence comest thou?
 &nbsp; 18 And he said unto him, We <I>are</I> passing from Beth-lehem-judah
 toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence <I>am</I> I: and I went
 to Beth-lehem-judah, but I <I>am now</I> going to the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 and there <I>is</I> no man that receiveth me to house.
 &nbsp; 19 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and
 there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and
 for the young man <I>which is</I> with thy servants: <I>there is</I> no
 want of any thing.
 &nbsp; 20 And the old man said, Peace <I>be</I> with thee; howsoever <I>let</I>
 all thy wants <I>lie</I> upon me; only lodge not in the street.
 &nbsp; 21 So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto
 the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though there as not one <I>of</I> Gibeah, yet it proved there was one 
 <I>in</I> Gibeah, that showed some civility to this distressed Levite, 
 who was glad that any one took notice of him. It was strange that some 
 of those wicked people, who, when it was dark, designed so ill to him 
 and his concubine, did not, under pretence of kindness, invite them in, 
 that they might have a fairer opportunity of perpetrating their 
 villany; but either they had not wit enough to be so designing, or not 
 wickedness enough to be so deceiving. Or, perhaps, none of them 
 separately thought of such a wickedness, till in the black and dark 
 night they got together to contrive what mischief they should do. Bad 
 people in confederacy make one another much worse than any of them 
 would be by themselves. When the Levite, and his wife, and servant, 
 were beginning to fear that they must lie in the street all night (and 
 as good have laid in a den of lions) they were at length invited into a 
 house, and we are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who that kind man was that invited them. 

 1. He was a man of Mount Ephraim, and only sojourned in Gibeah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Of all the tribes of Israel, the Benjamites had most reason to be kind 
 to poor travellers, for their ancestor, Benjamin, was born upon the 
 road, his mother being then upon a journey, and very near to this 
 place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:16,17">Gen. xxxv. 16, 17</A>.

 Yet they were hard-hearted to a traveller in distress, while an honest
 Ephraimite had compassion on him, and, no doubt, was the more kind to 
 him, when, upon enquiry, he found that he was his countryman, of Mount 
 Ephraim likewise. He that was himself but a sojourner in Gibeah was the 
 more compassionate to a wayfaring man, for he <I>knew the heart of a 
 stranger,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:9,De+10:19">Exod. xxiii. 9; Deut. x. 19</A>.

 Good people, that look upon themselves but as strangers and sojourners
 in this world, should for this reason be tender to one another, because 
 they all belong to the same better country and are not at home here. 

 2.  He was an old man, one that retained some of the expiring virtue of 
 an Israelite. The rising generation was entirely corrupted; if there 
 was any good remaining among them, it was only with those that were old 
 and going off. 

 3. He was coming home from his work out of the field at eventide. The 
 evening calls home labourers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:23">Ps. civ. 23</A>.

 But, it should seem, this was the only labourer that this evening 
 brought home to Gibeah. The rest had given themselves up to sloth and 
 luxury, and no marvel there was among them, as in Sodom, abundance of 
 uncleanness, when there was among them, as in Sodom, abundance of 
 idleness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:49">Ezek. xvi. 49</A>.

 But he that was honestly diligent in his business all day was disposed
 to be generously hospitable to these poor strangers at night. Let men 
 <I>labour, that they may have to give,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:28">Eph. iv. 28</A>.
 
 It appears from
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>

 that he was a man of some substance, and yet had been himself at work 
 in the field. No man's estate will privilege him in idleness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How free and generous he was in his invitation. He did not stay 
 till they applied to him to beg for a night's lodging; but when he saw 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 enquired into their circumstances, and anticipated them with his 
 kindness. Thus our good God answers before we call. Note, A charitable 
 disposition expects only opportunity, not importunity, to do good, and 
 will succour upon sight, unsought unto. Hence we read of a <I>bountiful 
 eye,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:9">Prov. xxii. 9</A>.

 If Gibeah was like Sodom, this old man was like Lot in Sodom, who 
 <I>sat in the gate</I> to invite strangers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:1">Gen. xix. 1</A>.

 Thus <I>Job opened his doors to the traveller,</I> and would not suffer 
 him to <I>lodge in the street,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:32">Job xxxi. 32</A>.
 
 Observe,

 1. How ready he was to give credit to the Levite's account of himself 
 when he saw no reason at all to question the truth of it. Charity is 
 not apt to distrust, but <I>hopeth all things</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:7">1 Cor. xiii. 7</A>)

 and will not make use of Nabal's excuse for his churlishness to David,
 <I>Many servants now-a-days break away from their masters,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:10">1 Sam. xxv. 10</A>.

 The Levite, in his account of himself, professed that he was now going
 <I>to the house of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:18"><I>v.</I>  18</A>),

 for there he designed to attend, either with a trespass-offering for 
 the sins of his family, or with a peace-offering for the mercies of his 
 family, or both, before he went to his own house. And, if the men of 
 Gibeah had any intimation of his being bound that way, probably they 
 would therefore be disinclined to entertain him. The Samaritans would 
 not receive Christ because his face was towards Jerusalem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:53">Luke ix. 53</A>.

 But for this reason, because he was a Levite and was now going to the
 house of the Lord, this good old man was the more kind to him. Thus he 
 received a disciples <I>in the name of a disciple,</I> a servant of God 
 for his Master's sake. 

 2. How free he was to give him entertainment.  The Levite was himself 
 provided with all necessaries

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 wanted nothing but a lodging, but his generous host would be himself at 
 the charge of his entertainment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Let all thy wants be upon me;</I> so he <I>brought him into his 
 house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Thus God will, some way or other, raise up friends for his people and 
 ministers, even when they seem forlorn.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 <I>Now</I> as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the
 men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round
 about, <I>and</I> beat at the door, and spake to the master of the
 house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into
 thine house, that we may know him.
 &nbsp; 23 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them,
 and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, <I>nay,</I> I pray you, do not
 <I>so</I> wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do
 not this folly.
 &nbsp; 24 Behold, <I>here is</I> my daughter a maiden, and his concubine;
 them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them
 what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a
 thing.
 &nbsp; 25 But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his
 concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her,
 and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day
 began to spring, they let her go.
 &nbsp; 26 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down
 at the door of the man's house where her lord <I>was,</I> till it was
 light.
 &nbsp; 27 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of
 the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his
 concubine was fallen down <I>at</I> the door of the house, and her
 hands <I>were</I> upon the threshold.
 &nbsp; 28 And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none
 answered. Then the man took her <I>up</I> upon an ass, and the man
 rose up, and gat him unto his place.
 &nbsp; 29 And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and
 laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, <I>together</I> with her
 bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 30 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such
 deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came
 up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take
 advice, and speak <I>your minds.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The great wickedness of the men of Gibeah. One could not imagine 
 that ever it should enter into the heart of men that had the use of 
 human reason, of Israelites that had the benefit of divine revelation, 
 to be so very wicked. "Lord, what is man!" said David, "what a 
 <I>mean</I> creature is he!" "Lord, what is man," may we say upon the 
 reading of this story, "what a vile creature is he, when he is given up 
 to his own heart's lusts!" The sinners are here called <I>sons of 
 Belial,</I> that is, ungovernable men, men that would endure no yoke, 
 children of the devil (for he is Belial), resembling him, and joining 
 with him in rebellion against God and his government. Sons of Benjamin, 
 of whom Moses had said, <I>The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in 
 safety by him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:12">Deut. xxxiii. 12</A>),

 have become such sons of Belial that an honest man cannot lodge in
 safety among them. The sufferers were a Levite and his wife, and that 
 kind man that gave them entertainment. We are strangers upon earth, and 
 must expect strange usage. It is said <I>they were making their hearts 
 merry</I> when this trouble came upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 If the mirth was innocent, it teaches us of what uncertain continuance 
 all our creature comforts and enjoyments are; when we are ever so well 
 pleased with our friends, we know not how near our enemies are; nor, if 
 it be well with us this hour, can we be sure it will be so the next. If 
 the mirth was sinful and excessive, let it be a warning to us to keep a 
 strict guard upon ourselves, that we grow not intemperate in the use of 
 lawful things, nor be transported into indecencies by our cheerfulness; 
 for <I>the end of that mirth is heaviness.</I> God can soon change the 
 note of those that are making their hearts merry, and turn their 
 laughter into mourning and their joy into heaviness. Let us see what 
 the wickedness of these Benjamites was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They made a rude and insolent assault, in the night, upon the 
 habitation of an honest man, that not only lived peaceably among them, 
 but kept a good house and was a blessing and ornament to their city. 
 They beset the house round, and, to the great terror of those within, 
 beat as hard as they could at the door, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 A man's house is his castle, in which he ought to be both safe and 
 quiet, and, where there is law, it is taken under the special 
 protection of it; but there was no king in Israel to keep the peace and 
 secure honest men from the sons of violence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They had a particular spite at the strangers that were within their 
 gates, that only desired a night's lodging among them, contrary to the 
 laws of hospitality, which all civilized nations have accounted sacred, 
 and which the master of the house pleaded with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Seeing that this man has come into my house.</I> Those are base and 
 abject spirits indeed that will trample upon the helpless, and use a 
 man the worse for his being a stranger, whom they know no ill of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They designed in the most filthy and abominable manner (not to be 
 thought of without horror and detestation) to abuse the Levite, whom 
 perhaps they had observed to be young and comely: <I>Bring him forth 
 that we may know him.</I> We should certainly have concluded they meant 
 only to enquire whence he came, and to know his character, but that the 
 good man of the house, who understood their meaning too well, by his 
 answer lets us know that they designed the gratification of that most 
 unnatural and worse than brutish lust which was expressly forbidden by 
 the law of Moses, and called an <I>abomination,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:22">Lev. xviii. 22</A>.

 Those that are guilty of it are ranked in the New Testament among the 
 worst and vilest of sinners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+1:10">1 Tim. i. 10</A>),

 and such as <I>shall not inherit the kingdom of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:9">1 Cor. vi. 9</A>.

 Now, 

 (1.) This was the sin of Sodom, and is thence called <I>Sodomy.</I> The 
 Dead Sea, which was the standing monument of God's vengeance upon 
 Sodom, for its filthiness, was one of the boundaries of Canaan, and lay 
 not many miles off from Gibeah. We may suppose the men of Gibeah had 
 seen it many a time, and yet would not take warning by it, but did 
 worse than Sodom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:48">Ezek. xvi. 48</A>),

 and sinned just <I>after the similitude of their transgression.</I> Who
 would have expected (says bishop Hall) such extreme abomination to come 
 out of the loins of Jacob? Even the worst pagans were saints to them. 
 What did it avail them that they had the ark of God in Shiloh when they 
 had Sodom in their streets--God's law in their fringes, but the devil 
 in their hearts? Nothing but hell itself can yield a worse creature 
 than a depraved Israelite. 

 (2.) This was the punishment of their idolatry, that sin to which they 
 were, above all others, most addicted.  Because they liked not to 
 retain God in their knowledge, therefore he gave them up to these vile 
 affections, by which they dishonoured themselves as they had by their 
 idolatry dishonoured him and turned his glory into shame, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:24,28">Rom. i. 24, 28</A>.

 See and admire, in this instance, the patience of God. Why were not
 these sons of Belial struck blind, as the Sodomites were? Why were not 
 fire and brimstone rained from heaven upon their city? It was because 
 God would leave it to Israel to punish them by the sword, and would 
 reserve his own punishment of them for the future state, in which those 
 that <I>go after strange flesh</I> shall <I>suffer the vengeance of 
 eternal fire,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:7">Jude 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They were deaf to the reproofs and reasoning of the good man of the 
 house, who, being well acquainted (we may suppose) with the story of 
 Lot and the Sodomites, set himself to imitate Lot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.
 
 Compare
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+19:6-8">Gen. xix. 6-8</A>.

 He went out to them as Lot did, spoke civilly to them, called them 
 brethren, begged of them to desist, pleaded the protection of his house 
 which his guests were under, and represented to them the great 
 wickedness of their attempt: "Do not so wickedly, so very wickedly." He 
 calls it <I>folly</I> and <I>a vile thing.</I> But in one thing he 
 conformed too far to Lot's example (as we are apt in imitating good men 
 to follow them even in their false steps), in offering them his 
 daughter to do what they would with. He had not power thus to 
 prostitute his daughter, nor ought he to have done this evil that good 
 might come. But this wicked proposal of his may be in part excused from 
 the great surprise and terror he was in, his concern for his guests, 
 and his having too close a regard to what Lot did in the like case, 
 especially not finding that the angels who were by reproved him for it.  
 And perhaps he hoped that his mentioning this as a more natural 
 gratification of their lust would have sent them back to their common 
 harlots. But <I>they would not hearken to him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Headstrong lusts are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear; they 
 sear the conscience and make it insensible.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They got the Levite's wife among them, and abused her to death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 They slighted the old man's offer of his daughter to their lust, either 
 because she was not handsome or because they knew her to be one of 
 great gravity and modesty: but, when the Levite brought them his 
 concubine, they took her with them by force to the place appointed for 
 their filthiness. Josephus, in his narrative of this story, makes her 
 to be the person they had a design upon when they beset the house, and 
 says nothing of their villainous design upon the Levite himself. They 
 saw her (he says) in the street, when they came into the town, and were 
 smitten with her beauty; and perhaps, though she was reconciled to her 
 husband, her looks did not bespeak her to be one of the most modest.  
 Many bring mischief of this kind upon themselves by their loose 
 carriage and behaviour; a little spark may kindle a great fire. One 
 would think the Levite should have followed them, to see what became of 
 his wife, but it is probable he durst not, lest they should do him a 
 mischief. In the miserable end of this woman, we may see the righteous 
 hand of God punishing her for her former uncleanness, when she played 
 the whore against her husband, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Though her father had countenanced her, her husband had forgiven her, 
 and the fault was forgotten now that the quarrel was made up, yet God 
 remembered it against her when he suffered these wicked men thus 
 wretchedly to abuse her; how unrighteous soever they were in their 
 treatment of her, in permitting it the Lord was righteous. Her 
 punishment answered her sin, <I>Culpa libido fuit, poena libido 
 fuit--Lust was her sin, and lust was her punishment.</I> By the law of 
 Moses she was to have been put to death for her adultery.  She escaped 
 that punishment from men, yet vengeance pursued her; for, if there was 
 no king in Israel, yet there was a God in Israel, a God that judgeth in 
 the earth. We must not think it enough to make our peace with men, whom 
 by our sins we have wronged, but are concerned, by repentance and 
 faith, to make our peace with God, who sees not as men see, nor makes 
 so light of sin as men often do. The justice of God in this matter does 
 not at all extenuate the horrid wickedness of these men of Gibeah, than 
 which nothing could be more barbarous and inhuman.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The notice that was sent of this wickedness to all the tribes of 
 Israel. The poor abused woman made towards her husband's lodgings as 
 soon as ever the approach of the day-light obliged these sons of Belial 
 to let her go (for these works of darkness hate and dread the light), 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Down she fell at the door, with her hands on the threshold, begging 
 pardon (as it were) for her former transgression, and in that posture 
 of a penitent, with her mouth in the dust, she expired. There he found 
 her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:26,27"><I>v.</I>  26, 27</A>),

 supposed her asleep, or overcome with shame and confusion for what had 
 happened, but soon perceived she was dead 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 took up her dead body, which, we may suppose, had all over it marks of 
 the hands, the blows, and other abuses, she had received. On this sad 
 occasion he waived his purpose of going to Shiloh, and went directly 
 home. He that went out in hopes to return rejoicing came in again 
 melancholy and disconsolate, sat down and considered, "Is this an 
 injury fit to be passed by?" He cannot call for fire from heaven to 
 consume the men of Gibeah, as those angels did who were, after the same 
 manner, insulted by the Sodomites. There was no king in Israel, nor 
 (for aught that appears) any sanhedrim, or great council, to appeal to, 
 and demand justice from. Phinehas is high priest, but he attends 
 closely to the business of the sanctuary, and will be no judge or 
 divider. He has therefore no other way left him than to appeal to the 
 people: let the community be judge. Though they had no general stated 
 assembly of all the tribes, yet it is probable that each tribe had a 
 meeting of their chiefs within itself. To each of the tribes, in their 
 respective meetings, he sent by special messengers a remonstrance of 
 the wrong that was done him, in all its aggravating circumstances, and 
 with it a piece of his wife's dead body 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 both to confirm the truth of the story and to affect them the more with 
 it. He divided it into twelve pieces, <I>according to the bones,</I> so 
 some read it, that is, by the joints, sending one to each tribe, even 
 to Benjamin among the rest, with the hope that some among them would be 
 moved to join in punishing so great a villany, and the more warmly 
 because committed by some of their own tribe. It did indeed look very 
 barbarous thus to mangle a dead body, which, having been so wretchedly 
 dishonoured, ought to have been decently interred; but the Levite 
 designed hereby, not only to represent their barbarous usage of his 
 wife, whom they had better have cut in pieces thus than have used as 
 they did, but also to express his own passionate concern and thereby to 
 excite the like in them. And it had the desired effect. All that saw 
 the pieces of the dead body, and were told how the matter was, 
 expressed the same sentiments upon it. 

 1.  That the men of Gibeah had been guilty of a very heinous piece of 
 wickedness, the like to which had never been known before in Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:30"><I>v.</I>  30</A>.

 It was a complicated crime, loaded and blackened with all possible 
 aggravations. They were not such fools as to make a mock at this sin, 
 or turn the story off with a jest. 

 2. That a general assembly of all Israel should be called, to debate 
 what was fit to be done for the punishment of this wickedness, that a 
 stop might be put to this threatening inundation of debauchery, and the 
 wrath of God might not be poured upon the whole nation for it. It is 
 not a common case, and therefore they stir up one another to come 
 together upon the occasion with this: <I>Consider of it, take advice, 
 and speak your minds.</I> We have here the three great rules by which 
 those that sit in council ought to go in every arduous affair.

 (1.) Let every man retire into himself, and weigh the matter 
 impartially and fully in his own thoughts, and seriously and calmly 
 consider it, without prejudice on either side, before he speaks upon 
 it. 

 (2.) Let them freely talk it over, and every man take advice of his 
 friend, know his opinion and his reasons, and weigh them. 

 (3.) Then let every man speak his mind, and give his vote according to 
 his conscience. In the multitude of such counsellors there is 
 safety.</P>
