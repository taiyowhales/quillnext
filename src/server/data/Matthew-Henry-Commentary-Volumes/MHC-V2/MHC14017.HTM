 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here begin the life and reign of Jehoshaphat, who was one of the first 
 three among the royal worthies, one of the best that ever swayed the 
 sceptre of Judah since David's head was laid. He was the good son of a 
 good father, so that, as this time, grace ran in the blood, even in the 
 blood-royal. Happy the son that had such a father, to lay a good 
 foundation in him and for him. Happy the father that had such a son, to 
 build so wall upon the foundation he had laid! Happy the kingdom that 
 was blessed with two such kings, two such reigns, together! In this 
 chapter we have, 

 I. His accession to and establishment in the throne, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:1,2,5">ver. 1, 2, 5</A>.

 II.  His persona piety, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:3,4,6">ver. 3, 4, 6</A>.

 III. The course he took to promote religion in his kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.
 
 IV. The mighty sway he bore among the neighbours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 V. The great strength of his kingdom, both in garrisons and standing
 forces, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:12-19">ver. 12-19</A>.

 Thus was his prosperity the reward of his piety and his piety the
 brightest grace and ornament of his prosperity.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and
 strengthened himself against Israel.
 &nbsp; 2  And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and
 set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim,
 which Asa his father had taken.
 &nbsp; 3  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the
 first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;
 &nbsp; 4  But sought to the <I>L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT></I> God of his father, and walked in his
 commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.
 &nbsp; 5  Therefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> stablished the kingdom in his hand; and
 all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and
 honour in abundance.
 &nbsp; 6  And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: moreover
 he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.
 &nbsp; 7  Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes,
 <I>even</I> to Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to
 Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.
 &nbsp; 8  And with them <I>he sent</I> Levites, <I>even</I> Shemaiah, and
 Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and
 Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, Levites;
 and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.
 &nbsp; 9  And they taught in Judah, and <I>had</I> the book of the law of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with them, and went about throughout all the cities of
 Judah, and taught the people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we find concerning Jehoshaphat,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What a wise man he was. As soon as he came to the crown he 
 <I>strengthened himself against Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Ahab, an active warlike prince, had now been three years upon the
 throne of Israel, the vigour of his beginning falling in with the decay 
 of Asa's conclusion.  It is probable that the kingdom of Israel had, of 
 late, got ground of the kingdom of Judah and began to grow formidable 
 to it; so that the first thing Jehoshaphat had to do was to make his 
 part good on that side, and to check the growing greatness of the king 
 of Israel, which he did so effectually, and without bloodshed, that 
 Ahab soon courted his alliance, so far was he from giving him any 
 disturbance, and proved more dangerous as a friend than he could have 
 been as an enemy.  Jehoshaphat strengthened himself not to act 
 offensively against Israel or invade them, but only to maintain his 
 own, which he did by fortifying the cities that were on his frontiers, 
 and putting garrisons, stronger than had been, in the cities of 
 Ephraim, which he was master of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He did not strengthen himself, as his father did, by a league with the
 king of Syria, but by fair and regular methods, on which he might 
 expect the blessing of God and in which he trusted God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What a good man he was. It is an excellent character that is here 
 given him. 

 1. He <I>walked in the ways of his father David.</I> In the characters 
 of the kings, David's ways are often made the standard, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:3,11,2Ki+14:3,18:3">1 Kings xv. 3, 11; 
 2 Kings xiv. 3; xvi. 2; xviii. 3</A>.

 But the distinction is nowhere so strongly marked as here between his
 first ways and his last ways; for the last were not so good as the 
 first. His ways, before he fell so foully in the matter of Uriah (which
 is mentioned long afterwards as the bar in his escutcheon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:5">1 Kings xv. 5</A>),

 were good ways, and, though he happily recovered from that fall, yet
 perhaps he never, while he lived, fully retrieved the spiritual 
 strength and comfort he lost by it.  Jehoshaphat followed David as far 
 as he followed God and no further.  Paul himself thus limits our 
 imitation of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:1">1 Cor. xi. 1</A>):

 <I>Follow me, as I follow Christ,</I> and not otherwise. Many good
 people have had their first ways, which were their best ways, their 
 first love, which was their strongest love; and in every copy we 
 propose to write after, as we must single out that only which is good, 
 so that chiefly which is best. The words here will admit another 
 reading; they run thus: <I>He walked in the ways of David his father 
 (Hareshonim), those first ways,</I> or those <I>ancient ways.</I> He 
 proposed to himself, for his example, the primitive times of the royal 
 family, those purest times, before the corruptions of the late reigns 
 came in. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:16">Jer. vi. 16</A>.

 The LXX. leaves out David, and so refers it to Asa: <I>He walked in the
 first ways of his father,</I> and did not imitate him in what was amiss 
 in him, towards the latter end of his time. It is good to be cautious 
 in following the best men, lest we step aside after them.

 2.  He <I>sought not to Baalim, but sought to the Lord God of his
 father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 The neighbouring nations had their Baalim, one had one Baal and another
 had another; but he abhorred them all, had nothing to do with them. He
 <I>worshipped the Lord God of his father</I> and him only, prayed to 
 him only and enquired of him only; both are included in seeking him.

 3. That he <I>walked in God's commandments,</I> not only worshipped the
 true God, but worshipped him according to his own institution, <I>and 
 not after the doings of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Though the king of Israel was his neighbour and ally, yet he did not
 learn his way. Whatever dealings he had with him in civil matters, he 
 would not have communion with him, nor comply with him in his religion. 
 In this he kept close to the rule.  

 4.  <I>His heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 or <I>he lifted up his heart.</I> He brought his heart to his work, and
 lifted up his heart in it; that is, he had a sincere regard to God in 
 it. <I>Unto thee, O Lord! do I lift up my soul.</I> His heart was 
 enlarged in that which is good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:32">Ps. cxix. 32</A>.

 He never thought he could do enough for God.  He was lively and
 affectionate in his religion, <I>fervent in spirit, serving the 
 Lord,</I> cheerful and pleasant in it; he went on in his work with 
 alacrity, as Jacob, who, after his vision of God at Bethel, <I>lifted 
 up his feet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:1">Gen. xxix. 1</A>,

 <I>margin.</I> He was bold and resolute in the ways of God and went on
 with courage. His heart was lifted up above the consideration of the 
 difficulties that were in the way of his duty; he easily got over them 
 all, and was not frightened with <I>winds and clouds</I> from <I>sowing 
 and reaping,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:4">Eccl. xi. 4</A>.

 Let us walk in the same spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What a useful man he was, not only a good man, but a good king. He 
 not only was good himself, but did good in his generation, did a great 
 deal of good. 

 1. He took away the teachers of lies, so images are called

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:18">Hab. ii. 18</A>),

 the <I>high places</I> and <I>the groves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It is meant of those in which idols were worshipped; for those that
 were dedicated to the true God only were not taken away,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:33"><I>ch.</I> xx. 33</A>.

 It was only idolatry that he abolished. Nothing debauched the nation
 more than those idolatrous groves or images which he took away. 

 2. He sent forth teachers of truth. When he enquired into the state of
 religion in his kingdom he found his people generally very ignorant: 
 they <I>knew not that they did evil.</I> Even in the last good reign 
 there had been little care taken to instruct them in their duty; and 
 therefore Jehoshaphat resolves to begin his work at the right end, 
 deals with them as reasonable creatures, will not lead them blindfold, 
 no, not into a reformation, but endeavours to have them well taught, 
 knowing that that was the way to have them well cured. In this good 
 work he employed,

 (1.) His princes. Those about him he sent forth; those in the country
 he sent <I>to teach in the cities of Judah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He ordered them, in the administration of justice, not only to correct
 the people when they did ill, but to teach them how to do better, and 
 to give a reason for what they did, that the people might be informed 
 of the difference between good and evil. The princes or judges upon the 
 bench have a great opportunity of teaching people their duty to God and 
 man, and it is not out of their province, for the laws of God are to be 
 looked upon as laws of the land.

 (2.) The <I>Levites</I> and <I>priests</I> went <I>with the
 princes,</I> and <I>taught in Judah, having the book of the law with 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.
 
 They were teachers by office,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:10">Deut. xxxiii. 10</A>.

 Teaching was part of the work for which they had their maintenance. The
 priests and the Levites had little else to do.  But, it seems, they had 
 neglected it, pretending perhaps that they could not get the people to 
 hear them. "Well," says Jehoshaphat, "you shall go along with the 
 princes, and they with their authority shall oblige the people to come 
 and hear you; and then, if they be not well instructed, it is your 
 fault." What an abundance of good may be done when Moses and Aaron thus 
 go hand in hand in the doing of it, when princes with their power, and 
 priests and Levites with their scripture learning, agree to teach the 
 people the good knowledge of God and their duty! These itinerant judges 
 and itinerant preachers together were instrumental to diffuse a blessed 
 light throughout the cities of Judah.  But it is said, <I>They had the 
 book of the law of the Lord with them.</I> 

 [1.] For their own direction, that thence they might fetch all the 
 instructions they gave to the people, and not <I>teach for doctrines 
 the commandments of men.</I> 

 [2.] For the conviction of the people, that they might see that they
 had a divine warrant for what they said and delivered to them that only 
 which they received from the Lord.  Note, Ministers, when they go to 
 teach the people, should have their Bibles with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. What a happy man he was. 

 1. How happy he was in the favour of his God, who signally owned and 
 blessed him: <I>The Lord was with him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 the word of the Lord was his helper</I> (so the Chaldee paraphrase);
 <I>the Lord established the kingdom in his hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Those stand firmly that have the presence of God with them. If the
 <I>beauty of the Lord our God be upon us,</I> that will <I>establish 
 the work of our hands</I> and establish us in our integrity.

 2. How happy he was in the affections of his people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>All Judah brought him presents,</I> in acknowledgment of his
 kindness in sending preachers among them. The more there is of true 
 religion among a people the more there will be of conscientious 
 loyalty. A government that answers the end of government will be 
 supported. The effect of the favour both of God and his kingdom was 
 that he had <I>riches and honour in abundance.</I> It is undoubtedly 
 true, though few will believe it, that religion and piety are the best 
 friends to outward prosperity.  And, observe, it follows immediately, 
 <I>His heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord.</I> Riches and 
 honour in abundance prove to many a clog and a hindrance in the ways of 
 the Lord, an occasion of pride, security, and sensuality; but they had 
 a quite contrary effect upon Jehoshaphat: his abundance was oil to the 
 wheels of his obedience, and the more he had of the wealth of this 
 world the more was his heart <I>lifted up in the ways of the 
 Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And the fear of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> fell upon all the kingdoms of the
 lands that <I>were</I> round about Judah, so that they made no war
 against Jehoshaphat.
 &nbsp; 11  Also <I>some</I> of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents,
 and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven
 thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven
 hundred he goats.
 &nbsp; 12  And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in
 Judah castles, and cities of store.
 &nbsp; 13  And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men
 of war, mighty men of valour, <I>were</I> in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 14  And these <I>are</I> the numbers of them according to the house
 of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the
 chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.
 &nbsp; 15  And next to him <I>was</I> Jehohanan the captain, and with him
 two hundred and fourscore thousand.
 &nbsp; 16  And next him <I>was</I> Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly
 offered himself unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and with him two hundred thousand
 mighty men of valour.
 &nbsp; 17  And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him
 armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.
 &nbsp; 18  And next him <I>was</I> Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and
 fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.
 &nbsp; 19  These waited on the king, beside <I>those</I> whom the king put
 in the fenced cities throughout all Judah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further account of Jehoshaphat's great prosperity and 
 the flourishing state of his kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He had good interest in the neighbouring princes and nations. Though 
 he was not perhaps so great a soldier as David (which might have made 
 him their terror), nor so great a scholar as Solomon (which might have 
 made him their oracle), yet <I>the fear of the Lord fell so upon 
 them</I> (that is, God so influenced and governed their spirits) that 
 they had all a reverence for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 And,

 1. <I>None of them made war against him.</I> God's good providence so 
 ordered it that, while the princes and priests were instructing and 
 reforming the country, none of his neighbours gave him any 
 molestations, to take him off from that good work. Thus when Jacob and 
 his sons were going to worship at Bethel the terror of God was upon the 
 neighbouring cities, that they <I>did not pursue after them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:5">Gen. xxxv. 5</A>,

 and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:24">Exod. xxxiv. 24</A>.

 2. Many of them brought presents to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 to secure his friendship.  Perhaps these were a tribute imposed upon
 them by Asa, who made himself master of the cities of the Philistines, 
 and the tents of the Arabians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+14:14,15"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 14, 15</A>.

 With the 7700 rams, and the same number of he-goats, which the Arabians
 brought, there was probably a proportionable number of ewes and lambs, 
 she-goats and kids.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He had a very considerable stores laid up in the cities of Judah. 
 He pulled down his barns, and built larger 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <I>castles and cities of store,</I> for arms and victuals. He was a man
 of business, and aimed at the public good in all his undertakings, 
 either to preserve the peace or prepare for war.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He had the militia in good order. It was never in better since 
 David modelled it. Five <I>lord-lieutenants</I> (if I may so call them) 
 are here named, with the numbers of those under their command (the 
 serviceable men, that were fit for war in their respective districts), 
 three in Judah, and two in Benjamin. It is said of one of these great 
 commanders, <I>Amasiah,</I> that <I>he willingly offered himself unto 
 the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 not only to the king, to serve him in this post, but to the Lord, to
 glorify him in it. He was the most eminent among them for religion, he 
 accepted the place, not for the honour, or power, or profit of it, but 
 for conscience' sake towards God, that he might serve his country,. It 
 was usual for great generals then to offer of their spoils to the Lord,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+26:26">1 Chron. xxvi. 26</A>.

 But this good man offered himself first to the Lord, and then his
 dedicated things. The number of the soldiers under these five generals 
 amounts to 1,160,000 men, a vast number for so small a compass of 
 ground as Judah's and Benjamin's lot to furnish out and maintain. 
 Abijah could bring into the field but 400,000

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:3"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 3</A>),

 Asa not 600,000 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+14:8"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 8</A>),

 yet Jehoshaphat has at command almost 1,200,000. But it must be
 considered, 

 1. That God had promised to make the seed of Abraham like the sand of
 the sea for number. 

 2. There had now been a long peace. 

 3.  We may suppose that the city of Jerusalem was very much enlarged.
 
 4.  Many had come over to them from the kingdom of Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:19"><I>ch.</I> xv. 19</A>),

 which would increase the numbers of the people. 

 5.  Jehoshaphat was under a special blessing of God, which made his
 affairs to prosper greatly. The armies, we may suppose, were dispersed 
 all the country over, and each man resided for the most part on his own 
 estate; but they appeared often, to be mustered and trained, and were 
 ready at call whenever there was occasion. The commanders waited on the 
 king

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)
 
 as officers of his court, privy-counsellors, and ministers of
 state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But, <I>lastly,</I> observe, It was not this formidable army that 
 struck a terror upon the neighbouring nations, that restrained them 
 from attempting any thing against Israel, or obliged them to pay
 tribute, but the fear of God which fell upon them when Jehoshaphat 
 reformed his country and set up a preaching ministry in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The ordinances of God are more the strength and safety of a kingdom
 than its military force--its men of God more than its men of war.</P>
