 We are here to attend Josiah, 

 I. To the temple, where we see his religious care for the due
 observance of the ordinance of the passover, according to the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:1-19">ver. 1-19</A>.

 II. To the field of battle, where we see his rashness in engaging with
 the king of Egypt, and how dearly it cost him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:20-23">ver. 20-23</A>.

 III. To the grave, where we see him bitterly lamented, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:24-27">ver. 24-27</A>.

 And so we must take our leave of Josiah.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in Jerusalem:
 and they killed the passover on the fourteenth <I>day</I> of the first
 month.
 &nbsp; 2  And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them
 to the service of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 &nbsp; 3  And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were
 holy unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon
 the son of David king of Israel did build; <I>it shall</I> not <I>be</I> a
 burden upon <I>your</I> shoulders: serve now the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, and
 his people Israel,
 &nbsp; 4  And prepare <I>yourselves</I> by the houses of your fathers, after
 your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel,
 and according to the writing of Solomon his son.
 &nbsp; 5  And stand in the holy <I>place</I> according to the divisions of
 the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and
 <I>after</I> the division of the families of the Levites.
 &nbsp; 6  So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare
 your brethren, that <I>they</I> may do according to the word of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by the hand of Moses.
 &nbsp; 7  And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids,
 all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the
 number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these
 <I>were</I> of the king's substance.
 &nbsp; 8  And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the
 priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel,
 rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the
 passover offerings two thousand and six hundred <I>small cattle,</I>
 and three hundred oxen.
 &nbsp; 9  Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and
 Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto
 the Levites for passover offerings five thousand <I>small cattle,</I>
 and five hundred oxen.
 &nbsp; 10  So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their
 place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's
 commandment.
 &nbsp; 11  And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled <I>the
 blood</I> from their hands, and the Levites flayed <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 12  And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give
 according to the divisions of the families of the people, to
 offer unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, as <I>it is</I> written in the book of Moses. And
 so <I>did they</I> with the oxen.
 &nbsp; 13  And they roasted the passover with fire according to the
 ordinance: but the <I>other</I> holy <I>offerings</I> sod they in pots, and
 in caldrons, and in pans, and divided <I>them</I> speedily among all
 the people.
 &nbsp; 14  And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the
 priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron <I>were busied</I> in
 offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore
 the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons
 of Aaron.
 &nbsp; 15  And the singers the sons of Asaph <I>were</I> in their place,
 according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and
 Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters <I>waited</I> at every gate;
 they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the
 Levites prepared for them.
 &nbsp; 16  So all the service of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was prepared the same day, to
 keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, according to the commandment of king Josiah.
 &nbsp; 17  And the children of Israel that were present kept the
 passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven
 days.
 &nbsp; 18  And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from
 the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of
 Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and
 the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the
 inhabitants of Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 19  In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this
 passover kept.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The destruction which Josiah made of idols and idolatry was more 
 largely related in the <I>Kings,</I> but just mentioned here in the 
 foregoing chapter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>);

 but his solemnizing the passover, which was touched upon there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:21">2 Kings xxiii. 21</A>),

 is very particularly related here.  Many were the feasts of the Lord,
 appointed by the ceremonial law, but the passover was the chief. It 
 <I>began them all</I> in the night wherein Israel came out of Egypt; it 
 <I>concluded them all</I> in the night wherein Christ was betrayed; and 
 in the celebration of it Hezekiah and Josiah, those two great 
 reformers, revived religion in their day. The ordinance of the Lord's 
 supper resembles the passover more than it does any of the Jewish 
 festivals; and the due observance of that ordinance, according to the 
 rule, is an instance and means both of the growing purity and beauty of 
 churches and of the growing piety and devotion of particular 
 Christians. Religion cannot flourish where that passover is either 
 wholly neglected or not duly observed; return to that, revive that, 
 make a solemn business of that affecting binding ordinance, and then, 
 it is to be hoped, there will be a reformation in other instances 
 also.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the account we had of Hezekiah's passover the great zeal of the 
 people was observable, and the transport of devout affection that they 
 were in; but little of the same spirit appears here. It was more in 
 compliance with the king that they all kept the passover 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>)
 
 than from any great inclination they had to it themselves. Some pride
 they took in this form of godliness, but little pleasure in the power 
 of it. But, whatever defect there was among the people in the spirit of 
 the duty, both the magistrates and the ministers did their part and 
 took care that the external part of the service should be performed 
 with due solemnity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The king exhorted and directed, quickened and encouraged, the 
 priests and Levites to do their office in this solemnity. Perhaps he 
 saw them remiss and indifferent, unwilling to go out of their road or 
 mend their pace. If ministers are so, it is not amiss for any, but most 
 proper for magistrates, to stir them up to their business. Say to 
 Archippus, <I>Take heed to thy ministry,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:17">Col. iv. 17</A>.

 Let us see how this good king managed his clergy upon this occasion.

 1. He reduced them to the office they were appointed to by the law of
 Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)
 
 and the order they were put into by David and Solomon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 <I>He set them in their charge,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He did not cut them out new work, nor put them into any new method, but
 called them back to their institution. Their courses were settled in 
 writing; let them have recourse to that writing, and marshal themselves 
 according to the <I>divisions of their families,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Our rule is settled in the written word; let magistrates take care that
 ministers walk according to that rule and they do their duty.

 2. He ordered the ark to be put in its place. It should seem, it had of
 late been displaced, either by the wicked kings, to make room for their 
 idols in the most holy place, or by Hezekiah, to make room for the 
 workmen that repaired the temple.  However it was, Josiah bids the 
 <I>Levites put the ark in the house</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and not carry it about from place to place, as perhaps of late they had
 done, justifying themselves therein by the practice before the temple 
 was built. Now that the priests were discharged from this burden of the 
 ark they must be careful in other services about it. 

 3. He charged them to <I>serve God and his people Israel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Ministers must look upon themselves as servants both to Christ and to
 his church for his sake,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:5">2 Cor. iv. 5</A>.

 They must take care, and take pains, and lay out themselves to the
 utmost, 

 (1.) For the glory and honour of God, and to advance the interests of
 his kingdom among men. Paul, <I>a servant of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:1">Tit. i. 1</A>.

 (2.) For the welfare and benefit of his people, not as having dominion
 over their faith, but as helpers of their holiness and joy; and there 
 will be no difficulty, in the strength of God, in honestly serving 
 these two masters. 

 4. He charged them to <I>sanctify themselves,</I> and <I>prepare their
 brethren,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Ministers' work must begin at home, and they must sanctify themselves
 in the first place, purify themselves from sin, sequester themselves 
 from the world, and devote themselves to God. But it must not end 
 there; they must do what they can to <I>prepare their brethren</I> by 
 admonishing, instructing, exhorting, quickening, and comforting, them.  
 <I>The preparation of the heart</I> is indeed <I>from the Lord;</I> but 
 ministers must be instruments in his hand.

 5.  He <I>encouraged them to the service,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 He spoke comfortably to them, as Hezekiah did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:22"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 22</A>.

 He promised them his countenance. Note, Those whom we charge we should
 encourage. Most people love to be commended, and will be wrought upon 
 by encouragements more than by threats.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The king and the princes, influenced by his example, gave liberally 
 for the bearing of the charges of this passover. The ceremonial 
 services were expensive, which perhaps was one reason why they had been 
 neglected. People had not zeal enough to be at the charge of them; nor 
 were they now very fond of them, for that reason, and therefore, 

 1.  Josiah, at his own proper cost, furnished the congregation with
 paschal lambs, and other sacrifices, to be offered during the seven 
 days of the feast. He allowed out of his own estate 30,000 <I>lambs</I> 
 for <I>passover offerings,</I> which the offerers were to feast upon, 
 and 3000 bullocks

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 to be offered during the following seven days.  Note, Those who are
 serious in religion should, when they persuade others to do that which
 is good, make it as cheap and easy to them as may be. And where God
 sows plentifully he expects to reap accordingly.  It is to be feared
 that the congregation generally had not come provided; so that, if
 Josiah had not furnished them, the work of God must have stood still.
 
 2. The chief of the priests, who were men of great estates, contributed
 towards the priests' charges, as Josiah did towards the people's.
 <I>The princes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 that is, the chief of the priests, the princes of the holy tribe,
 <I>rulers of the house of God,</I> bore the priests' charges. And some 
 of the rich and great men of the Levites furnished them also with 
 cattle, both great and small, for offerings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 For, as to those that sincerely desire to be found in the way of their
 duty, Providence sometimes raises up friends to bear them out in it, 
 beyond what they could have expected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The priests and Levites performed their office very readily, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They killed the paschal lambs in the court of the temple, the priests
 sprinkled the blood upon the altar, the Levites flayed them, and then 
 gave the flesh to the people according to their families

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>),

 not fewer than ten, nor more than twenty, to a lamb. They took it to
 their several apartments, roasted it, and ate it <I>according to the 
 ordinance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 As for the other sacrifices that were eucharistical, the flesh of them
 was boiled according to the law of the peace-offerings and was 
 <I>divided speedily among the people,</I> that they might feast upon it 
 as a token of their joy in the atonement made and their reconciliation 
 to God thereby. And, <I>lastly,</I> The priests and Levites took care 
 to honour God by <I>eating of the passover</I> themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Let not ministers think that the care they take for the souls of others
 will excuse their neglect of their own, or that being employed so much 
 in public worship will supersede the religious exercises of their 
 closets and families. The Levites here mace ready for themselves and 
 for the priests, because the priests were wholly taken up all day in 
 the service of the altar; therefore, that they might not have their 
 lamb to dress when they should eat it, the Levites got it ready for 
 them against supper time. Let ministers learn hence to help one 
 another, and to forward one another's work, as brethren, and 
 fellow-servants of the same Master.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The singers and porters attended in their places, and did their 
 office, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The singers with their sacred songs and music expressed and excited the
 joy of the congregation, and made the service very pleasant to them; 
 and the porters at the gates took care that there should be no breaking 
 in of any thing to defile or disquiet the assembly, nor going out of 
 any from it, that none should steal away till the service was done. 
 While they were thus employed their brethren the Levites prepared 
 paschal lambs for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The whole solemnity was performed with great exactness, according to 
 the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>),

 and, upon that account, there was none like it since Samuel's time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 for in Hezekiah's passover there were several irregularities. And
 bishop Patrick observes that in this also it exceeded the other 
 passovers which the preceding kings had kept, that though Josiah was by 
 no means so rich as David, and Solomon, and Jehoshaphat, yet he 
 furnished the whole congregation with beasts for sacrifice, both 
 paschal and eucharistical, at his own proper cost and charge, which was 
 more than any king ever did before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho
 king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates:
 and Josiah went out against him.
 &nbsp; 21  But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do
 with thee, thou king of Judah? <I>I come</I> not against thee this
 day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God
 commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from <I>meddling with</I>
 God, who <I>is</I> with me, that he destroy thee not.
 &nbsp; 22  Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but
 disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened
 not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to
 fight in the valley of Megiddo.
 &nbsp; 23  And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to
 his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.
 &nbsp; 24  His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put
 him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to
 Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in <I>one of</I> the sepulchres
 of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
 &nbsp; 25  And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men
 and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to
 this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they
 <I>are</I> written in the lamentations.
 &nbsp; 26  Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness,
 according to <I>that which was</I> written in the law of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 &nbsp; 27  And his deeds, first and last, behold, they <I>are</I> written in
 the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was thirteen years from Josiah's famous passover to his death. 
 During this time, we may hope, thing went well in his kingdom, that he 
 prospered, and religion flourished; yet we are not entertained with the 
 pleasing account of those years, but they are passed over in silence, 
 because the people, for all this, were not turned from the love of 
 their sins nor God from the fierceness of his anger. The next news 
 therefore we hear of Josiah is that he is cut off in the midst of his 
 days and usefulness, before he is full forty years old. We had this sad 
 story, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:29,30">2 Kings xxiii. 29, 30</A>.

 Here it is somewhat more largely related. That appears here, more than
 did there, which reflects such blame on Josiah and such praise on the 
 people as one would not have expected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Josiah was a very good prince, yet he was much to be blamed for his 
 rashness and presumption in going out to war against the king of Egypt 
 without cause or call. It was bad enough, as it appeared in the 
 <I>Kings,</I> that he meddled with strife which belonged not to him. 
 But here it looks worse; for, it seems, the king of Egypt sent 
 ambassadors to him, to warn him against this enterprise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The king of Egypt argued with Josiah, 

 (1.) From principles of justice. He professed that he had no desire to
 do him any hurt, and therefore it was unfair, against common equity and 
 the law of nations, for Josiah to take up arms against him. If even a 
 <I>righteous man</I> engage in an <I>unrighteous cause,</I> let him not 
 expect to prosper.  <I>God is no respecter of persons.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:20,25:8">Prov. iii. 30; xxv. 8</A>.

 (2.) From principles of religion: "<I>God is with me;</I> nay, <I>He
 commanded me to make haste,</I> and therefore, if thou retard my 
 motions, thou meddlest with God." It cannot be that the king of Egypt 
 only pretended this (as Sennacherib did in a like case,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:25">2 Kings xviii. 25</A>),

 hoping thereby to make Josiah desist, because he knew he had a
 veneration for the word of God; for it is said here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 that the words of Necho were from the mouth of God. We must therefore
 suppose that either by a dream, or by a strong impulse upon his spirit 
 which he had reason to think was from God, or by Jeremiah or some other 
 prophet, he had ordered him to make war upon the king of Assyria.

 (3.) From principles of policy: "<I>That he destroy thee not;</I> it is
 at thy peril if thou engage against one that has not only a better army 
 and a better cause, but God on his side."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was not in wrath to Josiah, whose heart was upright with the Lord 
 his God, but in wrath to a hypocritical nation, who were unworthy of so 
 good a king, that he was so far infatuated as not to hearken to these 
 fair reasonings and desist from his enterprise. He <I>would not turn 
 his face from him,</I> but went in person and fought the Egyptian army 
 in the <I>valley of Megiddo,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 If perhaps he could not believe that the king of Egypt had a command
 from God to do what he did, yet, upon his pleading such a command, he 
 ought to have consulted the oracles of God before he went out against 
 him. His not doing that was his great fault, and of fatal consequence. 
 In this matter he walked not in the ways of David his father; for, had 
 it been his case, he would have enquired of the Lord, <I>Shall I go up? 
 Wilt thou deliver them into my hands?</I> How can we think to prosper 
 in our ways if we do not acknowledge God in them?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The people were a very wicked people, yet they were much to be 
 commended for lamenting the death of Josiah as they did. That Jeremiah 
 lamented him I do not wonder; he was the weeping prophet, and plainly 
 foresaw the utter ruin of his country following upon the death of this 
 good king. But it is strange to find that all Judah and Jerusalem, that 
 stupid senseless people, <I>mourned for him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 contrived how to have their mourning excited by singing men and singing
 women, how to have it spread through the kingdom (they made an 
 ordinance in Israel that the mournful ditties penned on this sad 
 occasion should be learned and sung by all sorts of people), and also 
 how to have the remembrance of it perpetuated: these elegies were 
 inserted in the collections of state poems; they are written in the 
 Lamentations. Hereby it appeared, 

 1. That they had some respect to their good prince, and that, though 
 they did not cordially comply with him in all his good designs, they 
 could not but greatly honour him.  Pious useful men will be manifested 
 in the consciences even of those that will not be influenced by their 
 example; and many that will not submit to the rules of serious 
 godliness themselves yet cannot but give it their good word and esteem 
 it in others.  Perhaps those lamented Josiah when he was dead that were 
 not thankful to God for him while he lived. The Israelites murmured at 
 Moses and Aaron while they were with them and spoke sometimes of 
 stoning them, and yet, when they died, they mourned for them many days.  
 We are often taught to value mercies by the loss of them which, when we 
 enjoyed them, we did not prize as we ought. 

 2. That they had some sense of their own danger now that he was gone.
 Jeremiah told them, it is likely, of the evil they might now expect to 
 come upon them, from which he was taken away; and so far they credited 
 what he said that they lamented the death of him that was their 
 defence. Note, Many will more easily be persuaded to lament the 
 miseries that are coming upon them than to take the proper way by 
 universal reformation to prevent them, will shed tears for their 
 troubles, but will not be prevailed upon to part with their sins. But 
 godly sorrow worketh repentance and that repentance will be to 
 salvation.</P>
