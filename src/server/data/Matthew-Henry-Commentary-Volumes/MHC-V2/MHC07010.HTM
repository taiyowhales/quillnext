 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son
 of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in
 Shamir in mount Ephraim.
 &nbsp; 2 And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and
 was buried in Shamir.
 &nbsp; 3 And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel
 twenty and two years.
 &nbsp; 4 And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and
 they had thirty cities, which are called Havoth-jair unto this
 day, which <I>are</I> in the land of Gilead.
 &nbsp; 5 And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.

 Quiet and peaceable reigns, though the best to live in, are the worst 
 to write of, as yielding least variety of matter for the historian to 
 entertain his reader with; such were the reigns of these two judges, 
 Tola and Jair, who make but a small figure and take up but a very 
 little room in this history. But no doubt they were both <I>raised up 
 of God</I> to serve their country in the quality of judges, not 
 pretending, as Abimelech had done, to the grandeur of kings, nor, like 
 him, taking the honour they had to themselves, but being called of God 
 to it. 

 1. Concerning Tola it is said that he arose after Abimelech to defend 
 Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 After Abimelech had debauched Israel by his wickedness, disquieted and 
 disturbed them by his restless ambition, and, by the mischiefs he 
 brought on them, exposed them to enemies from abroad, God animated this 
 good man to appear for the reforming of abuses, the putting down of 
 idolatry, the appeasing of tumults, and the healing of the wounds given 
 to the state by Abimelech's usurpation.  Thus he saved them from 
 themselves, and guarded them against their enemies. He was of the tribe 
 of Issachar, a tribe disposed to serve, for he <I>bowed his shoulder to 
 bear</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:14,15">Gen. xlix. 14, 15</A>),

 yet one of that tribe is here raised up to rule; for those that humble 
 themselves shall be exalted. He bore the name of him that was ancestor 
 to the first family of that tribe; of the sons of Issachar Tola was the 
 first, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:13,Nu+26:23">Gen. xlvi. 13; Num. xxvi. 23</A>.

 It signifies a <I>worm,</I> yet, being the name of his ancestor, he was
 not ashamed of it. Though he was of Issachar, yet, when he was raised 
 up to the government, he came and dwelt in Mount Ephraim, which was 
 more in the heart of the country, that the people might the more 
 conveniently resort to him for judgment.  He judged Israel twenty-three 
 years

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 kept things in good order, but did not any thing very memorable. 

 2.  Jair was a Gileadite, so was his next successor Jephthah, both of
 that half tribe of the tribe of Manasseh which lay on the other side 
 Jordan; though they seemed separated from their brethren, yet God took 
 care, while the honour of the government was shifted from tribe to 
 tribe and before it settled in Judah, that those who lay remote should 
 sometimes share in it, <I>putting more abundant honour on that part 
 which lacked.</I> Jair bore the name of a very famous man of the same 
 tribe who in Moses's time was very active in reducing this country,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:41,Jos+13:30">Num. xxxii. 41; Josh. xiii. 30</A>.
 
 That which is chiefly remarkable concerning this Jair is the increase
 and honour of his family: <I>He had thirty sons,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 And,

 (1.) They had good preferments, for they <I>rode on thirty ass 
 colts;</I> that is, they were judges itinerant, who, as deputies to 
 their father, rode from place to place in their several circuits to 
 administer justice. We find afterwards that Samuel made his sons 
 judges, though he could not make them good ones,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:1-3">1 Sam. viii. 1-3</A>.

 (2.) They had good possessions, every one a city, out of those that
 were called, from their ancestor of the same name with their father, 
 <I>Havoth-jair--the villages of Jair;</I> yet they are called 
 <I>cities,</I> either because those young gentlemen to whom they were 
 assigned enlarged and fortified them, and so improved them into cities, 
 or because they were as well pleased with their lot in those country 
 towns as if they had been cities compact together and fenced with gates 
 and bars. Villages are cities to a contented mind.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria,
 and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the
 children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and served not him.
 &nbsp; 7 And the anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was hot against Israel, and he sold
 them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the
 children of Ammon.
 &nbsp; 8 And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of
 Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that <I>were</I> on
 the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which <I>is</I> in
 Gilead.
 &nbsp; 9 Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight
 also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house
 of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 While those two judges, Tola and Jair, presided in the affairs of 
 Israel, things went well, but afterwards,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Israel returned to their idolatry, that sin which did most easily 
 beset them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>They did evil again in the sight of the Lord,</I> from whom they 
 were unaccountably bent to backslide, as a <I>foolish people and 
 unwise.</I> 

 1. They worshipped many gods; not only their old demons Baalim and 
 Ashtaroth, which the Canaanites had worshipped, but, as if they would 
 proclaim their folly to all their neighbours, they served the gods of 
 Syria, Zidon, Moab, Ammon, and the Philistines. It looks as if the 
 chief trade of Israel had been to import deities from all countries. It 
 is hard to say whether it was more impious or impolitic to do this. By 
 introducing these foreign deities, they rendered themselves mean and 
 despicable, for no nation that had any sense of honour changed their 
 gods. Much of the wealth of Israel, we may suppose, was carried out, in 
 offerings to the temples of the deities in the several countries whence 
 they came, on which, as their mother-churches, their temples in Israel 
 were expected to own their dependence; the priests and devotees of 
 those sorry deities would follow their gods, no doubt, in crowds into 
 the land of Israel, and, if they could not live in their own country, 
 would take root there, and so <I>strangers would devour their 
 strength.</I> If they did it in compliment to the neighbouring nations, 
 and to ingratiate themselves with them, justly were they disappointed; 
 for those nations which by their wicked arts they sought to make their 
 friends by the righteous judgments of God became their enemies and 
 oppressors. <I>In quo quis peccat, in eo punitur--Wherein a person 
 offends, therein he shall be punished.</I> 

 2. They did not so much as admit the God of Israel to be one of those
 many deities they worshipped, but quite cast him off: They <I>forsook 
 the Lord, and served not him</I> at all. Those that think to serve both 
 God and Mammon will soon come entirely to forsake God, and to serve 
 Mammon only. If God have not all the heart, he will soon have none of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God renewed his judgments upon them, bringing them under the power 
 of oppressing enemies. Had they <I>fallen into the hands of the 
 Lord</I> immediately, they might have found that <I>his mercies were 
 great;</I> but God let them <I>fall into the hands of man,</I> whose 
 tender mercies are cruel. He <I>sold them into the hands of the 
 Philistines</I> that lay south-west of Canaan, and of the Ammonites 
 that lay north-east, both at the same time; so that between those two 
 millstones they were miserably <I>crushed,</I> as the original word is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 for <I>oppressed.</I> God had appointed that, if any of the cities of 
 Israel should revolt to idolatry, the rest should make war upon them 
 and cut them off,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:12-18">Deut. xiii. 12</A>,

 &c. They had been jealous enough in this matter, almost to an extreme,
 in the case of the altar set up by the two tribes and a half 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:1-34">Josh. xxii.</A>);

 but now they had grown so very bad that when one city was infected with
 idolatry the next took the infection and instead of punishing it, 
 imitated and out-did it; and therefore, since those that should have 
 been revengers to <I>execute wrath on those that did</I> this 
 <I>evil</I> were themselves guilty, or <I>bore the sword in vain,</I> 
 God brought the neighbouring nations upon them, to chastise them for 
 their apostasy. The oppression of Israel by the Ammonites, the 
 posterity of Lot, was, 

 1. Very long. It continued eighteen years. Some make those years to be 
 part of the judgeship of Jair, who could not prevail to reform and 
 deliver Israel as he would.  Others make them to commence at the death 
 of Jair, which seems the more probable because that part of Israel 
 which was most infested by the Ammonites was Gilead, Jair's own 
 country, which we cannot suppose to have suffered so much while he was 
 living, but that part at least would be reformed and protected. 

 2. Very grievous. They vexed them and oppressed them. It was a great
 vexation to be oppressed by such a despicable people as the children of 
 Ammon were. They began with those tribes that lay next them on the 
 other side Jordan, here called <I>the land of the Amorites</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 because the Israelites had so wretchedly degenerated, and had made 
 themselves so like the heathen, that they had become, in a manner, 
 perfect Amorites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:3">Ezek. xvi. 3</A>),

 or because by their sin they forfeited their title to this land, so
 that it might justly be looked upon as <I>the land of the Amorites</I> 
 again, from whom they took it. But by degrees they pushed forward, came 
 over Jordan, and invaded Judah, and Benjamin, and Ephraim 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 three of the most famous tribes of Israel, yet thus insulted when they 
 had forsaken God, and unable to make head against the invader. Now the 
 threatening was fulfilled that they should be <I>slain before their 
 enemies,</I> and should have <I>no power to stand before them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:17,37">Lev. xxvi. 17, 37</A>.

 Their <I>ways and their doings procure this to themselves;</I> they 
 have sadly degenerated, and so they come to be sorely distressed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And the children of Israel cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, We
 have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God,
 and also served Baalim.
 &nbsp; 11 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto the children of Israel, <I>Did</I> not <I>I
 deliver you</I> from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the
 children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?
 &nbsp; 12 The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites,
 did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of
 their hand.
 &nbsp; 13 Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I
 will deliver you no more.
 &nbsp; 14 Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them
 deliver you in the time of your tribulation.
 &nbsp; 15 And the children of Israel said unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, We have
 sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee;
 deliver us only, we pray thee, this day.
 &nbsp; 16 And they put away the strange gods from among them, and
 served the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and his soul was grieved for the misery of
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 17 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and
 encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled
 themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.
 &nbsp; 18 And the people <I>and</I> princes of Gilead said one to another,
 What man <I>is he</I> that will begin to fight against the children of
 Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A humble confession which Israel make to God in their distress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:10"><I>v.</I>  10</A>.

 Now they own themselves guilty, like a malefactor upon the rack, and 
 promise reformation, like a child under the rod. They not only complain 
 of the distress, but acknowledge it is their own sin that has brought 
 them into the distress; therefore God is righteous, and they have no 
 reason to repine. They confess their omissions, for in them their sin 
 began--"We have forsaken our God," and their commissions--"We have 
 served Baalim, and herein have done foolishly, treacherously, and very 
 wickedly."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A humbling message which God thereupon sends to Israel, whether by
 an angel (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:1"><I>ch.</I> ii. 1</A>)
 
 or by a prophet (as
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:8"><I>ch.</I> vi. 8</A>)

 is not certain. It was kind that God took notice of their cry, and did
 not turn a deaf ear to it and send them no answer at all; it was kind 
 likewise that when they began to repent he sent them such a message as 
 was proper to increase their repentance, that they might be qualified 
 and prepared for deliverance. Now in this message, 

 1. He upbraids them with their great ingratitude, reminds them of the 
 great things he had done for them, delivering them from such and such 
 enemies, the Egyptians first, out of whose land they were rescued, the 
 Amorites whom they conquered and into whose land they entered, and 
 since their settlement there, when the Ammonites had joined with the 
 Moabites to oppress them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+3:13"><I>ch.</I> iii. 13</A>),

 when the Philistines were vexatious in the days of Shamgar, and
 afterwards other enemies had given them trouble, upon their petition 
 God had wrought many a great salvation for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 Of their being oppressed by the Zidonians and the Maonites we read not 
 elsewhere. God had in justice corrected them, and in mercy delivered 
 them, and therefore might reasonably expect that either through fear or 
 through love they would adhere to him and his service. Well therefore 
 might the word cut them to the heart

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 "Yet <I>you have forsaken me</I> that have brought you out of your 
 troubles and <I>served other gods</I> that brought you into your 
 troubles." Thus did they <I>forsake their own mercies</I> for <I>their 
 own delusions.</I> 

 2. He shows them how justly he might now abandon them to ruin, by
 abandoning them to the <I>gods that they had served.</I> To awaken them 
 to a thorough repentance and reformation, he lets them see,

 (1.) Their folly in serving Baalim. They had been at a vast expense to 
 obtain the favour of such gods as could not help them when they had 
 most need of their help: "<I>Go, and cry unto the gods which you have 
 chosen</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 try what they can do for you now.  You have worshipped them as 
 gods--try if they have now either a divine power or a divine goodness 
 to be employed for you. You paid your homage to them as your kings and 
 lords--try if they will now protect you. You brought your sacrifices of 
 praise to their altars as your benefactors, imagining that they gave 
 you your corn, and wine, and oil, but a friend indeed will be a friend 
 in need; what stead will their favour stand you in now?" Note, It is 
 necessary, in true repentance, that there be a full conviction of the 
 utter insufficiency of all those things to help us and do us any 
 kindness which we have idolized and set upon the throne in our hearts 
 in competition with God. We must be convinced that the pleasures of 
 sense on which we have doted cannot be our satisfaction, nor the wealth 
 of the world which we have coveted be our portion, that we cannot be 
 happy or easy any where but in God. 

 (2.) Their misery and danger in forsaking God. "See what a pass you 
 have brought yourselves to; now you can expect no other than that I 
 should say, <I>I will deliver you no more,</I> and what will become of 
 you then?" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 This he tells them, not only as what he <I>might</I> do, but as what he 
 <I>would</I> do if they rested in a confession of what they had done 
 amiss, and did not put away their idols and amend for the future.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A humble submission which Israel hereupon made to God's justice, 
 with a humble application to his mercy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 <I>The children of Israel met together,</I> probably in a solemn 
 assembly at the door of the tabernacle, received the impressions of the 
 message God had sent them, were not driven by it to despair, though it 
 was very threatening, but resolve to lie at God's feet, and, if they 
 perish, they will perish there. They not only repeat their confession, 
 <I>We have sinned,</I> but, 

 1. They surrender themselves to God's justice: <I>Do thou unto us
 whatsoever seemeth good unto thee.</I> Hereby they own that they 
 deserved the severest tokens of God's displeasure and were sure he 
 could do them no wrong, whatever he laid upon them; they humbled 
 themselves under his mighty and heavy hand, and <I>accepted of the 
 punishment of their iniquity,</I> which Moses had made the condition of 
 God's return in mercy to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:41">Lev. xxvi. 41</A>.

 Note, True penitents dare and will refer themselves to God to correct 
 them as he thinks fit, knowing that their sin is highly malignant in 
 its deserts, and that God is not rigorous or extreme in his demands. 

 2.  They supplicate for God's mercy: <I>Deliver us only, we pray thee,
 this day,</I> from this enemy.  They acknowledge what they deserved, 
 yet pray to God not to deal with them according to their deserts. Note, 
 We must submit to God's justice with a hope in his mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A blessed reformation set on foot hereupon. They brought forth 
 fruits meet for repentance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>They put away the gods of strangers</I> (as the word is), strange
 gods, and worshipped by those nations that were strangers to the 
 commonwealth of Israel and to the covenants of promise, and they 
 <I>served the Lord.</I> Need drove them to him. They knew it was to no 
 purpose to go to the gods whom they had served, and therefore returned 
 to the God whom they had slighted. This is true repentance not only for 
 sin, but from sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. God's gracious return in mercy to them, which is expressed here very
 tenderly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.</I> Not that there is 
 any grief in God (he has infinite joy and happiness in himself, which 
 cannot be broken in upon by either the sins or the miseries of his 
 creatures), nor that there is any change in God: he <I>is in one mind, 
 and who can turn him?</I> But his goodness is his glory. By it he 
 proclaims his name, and magnifies it above all names; and, as he is 
 pleased to put himself into the relation of a father to his people that 
 are in covenant with him, so he is pleased to represent his goodness to 
 them by the compassions of a father towards his children; for, as he is 
 the Father of lights, so he is the Father of mercies. As the 
 disobedience and misery of a child are a grief to a tender father, and 
 make him feel very sensibly from his natural affection, so the 
 provocations of God's people are a grief to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:10">Ps. xcv. 10</A>),

 he is <I>broken with their whorish heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:9">Ezek. vi. 9</A>);

 their troubles also are a grief to him; so he is pleased to speak when
 he is pleased to appear for the deliverance of his people, changing his 
 way and method of proceeding, as tender parents when they begin to 
 relent towards their children with whom they have been displeased. Such 
 are the tender mercies of our God, and so far is he from having any 
 pleasure in the death of sinners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Things are now working towards their deliverance from the 
 Ammonites' oppression, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 God had said, "I will deliver you no more;" but now they are not what 
 they were, they are other men, they are new men, and now he will 
 deliver them. That threatening was denounced to convince and humble 
 them, and, now that it had taken its desired effect, it is revoked in 
 order to their deliverance. 

 1. The Ammonites are hardened to their own ruin. They gathered together
 in one body, that they might be destroyed at one blow,

 2. The Israelites are animated to their own rescue. They assembled 
 likewise,

 During their eighteen years' oppression, as in their former servitudes, 
 they were run down by their enemies, because they would not 
 incorporate; each family, city, or tribe, would stand by itself, and 
 act independently, and so they all became an easy prey to the 
 oppressors, for want of a due sense of a common interest to cement 
 them: but, whenever they got together, they did well; so they did here.  
 When God's Israel become as one man to advance a common good and oppose 
 a common enemy what difficulty can stand before them? The people and 
 princes of Gilead, having met, consult first about a general that 
 should command in chief against the Ammonites. Hitherto most of the 
 deliverers of Israel had an extraordinary call to the office, as Ehud, 
 Barak, Gideon; but the next is to be called in a more common way, by a 
 convention of the states, who enquired out a fit man to command their 
 army, found out one admirably well qualified for the purpose, and God 
 owned their choice by putting his Spirit upon him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:29"><I>ch.</I> xi. 29</A>);

 so that this instance is of use for direction and encouragement in
 after-ages, when extraordinary calls are no longer to be expected. Let 
 such be impartially chosen to public trust and power as God has 
 qualified, and then God will graciously own those who are thus 
 chosen.</P>
