 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The foregoing chapter gave us the account of David's sin; this gives us 
 the account of his repentance. Though he fell, he was not utterly cast 
 down, but, by the grace of God, recovered himself, and found mercy with
 God. Here is, 

 I. His conviction, by a message Nathan brought him from God, which was
 a parable that obliged him to condemn himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>),

 and the application of the parable, in which Nathan charged him with
 the sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>)

 and pronounced sentence upon him,, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:10-12">ver. 10-12</A>.

 II. His repentance and remission, with a proviso, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.

 III. The sickness and death of the child, and his behaviour while it
 was sick and when it was dead 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:15-23">ver. 15-23</A>),

 in both which David gave evidence of his repentance. 

 IV. The birth of Solomon, and God's gracious message concerning him, in 
 which God gave an evidence of his reconciliation to David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:24,25">ver. 24, 25</A>.

 V. The taking of Rabbah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:26-31">ver. 26-31</A>),

 which is mentioned as a further instance that God did not deal with 
 David according to his sins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him,
 and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich,
 and the other poor.
 &nbsp; 2 The rich <I>man</I> had exceeding many flocks and herds:
 &nbsp; 3 But the poor <I>man</I> had nothing, save one little ewe lamb,
 which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together
 with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and
 drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a
 daughter.
 &nbsp; 4 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared
 to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the
 wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's
 lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
 &nbsp; 5 And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he
 said to Nathan, <I>As</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth, the man that hath done this
 <I>thing</I> shall surely die:
 &nbsp; 6 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this
 thing, and because he had no pity.
 &nbsp; 7 And Nathan said to David, Thou <I>art</I> the man. Thus saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I
 delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;
 &nbsp; 8 And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives
 into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah;
 and if <I>that had been</I> too little, I would moreover have given
 unto thee such and such things.
 &nbsp; 9 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to
 do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the
 sword, and hast taken his wife <I>to be</I> thy wife, and hast slain
 him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
 &nbsp; 10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;
 because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah
 the Hittite to be thy wife.
 &nbsp; 11 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Behold, I will raise up evil against
 thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before
 thine eyes, and give <I>them</I> unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie
 with thy wives in the sight of this sun.
 &nbsp; 12 For thou didst <I>it</I> secretly: but I will do this thing
 before all Israel, and before the sun.
 &nbsp; 13 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 And Nathan said unto David, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> also hath put away thy sin;
 thou shalt not die.
 &nbsp; 14 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion
 to the enemies of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to blaspheme, the child also <I>that is</I>
 born unto thee shall surely die.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It seems to have been a great while after David had been guilty of
 adultery with Bath-sheba before he was brought to repentance for it.
 For, when Nathan was sent to him, the child was born

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 so that it was about nine months that David lay under the guilt of that
 sin, and, for aught that appears, unrepented of. What shall we think of 
 David's state all this while? Can we imagine that his heart never smote 
 him for it, or that he never lamented it in secret before God? I would 
 willingly hope that he did, and that Nathan was sent to him, 
 immediately upon the birth of the child, when the thing by that means 
 came to be publicly known and talked of, to draw from him an open 
 confession of the sin, to the glory of God, the admonition of others, 
 and that he might receive, by Nathan, absolution with certain 
 limitations. But, during these nine months, we may well suppose his 
 comforts and the exercises of his graces suspended, and his communion 
 with God interrupted; during all that time, it is certain, he penned no 
 psalms, his harp was out of tune, and his soul like a tree in winter, 
 that has life in the root only. Therefore, after Nathan had been with 
 him, he prays, <I>Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and open 
 thou my lips,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:12,15">Ps. li. 12, 15</A>.
 
 Let us observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The messenger God sent to him. We were told by the last words of the 
 foregoing chapter that the thing David had done displeased the Lord, 
 upon which, one would think, it should have followed that the Lord sent 
 enemies to invade him, terrors to take hold on him, and the messengers 
 of death to arrest him. No, he sent a prophet to him--Nathan, his
 faithful friend and confidant, to instruct and counsel him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 David did not send for Nathan (though he had never had so much occasion
 as he had now for his confessor), but God sent Nathan to David. Note, 
 Though God may suffer his people to fall into sin, he will not suffer 
 them to lie still in it. <I>He went on frowardly in the way of his 
 heart,</I> and if left to himself, would have wandered endlessly, but 
 (saith God) <I>I have seen his ways, and will heal him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:17,18">Isa. lvii. 17, 18</A>.

 He sends after us before we seek after him, else we should certainly be
 lost. Nathan was the prophet by whom God had sent him notice of his 
 kind intentions towards him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:4"><I>ch.</I>  vii. 4</A>),

 and now, by the same hand, he sends him this message of wrath. God's
 word in the mouth of his ministers must be received, whether it speak 
 terror or comfort. Nathan was obedient to the heavenly vision, and went 
 on God's errand to David.  He did not say, "David has sinned, I will 
 not come near him." No; <I>count him not an enemy, but admonish him as 
 a brother,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:15">2 Thess.  iii. 15</A>.

 He did not say, "David is a king, I dare not reprove him." No; if God
 sends him, he <I>sets his face like a flint,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7">Isa. l. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The message Nathan delivered to him, in order to his 
 conviction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He fetched a compass with a parable, which seemed to David as a 
 complaint made to him by Nathan against one of his subjects that had 
 wronged his poor neighbour, in order to his redressing the injury and 
 punishing the injurious. Nathan, it is likely, used to come to him upon 
 such errands, which made this the less suspected. It becomes those who 
 have interest in princes, and have free access to them, to intercede 
 for those that are wronged, that they may have justice done them. 

 (1.) Nathan represented to David a grievous injury which a rich man had
 done to an honest neighbour that was not able to contend with him: 
 <I>The rich man had many flocks and herds</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 the poor man had one lamb only; so unequally is the world divided; and
 yet infinite wisdom, righteousness, and goodness, make the 
 distribution, that the rich may learn charity and the poor contentment. 
 This poor man had but one lamb, a ewe-lamb, a little ewe-lamb, having 
 not wherewithal to buy or keep more. But it was a <I>cade</I>--lamb (as 
 we call it); <I>it grew up with his children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He was fond of it, and it was familiar with him at all times. The rich
 man, having occasion for a lamb to entertain a friend with, took the 
 poor man's lamb from him by violence and made use of that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 either out of covetousness, because he grudged to make use of his own,
 or rather out of luxury, because he fancied the lamb that was thus 
 tenderly kept, and ate and drank like a child, must needs be more 
 delicate food than any of his own and have a better relish.

 (2.) In this he showed him the evil of the sin he had been guilty of in
 defiling Bath-sheba. He had many wives and concubines, whom he kept at 
 a distance, as rich men keep their flocks in their fields. Had he had 
 but one, and had she been dear to him, as the ewe-lamb was to its 
 owner, had she been dear to him <I>as the loving hind and the pleasant 
 roe, her breasts would have satisfied him at all times,</I> and he 
 would have looked no further, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:19">Prov. v. 19</A>.

 Marriage is a remedy against fornication, but marrying many is not;
 for, when once the law of unity is transgressed, the indulged lust will 
 hardly stint itself. Uriah, like the poor man, had only one wife, who 
 was to him as his own soul, and always lay in his bosom, for he had no 
 other, he desired no other, to lie there. The traveller or wayfaring 
 man was, as bishop Patrick explains it from the Jewish writers, the 
 evil imagination, disposition, or desire, which came into David's 
 heart, which he might have satisfied with some of his own, yet nothing 
 would serve but Uriah's darling. They observe that this evil 
 disposition is called a traveller, for in the beginning it is only so, 
 but, in time, it becomes a guest, and, in conclusion, is master of the 
 house. For he that is called a traveller in the beginning of the verse 
 is called <I>a man</I> (ish--a husband) in the close of it. Yet some 
 observe that in David's breast lust was but as a wayfaring man that 
 tarries only for a night; it did not constantly dwell and rule there.

 (3.) By this parable he drew from David a sentence against himself. For
 David supposing it to be a case in fact, and not doubting the truth of 
 it when he had it from Nathan himself, gave judgment immediately 
 against the offender, and confirmed it with an oath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 [1.] That, for his injustice in taking away the lamb, he should restore
 four-fold, according to the law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:1">Exod. xxii. 1</A>),
 
 <I>four sheep for a sheep.</I> 

 [2.] That for his tyranny and cruelty, and the pleasure he took in
 abusing a poor man, he should be put to death. If a poor man steal from 
 a rich man, to satisfy his soul when he is hungry, he shall make 
 restitution, though it cost him <I>all the substance of his house,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:30">Prov. vi. 30, 31</A>

 (and Solomon there compares the sin of adultery with that,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);

 but if a rich man steal for stealing sake, not for want but wantonness,
 merely that he may be imperious and vexatious, he deserves to die for 
 it, for to him the making of restitution is no punishment, or next to 
 none. If the sentence be thought too severe, it must be imputed to the 
 present roughness of David's temper, being under guilt, and not having 
 himself as yet received mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He closed in with him, at length, in the application of the parable. 
 In beginning with a parable he showed his prudence, and great need 
 there is of prudence in giving reproofs. It is well managed if, as 
 here, the offender can be brought ere he is aware, to convict and 
 condemn himself. But here, in his application, he shows his 
 faithfulness, and deals as plainly and roundly with king David himself 
 as if he had been a common person. In plain terms, "<I>Thou art the 
 man</I> who hast done this wrong, and a much greater, to thy neighbour; 
 and therefore, by thy own sentence, thou deservest to die, and shalt be 
 judged out of thy own mouth. Did he deserve to die who took his 
 neighbour's lamb? and dost not thou who hast taken thy neighbour's 
 wife? Though he took the lamb, he did not cause the owner thereof to 
 lose his life, as thou hast done, and therefore much more art thou 
 worthy to die." Now he speaks immediately from God, and in his name. He 
 begins with, <I>Thus saith the Lord God of Israel,</I> a name sacred 
 and venerable to David, and which commanded his attention. Nathan now 
 speaks, not as a petitioner for a poor man, but as an ambassador from 
 the great God, with whom is no respect of persons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God, by Nathan, reminds David of the great things he had done and 
 designed for him, anointing him to be king, and preserving him to the 
 kingdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 giving him power over the house and household of his predecessor, and
 of others that had been his masters, Nabal for one. He had given him 
 the house of Israel and Judah. The wealth of the kingdom was at his 
 service and every body was willing to oblige him. Nay, he was ready to 
 bestow any thing upon him to make him easy: <I>I would have given thee 
 such and such things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 See how liberal God is in his gifts; we are not straitened in him.
 Where he has given much, yet he gives more.  And God's bounty to us is 
 a great aggravation of our discontent and desire of forbidden fruit. It 
 is ungrateful to covet what God has prohibited, while we have liberty 
 to pray for what God has promised, and that is enough.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He charges him with a high contempt of the divine authority, in 
 the sins he had been guilty of: <I>Wherefore hast thou</I> (presuming 
 upon thy royal dignity and power) <I>despised the commandment of the 
 Lord?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 This is the spring and this is the malignity of sin, that it is making
 light of the divine law and the law-maker; as if the obligation of it 
 were weak, the precepts of it trifling, and the threats not at all 
 formidable. Though no man ever wrote more honourably of the law of God 
 than David did, yet, in this instance, he is justly charged with a 
 contempt of it. His adultery with Bath-sheba, which began the mischief, 
 is not mentioned, perhaps because he was already convinced of that, 
 but,

 [1.] The murder of Uriah is twice mentioned: <I>"Thou hast killed Uriah
 with the sword,</I> though not with thy sword, yet, which is equally 
 heinous, with thy pen, by ordering him to be set in the forefront of 
 the battle." Those that contrive wickedness and command it are as truly 
 guilty of it as those that execute it. It is repeated with an 
 aggravation: <I>Thou hast slain him with the sword of the children of 
 Ammon,</I> those uncircumcised enemies of God and Israel. 

 [2.] The marrying of Bath-sheba is likewise twice mentioned, because he
 thought there was no harm in that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Thou hast taken his wife to be thy wife,</I> and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 To marry her whom he had before defiled, and whose husband he had
 slain, was an affront upon the ordinance of marriage, making that not 
 only to palliate, but in a manner to consecrate, such villanies. In all 
 this he <I>despised the word of the Lord</I> (so it is in the Hebrew), 
 not only his commandment in general which forbade such things, but the 
 particular word of promise which God had, by Nathan, sent to him some 
 time before, that he would build him a house. If he had had a due value 
 and veneration for this sacred promise, he would not thus have polluted 
 his house with lust and blood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He threatens an entail of judgements upon his family for this sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>The sword shall never depart from thy house,</I> not in thy time
 nor afterwards, but, for the most part, thou and thy posterity shall be 
 engaged in war." Or it points at the slaughters that should be among 
 his children, Amnon, Absalom, and Adonijah, all falling by the sword. 
 God had promised that his mercy should not depart from him and his 
 house

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:15"><I>ch.</I> vii. 15</A>),

 yet here threatens that the sword should not depart. Can the mercy and
 the sword consist with each other? Yes, those may lie under great and 
 long afflictions who yet shall not be excluded from the grace of the 
 covenant. The reason given is, <I>Because thou hast despised me.</I> 
 Note, Those who despise the word and law of God despise God himself and 
 shall be lightly esteemed. It is particularly threatened, 

 [1.] That his children should be his grief: <I>I will raise up evil
 against thee out of thy own house.</I> Sin brings trouble into a 
 family, and one sin is often made the punishment of another. 

 [2.] That his wives should be his shame, that by an unparalleled piece
 of villany they should be publicly debauched before all Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 It is not said that this should be done by his own son, lest the
 accomplishment should have been hindered by the prediction being too 
 plain; but it was done by Absalom, at the counsel of Ahithophel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:21,22"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 21, 22</A>.

 <I>He that defiled his neighbour's wife should have his own
 defiled,</I> for thus that sin used to be punished, as appears by Job's 
 imprecation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:10">Job xxxi. 10</A>,

 <I>Then let my wife grind unto another,</I> and that threatening,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:14">Hos. iv. 14</A>.

 The sin was secret, and industriously concealed, but the punishment
 should be open, and industriously proclaimed, to the shame of David, 
 whose sin in the matter of Uriah, though committed many years before, 
 would then be called to mind and commonly talked of upon that occasion. 
 As face answers to face in a glass, so does the punishment often answer 
 to the sin; here is <I>blood for blood and uncleanness for 
 uncleanness.</I> And thus God would show how much he hates sin, even in 
 his own people, and that, wherever he find it, he will not let it go 
 unpunished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. David's penitent confession of his sin hereupon. He says not a word 
 to excuse himself or extenuate his sin, but freely owns it: <I>I have 
 sinned against the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 It is probable that he said more to this purport; but this is enough to
 show that he was truly humbled by what Nathan said, and submitted to 
 the conviction. He owns his guilt--<I>I have sinned,</I> and aggravates 
 it--It was <I>against the Lord:</I> on this string he harps in the 
 psalm he penned on this occasion. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:1">Ps. li. 1</A>,

 <I>Against thee, thee only, have I sinned.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. His pardon declared, upon this penitent confession, but with a 
 proviso. When David said <I>I have sinned,</I> and Nathan perceived 
 that he was a true penitent,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He did, in God's name, assure him that his sin was forgiven: 
 "<I>The Lord also has put away thy sin</I> out of the sight of his 
 avenging eye; <I>thou shalt not die,</I>" that is, "not die eternally, 
 nor be for ever put away from God, as thou wouldest have been if he had 
 not put away the sin." The obligation to punishment is hereby cancelled 
 and vacated. <I>He shall not come into condemnation:</I> that is the 
 nature of forgiveness. "Thy iniquity shall not be thy everlasting ruin. 
 <I>The sword shall not depart from thy house,</I> but, 

 [1.] It shall not cut thee off, thou shalt come to thy grave in peace."
 David deserved to die as an adulterer and murderer, but God would not 
 cut him off as he might justly have done. 

 [2.] "Though thou shalt all thy days be <I>chastened of the Lord,</I>
 yet thou <I>shalt not be condemned with the world.</I>" See how ready 
 God is to forgive sin. To this instance, perhaps, David refers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:5">Ps. xxxii. 5</A>,

 <I>I said, I will confess, and thou forgavest.</I> Let not great
 sinners despair of finding mercy with God if they truly repent; for who 
 is a God like unto him, pardoning iniquity?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Yet he pronounces a sentence of death upon the child, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Behold the sovereignty of God! The guilty parent lives, and the
 guiltless infant dies; but all souls are his, and he may, in what way 
 he pleases, glorify himself in his creatures.

 [1.] David had, by his sin, wronged God in his honour; he had <I>given
 occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme.</I> The wicked people 
 of that generation, the infidels, idolaters, and profane, would triumph 
 in David's fall, and speak ill of God and of his law, when they saw one 
 guilty of such foul enormities that professed such an honour both for 
 him and it. "These are your professors! This is he that prays and sings 
 psalms, and is so very devout! What good can there be in such 
 exercises, if they will not restrain men from adultery and murder?" 
 They would say, "Was not Saul rejected for a less matter? why then must 
 David live and reign still?" not considering that God <I>sees not as 
 man sees, but searches the heart.</I> To this day there are those who 
 reproach God, and are hardened in sin, through the example of David. 
 Now, though it is true that none have any just reason to speak ill of 
 God, or of his word and ways, for David's sake, and it is their sin 
 that do so, yet he shall be reckoned with that laid the stumbling-block 
 in their way, and gave, though not cause, yet colour, for the reproach. 
 Note, There is this great evil in the scandalous sins of those that 
 profess religion, and relation to God, that they furnish the enemies of 
 God and religion with matter for reproach and blasphemy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:24">Rom. ii. 24</A>.
 
 [2.] God will therefore vindicate his honour by showing his displeasure
 against David for this sin, and letting the world see that though he 
 loves David he hates his sin; and he chooses to do it by the <I>death 
 of the child.</I> The landlord may distrain on any part of the premises 
 where he pleases.  Perhaps the diseases and deaths of infants were not 
 so common in those days as they are now, which might make this, as an 
 unusual thing, the more evident token of God's displeasure; according 
 to the word he had often said, that he would <I>visit the sins of the 
 fathers upon the children.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  And Nathan departed unto his house. And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> struck the
 child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.
 &nbsp; 16 David therefore besought God for the child; and David
 fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.
 &nbsp; 17 And the elders of his house arose, <I>and went</I> to him, to
 raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat
 bread with them.
 &nbsp; 18 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.
 And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was
 dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we
 spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will
 he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?
 &nbsp; 19 But when David saw that his servants whispered, David
 perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his
 servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
 &nbsp; 20 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
 <I>himself,</I> and changed his apparel, and came into the house of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when
 he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.
 &nbsp; 21 Then said his servants unto him, What thing <I>is</I> this that
 thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, <I>while it
 was</I> alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat
 bread.
 &nbsp; 22 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and
 wept: for I said, Who can tell <I>whether</I> G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> will be gracious to
 me, that the child may live?
 &nbsp; 23 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him
 back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
 &nbsp; 24 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto
 her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name
 Solomon: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> loved him.
 &nbsp; 25 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called
 his name Jedidiah, because of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Nathan, having delivered his message, staid not at court, but went 
 home, probably to pray for David, to whom he had been preaching. God, 
 in making use of him as an instrument to bring David to repentance, and 
 as the herald both of mercy and judgment, put an honour upon the 
 ministry, <I>and magnified his word above all his name.</I> David named 
 one of his sons by Bath-sheba <I>Nathan,</I> in honour of this prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:5">1 Chron. iii. 5</A>),

 and it was that son of whom Christ, the great prophet, lineally
 descended, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:31">Lu. iii. 31</A>.

 When Nathan retired, David, it is probable, retired likewise, and
 penned the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:1-19">51st Psalm</A>,

 in which (though he had been assured that his sin was pardoned) he
 prays earnestly for pardon, and greatly laments his sin; for then will 
 true penitents be ashamed of what they have done when God is 
 <I>pacified towards them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:63">Ezek.  xvi. 63</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The child's illness: <I>The Lord struck</I> it, <I>and it was very 
 sick,</I> perhaps with convulsions, or some other dreadful distemper,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The diseases and death of infants that have <I>not sinned after the
 similitude of Adam's transgression,</I> especially as they are 
 sometimes sadly circumstanced, are sensible proofs of the original sin 
 in which they are conceived.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David's humiliation under this token of God's displeasure, and the 
 intercession he made with God for the life of the child 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>):
 
 <I>He fasted, and lay all night upon the earth,</I> and would not
 suffer any of his attendants either to feed him or help him up. This 
 was an evidence of the truth of his repentance. For, 

 1. Hereby it appeared that he was willing to bear the shame of his sin,
 to have it ever before him, and to be continually upbraided with it; 
 for this child would be a continual memorandum of it, both to himself 
 and others, if he lived: and therefore he was so far from desiring its 
 death, as most in such circumstances do, that he prayed earnestly for 
 its life. True penitents patiently <I>bear the reproach of their 
 youth,</I> and of their youthful lusts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:19">Jer. xxxi. 19</A>.

 2. A very tender compassionate spirit appeared in this, and great
 humanity, above what is commonly found in men, especially men of war, 
 towards little children, even their own; and this was another sign of a 
 broken contrite spirit. Those that are penitent will be pitiful. 

 3. He discovered, in this, a great concern for another world, which is
 an evidence of repentance. Nathan had told him that certainly the child 
 should die; yet, while it is in the reach of prayer, he earnestly 
 intercedes with God for it, chiefly (as we may suppose) that its soul 
 might be safe and happy in another world, and that his sin might not 
 come against the child, and that it might not fare the worse for that 
 in the future state. 

 4. He discovered, in this, a holy dread of God and of his displeasure.
 He deprecated the death of the child chiefly as it was a token of God's 
 anger against him and his house, and was inflicted in performance of a 
 threatening; therefore he prayed thus earnestly that, if it were the 
 will of God, the child might live, because that would be to him a token 
 of God's being reconciled to him. <I>Lord, chasten me not in thy hot 
 displeasure.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:1">Ps. vi. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The death of the child: It <I>died on the seventh day</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 when it was seven days old, and therefore not circumcised, which David
 might perhaps interpret as a further token of God's displeasure, that 
 it died before it was brought under the seal of the covenant; yet he 
 does not therefore doubt of its being happy for the benefits of the 
 covenant do not depend upon the seals. David's servants, judging of him 
 by themselves, were afraid to tell him that <I>the child was dead,</I> 
 concluding that then he would disquiet himself most of all; so that he 
 knew not till he asked, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. David's wonderful calmness and composure of mind when he understood 
 the child was dead.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he did. 

 (1.) He laid aside the expressions of his sorrow, washed and anointed
 himself, and called for clean linen, that he might decently appear 
 before God in his house.

 (2.) <I>He went up to the tabernacle and worshipped,</I> like Job when
 he heard of the death of his children. He went to acknowledge the hand 
 of God in the affliction, and to humble himself under it, and to submit 
 to his holy will in it, to thank God that he himself was spared and his 
 sin pardoned, and to pray that God would not proceed in his controversy 
 with him, nor stir up all his wrath. <I>Is any afflicted? Let him 
 pray.</I> Weeping must never hinder worshipping.

 (3.) <I>Then he went to his own house</I> and refreshed himself, as one
 who found benefit by his religion in the day of his affliction; for, 
 having worshipped, <I>he did eat,</I> and his countenance was no more 
 sad.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The reason he gave for what he did. His servants thought it strange 
 that he should afflict himself so for the sickness of the child and yet 
 take the death of it so easily, and asked him the reason of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),
 
 in answer to which he gives this plain account of his conduct,

 (1.) That while the child was alive he thought it his duty to importune
 the divine favour towards it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Nathan had indeed said the child should die, but, for aught that he
 knew, the threatening might be conditional, as that concerning 
 Hezekiah: upon his great humiliation and earnest prayer, he that had so 
 often <I>heard the voice of his weeping</I> might be pleased to reverse 
 the sentence, and spare the child: <I>Who can tell whether God will yet 
 be gracious to me?</I> God gives us leave to be earnest with him in 
 prayer for particular blessings, from a confidence in his power and 
 general mercy, though we have no particular promise to build upon: we 
 cannot be sure, yet let us pray, <I>for who can tell but God will be 
 gracious to us,</I> in this or that particular? When our relations and 
 friends have fallen sick, the prayer of faith has prevailed much; while 
 there is life there is hope, and, while there is hope, there is room 
 for prayer.

 (2.) That now the child was dead he thought it as much his duty to be
 satisfied in the divine disposal concerning it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Now, wherefore should I fast?</I> Two things checked his
 grief:--

 [1.] <I>I cannot bring him back again;</I> and again, <I>He shall not
 return to me.</I> Those that are dead are out of the reach of prayer; 
 nor can our tears profit them. We can neither weep nor pray them back 
 to this life. Wherefore then should we fast? <I>To what purpose is this 
 waste?</I> Yet David fasted and wept for Jonathan when he was dead, in 
 honour to him. 

 [2.] <I>I shall go to him. First,</I> To him to the grave. Note, The
 consideration of our own death should moderate our sorrow at the death 
 of our relations.  It is the common lot; instead of mourning for their 
 death, we should think of our own: and, whatever loss we have of them 
 now, we shall die shortly, and go to them.  <I>Secondly,</I> To him to 
 heaven, to a state of blessedness, which even the Old Testament saints 
 had some expectation of. Godly parents have great reason to hope 
 concerning their children that die in infancy that it is well with 
 their souls in the other world; for <I>the promise is to us and to our 
 seed,</I> which shall be performed to those that do not put a bar in 
 their own door, as infants do not. <I>Favores sunt ampliandi--Favours 
 received should produce the hope of more.</I> God calls those his 
 children that are born unto him; and, if they be his, he will save 
 them. This may comfort us when our children are removed from us by 
 death, they are better provided for, both in work and wealth, than they 
 could have been in this world. We shall be with them shortly, to part 
 no more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The birth of Solomon. Though David's marrying Bath-sheba had 
 displeased the Lord, yet he was not therefore commanded to divorce her; 
 so far from this that God gave him that son by her on whom the covenant 
 of royalty should be entailed. Bath-sheba, no doubt, was greatly 
 afflicted with the sense of her sin and the tokens of God's 
 displeasure. But, God having restored to David the joys of his 
 salvation, he comforted her with the same comforts with which he 
 himself was comforted of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 He <I>comforted Bath-sheba.</I> And both he and she had reason to be
 comforted in the tokens of God's reconciliation to them, 

 1. Inasmuch as, by his providence, he gave them a son, not as the
 former, who was given in anger and taken away in wrath, but a child 
 graciously given, and written among the living in Jerusalem. They 
 called him <I>Solomon--peaceful,</I> because his birth was a token of 
 God's being at peace with them, because of the prosperity which was 
 entailed upon him, and because he was to be a type of Christ, the 
 prince of peace.  God had removed one son from them, but now gave them 
 another instead of him, like <I>Seth instead of Abel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:25">Gen. iv. 25</A>.
 
 Thus God often balances the griefs of his people with comforts in the
 same thing wherein he hath afflicted them, setting the one over-against 
 the other.  David had very patiently submitted to the will of God in 
 the death of the other child, and now God made up the loss of that, 
 abundantly to his advantage, in the birth of this. The way to have our 
 creature-comforts either continued or restored, or the loss of them 
 made up some other way, is cheerfully to resign them to God. 

 2.  Inasmuch as, by his grace, he particularly owned and favoured that
 son: <I>The Lord loved him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24 and 25</A>),

 ordered him, by the prophet Nathan, to be called <I>Jedidiah--Beloved
 of the Lord:</I> though a seed of evil-doers (for such David and 
 Bath-sheba were), yet so well ordered was the covenant, and the crown 
 entailed by it, that it took away all attainders and corruption of 
 blood, signifying that those who were by nature children of wrath and 
 disobedience should, by the covenant of grace, not only be reconciled, 
 but made favourites. And, in this name, he typified Jesus Christ, that 
 blessed Jedidiah, the son of God's love, concerning whom God declared 
 again and again, <I>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well 
 pleased.</I></P>

 unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all
 the people returned unto Jerusalem.
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the conquest of Rabbah, and other cities of 
 the Ammonites. Though this comes in here after the birth of David's 
 child, yet it is most probable that it was effected a good while 
 before, and soon after the death of Uriah, perhaps during the days of 
 Bath-sheba's mourning for him. Observe, 

 1. That God was very gracious in giving David this great success
 against his enemies, notwithstanding the sin he had been guilty of just 
 at that time when he was engaged in this war, and the wicked use he had 
 made of the sword of the children of Ammon in the murder of Uriah. 
 Justly might he have made that sword, thenceforward, a plague to David 
 and his kingdom; yet he breaks it, and makes David's sword victorious, 
 even before he repents, that this <I>goodness of God might lead him to 
 repentance.</I> Good reason had David to own that God <I>dealt not with 
 him according to his sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:10">Ps. ciii. 10</A>.

 2. That Joab acted very honestly and honourably; for when he had taken
 <I>the city of waters,</I> the royal city, where the palace was, and 
 from which the rest of the city was supplied with water (and therefore, 
 upon the cutting off of that, would be obliged speedily to surrender), 
 he sent to David to come in person to complete this great action, that 
 he might have the praise of it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:26-28"><I>v.</I> 26-28</A>.

 Herein he showed himself a faithful servant, that sought his master's
 honour, and his own only in subordination to his, and left an example 
 to the servants of the Lord Jesus, in every thing they do, to consult 
 his honour.  <I>Not unto us, but to thy name, give glory.</I>

 3. That David was both too haughty and too severe upon this occasion,
 and neither so humble nor so tender as he should have been.

 (1.) He seems to have been too fond of the crown of the king of Ammon,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 Because it was of extraordinary value, by reason of the precious stones
 with which it was set, David would have it set upon his head, though it 
 would have been better to have cast it at God's feet, and at this time 
 to have put his own mouth in the dust, under guilt. The heart that is 
 truly humbled for sin is dead to worldly glory and looks upon it with a 
 holy contempt.

 (2.) He seems to have been too harsh with his prisoners of war, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 
 Taking the city by storm, after it had obstinately held out against a
 long and expensive siege, if he had put all whom he found in arms to 
 the sword in the heat of battle, it would have been severe enough; but 
 to kill them afterwards in cold blood, and by cruel tortures, with saws 
 and harrows, tearing them to pieces, did not become him who, when he 
 entered upon the government, promised to sing of mercy as well as 
 judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:1">Ps. ci. 1</A>.

 Had he made examples of those only who had abused his ambassadors, or
 advised or assisted in it, that being a violation of the law of 
 nations, it might have been looked upon as a piece of necessary justice 
 for terror to other nations; but to be thus severe with all the cities 
 of the children of Ammon (that is, the garrisons or soldiers of the 
 cities) was extremely rigorous, and a sign that David's heart was not 
 yet made soft by repentance, else the bowels of his compassion would 
 not have been thus shut up--a sign that he had not yet found mercy, 
 else he would have been more ready to show mercy.</P>
