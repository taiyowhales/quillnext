 "Out of the eater comes forth meat." It was upon occasion of the
 terrible judgment inflicted on Israel for the sin of David that God
 gave intimation of the setting up of another altar, and of the place
 where he would have the temple to be built, upon which David was
 excited with great vigour to make preparation for that great work,
 wherein, though he had long since designed it, it should seem, he had,
 of late, grown remiss, till awakened by the alarm of that judgment. The
 tokens of God's favour he received after those of his displeasure, 

 I. Directed him to the place,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. Encouraged and quickened him to the work. 

 1. He set himself to prepare for the building, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:2-5">ver. 2-5</A>.

 2. He instructed Solomon, and gave him a charge concerning this work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:6-16">ver. 6-16</A>.

 3. He commanded the princes to assist him in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:17-19">ver. 17-19</A>.

 There is a great deal of difference between the frame of David's spirit
 in the beginning of the former chapter and in the beginning of this.
 There, in the pride of his heart, he was numbering the people; here, in 
 his humility, preparing for the service of God. There corruption was 
 uppermost (but the well of living water in the soul, though it may be 
 muddied, will work itself clear again); grace here has recovered the 
 upper hand.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then David said, This <I>is</I> the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God, and
 this <I>is</I> the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.
 &nbsp; 2  And David commanded to gather together the strangers that
 <I>were</I> in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought
 stones to build the house of God.
 &nbsp; 3  And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the
 doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance
 without weight;
 &nbsp; 4  Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of
 Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.
 &nbsp; 5  And David said, Solomon my son <I>is</I> young and tender, and the
 house <I>that is</I> to be builded for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>must be</I> exceeding
 magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will
 <I>therefore</I> now make preparation for it. So David prepared
 abundantly before his death.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The place fixed for the building of the temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Then David said,</I> by inspiration of God, and as a declaration of
 his mind, <I>This is the house of the Lord God.</I> If a temple must be 
 built for God, it is fit that it be left to him to choose the ground, 
 for all the earth is his; and this is the ground he makes choice 
 of-ground that pertained to a Jebusite, and perhaps there was not a 
 spot of ground besides, in or about Jerusalem, that did so--a happy 
 presage of the setting up of the gospel temple among the Gentiles. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:16,17">Acts xv. 16, 17</A>.

 The ground was a threshing-floor; for the church of the living God is
 his floor, his threshing, and <I>the corn of his floor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:10">Isa. xxi. 10</A>.
 
 Christ's fan is in his hand, thoroughly to purge his floor. This is to
 be the house because this is the altar. The temple was built for the 
 sake of the altar. There were altars long before there were 
 temples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Preparation made for that building. David must not build it, but he 
 would do all he could towards it: He <I>prepared abundantly before his 
 death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 This intimates that the consideration of his age and growing
 infirmities, which showed him his death approaching, quickened him, 
 towards his latter end, to be very diligent in making this preparation. 
 What our hands find to do for God, and our souls, and our generation, 
 let us do it with all our might before our death, because, after death, 
 there is no device nor working. Now we are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What induced him to make such preparation. Two things he 
 considered:--

 (1.) That Solomon was young and tender, and not likely to apply with
 any great vigour to this business at first; so that, unless he found 
 the wheels set a-going, he would be in danger of losing a great deal of 
 time at first, the rather because, being young, he would be tempted to 
 put it off; whereas, if he found the materials got ready to his hand, 
 the most difficult part of the work would be over, and this would 
 excite and encourage him to go about it in the beginnings of his reign. 
 Note, Those that are aged and experienced should consider those that 
 are young and tender, and provide them what help they can, that they 
 may make the work of God as easy to them as possible.

 (2.) That the house must be exceedingly magnificent, very stately and
 sumptuous, strong and beautiful, every thing about it the best in its 
 kind, and for a good reason, since it was intended for the honour of 
 the great God, the Lord of the whole earth, and was to be a type of 
 Christ, in whom all fulness dwells and in whom are hid all treasures.
 Men were then to be taught by sensible methods. The grandeur of the 
 house would help to affect the worshippers with a holy awe and 
 reverence of God, and would invite strangers to come to see it, and the 
 wonder of the world, who thereby would be brought acquainted with the 
 true God. Therefore it is here designed to be of fame and glory 
 throughout all countries. David foretold this good effect of its being 
 magnificent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:29">Ps. lxviii. 29</A>

 <I>Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto
 thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What preparation he made. In general, he prepared abundantly, as we 
 shall find afterwards; cedar and stones, iron and brass, are here 
 specified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>.

 Cedar he had from the Tyrians and the Zidonians. <I>The daughter of
 Tyre shall be there with a gift,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:12">Ps. xlv. 12</A>.

 He also got workmen together, <I>the strangers that were in the land of
 Israel.</I> Some think that he employed them because they were 
 generally better artists, and more ingenious in manual operations, than 
 the Israelites; or, rather, because he would not employ the free-born 
 Israelites in any thing that looked mean and servile. They were 
 delivered from the bondage of making bricks in Egypt, and must not 
 return to hew stone. These strangers were proselytes to the Jewish 
 religion, but, though not enslaved, they were not of equal dignity with 
 Israelites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build
 a house for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel.
 &nbsp; 7  And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my
 mind to build a house unto the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God:
 &nbsp; 8  But the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came to me, saying, Thou hast shed
 blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build
 a house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the
 earth in my sight.
 &nbsp; 9  Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of
 rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about:
 for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and
 quietness unto Israel in his days.
 &nbsp; 10  He shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son,
 and I <I>will be</I> his father; and I will establish the throne of
 his kingdom over Israel for ever.
 &nbsp; 11  Now, my son, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> be with thee; and prosper thou, and
 build the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, as he hath said of thee.
 &nbsp; 12  Only the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> give thee wisdom and understanding, and give
 thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God.
 &nbsp; 13  Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the
 statutes and judgments which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> charged Moses with
 concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor
 be dismayed.
 &nbsp; 14  Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand
 thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight;
 for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared;
 and thou mayest add thereto.
 &nbsp; 15  Moreover <I>there are</I> workmen with thee in abundance, hewers
 and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men
 for every manner of work.
 &nbsp; 16  Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, <I>there
 is</I> no number. Arise <I>therefore,</I> and be doing, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> be
 with thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though Solomon was young and tender, he was capable of receiving 
 instructions, which his father accordingly gave him, concerning the 
 work for which he was designed. When David came to the throne he had 
 many things to do, for the foundations were all out of course; but 
 Solomon had only one thing in charge, and that was <I>to build a house 
 for the Lord God of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David tells him why he did not do it himself. It was in his mind to 
 do it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 but God forbade him, because <I>he had shed much blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Some think this refers to the blood of Uriah, which fastened such a
 reproach upon him as rendered him unworthy the honour of building the 
 temple: but that honour was forbidden him before he had shed that 
 blood; therefore it must be meant, as it is here explained, of the 
 blood he shed in his wars (for he had been a man of war from his 
 youth), which, though shed very justly and honourably in the service of 
 God and Israel, yet made him unfit to be employed in this service, or 
 rather less fit than another that had never been called to such bloody 
 work. God, by assigning this as the reason of laying David aside from
 this work, showed how precious human life is to him, and intended a 
 type of him who should build the gospel temple, not by <I>destroying 
 men's lives,</I> but <I>by saving them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:56">Luke ix. 56</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives him the reason why he imposed this task upon him. 

 1. Because God had designed him for it, nominated him as the man that
 should do it: <I>A son shall be born to thee,</I> that shall be called 
 <I>Solomon,</I> and <I>he shall build a house for my name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 Nothing is more powerful to engage us to any service for God, and
 encourage us in it, than to know that hereunto we are appointed.

 2. Because he would have leisure and opportunity to do it. He should
 be a man of rest, and therefore should not have his time, or thoughts, 
 or wealth, diverted from this business. He should have rest from his 
 enemies abroad (none of them should invade or threaten him, or give him 
 provocation), and he should have peace and quietness at home; and 
 therefore let him build the house. Note, Where God gives rest he 
 expects work. 

 3. Because God had promised to establish his kingdom. Let this
 encourage him to honour God, that God had honour in store for him; let 
 him build up God's house, and God will build up his throne. Note, God's 
 gracious promises should quicken and invigorate our religious 
 service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He delivers him an account of the vast preparations he had made 
 for this building 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 not in a way of pride and vain glory (he speaks of it as a poor
 thing--<I>I have, in my poverty, prepared,</I> margin), but as an 
 encouragement to Solomon to engage cheerfully in the work, for which so 
 solid a foundation was laid. The treasure here mentioned of the 100,000 
 talents of gold, and 1,000,000 talents of silver, amounts to such an 
 incredible sum that most interpreters either allow an error in the copy 
 or think the talent here signifies no more than a plate or piece: 
 <I>ingots</I> we call them. I am inclined to suppose that a certain 
 number is here put for an uncertain, because it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 that of the gold and silver, as well as of the brass and iron, there
 was no number, and that David here includes all the dedicated things

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:11"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 11</A>)

 which he designed <I>for the house of the Lord,</I> that is, not only
 for the building of it, but for the treasure of it; and putting all 
 together, it might come pretty near what is here spoken of. Hundreds 
 and thousands are numbers which we often use to express that which is 
 very much, when yet we would not be understood strictly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He charges them to keep God's commandments and to take heed to his 
 duty in every thing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He must not think by building the temple to purchase a dispensation to
 sin; no, on the contrary, his doing that would not be accepted, nor 
 accounted of, if he did not <I>take heed to fulfil the statutes which 
 the Lord charged Moses with,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Though he was to be king of Israel, he must always remember that he was
 a subject to the God of Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He encourages him to go about this great work, and to go on in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>Be strong, and of good courage,</I> Though it is a vast
 undertaking, thou needest not fear coming under the reproach of the 
 foolish builder, who began to build and was not able to finish it; it 
 is God's work, and it shall come to perfection. <I>Dread not, nor be 
 dismayed.</I>" In our spiritual work, as well as in our spiritual 
 warfare, we have need of courage and resolution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He quickens him not to rest in the preparations he had made, but to 
 add thereto, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Those that enter into the labours of others, and build upon their
 advantages, must still be improving.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. He prays for him: <I>The Lord give thee wisdom and understanding, 
 and give thee charge concerning Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Whatever charge we have, if we see God giving us the charge and calling
 us to it, we may hope he will give us wisdom for the discharge of it. 
 Perhaps Solomon had an eye to this prayer of his father for him, in the 
 prayer he offered for himself: Lord, <I>give me a wise and 
 understanding heart.</I> He concludes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 <I>Up, and be doing, and the Lord be with thee.</I> Hope of God's
 presence must not slacken our endeavours. Though the Lord be with us,
 we must <I>rise and be doing,</I> and, if we do this, we have reason to 
 believe he is and will be with us. Work out your salvation, and God 
 will work in you.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help
 Solomon his son, <I>saying,</I>
 &nbsp; 18  <I>Is</I> not the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God with you? and hath he <I>not</I> given
 you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the
 land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 before his people.
 &nbsp; 19  Now set your heart and your soul to seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God;
 arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God, to
 bring the ark of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the holy vessels
 of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here engages the princes of Israel to assist Solomon in the great 
 work he had to do, and every one to lend him a hand towards the 
 carrying of it on. Those that are in the throne cannot do the good they 
 would, unless those about the throne set in with them. David would 
 therefore have the princes to advise Solomon and quicken him, and make 
 the work as easy to him as they could, by promoting it every one in his 
 place. 

 1. He shows them what obligations they lay under to be zealous in this
 matter, in gratitude to God for the great things he had done for them. 
 He had given them victory, and rest, and a good land for an 
 inheritance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 The more God has done for us the more we should study to do for him.

 2. He presses that upon them which should make them zealous in it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 "<I>Set your heart and soul to seek God,</I> place your happiness in
 his favour, and keep your eye upon his glory. Seek him as your chief 
 good and highest end, and this <I>with your heart and soul.</I> Make 
 religion your choice and business; and then you will grudge no pains 
 nor cost to promote the building of his sanctuary." Let but the heart 
 be sincerely engaged for God, and the head and hand, the estate and 
 interest, and all will be cheerfully employed for him.</P>
