 In this chapter we have Naomi's afflictions. 

 I. As a distressed housekeeper, forced by famine to remove into the 
 land of Moab,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. As a mournful widow and mother, bewailing the death of her husband
 and her two sons,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 III. As a careful mother-in-law, desirous to be kind to her two
 daughters, but at a loss how to be so when she returns to her own 
 country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:6-13">ver. 6-13</A>. 

 Orpah she parts with in sorrow,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:14">ver. 14</A>.

 Ruth she takes with her in fear,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:15-18">ver. 15-18</A>.

 IV. As a poor woman sent back to the place of her first settlement, to
 be supported by the kindness of her friends,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:19-22">ver. 19-22</A>.

 All these things were melancholy and seemed against her, and yet all
 were working for good.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that
 there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of
 Beth-lehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and
 his wife, and his two sons.
 &nbsp; 2 And the name of the man <I>was</I> Elimelech, and the name of his
 wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion,
 Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of
 Moab, and continued there.
 &nbsp; 3 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her
 two sons.
 &nbsp; 4 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of
 the one <I>was</I> Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they
 dwelled there about ten years.
 &nbsp; 5 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman
 was left of her two sons and her husband.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first words give all the date we have of this story. It was <I>in 
 the days when the judges ruled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 not in those disorderly times when <I>there was no king in Israel;</I>
 but under which of the judges these things happened we are not told, 
 and the conjectures of the learned are very uncertain. It must have 
 been towards the beginning of the judges' time, for Boaz, who married 
 Ruth, was born of Rahab, who received the spies in Joshua's time. Some 
 think it was in the days of Ehud, others of Deborah; the learned 
 bishop Patrick inclines to think it was in the days of Gideon, because 
 in his days only we read of a famine by the Midianites' invasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:3,4">Judges vi. 3, 4</A>.

 While the judges were ruling, some one city and some another,
 Providence takes particular cognizance of Bethlehem, and has an eye to 
 a King, to Messiah himself, who should descend from two Gentile 
 mothers, Rahab and Ruth. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A famine in the land, in the land of Canaan, that land <I>flowing 
 with milk and honey.</I> This was one of the judgments which God had 
 threatened to bring upon them for their sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:19,20">Lev. xxvi. 19, 20</A>.

 He has many arrows in his quiver. In the days of the judges they were 
 oppressed by their enemies; and, when by that judgment they were not 
 reformed, God tried this, for when he <I>judges he will overcome.</I> 
 When the land had rest, yet it had not plenty; even in Bethlehem, 
 which signifies <I>the house of bread,</I> there was scarcity. A 
 <I>fruitful land is turned into barrenness,</I> to correct and 
 restrain the luxury and wantonness of those that dwell therein.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An account of one particular family distressed in the famine; it is 
 that of <I>Elimelech.</I> His name signifies <I>my God a king,</I> 
 agreeable to the state of Israel when the judges ruled, for the Lord 
 was their King, and comfortable to him and his family in their 
 affliction, that God was theirs and that he reigns for ever. His wife 
 was <I>Naomi,</I> which signifies my <I>amiable</I> or <I>pleasant</I> 
 one. But his sons' names were <I>Mahlon</I> and <I>Chilion, 
 sickness</I> and <I>consumption,</I> perhaps because weakly children, 
 and not likely to be long-lived. Such are the productions of our 
 pleasant things, weak and infirm, fading and dying.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The removal of this family from Bethlehem into the country of Moab 
 on the other side Jordan, for subsistence, because of the famine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 It seems there was plenty in the country of Moab when there was 
 scarcity of bread in the land of Israel. Common gifts of providence
 are often bestowed in greater plenty upon those that are strangers to 
 God than upon those that know and worship him. <I>Moab is at ease from 
 his youth,</I> while Israel <I>is emptied from vessel to vessel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:11">Jer. xlviii. 11</A>),

 not because God loves Moabites better, but because they have <I>their
 portion in this life.</I> Thither Elimelech goes, not to settle for 
 ever, but to sojourn for a time, during the dearth, as Abraham, on a 
 similar occasion, went into Egypt, and Isaac into the land of the 
 Philistines. Now here, 

 1. Elimelech's care to provide for his family, and his taking his wife 
 and children with him, were without doubt commendable. <I>If any 
 provide not for his own, he hath denied the faith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:8">1 Tim. v. 8</A>.
 
 When he was in his straits he did not forsake his house, go seek his
 fortune himself, and leave his wife and children to shift for their 
 own maintenance; but, as became a tender husband and a loving father, 
 where he went he took them with him, not as the ostrich, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:16">Job xxxix. 16</A>.
 
 But,

 2. I see not how his removal into the country of Moab, upon this 
 occasion, could be justified. Abraham and Isaac were only sojourners 
 in Canaan, and it was agreeable to their condition to remove; but the 
 seed of Israel were now fixed, and ought not to remove into the 
 territories of the heathen. What reason had Elimelech to go more than 
 any of his neighbours? If by any ill husbandry he had wasted his 
 patrimony, and sold his land or mortgaged it (as it should seem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:3,4"><I>ch.</I> iv. 3, 4</A>),

 which brought him in to a more necessitous condition than others, the
 law of God would have obliged his neighbours to relieve him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:35">Lev. xxv. 35</A>);

 but that was not his case, for he went out full, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 By those who tarried at home it appears that the famine was not so 
 extreme but that there was sufficient to keep life and soul together; 
 and his charge was but small, only two sons. But if he could not be 
 content with the short allowance that his neighbours took up with, and 
 <I>in the day of famine could not be satisfied</I> unless he kept as 
 plentiful a table as he had done formerly, if he could not live in 
 hope that there would come years of plenty again in due time, or could 
 not with patience wait for those years, it was his fault, and he did 
 by it dishonour God and the good land he had given them, <I>weaken the 
 hands of his brethren,</I> with whom he should have been willing to 
 take his lot, and set an ill example to others. If all should do as he 
 did Canaan would be dispeopled. Note, It is an evidence of a 
 discontented, distrustful, unstable spirit, to be weary of the place 
 in which God hath set us, and to be for leaving it immediately 
 whenever we meet with any uneasiness or inconvenience in it. It is 
 folly to think of escaping that cross which, being laid in our way, we 
 ought to take up. It is our wisdom to make the best of that which is,
 for it is seldom that changing our place is mending it. Or, if he 
 would remove, why to the country of Moab? If he had made enquiry, it 
 is probable he would have found plenty in some of the tribes of 
 Israel, those, for instance, on the other side Jordan, that bordered 
 on the land of Moab; if he had had that zeal for God and his worship, 
 and that affection for his brethren which became an Israelite, he 
 would not have persuaded himself so easily to go and sojourn among 
 Moabites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The marriage of his two sons to two of the daughters of Moab after 
 his death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 All agree that this was ill done. The Chaldee says, <I>They 
 transgressed the decree of the word of the Lord in taking strange 
 wives.</I> If they would not stay unmarried till their return to the 
 land of Israel, they were not so far off but that they might have 
 fetched themselves wives thence. Little did Elimelech think, when he 
 went to sojourn in Moab, that ever his sons would thus join in 
 affinity with Moabites. But those that bring young people into bad
 acquaintance, and take them out of the way of public ordinances, 
 though they may think them well-principled and armed against 
 temptation, know not what they do, nor <I>what will be the end 
 thereof.</I> It does not appear that the women they married were 
 proselyted to the Jewish religion, for Orpah is said to return to her 
 gods

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 the gods of Moab were hers still. It is a groundless tradition of the
 Jews that Ruth was the daughter of Eglon king of Moab, yet the Chaldee 
 paraphrast inserts it; but this and their other tradition, which he 
 inserts likewise, cannot agree, that Boaz who married Ruth was the 
 same with Ibzan, who judged Israel 200 years after Eglon's death,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+12:8-10">
 Judg. xii.</A></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The death of Elimelech and his two sons, and the disconsolate 
 condition Naomi was thereby reduced to. Her husband died 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 and her two sons

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 soon after their marriage, and the Chaldee says, <I>Their days were
 shortened,</I> because they transgressed the law in marrying strange 
 wives. See here, 

 1. That wherever we go we cannot out-run death, whose fatal arrows fly 
 in all places. 

 2. That we cannot expect to prosper when we go out of the way of our 
 duty. <I>He that will save his life</I> by any indirect course 
 <I>shall lose it.</I> 

 3. That death, when it comes into a family, often makes breach upon
 breach. One is taken away to prepare another to follow soon after; one 
 is taken away, and that affliction is not duly improved, and therefore 
 God sends another of the same kind. When Naomi had lost her husband 
 she took so much the more complacency and put so much the more 
 confidence in her sons. Under the shadow of these surviving comforts 
 she thinks she shall live among the heathen, and exceedingly glad she 
 was of these gourds; but behold they wither presently, <I>green and 
 growing up in the morning, cut down and dried up</I> before night, 
 buried soon after they were married, for neither of them left any 
 children. So uncertain and transient are all our enjoyments here. It 
 is therefore our wisdom to make sure of those comforts that will be 
 made sure and of which death cannot rob us. But how desolate was the 
 condition, and how disconsolate the spirit, of poor Naomi, when the 
 woman <I>was left of her two sons and her husband!</I> When <I>these 
 two things, loss of children and widowhood, come upon her in a 
 moment,</I> come upon her <I>in their perfection, by whom shall she be 
 comforted?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:9,51:19">Isa. xlvii. 9; li. 19</A>.

 It is God alone who has wherewithal to comfort those who are thus cast
 down.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might
 return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country
 of Moab how that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had visited his people in giving them
 bread.
 &nbsp; 7 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and
 her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to
 return unto the land of Judah.
 &nbsp; 8 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each
 to her mother's house: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> deal kindly with you, as ye have
 dealt with the dead, and with me.
 &nbsp; 9 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> grant you that ye may find rest, each <I>of you</I> in
 the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted
 up their voice, and wept.
 &nbsp; 10 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto
 thy people.
 &nbsp; 11 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go
 with me? <I>are</I> there yet <I>any more</I> sons in my womb, that they
 may be your husbands?
 &nbsp; 12 Turn again, my daughters, go <I>your way;</I> for I am too old to
 have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, <I>if</I> I should have
 a husband also to night, and should also bear sons;
 &nbsp; 13 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay
 for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth
 me much for your sakes that the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> is gone out
 against me.
 &nbsp; 14 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah
 kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.
 &nbsp; 15 And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto
 her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in
 law.
 &nbsp; 16 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, <I>or</I> to return
 from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and
 where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people <I>shall be</I> my
 people, and thy God my God:
 &nbsp; 17 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried:
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> do so to me, and more also, <I>if ought</I> but death part
 thee and me.
 &nbsp; 18 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her,
 then she left speaking unto her.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 
 
 I. The good affection Naomi bore to the land of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Though she could not stay in it while the famine lasted, she would not 
 stay out of it when the famine ceased. Though the country of Moab had 
 afforded her shelter and supply in a time of need, yet she did not 
 intend it should be her rest for ever; no land should be that but the 
 holy land, in which the sanctuary of God was, of which he had said, 
 <I>This is my rest for ever.</I> Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God, at last, returned in mercy to his people; for, though he 
 contend long, he will not contend always. As the judgment of 
 oppression, under which they often groaned in the time of the judges, 
 still came to an end, after a while, when God had raised them up a 
 deliverer, so here the judgment of famine: At length God graciously 
 <I>visited his people in giving them bread.</I> Plenty is God's gift, 
 and it is his visitation which by bread, the staff of life, <I>holds 
 our souls in life.</I> Though this mercy be the more striking when it 
 comes after famine, yet if we have constantly enjoyed it, and never 
 knew what famine meant, we are not to think it the less valuable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Naomi then returned, in duty to her people. She had often enquired 
 of their state, what harvests they had and how the markets went, and 
 still the tidings were discouraging; but like the prophet's servant, 
 who, having looked seven times and seen no sign of rain, at length 
 discerned a cloud no bigger than a man's hand, which soon overspread 
 the heavens, so Naomi at last has good news brought her of plenty in 
 Bethlehem, and then she can think of no other than returning thither 
 again. Hew new alliances in the country of Moab could not make her 
 forget her relation to the land of Israel. Note, Though there be a 
 reason for our being in bad places, yet, when the reason ceases, we 
 must by no means continue in them. Forced absence from God's 
 ordinances, and forced presence with wicked people, are great 
 afflictions; but when the force ceases, and such a situation is 
 continued of choice, then it becomes a great sin. It should seem she 
 began to think of returning immediately upon the death of her two sons, 
 
 (1.) Because she looked upon that affliction to be a judgment upon her
 family for lingering in the country of Moab; and hearing this to be the 
 <I>voice of the rod, and of him that appointed it,</I> she obeys and 
 returns. Had she returned upon the death of her husband, perhaps she 
 might have saved the life of her sons; but, <I>when God judgeth he will 
 overcome,</I> and, if one affliction prevail not to awaken us to a 
 sight and sense of sin and duty, another shall. When death comes into a 
 family it ought to be improved for the reforming of what is amiss in 
 the family: when relations are taken away from us we are put upon 
 enquiry whether, in some instance or other, we are not out of the way 
 of our duty, that we may return to it. God <I>calls our sins to 
 remembrance,</I> when he <I>slays a son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:18">1 Kings xvii. 18</A>.

 And, if he thus hedge up our way with thorns, it is that he may oblige
 us to say, We will <I>go and return to our first husband,</I> as Naomi 
 here to her country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:7">Hos. ii. 7</A>.

 (2.) Because the land of Moab had now become a melancholy place to
 her. It is with little pleasure that she can breathe in that air in 
 which her husband and sons had expired, or go on that ground in which 
 they lay buried out of her sight, but not out of her thoughts; now she 
 will go to Canaan again. Thus God takes away from us the comforts we 
 stay ourselves too much upon and solace ourselves too much in, here in 
 the land of our sojourning, that we may think more of our home in the 
 other world, and by faith and hope may hasten towards it. Earth is
 embittered to us, that heaven may be endeared.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The good affection which her daughters-in-law, and one of them 
 especially, bore to her, and her generous return of their good 
 affection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were both so kind as to accompany her, some part of the way at 
 least, when she returned towards the land of Judah. Her two 
 daughters-in-law did not go about to persuade her to continue in the 
 land of Moab, but, if she was resolved to go home, would pay her all 
 possible civility and respect at parting; and this was one instance of 
 it: they would <I>bring her on her way,</I> at least to the utmost 
 limits of their country, and help her to carry her luggage as far as 
 they went, for it does not appear that she had any servant to attend 
 her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 By this we see both that Naomi, as became an Israelite, had been very 
 kind and obliging to them and had won their love, in which she is an 
 example to all mothers-in-law, and that Orpah and Ruth had a just 
 sense of her kindness, for they were willing to return it thus far. It 
 was a sign they had dwelt together in unity, though <I>those</I> were 
 dead by whom the relation between them came. Though they retained an 
 affection for the gods of Moab

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and Naomi was still faithful to the God of Israel, yet that was no
 hindrance to either side from love and kindness, and all the good 
 offices that the relation required. Mothers-in-law and 
 daughters-in-law are too often at variance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:35">Matt. x. 35</A>),

 and therefore it is the more commendable if they live in love; let all
 who sustain this relation aim at the praise of doing so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When they had gone a little way with her Naomi, with a great deal of 
 affection, urged them to go back 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>):

 <I>Return each to her mother's house.</I> When they were dislodged by
 a sad providence from the house of their husbands it was a mercy to 
 them that they had their parents yet living, that they had their 
 houses to go to, where they might be welcome and easy, and were not 
 turned out to the wide world. Naomi suggests that their own mothers
 would be more agreeable to them than a mother-in-law, especially when 
 their own mothers had houses and their mother-in-law was not sure she 
 had a place to lay her head in which she could call her own. She 
 dismisses them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) With commendation. This is a debt owing to those who have 
 conducted themselves well in any relation, they ought to have the 
 praise of it: <I>You have dealt kindly with the dead and with me,</I> 
 that is, "You were good wives to your husbands that are gone, and have 
 been good daughters to me, and not wanting to your duty in either 
 relation." Note, When we and our relations are parting, by death or 
 otherwise, it is very comfortable if we have both their testimony and 
 the testimony of our own consciences for us that while we were together 
 we carefully endeavoured to do our duty in the relation. This will help 
 to allay the bitterness of parting; and, while we are together, we 
 should labour so to conduct ourselves as that when we part we may not 
 have cause to reflect with regret upon our miscarriages in the 
 relation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) With prayer. It is very proper for friends, when they part, to 
 part with prayer. She sends them home with her blessing; and the 
 blessing of a mother-in-law is not to be slighted. In this blessing she 
 twice mentions the name <I>Jehovah,</I> Israel's God, and the only true 
 God, that she might direct her daughters to look up to him as the only 
 fountain of all good. To him she prays in general that he would 
 recompense to them the kindness they had shown to her and hers. It may 
 be expected and prayed for in faith that God will deal kindly with 
 those that have dealt kindly with their relations. <I>He that watereth 
 shall be watered also himself.</I> And, in particular, that they might 
 be happy in marrying again: <I>The Lord grant that you may find rest, 
 each of you in the house of her husband.</I> Note, 

 [1.] It is very fit that, according to the apostle's direction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:14">1 Tim. v. 14</A>),

 the younger women, and he speaks there of young widows, should
 <I>marry, bear children,</I> and <I>guide the house.</I> And it is a 
 pity that those who have approved themselves good wives should not 
 again be blessed with good husbands, especially those that, like these 
 widows, have no children. 

 [2.] The married state is a state of rest, such rest as this world 
 affords, rest in the house of a husband, more than can be expected in 
 the house of a mother or a mother-in-law. 

 [3.] This rest is God's gift. If any content and satisfaction be found 
 in our outward condition, God must be acknowledged in it. There are 
 those that are unequally yoked, that find little rest even in the 
 house of a husband. Their affliction ought to make those the more
 thankful to whom the relation is comfortable. Yet let God be the rest 
 of the soul, and no perfect rest thought of on this side heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) She dismissed them with great affection: <I>She kissed them,</I> 
 wished she had somewhat better to give them, but silver and gold she 
 had none. However, this parting kiss shall be the seal of such a true 
 friendship as (though she never see them more) she will, while she 
 lives, retain the pleasing remembrance of. If relations must part, let 
 them thus part in love, that they may (if they never meet again in this 
 world) meet in the world of everlasting love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The two young widows could not think of parting with their good 
 mother-in-law, so much had the good conversation of that pious 
 Israelite won upon them. They not only lifted up their voice and wept, 
 as loth to part, but they professed a resolution to adhere to her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>Surely we will return with thee unto thy people,</I> and take our
 lot with thee." It is a rare instance of affection to a mother-in-law 
 and an evidence that they had, for her sake, conceived a good opinion 
 of the people of Israel. Even Orpah, who afterwards went back to her 
 gods, now seemed resolved to go forward with Naomi. The sad ceremony 
 of parting, and the tears shed on that occasion, drew from her this 
 protestation, but it did not hold. Strong passions, without a settled 
 judgment, commonly produce weak resolutions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Naomi sets herself to dissuade them from going along with her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:11-13"><I>v.</I> 11-13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Naomi urges her afflicted condition. If she had had any sons in 
 Canaan, or any near kinsmen, whom she could have expected to marry the 
 widows, to <I>raise up seed</I> to those that were gone, and to redeem 
 the mortgaged estate of the family, it might have been some 
 encouragement to them to hope for a comfortable settlement at 
 Bethlehem. But she had no sons, nor could she think of any near kinsman 
 likely to do the kinsman's part, and therefore argues that she was 
 never likely to have any sons to be husbands for them, for she was too 
 old to have a husband; it became here age to think of dying and going 
 out of the world, not of marrying and beginning the world again. Or, if 
 she had a husband, she could not expect to have children, nor, if she 
 had sons, could she think that these young widows would stay unmarried 
 till her sons that should yet be born would grow up to be marriageable. 
 Yet this was not all: she could not only not propose to herself to 
 marry them like themselves, but she knew not how to maintain them like 
 themselves. The greatest grievance of that poor condition to which she 
 was reduced was that she was not in a capacity to do for them as she 
 would: <I>It grieveth me</I> more <I>for your sakes</I> than for my own 
 <I>that the hand of the Lord has gone out against me.</I> Observe, 

 [1.] She judges herself chiefly aimed at in the affliction, that God's 
 quarrel was principally with her: "<I>The hand of the Lord has gone 
 out against me.</I> I am the sinner; it is with me that God has a 
 controversy; it is with me that he is contending; I take it to 
 myself." This well becomes us when we are under affliction; though 
 many others share in the trouble, yet we must hear the voice of the 
 rod as if it spoke only against us and to us, not billeting the 
 rebukes of it at other people's houses, but taking them to ourselves. 
 
 [2.] She laments most the trouble that redounded to them from it. She 
 was the sinner, but they were the sufferers: <I>It grieveth me much 
 for your sakes.</I> A gracious generous spirit can better bear its own 
 burden than it can bear to see it a grievance to others, or others in 
 any way drawn into trouble by it. Naomi could more easily want herself 
 than see her daughters want. "Therefore <I>turn again, my 
 daughters,</I> for, alas! I am in no capacity to do you any
 kindness." But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Did Naomi do well thus to discourage her daughters from going with 
 her, when, by taking them with her, she might save them from the 
 idolatry of Moab and bring them to the faith and worship of the God of 
 Israel? Naomi, no doubt, desired to do so. But,

 [1.] If they did come with her, she would not have them to come upon 
 her account. Those that take upon them a profession of religion only 
 in complaisance to their relations, to oblige their friends, or for 
 the sake of company, will be converts of small value and of short 
 continuance. 

 [2.] If they did come with her, she would have them to make it their 
 deliberate choice, and to sit down first and count the cost, as it 
 concerns those to do that may take up a profession of religion. It is 
 good for us to be told the worst. Our Saviour took this course with 
 him who, in the heat of zeal, spoke that bold word, <I>Master, I will 
 follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</I> "Come, come," says Christ, 
 "canst thou fare as I fare? <I>The Son of man has not where to lay
 his head;</I> know this, and then consider whether thou canst find in 
 thy heart to take thy lot with him,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:19,20">Matt. viii. 19, 20</A>.

 Thus Naomi deals with her daughters-in-law. Thoughts ripened into
 resolves by serious consideration are likely to be kept always in the 
 imagination of the heart, whereas what is soon ripe is soon 
 rotten.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Orpah was easily persuaded to yield to her own corrupt inclination, 
 and to go back to her country, her kindred, and her father's house, now 
 when she stood fair for an effectual call from it. They both <I>lifted 
 up their voice and wept again</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 being much affected with the tender things that Naomi had said. But it
 had a different effect upon them: to Orpah it was a savour of death 
 unto death; the representation Naomi had made of the inconveniences 
 they must count upon if they went forward to Canaan sent her back to 
 the country of Moab, and served her as an excuse for her apostasy; 
 but, on the contrary, it strengthened Ruth's resolution, and her good 
 affection to Naomi, with whose wisdom and goodness she was never so 
 charmed as she was upon this occasion; thus to her it was a savour of 
 life unto life.

 (1.) <I>Orpah kissed her mother-in-law,</I> that is, took an
 affectionate leave of her, bade her farewell for ever, without any 
 purpose to follow her hereafter, as he that said he would follow Christ 
 when he had buried his father or bidden those farewell that were at 
 home. Orpah's kiss showed she had an affection for Naomi and was loth 
 to part from her; yet she did not love her well enough to leave her 
 country for her sake. Thus many have a value and affection for Christ, 
 and yet come short of salvation by him, because they cannot find in 
 their hearts to forsake other things for him. They love him and yet 
 leave him, because they do not love him enough, but love other things 
 better. Thus the young man that went away from Christ went away 
 sorrowful, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:22">Matt. xix. 22</A>.

 But, 

 (2.) <I>Ruth clave unto her.</I> Whether, when she came from home, she
 was resolved to go forward with her or no does not appear; perhaps she 
 was before determined what to do, out of a sincere affection for the 
 God of Israel and to his law, of which, by the good instructions of 
 Naomi, she had some knowledge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Naomi persuades Ruth to go back, urging, as a further inducement, 
 her sister's example 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Thy sister-in-law has gone back to her people,</I> and therefore of
 course gone back <I>to her gods;</I> for, whatever she might do while 
 she lived with her mother-in-law, it would be next to impossible for 
 her to show any respect to the God of Israel when she went to live 
 among the worshippers of Chemosh. Those that forsake the communion of 
 saints, and return to the people of Moab, will certainly break off 
 their communion with God, and embrace the idols of Moab. Now, 
 <I>return thou after thy sister,</I> that is, "If ever thou wilt 
 return, return now. This is the greatest trial of thy constancy; stand 
 this trial, and thou art mine for ever." Such offences as that of 
 Orpah's revolt must needs come, that those who are perfect and sincere 
 may be made manifest, as Ruth was upon this occasion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. Ruth puts an end to the debate by a most solemn profession of her 
 immovable resolution never to forsake her, nor to return to her own 
 country and her old relations again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Nothing could be said more fine, more brave, than this. She seems 
 to have had another spirit, and another speech, now that her sister had 
 gone, and it is an instance of the grace of God inclining the soul to 
 the resolute choice of the better part. <I>Draw me</I> thus, and <I>we
 will run after thee.</I> Her mother's dissuasions made her the more 
 resolute; as when Joshua said to the people, <I>You cannot serve the 
 Lord,</I> they said it with the more vehemence, <I>Nay, but we 
 will.</I> 

 [1.] She begs of her mother-in-law to say no more against her going: 
 "<I>Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after 
 thee;</I> for all thy entreaties now cannot shake that resolution 
 which thy instructions formerly have wrought in me, and therefore let 
 me hear no more of them." Note, It is a great vexation and uneasiness 
 to those that are resolved for God and religion to be tempted and 
 solicited to alter their resolution. Those that would not think of it 
 would not hear of it. <I>Entreat me not.</I> The margin reads it, 
 <I>Be not against me.</I> Note, We are to reckon those against us, and 
 really our enemies, that would hinder us in our way to the heavenly 
 Canaan. Our relations they may be, but they cannot be our friends,
 that would dissuade us from and discourage us in the service of God 
 and the work of religion. 

 [2.] She is very particular in her resolution to cleave to her and 
 never to forsake her; and she speaks the language of one resolved for 
 God and heaven. She is so in love, not with her mother's beauty, or 
 riches, or gaiety (all these were withered and gone), but with her 
 wisdom, and virtue, and grace, which remained with her, even in her 
 present poor and melancholy condition, that she resolves to cleave to 
 her. <I>First,</I> She will travel with her: <I>Whither thou goest I 
 will go,</I> though to a country I never saw and in a low and ill 
 opinion of which I have been trained up; though far from my own 
 country, yet with thee every road shall be pleasant. <I>Secondly,</I> 
 She will dwell with her: "<I>Where thou lodgest I will lodge,</I> 
 though it be in a cottage, nay, though it be no better a lodging than 
 Jacob had when he had the stones for his pillow. Where thou settest up 
 thy staff I will set up mine, be it where it may." <I>Thirdly,</I> She 
 will twist interest with her: <I>Thy people shall be my people.</I> 
 From Naomi's character she concludes certainly that the great nation 
 was a wise and an understanding people. She judges of them all by her 
 good mother, who, wherever she went, was a credit to her country (as 
 all those should study to be who profess relation to the better 
 country, that is, the heavenly), and therefore she will think herself 
 happy if she may be reckoned one of them. "Thy people shall be mine to 
 associate with, to be conformable to, and to be concerned for." 
 <I>Fourthly,</I> She will join in religion with her. Thus she 
 determined to be hers <I>usque ad aras--to the very altars: "Thy God 
 shall be my God,</I> and farewell to all the gods of Moab, which are 
 vanity and a lie. I will adore the God of Israel, the only living and 
 true God, trust in him alone, serve him, and in every thing be ruled 
 by him;" this is to take the Lord for our God. <I>Fifthly,</I> She 
 will gladly die in the same bed: <I>Where thou diest will I die.</I> 
 She takes it for granted they must both die, and that in all 
 probability Naomi, as the elder, would die first, and resolves to 
 continue in the same house, if it might be, till her days also were 
 fulfilled, intimating likewise a desire to partake of her happiness in 
 death; she wishes to die in the same place, in token of her dying 
 after the same manner. "Let me die the death of righteous Naomi, and 
 let my last end be like hers." <I>Sixthly,</I> She will desire to be 
 buried in the same grave, and to lay her bones by hers: <I>There will 
 I be buried,</I> not desiring to have so much as her dead body carried 
 back to the country of Moab, in token of any remaining kindness for 
 it; but, Naomi and she having joined souls, she desires they may 
 mingle dust, in hopes of rising together, and being together for ever 
 in the other world. 

 [3.] She backs her resolution to adhere to Naomi with a solemn oath: 
 <I>The Lord do so to me, and more also</I> (which was an ancient form 
 of imprecation), <I>if aught but death part thee and me.</I> An oath 
 for confirmation was an end of this strife, and would leave a lasting 
 obligation upon her never to forsake that good way she was now making 
 choice of. <I>First,</I> It is implied that death would separate 
 between them for a time. She could promise to die and be buried in the 
 same place, but not at the same time; it might so happen that she 
 might die first, and this would part them. Note, Death parts those 
 whom nothing else will part. A dying hour is a parting hour, and 
 should be so thought of by us and prepared for. <I>Secondly,</I> It
 is resolved that nothing else should part them; not any kindness from 
 her own family and people, nor any hope of preferment among them, not 
 any unkindness from Israel, nor the fear of poverty and disgrace among 
 them. "No, I will <I>never leave thee.</I>" Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) This is a pattern of a resolute convert to God and religion. Thus 
 must we be at a point. 

 [1.] We must take the Lord for our God. "This God is <I>my God for 
 ever and ever;</I> I have avouched him for mine." 

 [2.] When we take God for our God we must take his people for our 
 people in all conditions; though they be a poor despised people, yet, 
 if they be his, they must be ours. 

 [3.] Having cast in our lot among them, we must be willing to take our 
 lot with them and to fare as they fare. We must submit to the same 
 yoke and draw in it faithfully, take up the same cross and carry it 
 cheerfully, go where God will have us to go, though it should be into 
 banishment, and lodge where he will have us to lodge, though it be in 
 a prison, die where he will have us die, and lay our bones in the 
 graves of the upright, who enter into peace and rest in their beds, 
 though they be but the <I>graves of the common people.</I> 

 [4.] We must resolve to continue and persevere, and herein our 
 adherence to Christ must be closer than that of Ruth to Naomi. She 
 resolved that nothing but death should separate them; but we must 
 resolve that death itself shall not separate us from our duty to 
 Christ, and then we may be sure that death itself shall not separate 
 us from our happiness in Christ. 

 [5.] We must bind our souls with a bond never to break these pious 
 resolutions, and swear unto the Lord that we will cleave to him. Fast
 bind, fast find. He that means honestly does not startle at 
 assurances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. Naomi is hereby silenced 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>When she saw that Ruth was stedfastly minded to go with her</I>
 (which was the very thing she aimed at in all that she had said, to 
 make her of a stedfast mind in going with her), when she saw that she 
 had gained her point, she was well satisfied, and <I>left off speaking 
 to her.</I> She could desire no more than that solemn protestation 
 which Ruth had just now made. See the power of resolution, how it puts 
 temptation to silence. Those that are unresolved, and go in religious 
 ways without a stedfast mind, tempt the tempter, and stand like a door 
 half open, which invites a thief; but resolution shuts and bolts the 
 door, resists the devil, and forces him to flee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Chaldee paraphrase thus relates the debate between Naomi and 
 Ruth:--Ruth said, <I>Entreat me not to leave thee,</I> for <I>I will be
 a proselyte.</I> Naomi said, <I>We are commanded to keep sabbaths and 
 good days, on which we may not travel above 2000 cubits</I>--a
 sabbath-day's journey. <I>Well,</I> said Ruth, <I>whither thou goest I 
 will go.</I> Naomi said, <I>We are commanded not to tarry all night 
 with Gentiles. Well,</I> said Ruth, <I>where thou lodgest I will 
 lodge.</I> Naomi said, <I>We are commanded to keep 613 precepts. 
 Well,</I> said Ruth, <I>whatever thy people keep I will keep, for they 
 shall be my people.</I> Naomi said, <I>We are forbidden to worship any 
 strange god. Well,</I> said Ruth, <I>thy God shall be my God.</I> Naomi 
 said, <I>We have four sorts of deaths for malefactors, stoning, 
 burning, strangling, and slaying with the sword. Well,</I> said Ruth, 
 <I>where thou diest I will die. We have,</I> said Naomi, <I>houses of 
 sepulchre. And there,</I> said Ruth, <I>will I be buried.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came
 to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was
 moved about them, and they said, <I>Is</I> this Naomi?
 &nbsp; 20 And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for
 the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.
 &nbsp; 21 I went out full, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath brought me home again
 empty: why <I>then</I> call ye me Naomi, seeing the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?
 &nbsp; 22 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in
 law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and
 they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Naomi and Ruth, after many a weary step (the fatigue of the journey, we 
 may suppose, being somewhat relieved by the good instructions Naomi 
 gave to her proselyte and the good discourse they had together), came 
 at last to Bethlehem. And they came very seasonably, <I>in the 
 beginning of the barley-harvest,</I> which was the first of their 
 harvests, that of wheat following after. Now Naomi's own eyes might 
 convince her of the truth of what she had heard in the country of Moab, 
 that <I>the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread,</I> and 
 Ruth might see this good land in its best state; and now they had 
 opportunity to provide for winter. Our <I>times are in God's hand,</I> 
 both the events and the time of them. Notice is here taken,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the discomposure of the neighbours upon this occasion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 <I>All the city was moved about them.</I> Her old acquaintance gathered
 about her, to enquire concerning her state, and to bid her welcome to 
 Bethlehem again. Or perhaps they were <I>moved about her,</I> lest she 
 should be a charge to the town, she looked so bare. By this it appears 
 that she had formerly lived respectably, else there would not have been 
 so much notice taken of her. If those that have been in a high and 
 prosperous condition break, or fall into poverty or disgrace, their 
 fall is the more remarkable. And they said, <I>Is this Naomi?</I> The 
 <I>women</I> of the city said it, for the word is feminine. Those with 
 whom she had formerly been intimate were surprised to see her in this 
 condition; she was so much broken and altered with her afflictions that 
 they could scarcely believe their own eyes, nor think that this was the 
 same person whom they had formerly seen, so fresh, and fair, and gay: 
 <I>Is this Naomi?</I> So unlike is the rose when it is withered to what 
 it was when it was blooming. What a poor figure does Naomi make now, 
 compared with what she made in her prosperity! If any asked this
 question in contempt, upbraiding her with her miseries ("is this she
 that could not be content to fare as her neighbours did, but must
 ramble to a strange country? see what she has got by it!"), their
 temper was very base and sordid. Nothing more barbarous than to triumph 
 over those that are fallen. But we may suppose that the generality 
 asked it in compassion and commiseration: "Is this she that lived so 
 plentifully, and kept so good a house, and was so charitable to the 
 poor? <I>How has the gold become dim!</I>" Those that had seen the 
 magnificence of the first temple wept when they saw the meanness of the 
 second; so these here. Note, Afflictions will make great and surprising 
 changes in a little time. When we see how sickness and old age alter 
 people, change their countenance and temper, we may think of what the 
 Bethlehemites said: "<I>Is this Naomi?</I> One would not take it to be 
 the same person." God, by his grace, fit us for all such changes, 
 especially the great change!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the composure of Naomi's spirit. If some upbraided her with her 
 poverty, she was not moved against them, as she would have been if she 
 had been poor and proud; but, with a great deal of pious patience, bore 
 that and all the other melancholy effects of her affliction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>):

 <I>Call me not Naomi, call me Mara,</I> &c. "<I>Naomi</I> signifies
 <I>pleasant</I> or <I>amiable;</I> but all my pleasant things are laid 
 waste; call me <I>Mara, bitter</I> or <I>bitterness,</I> for I am now 
 a woman of a sorrowful spirit." Thus does she bring her mind to her 
 condition, which we all ought to do when our condition is not in every 
 thing to our mind. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The change of her state, and how it is described, with a pious 
 regard to the divine providence, and without any passionate murmurings 
 or complaints. 

 (1.) It was a very sad and melancholy change. She <I>went out 
 full;</I> so she thought herself when she had her husband with her and 
 two sons. Much of the fulness of our comfort in this world arises from 
 agreeable relations. But she now <I>came home again empty,</I> a widow 
 and childless, and probably had sold her goods, and of all the effects 
 she took with her brought home no more than the clothes on her back. 
 So uncertain is all that which we call fulness in the creature,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:5">1 Sam. ii. 5</A>.

 Even in the fulness of that sufficiency we may be in straits. But
 there is a fulness, a spiritual and divine fulness, which we can never 
 be emptied of, a good part which shall not be <I>taken from those that 
 have it.</I> 

 (2.) She acknowledges the hand of God, his mighty hand, in the 
 affliction. "It is the Lord that has <I>brought me home again 
 empty;</I> it is the Almighty that has afflicted me." Note, Nothing 
 conduces more to satisfy a gracious soul under an affliction than the 
 consideration of the hand of God in it. <I>It is the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:18,Job+1:21">1 Sam. iii. 18; Job i. 21</A>.

 Especially to consider that he who afflicts us is <I>Shaddai,</I> the
 <I>Almighty,</I> with whom it is folly to contend and to whom it is 
 our duty and interest to submit. It is that name of God by which he 
 enters into covenant with his people: <I>I am God Almighty, God 
 All-sufficient,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:1">Gen. xvii. 1</A>.

 He afflicts as a God in covenant, and his all-sufficiency may be our
 support and supply under all our afflictions. He that empties us of 
 the creature knows how to fill us with himself.

 (3.) She speaks very feelingly of the impression which the affliction 
 had made upon her: He has <I>dealt very bitterly with me.</I> The cup 
 of affliction is a bitter cup, and even that which afterwards 
 <I>yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness,</I> yet, for the 
 present, is <I>not joyous, but grievous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:11">Heb. xii. 11</A>.

 Job complains, <I>Thou writest bitter things against me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:26">Job xiii. 26</A>.

 (4.) She owns the affliction to come from God as a controversy: <I>The
 Lord hath testified against me.</I> Note, When God corrects us he 
 <I>testifies against us</I> and contends with us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:17">Job x. 17</A>),
 
 intimating that he is displeased with us. Every rod has a voice, the
 voice of a witness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The compliance of her spirit with this change: "<I>Call me not 
 Naomi,</I> for I am no more pleasant, either to myself or to my 
 friends; <I>but call me Mara,</I> a name more agreeable to my present 
 state." Many that are debased and impoverished yet affect to be called 
 by the empty names and titles of honour they have formerly enjoyed. 
 Naomi did not so. Her humility regards not a glorious name in a 
 dejected state. If God deal bitterly with her, she will accommodate 
 herself to the dispensation, and is willing to be called <I>Mara,
 bitter.</I> Note, It well becomes us to have our hearts humbled under 
 humbling providences. When our condition is brought down our spirits 
 should be brought down with it. And then our troubles are sanctified to 
 us when we thus comport with them; for it is not an affliction itself, 
 but an affliction rightly borne, that does us good. <I>Perdidisti tot 
 mala, si nondum misera esse didicisti--So many calamities have been lost
 upon you if you have not yet learned how to suffer.</I> Sen. ad Helv. 
 <I>Tribulation works patience.</I></P>
