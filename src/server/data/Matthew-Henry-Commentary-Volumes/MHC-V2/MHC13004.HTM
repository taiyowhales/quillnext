 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The sons of Judah; Pharez, Hezron, and Carmi, and Hur, and
 Shobal.
 &nbsp; 2  And Reaiah the son of Shobal begat Jahath; and Jahath begat
 Ahumai, and Lahad. These <I>are</I> the families of the Zorathites.

 &nbsp; 5  And Ashur the father of Tekoa had two wives, Helah and
 Naarah.
 &nbsp; 6  And Naarah bare him Ahuzam, and Hepher, and Temeni, and

 wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine
 hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep <I>me</I> from
 evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which
 he requested.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 One reason, no doubt, why Ezra is here most particular in the register 
 of the tribe of Judah is because it was that tribe which, with its 
 appendages, Simeon, Benjamin, and Levi, made up the kingdom of Judah, 
 which not only long survived the other tribes in Canaan, but in process 
 of time, now when this was written, returned out of captivity, when the 
 generality of the other tribes were lost in the kingdom of Assyria. The 
 most remarkable person in this paragraph is Jabez. It is not said whose 
 son he was, nor does it appear in what age he lived; but, it should 
 seem, he was the founder of one of the families of Aharhel, mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The reason of his name: his mother gave him the name with this 
 reason, <I>Because I bore him with sorrow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 All children are borne with sorrow (for the sentence upon the woman is,
 <I>In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children</I>), but some with much 
 more sorrow than others. Usually the sorrow in bearing is afterwards 
 forgotten <I>for joy that the child is born;</I> but here it seems it 
 was so extraordinary that it was remembered when the child came to be 
 circumcised, and care was taken to perpetuate the remembrance of it 
 while he lived. Perhaps the mother called Habez, as Rachel called her 
 son Benoni, when she was dying of the sorrow. Or, if she recovered it, 
 yet thus she recorded it,

 1. That it might be a continual memorandum to herself, to be thankful
 to God as long as she lived for supporting her under and bringing her 
 through that sorrow. It may be of use to be often reminded of our 
 sorrows, that we may always have such thoughts of things as we had in 
 the day of our affliction, and may learn to rejoice with trembling. 

 2.  That it might likewise be a memorandum to him what this world is
 into which she bore him, a vale of tears, in which he must expect 
 <I>few days and full of trouble.</I> The sorrow he carried in his name 
 might help to put a seriousness upon his spirit. It might also remind 
 him to love and honour his mother, and labour, in every thing, to be a 
 comfort to her who brought him into the world with so much sorrow. It 
 is piety in children thus to requite their parents, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:4">1 Tim. v. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The eminence of his character: <I>He was more honourable than his 
 brethren,</I> qualified above them by the divine grace and dignified 
 above them by the divine providence; they did virtuously, but he 
 excelled them all. Now the sorrow with which his mother bore him was 
 abundantly recompensed. That son which of all her children cost her 
 most dear she was most happy in, and was made glad in proportion to the 
 affliction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:15">Ps. xc. 15</A>.

 We are not told upon what account he was <I>more honourable than his
 brethren,</I> whether because he raised a greater estate, or was 
 preferred to the magistracy, or signalized himself in war; we have most 
 reason to think it was upon the account of his learning and piety, not 
 only because these, above any thing, put honour upon a man, but because 
 we have reason to think that in these Jabez was eminent.

 1. In learning, because we find that <I>the families of the scribes
 dwelt at Jabez</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:55"><I>ch.</I> ii. 55</A>),

 a city which, it is likely, took its name from him. The Jews say that
 he was a famous doctor of the law and left many disciples behind him. 
 And it should seem, by the mentioning of him so abruptly here, that his 
 name was well known when Ezra wrote this. 

 2. In piety, because we find here that he was a praying man. His
 inclination to devotion made him truly honourable, and by prayer he 
 obtained those blessings from God which added much to his honour. The 
 way to be truly great is to be truly good and to pray much.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The prayer he made, probably like Solomon's prayer for wisdom, 
 just when he was setting out in the world. He set himself to 
 acknowledge God in all his ways, put himself under the divine blessing 
 and protection, and prospered accordingly. Perhaps these were the heads 
 on which he enlarged in his daily prayers; for this purpose it was his 
 constant practice to pray alone, and with his family, as Daniel. Some 
 think that it was upon some particular occasion, when he was straitened 
 and threatened by his enemies, that he prayed this prayer.  
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To whom he prayed, not to any of the gods of the Gentiles; no, he 
 <I>called on the God of Israel,</I> the living and true God, who alone 
 can hear and answer prayer, and in prayer had an eye to him as the God 
 of Israel, a God in covenant with his people, the God with whom Jacob 
 wrestled and prevailed and was thence called Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What was the nature of his prayer. 

 (1.) As the <I>margin</I> reads it, it was a solemn vow--<I>If thou
 wilt bless me indeed, &c.</I> and then the sense is imperfect, but may 
 easily be filled up from Jacob's vow, or some such like--<I>then thou 
 shalt be my God.</I> He did not express his promise, but left it to be 
 understood, either because he was afraid to promise in his own strength 
 or because he resolved to devote himself entirely to God. He does, as 
 it were, give God a blank paper, let him write what he pleases: "Lord, 
 if thou wilt bless me and keep me, do what thou wilt with me, I will be 
 at thy command and disposal for ever."

 (2.) As the <I>text</I> reads it, it was the language of a most ardent
 and affectionate desire: <I>O that thou wouldst bless me!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What was the matter of his prayer. Four things he prayed for:--

 (1.) That God would bless him indeed: "That, <I>blessing, thou wilt
 bless me,</I> bless me greatly with manifold and abundant blessings." 
 Perhaps he had an eye to the promise God made to Abraham

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:17">Gen. xxii. 17</A>),

 <I>In blessing, I will bless thee.</I> "Let that blessing of Abraham
 come upon me." Spiritual blessings are the best blessings, and those 
 are blessed indeed who are blessed with them. God's blessings are real 
 things and produce real effects. We can but wish a blessing: he 
 commands it. Those whom he blesses are blessed indeed.

 (2.) That he would enlarge his coast, that he would prosper his
 endeavours for the increase of what fell to his lot either by work or 
 war. That God would enlarge our hearts, and so enlarge our portion in 
 himself and in the heavenly Canaan, ought to be our desire and prayer.

 (3.) That God's hand might be with him. The prayer of Moses for this
 tribe of Judah was, That his own <I>hands might be sufficient for 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:7">Deut. xxxiii. 7</A>;

 but Jabez expects not that this can be the case, unless he have 
 <I>God's</I> hand with him and the presence of his power. God's hand 
 with us, to lead us, protect us, strengthen us, and to work all our 
 works in us and for us, is indeed a hand sufficient for us, 
 all-sufficient. 

 (4.) That he would keep him from evil, the evil of sin, the evil of
 trouble, all the evil designs of his enemies, that they might not hurt 
 him, nor grieve him, nor make him a <I>Jabez</I> indeed, <I>a man of 
 sorrow:</I> in the original there is an allusion to his name. <I>Father 
 in heaven, deliver me from evil.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. What was the success of his prayer: <I>God granted him that which he 
 requested,</I> prospered him remarkably, and gave him success in his 
 undertakings, in his studies, in his worldly business, in his conflicts 
 with the Canaanites, and so he became <I>more honourable than his 
 brethren.</I> God was of old always ready to hear prayer, and <I>his 
 ear is not yet heavy.</I></P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe in these verses, 

 1. That here is a whole family of craftsmen, handicraft tradesmen, that
 applied themselves to all sorts of manufactures, in which they were 
 ingenious and industrious above their neighbours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 There was a valley where they lived which was, from them, called <I>the
 valley of craftsmen.</I> Those that are craftsmen are not therefore to 
 be looked upon as mean men. These craftsmen, though two of a trade 
 often disagree, yet chose to live together, for the improving of arts 
 by comparing notes, and that they might support one another's 
 reputation.

 2. That one of these married the daughter of Pharaoh

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 which was the common name of the kings of Egypt. If an Israelite in
 Egypt before the bondage began, while Joseph's merits were yet fresh in 
 mind, was preferred to be the king's son-in-law, it is not to be 
 thought strange: few Israelites could, like Moses, refuse an alliance 
 with the court. 

 3. That another is said to be the <I>father of the house of those that
 wrought fine linen,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 It is inserted in their genealogy as their honour that they were the
 best weavers in the kingdom, and they brought up their children, from 
 one generation to another, to the same business, not aiming to make 
 them gentlemen. This Laadah is said to be the <I>father of those that 
 wrought fine linen,</I> as before the flood Jubal is said to be <I>the 
 father of musicians</I> and Jabal of <I>shepherds,</I> &c. His 
 posterity inhabited the city of Mareshah, the manufacture or staple 
 commodity of which place was linen-cloth, with which their kings and 
 priests were clothed. 

 4. That another family had had <I>dominion in Moab,</I> but were now in
 <I>servitude in Babylon,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+4:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 (1.) It was found among the <I>ancient things</I> that they had the
 <I>dominion in Moab.</I> Probably in David's time, when that country 
 was conquered, they transplanted themselves thither, and were put in 
 places of power there, which they held for several generations; but 
 this was a great while ago, time out of mind.

 (2.) Their posterity were now potters and gardeners, as is supposed in
 Babylon, where they <I>dwelt with the king for his work,</I> got a good 
 livelihood by their industry, and therefore cared not for returning 
 with their brethren to their own land, after the years of captivity had 
 expired. Those that now have dominion know not what their posterity may 
 be reduced to, nor what mean employments they may be glad to take up 
 with. But those were unworthy the name of <I>Israelites</I> that would 
 dwell among <I>plants and hedges</I> rather than be at the pains to 
 return to Canaan.</P>

 <I>and</I> Shaul:
 &nbsp; 25  Shallum his son, Mibsam his son, Mishma his son.
 &nbsp; 26  And the sons of Mishma; Hamuel his son, Zacchur his son,
 Shimei his son.
 &nbsp; 27  And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters; but his
 brethren had not many children, neither did all their family
 multiply, like to the children of Judah.
 &nbsp; 28  And they dwelt at Beer-sheba, and Moladah, and Hazar-shual,
 &nbsp; 29  And at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad,
 &nbsp; 30  And at Bethuel, and at Hormah, and at Ziklag,
 &nbsp; 31  And at Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susim, and at Beth-birei, and
 at Shaaraim. These <I>were</I> their cities unto the reign of David.
 &nbsp; 32  And their villages <I>were,</I> Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and
 Tochen, and Ashan, five cities:
 &nbsp; 33  And all their villages that <I>were</I> round about the same
 cities, unto Baal. These <I>were</I> their habitations, and their
 genealogy.
 &nbsp; 34  And Meshobab, and Jamlech, and Joshah the son of Amaziah,
 &nbsp; 35  And Joel, and Jehu the son of Josibiah, the son of Seraiah,
 the son of Asiel,
 &nbsp; 36  And Elioenai, and Jaakobah, and Jeshohaiah, and Asaiah, and
 Adiel, and Jesimiel, and Benaiah,
 &nbsp; 37  And Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of
 Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah;
 &nbsp; 38  These mentioned by <I>their</I> names <I>were</I> princes in their
 families: and the house of their fathers increased greatly.
 &nbsp; 39  And they went to the entrance of Gedor, <I>even</I> unto the east
 side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.
 &nbsp; 40  And they found fat pasture and good, and the land <I>was</I>
 wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for <I>they</I> of Ham had dwelt there
 of old.
 &nbsp; 41  And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king
 of Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were
 found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and dwelt
 in their rooms: because <I>there was</I> pasture there for their
 flocks.
 &nbsp; 42  And <I>some</I> of them, <I>even</I> of the sons of Simeon, five
 hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains
 Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of
 Ishi.
 &nbsp; 43  And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped,
 and dwelt there unto this day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here some of the genealogies of the tribe of Simeon (though it 
 was not a tribe of great note), especially the princes of that tribe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+4:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 Of this tribe it is said that they <I>increased greatly,</I> but <I>not
 like the children of Judah,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+4:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Those whom God increases ought to be thankful, though they see others
 that are more increased.  Here observe,

 1. The cities allotted them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+4:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),
 
 of which see
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:1-9">Joshua xix. 1</A>,

 &c. When it is said that they were theirs <I>unto the reign of
 David</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+4:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>)

 intimation is given that when the ten tribes revolted from the house of
 David many of the Simeonites quitted these cities, because they lay 
 within Judah, and seated themselves elsewhere. 

 2. The ground they got elsewhere. When those of this tribe that
 revolted from the house of David were carried captive with the rest 
 into Assyria those that adhered to Judah were remarkably owned of God 
 and prospered in their endeavours to enlarge their coasts. It was in 
 the days of Hezekiah that a generation of Simeonites, whose tribe had 
 long crouched and truckled, was animated to make these bold efforts.

 (1.) Some of them attacked a place in Arabia, as it should seem, called
 <I>the entrance of Gedor,</I> inhabited by the posterity of accursed 
 Ham

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+4:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 made themselves masters of it, and dwelt there. This adds to the glory
 of Hezekiah's pious reign, that, as his kingdom in general prospered, 
 so did particular families. It is said that they found fat pastures, 
 and yet <I>the land was quiet;</I> even when the kings of Assyria were 
 giving disturbance to all their neighbours this land escaped their 
 alarms. The inhabitants being shepherds, who molested none, were not 
 themselves molested, till the Simeonites came and drove them out and 
 succeeded them, not only in the plenty, but in the peace, of their 
 land. Those who dwell (as we do) in a fruitful country, and whose land 
 is wide, and quiet, and peaceable, have reason to own themselves 
 indebted to that God who <I>appoints the bounds of our habitation.</I>

 (2.) Others of them, to the number of 500, under the command of four
 brethren here named, made a descent upon Mount Seir, and smote the 
 remainder of the devoted Amalekites, and took possession of their 
 country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+4:42,43"><I>v.</I> 42, 43</A>.

 Now the curses on Ham and Amalek had a further accomplishment, when
 they seemed dormant, if not dead; as had also the curse on Simeon, that 
 he should be divided and scattered

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:7">Gen. xlix. 7</A>):
