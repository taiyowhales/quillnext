 The revolution in the kingdom of Israel was soon perfected in Jehu's 
 settlement; we must now enquire into the affairs of the kingdom of 
 Judah, which lost its head (such as it was) at the same time, and by 
 the same hand, as Israel lost its head; but things continued longer 
 there in distraction than in Israel, yet, after some years, they were 
 brought into a good posture, as we find in this chapter. 

 I. Athaliah usurps the government and destroys all the seed-royal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II.  Joash, a child of a year old, is wonderfully preserved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.
 
 III.  At six years' end he is produced, and, by the agency of Jehoiada,
 made king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:4-12">ver. 4-12</A>.

 IV. Athaliah is slain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>.

 V.  Both the civil and religious interests of the kingdom are well
 settled in the hands of Joash, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:17-21">ver.  17-21</A>.

 And thus, after some interruption, things returned with advantage into 
 the old channel.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
 dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.
 &nbsp; 2 But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,
 took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the
 king's sons <I>which were</I> slain; and they hid him, <I>even</I> him and
 his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not
 slain.
 &nbsp; 3 And he was with her hid in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> six years.
 And Athaliah did reign over the land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God had assured David of the continuance of his family, which is called 
 his <I>ordaining a lamp for his anointed;</I> and this cannot but 
 appear a great thing, now that we have read of the utter extirpation of 
 so many royal families, one after another.  Now here we have David's 
 promised lamp almost extinguished and yet wonderfully preserved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It was almost extinguished by the barbarous malice of Athaliah, the 
 queen-mother, who, when she heard that her son Ahaziah was slain by 
 Jehu, <I>arose and destroyed all the seed-royal</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 all that she knew to be akin to the crown. Her husband Jehoram had 
 slain all his brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+21:4">2 Chron. xxi. 4</A>.

 The Arabians had slain all Jehoram's sons except Ahaziah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+22:1">2 Chron. xxii. 1</A>.

 Jehu had slain all their sons

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+22:8">2 Chron. xxii. 8</A>)

 and Ahaziah himself. Surely never was royal blood so profusely shed.
 Happy the men of inferior birth, who live below envy and emulation! 
 But, as if all this were but a small matter, Athaliah destroyed all 
 that were left of the seed-royal. It was strange that one of the tender 
 sex could be so barbarous, that one who had been herself a king's 
 daughter, a king's wife, and a king's mother, could be so barbarous to 
 a royal family, and a family into which she was herself ingrafted; but 
 she did it, 

 1. From a spirit of ambition. She thirsted after rule, and thought she 
 could not get to it any other way. That none might reign with her, she 
 slew even the infants and sucklings that might have reigned after her. 
 For fear of a competitor, not any must be reserved for a successor. 

 2.  From a spirit of revenge and rage against God.  The house of Ahab
 being utterly destroyed, and her son Ahaziah among the rest, because he 
 was akin to it, she resolved, as it were, by way of reprisal, to 
 destroy the house of David, and cut off his line, in defiance of God's 
 promise to perpetuate it--a foolish attempt and fruitless, for who can 
 disannul what God hath purposed? Grandmothers have been thought more 
 fond of their grandchildren than they were of their own; yet Ahaziah's 
 own mother is the wilful murderer of Ahaziah own sons, and in their 
 infancy too, when she was obliged, above any other, to nurse them and 
 take care of them. Well might she be called <I>Athaliah, that wicked 
 woman</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:7">2 Chron. xxiv. 7</A>),

 Jezebel's own daughter; yet herein God was righteous, and visited the
 iniquity of Joram and Ahaziah, those degenerate branches of David's 
 house, upon their children.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It was wonderfully preserved by the pious care of one of Joram's 
 daughters (who was wife to Jehoiada the priest), who stole away one of 
 the king's sons, Joash by name, and hid him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 This was a brand plucked out of the fire; what number were slain we are 
 not told, but, it seems, this being a child in the nurse's arms was not 
 missed, or not enquired after, or at least no found. The person that 
 delivered him was his own aunt, the daughter of wicked Joram; for God 
 will raise up protectors for those whom he will have protected. The 
 place of his safety was the house of the Lord, one of the chambers 
 belonging to the temple, a place Athaliah seldom troubled. His aunt, by 
 bringing him hither, put him under God's special protection, and so hid 
 him by faith, as Moses was hidden. Now were David's words made good to 
 one of his seed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:5">Ps. xxvii. 5</A>),

 <I>In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me.</I> With good
 reason did this Joash, when he grew up, set himself to repair the house 
 of the Lord, for it had been a sanctuary to him.  Now was the promise 
 made to David bound up in one life, and yet it did not fail. Thus to 
 the son of David will God, according to his promise, secure a spiritual 
 seed, which, though sometimes reduced to a small number, brought very 
 low, and seemingly lost, will be perpetuated to the end of time, hidden 
 sometimes and unseen, but hidden in God's pavilion and unhurt. It was a 
 special providence that Joram, though a king, a wicked king, married 
 his daughter to Jehoiada a priest, a godly priest. Some perhaps thought 
 it a disparagement to the royal family to marry a daughter to a 
 clergyman, but it proved a happy marriage, and the saving of the royal 
 family from ruin; for Jehoiada's interest in the temple gave <I>her</I> 
 an opportunity to preserve the child, and her interest in the royal 
 family gave <I>him</I> an opportunity to set him on the throne. See the 
 wisdom and care of Providence, and how it prepares for what it designs; 
 and see what blessings those lay up in store for their families that 
 marry their children to those that are wise and good.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers
 over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them
 to him into the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and made a covenant with them,
 and took an oath of them in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and showed
 them the king's son.
 &nbsp; 5 And he commanded them, saying, This <I>is</I> the thing that ye
 shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall
 even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;
 &nbsp; 6 And a third part <I>shall be</I> at the gate of Sur; and a third
 part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of
 the house, that it be not broken down.
 &nbsp; 7 And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even
 they shall keep the watch of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> about the
 king.
 &nbsp; 8 And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his
 weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let
 him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he
 cometh in.
 &nbsp; 9 And the captains over the hundreds did according to all
 <I>things</I> that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every
 man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that
 should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
 &nbsp; 10 And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king
 David's spears and shields, that <I>were</I> in the temple of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 11 And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand,
 round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the
 left corner of the temple, <I>along</I> by the altar and the temple.
 &nbsp; 12 And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon
 him, and <I>gave him</I> the testimony; and they made him king, and
 anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save
 the king.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Six years Athaliah tyrannised. We have not a particular account of her 
 reign; no doubt it was of a piece with the beginning. While Jehu was 
 extirpating the worship of Baal in Israel, she was establishing it in 
 Judah, as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:7">2 Chron. xxiv. 7</A>.

 The court and kingdom of Judah had been debauched by their alliance
 with the house of Ahab, and now one of that house is a curse and a 
 plague to both: sinful friendships speed no better. All this while, 
 Joash lay hid, entitled to a crown and intended for it, and yet buried 
 alive in obscurity. Though the sons and heirs of heaven are now hidden, 
 <I>the world knows them not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:1">1 John iii. 1</A>),

 yet the time is fixed when they shall appear in glory, as Joash in his
 seventh year; by that time he was ready to be shown, not a babe, but, 
 having served his first apprenticeship to life and arrived at his first 
 climacterical year, he had taken a good step towards manhood; by that 
 time the people had grown weary of Athaliah's tyranny and ripe for a 
 revolution. How that revolution was effected we are here told.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The manager of this great affair was Jehoiada the priest, probably 
 the high priest, or at least the <I>sagan</I> (as the Jews called him) 
 or suffragan to the high priest. By his birth and office he was a man 
 in authority, whom the people were bound by the law to observe and 
 obey, especially when there was no rightful king upon the throne, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:12">Deut. xvii. 12</A>.

 By marriage he was allied to the royal family, and, if all the
 seed-royal were destroyed, his wife, as daughter to Joram, had a better 
 title to the crown than Athaliah had. By his eminent gifts and graces 
 he was fitted to serve his country, and better service he could not do 
 it than to free it from Athaliah's usurpation; and we have reason to 
 think he did not make this attempt till he had first asked counsel of 
 God and known his mind, either by prophets or Urim, perhaps by 
 both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The management was very discreet and as became so wise and good a 
 man as Jehoiada was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He concerted the matter with the <I>rulers of hundreds and the 
 captains,</I> the men in office, ecclesiastical, civil, and military; 
 he got them to him to the temple, consulted with them, laid before them 
 the grievances they at present laboured under, gave them an oath of 
 secresy, and, finding them free and forward to join with him, <I>showed 
 them the king's son</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and so well satisfied were they with his fidelity that they saw no 
 reason to suspect an imposition. We may well think what a pleasing 
 surprise it was to the good people among them, who feared that the 
 house and lineage of David were quite cut off, to find such a spark as 
 this in the embers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He posted the priests and Levites, who were more immediately under 
 his direction, in the several avenues to the temple, to keep the guard, 
 putting them under the command of the <I>rulers of hundreds,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 David had divided the priests into courses, which waited by turns.
 Every sabbath-day morning a new company came into waiting, but the 
 company of the foregoing week did not go out of waiting till the 
 sabbath evening, so that on the sabbath day, when double service was to 
 be done, there was a double number to do it, both those that were to 
 come in and those that were to go out. These Jehoiada employed to 
 attend on this great occasion; he armed them out of the magazines of 
 the temple with David's spears and shields, either his own or those he 
 had taken from his enemies, which he devoted to God's honour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 If they were old and unfashionable, yet those that used them might, by
 their being David's, be reminded of God's covenant with him, which they 
 were now acting in the defence of. Two things they were ordered to 
 do:--

 (1.) To protect the young king from being insulted; they must <I>keep 
 the watch of the king's house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>compass the king, and be with him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 to guard him from Athaliah's partizans, for still there were those that 
 thirsted after royal blood.

 (2.) To preserve the holy temple from being profaned by the concourse 
 of people that would come together on this occasion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Keep the watch of the house, that it be</I> neither broken through 
 nor broken down, and so strangers should crowd in, or such as were 
 unclean. He was not so zealous for the projected revolution as to 
 forget his religion.  In times of the greatest hurry care must be 
 taken, <I>Ne detrimentum capiat ecclesia</I>--<I>That the holy things 
 of God be not trenched upon.</I> It is observable that Jehoiada 
 appointed to each his place as well as his work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>),

 for good order contributes very much to the expediting and 
 accomplishing of any great enterprise. Let every man know, and keep, 
 and make good, his post, and then the work will be done quickly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. When the guards were fixed, then the king was brought forth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 <I>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion!</I> for even in thy holy
 mountain thy king appears, a child indeed, but not such a one as brings 
 a woe upon the land, for he is the son of nobles, the son of David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:17">Eccl. x. 17</A>)--

 a child indeed, but he had a good guardian, and, which was better, a
 good God, to go to. Jehoiada, without delay, proceeded to the 
 coronation of this young king; for, though he was not yet capable of 
 despatching business, he would be growing up towards it by degrees.  
 This was done with great solemnity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 (1.) In token of his being invested with kingly power, he <I>put the 
 crown upon him,</I> though it was yet too large and heavy for his head. 
 The regalia, it is probable, were kept in the temple, and so the crown 
 was ready at hand. 

 (2.) In token of his obligation to govern by law, and to make the word 
 of God his rule, he gave him the testimony, put into his hand a Bible, 
 in which he must <I>read all the days of his life,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:18,19">Deut. xvii. 18, 19</A>.
 
 (3.) In token of his receiving the Spirit, to qualify him for this
 great work to which he before was called, he anointed him. Though 
 notice is taken of the anointing of the kings only in case of 
 interruption, as here, and in Solomon's case, yet I know not but the 
 ceremony might be used for all their kings, at least those of the house 
 of David, because their royalty was typical of Christ's, who was to be 
 anointed above his fellows, above all the sons of David. 

 (4.) In token of the people's acceptance of him and subjection to his
 government, they clapped their hands for joy, and expressed their 
 hearty good wishes to him: <I>Let the king live;</I> and thus they made 
 him king, made him their king, consented to, and concurred with, the 
 divine appointment. They had reason to rejoice in the period now put to 
 Athaliah's tyranny, and the prospect they had of the restoration and 
 establishment of religion by a king under the tuition of so good a man 
 as Jehoiada. They had reason to bid him welcome to the crown whose 
 right it was, and to pray, <I>Let him live,</I> concerning him who came 
 to them as life from the dead and in whom the house of David was to 
 live. With such acclamations of joy and satisfaction must the kingdom 
 of Christ be welcomed into our hearts when his throne is set up there 
 and Satan the usurper is deposed. <I>Hosanna, blessed is he that 
 comes:</I> clap hands, and say, "Let King Jesus live, for ever live and 
 reign, in my soul, and in all the world;" it is promised 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:15">Ps. lxxii. 15</A>),
 
 <I>He shall live, and prayer shall be made for him,</I> and his
 kingdom, <I>continually.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard <I>and</I> of the
 people, she came to the people into the temple of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 14 And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as
 the manner <I>was,</I> and the princes and the trumpeters by the king,
 and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets:
 and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.
 &nbsp; 15 But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the
 hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her
 forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with
 the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the
 house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 16 And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the
 which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she
 slain.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may suppose it was designed when they had finished the solemnity of 
 the king's inauguration, to pay a visit to Athaliah, and call her to an 
 account for her murders, usurpation, and tyranny; but, like her mother 
 Jezebel, she saved them the labour, went out to meet them, and hastened 
 her own destruction. 

 1. Hearing the noise, she came in a fright to see what was the matter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Jehoiada and his friends began in silence, but now that they found 
 their strength, they proclaimed what they were doing.  It seems, 
 Athaliah was little regarded, else she would have had intelligence 
 brought her of this daring attempt before with her own ears she heard 
 the noise; had the design been discovered before it was perfected, it 
 might have been quashed, but now it was too late. When she heard the 
 noise it was strange that she was so ill advised as to come herself, 
 and, for aught that appears, to come alone. Surely she was not so 
 neglected as to have none to go for her, or none to go with her, but 
 she was wretchedly infatuated by the transport both of fear and 
 indignation she was in. Whom God will destroy he befools. 

 2. Seeing what was done she cried out for help. She saw the king's
 place by the pillar possessed by one to whom the princes and people did 
 homage

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 and had reason to conclude her power at an end, which she knew was 
 usurped; this made her rend her clothes, like one distracted, and cry, 
 "Treason! treason! Come and help against the traitors." Josephus adds 
 that she cried to have him killed that possessed the king's place. What 
 was now doing was the highest justice, yet it was branded as the 
 highest crime; she herself was the greatest traitor, and yet was first 
 and loudest in crying Treason! treason! Those that are themselves most 
 guilty are commonly most forward to reproach others. 

 3. Jehoiada gave orders to put her to death as an idolater, a usurper, 
 and an enemy to the public peace. Care was taken,

 (1.) That she should not be killed in the temple, or any of the courts 
 of it, in reverence to that holy place, which must not be stained with 
 the blood of any human sacrifice, though ever so justly offered. 

 (2.) That whoever appeared for her should die with her: "Him that 
 follows her, to protect or rescue her, any of her attendants that 
 resolve to adhere to her and will not come into the interests of their 
 rightful sovereign, <I>kill with the sword,</I> but not unless they 
 follow her now," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 According to these orders, she endeavouring to make her escape the back
 way to the palace, through the stalls, they pursued her, and there 
 killed her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 <I>So let thy enemies perish, O Lord!</I> thus give the bloody harlot
 blood to drink, for she is worthy.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 And Jehoiada made a covenant between the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> and the king
 and the people, that they should be the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s people; between
 the king also and the people.
 &nbsp; 18 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal,
 and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces
 thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.
 And the priest appointed officers over the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 19 And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and
 the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down
 the king from the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and came by the way of the
 gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne
 of the kings.
 &nbsp; 20 And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in
 quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword <I>beside</I> the king's
 house.
 &nbsp; 21 Seven years old <I>was</I> Jehoash when he began to reign.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jehoiada had now got over the harlot part of his work, when, by the 
 death of Athaliah, the young prince had his way to the throne cleared 
 of all opposition. He had now to improve his advantages for the 
 perfecting of the revolution and the settling of the government. Two 
 things we have an account of here:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The good foundations he laid, by an original contract, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Now that prince and people were together in God's house, as it should
 seem before they stirred, Jehoiada took care that they should jointly 
 covenant with God, and mutually covenant with each other, that they 
 might rightly understand their duty both to God and to one another, and 
 be firmly bound to it.

 1. He endeavoured to settle and secure the interests of religion among 
 them, by a covenant between them and God.  King and people would then 
 cleave most firmly to each other when both had joined themselves to the 
 Lord. God had already, on his part, promised to be their God (Jehoiada 
 could show them that in the book of the testimony); now the king and 
 people on their part must covenant and agree that <I>they will be the 
 Lord's people:</I> in this covenant, the king stands upon the same 
 level with his subjects and is as much bound as any of them to serve 
 the Lord. By this engagement they renounced Baal, whom many of them had 
 worshipped, and resigned themselves to God's government. It is well 
 with a people when all the changes that pass over them help to revive, 
 strengthen, and advance the interests of religion among them. And those 
 are likely to prosper who set out in the world under fresh and sensible 
 obligations to God and their duty. By our bonds to God the bonds of 
 every relation are strengthened. They <I>first gave themselves to the 
 Lord,</I> and then <I>to us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:5">2 Cor. viii. 5</A>.

 2. He then settled both the coronation-oath and the oath of allegiance,
 the <I>pacta conventa--covenant,</I> between the king and the people, 
 by which the king was obliged to govern according to law and to protect 
 his subjects, and they were obliged, while he did so, to obey him and 
 to bear faith and true allegiance to him. Covenants are of use both to 
 remind us of and to bind us to those duties which are already binding 
 on us. It is good, in all relations, for the parties to understand one 
 another fully, particularly in that between prince and subject, that 
 the one may understand the limits of his power and prerogative, the 
 other those of his liberty and property; and never may the ancient 
 landmarks which our fathers have set before them be removed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The good beginnings he raised on those foundations. 

 1. Pursuant to their covenant with God they immediately abolished 
 idolatry, which the preceding kings, in compliance with the house of 
 Ahab, had introduced

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>All the people of the land,</I> the mob, got together, to show their 
 zeal against idolatry; and every one, now that they were so well 
 headed, would lend a hand to pull down Baal's temple, his altars, and 
 his images. All his worshippers, it should seem, deserted him; only his 
 priest Mattan stuck to his altar. Though all men forsook Baal, he would 
 not, and there he was slain, the best sacrifice that ever was offered 
 upon that altar. Having destroyed Baal's temple, they appointed 
 <I>officers over the house of God,</I> to see that the service of God 
 was regularly performed by the proper persons, in due time, and 
 according to the institutional manner. 

 2. Pursuant to their covenant with one another they expressed a mutual
 readiness to and satisfaction in each other.

 (1.) The king was brought in state to the royal palace, and sat there 
 on the throne of judgment, <I>the thrones of the house of David</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 ready to receive petitions and appeals, which he would refer it to 
 Jehoiada to give answers to and to give judgment upon.

 (2.) The people rejoiced, and Jerusalem was in quiet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 and Josephus says they kept a feast of joy many days, making good 
 Solomon's observation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:10">Prov. xi. 10</A>),

 <I>When it goes well with the righteous the city rejoices, and when the
 wicked perish there is shouting.</I></P>
