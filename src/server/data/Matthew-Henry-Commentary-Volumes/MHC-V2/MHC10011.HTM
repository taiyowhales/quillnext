 What David said of the mournful report of Saul's death may more fitly 
 be applied to the sad story of this chapter, the adultery and murder 
 David was guilty of.--"Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the
 streets of Ashkelon." We wish we could draw a veil over it, and that it 
 might never be known, might never be said, that David did such things 
 as are here recorded of him. But it cannot, it must not, be concealed. 
 The scripture is faithful in relating the faults even of those whom it 
 most applauds, which is an instance of the sincerity of the penmen, and 
 an evidence that it was not written to serve any party: and even such 
 stories as these "were written for our learning," that "he that thinks 
 he stands may take heed lest he fall," and that others' harms may be 
 our warnings. Many, no doubt, have been emboldened to sin, and hardened 
 in it, by this story, and to them it is a "savour of death unto death;" 
 but many have by it been awakened to a holy jealousy over themselves, 
 and constant watchfulness against sin, and to them it is a "savour of 
 life unto life." Those are very great sins, and greatly aggravated, 
 which here we find David guilty of. 

 I. He committed adultery with Bath-sheba, the wife of Uriah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.
 
 II. He endeavoured to father the spurious brood upon Uriah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:6-13">ver. 6-13</A>.
 
 III. When that project failed, he plotted the death of Uriah by the
 sword of the children of Ammon, and effected it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:14-25">ver. 14-25</A>.

 IV. He married Bath-sheba, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:26,27">ver. 26, 27</A>.

 Is this David? Is this the man after God's own heart?  How is his
 behaviour changed, worse than it was before Ahimelech! How has this 
 gold become dim! Let him that readeth understand what the best of men 
 are when God leaves them to themselves.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time
 when kings go forth <I>to battle,</I> that David sent Joab, and his
 servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the
 children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still
 at Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 2 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from
 off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and
 from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman <I>was</I>
 very beautiful to look upon.
 &nbsp; 3 And David sent and enquired after the woman. And <I>one</I> said,
 <I>Is</I> not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah
 the Hittite?
 &nbsp; 4 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto
 him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her
 uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.
 &nbsp; 5 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I
 <I>am</I> with child.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. David's glory, in pursuing the war against the Ammonites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 We cannot take that pleasure in viewing this great action which
 hitherto we have taken in observing David's achievements, because the 
 beauty of it was stained and sullied by sin; otherwise we might take 
 notice of David's wisdom and bravery in following his blow. Having 
 routed the army of the Ammonites in the field, as soon as ever the 
 season of the year permitted he sent more forces to waste the country 
 and further to avenge the quarrel of his ambassadors. Rabbah, their 
 metropolis, made a stand, and held out a great while. To this city Joab 
 laid close siege, and it was at the time of this siege that David fell 
 into this sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David's shame, in being himself conquered, and led captive by his 
 own lust. The sin he was guilty of was adultery, against the letter of 
 the seventh commandment, and (in the judgment of the patriarchal age) a 
 heinous crime, and <I>an iniquity to be punished by the judges</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:11">Job xxxi. 11</A>),

 a sin which <I>takes away the heart,</I> and <I>gets a man a wound and
 dishonour,</I> more than any other, and the <I>reproach of which is not 
 wiped away.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Observe the occasions which led to this sin. 

 (1.) Neglect of his business. When he should have been abroad with his
 army in the field, fighting the battles of the Lord, he devolved the 
 care upon others, and he himself <I>tarried still at Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 To the war with the Syrians David went in person,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:17"><I>ch.</I> x. 17</A>.

 Had he been now at his post at the head of his forces, he would have
 been out of the way of this temptation. When we are out of the way of 
 our duty we are in the way of temptation.  

 (2.) Love of ease, and the indulgence of a slothful temper: <I>He came
 off his bed at evening-tide,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 There he had dozed away the afternoon in idleness, which he should have
 spent in some exercise for his own improvement or the good of others. 
 He used to pray, not only morning and evening, but at noon, in the day 
 of his trouble: it is to be feared he had, this noon, omitted to do so.  
 Idleness gives great advantage to the tempter. Standing waters gather 
 filth. The bed of sloth often proves the bed of lust.

 (3.) A wandering eye: <I>He saw a woman washing herself,</I> probably
 from some ceremonial pollution, according to the law. The sin came in 
 at the eye, as Eve's did. Perhaps he sought to see her, at least he did 
 not practise according to his own prayer, <I>Turn away my eyes from 
 beholding vanity,</I> and his son's caution in a like case, <I>Look not 
 thou on the wine it is red.</I> Either he had not, like Job, <I>made a 
 covenant with his eyes,</I> or, at this time, he had forgotten it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The steps of the sin. When he saw her, lust immediately conceived, 
 and, 
 
 (1.) He enquired who she was
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 perhaps intending only, if she were unmarried, to take her to wife, as
 he had taken several; but, if she were a wife, having no design upon 
 her.

 (2.) The corrupt desire growing more violent, though he was told she
 was a wife, and whose wife she was, yet he sent messengers for her, and 
 then, it may be, intended only to please himself with her company and 
 conversation. But,

 (3.) When she came <I>he lay with her,</I> she too easily consenting,
 because he was a great man, and famed for his goodness too. Surely 
 (thinks she) that can be no sin which such a man as David is the mover 
 of. See how the way of sin is down-hill; when men begin to do evil they 
 cannot soon stop themselves. <I>The beginning</I> of lust, as <I>of 
 strife, is like the letting forth of water;</I> it is therefore wisdom 
 to leave it off before it be meddled with. The foolish fly fires her 
 wings, and fools away her life at last, by playing about the 
 candle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The aggravations of the sin. 

 (1.) He was now in years, fifty at least, some think more, when those
 lusts which are more properly youthful, one would think, should not 
 have been violent in him,

 (2.) He had many wives and concubines of his own; this is insisted on,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:8"><I>ch.</I> xii. 8</A>.

 (3.) Uriah, whom he wronged, was one of his own worthies, a person of
 honour and virtue, one that was now abroad in his service, hazarding 
 his life in the high places of the field for the honour and safety of 
 him and his kingdom, where he himself should have been. 

 (4.) Bath-sheba, whom he debauched, was a lady of good reputation, and,
 till she was drawn by him and his influence into this wickedness, had 
 no doubt preserved her purity. Little did she think that ever she could 
 have done so bad a thing as to <I>forsake the guide of her youth, and 
 forget the covenant of her God;</I> nor perhaps could any one in the 
 world but David have prevailed against her. The adulterer not only 
 wrongs and ruins his own soul, but, as much as he can, another's soul 
 too.

 (5.) David was a king, whom God had entrusted with the sword of justice
 and the execution of the law upon other criminals, particularly upon 
 adulterers, who were, by the law, to be put to death; for him therefore 
 to be guilty of those crimes himself was to make himself a pattern, 
 when he should have been a terror, to evil doers. With what face could 
 he rebuke or punish that in others which he was conscious to himself of 
 being guilty of? See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:22">Rom. ii. 22</A>.

 Much more might be said to aggravate the sin; and I can think but of
 one excuse for it, which is that it was done but once; it was far from 
 being his practice; it was by the surprise of a temptation that he was 
 drawn into it. He was not one of those of whom the prophet complains 
 that <I>they were as fed horses, neighing every one after his 
 neighbour's wife</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:8">Jer. v. 8</A>);
 
 but this once God left him to himself, as he did Hezekiah, <I>that he
 might know what was in his heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:31">2 Chron. xxxii. 31</A>.

 Had he been told of it before, he would have said, as Hazael, <I>What!
 is thy servant a dog?</I> But by this instance we are taught what need 
 we have to pray every day, <I>Father, in heaven, lead us not into 
 temptation,</I> and to watch, that we enter not into it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  And David sent to Joab, <I>saying,</I> Send me Uriah the Hittite.
 And Joab sent Uriah to David.
 &nbsp; 7 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded <I>of him</I> how
 Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.
 &nbsp; 8 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy
 feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there
 followed him a mess <I>of meat</I> from the king.
 &nbsp; 9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the
 servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
 &nbsp; 10 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down
 unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from <I>thy</I>
 journey? why <I>then</I> didst thou not go down unto thine house?
 &nbsp; 11 And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah,
 abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord,
 are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house,
 to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? <I>as</I> thou livest,
 and <I>as</I> thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.
 &nbsp; 12 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to
 morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that
 day, and the morrow.
 &nbsp; 13 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before
 him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his
 bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his
 house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Uriah, we may suppose, had now been absent from his wife some weeks, 
 making the campaign in the country of the Ammonites, and not intending 
 to return till the end of it. The situation of his wife would <I>bring 
 to light the hidden works of darkness;</I> and when Uriah, at his 
 return, should find how he had been abused, and by whom, it might well 
 be expected, 

 1. That he would prosecute his wife, according to law, and have her
 stoned to death; for <I>jealousy is the rage of a man,</I> especially a 
 man of honour, and he that is thus injured <I>will not spare in the day 
 of vengeance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:34">Prov. vi. 34</A>.

 This Bath-sheba was apprehensive of when she sent to let David know she
 was with child, intimating that he was concerned to protect her, and, 
 it is likely, if he had not promised her so to do (so wretchedly 
 abusing his royal power), she would not have consented to him. Hope of 
 impunity is a great encouragement to iniquity.

 2. It might also be expected that since he could not prosecute David by
 law for an offence of this nature he would take his revenge another 
 way, and raise a rebellion against him. There have been instances of 
 kings who by provocations of this nature, given to some of their 
 powerful subjects, have lost their crowns. To prevent this double 
 mischief, David endeavours to father the child which should be born 
 upon Uriah himself, and therefore sends for him home to stay a night or 
 two with his wife.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the plot was laid. Uriah must come home from the army under 
 pretence of bringing David an account <I>how the war prospered,</I> and 
 how they went on with the siege of Rabbah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Thus does he pretend a more than ordinary concern for his army when
 that was the least thing in his thoughts; if he had not had another 
 turn to serve, an express of much less figure than Uriah might have 
 sufficed to bring him a report of the state of the war. David, having 
 had as much conference with Uriah as he thought requisite to cover the 
 design, sent him to his house, and, that he might be the more pleasant 
 there with the wife of his youth, sent a dish of meat after him for 
 their supper, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 When that project failed the first night, and Uriah, being weary of his
 journey and more desirous of sleep than meat, lay all night in the 
 guard-chamber, the next night <I>he made him drunk</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 or made him merry, tempted him to drink more than was fit, that he
 might forget his vow

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and might be disposed to go home to his own bed, to which perhaps, if
 David could have made him dead drunk, he would have ordered him to be 
 carried. It is a very wicked thing, upon any design whatsoever, to make 
 a person drunk. <I>Woe to him</I> that does so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:15,16">Hab. ii. 15, 16</A>.

 God will put a cup of trembling into the hands of those who put into
 the hands of others the cup of drunkenness. Robbing a man of his reason 
 is worse than robbing him of his money, and drawing him into sin worse 
 than drawing him into any trouble whatsoever.  Every good man, 
 especially every magistrate, should endeavour to prevent this sin, by 
 admonishing, restraining, and denying the glass to those whom they see 
 falling into excess; but to further it is to do the devil's work, to 
 officiate as factor for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How this plot was defeated by Uriah's firm resolution not to lie in 
 his own bed. Both nights he slept with the life-guard, and <I>went not 
 down to his house,</I> though, it is probable, his wife pressed him to 
 do it as much as David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:9,12"><I>v.</I> 9, 12</A>.
 
 Now,

 1. Some think he suspected what was done, being informed of his wife's
 attendance at court, and therefore he would not go near her. But if he 
 had had any suspicion of that kind, surely he would have opened the 
 letter that David sent by him to Joab. 

 2.  Whether he suspected any thing or no, Providence put this
 resolution into his heart, and kept him to it, for the discovering of 
 David's sin, and that the baffling of his design to conceal it might 
 awaken David's conscience to confess it and repent of it.  

 3. The reason he gave to David for this strange instance of self-denial
 and mortification was very noble,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 While the army was encamped in the field, he would not lie at ease in
 his own house. "The ark is in a tent," whether at home, in the tent 
 David had pitched for it, or abroad, with Joab in the camp, is not 
 certain. "Joab, and all the mighty men of Israel, lie hard and uneasy, 
 and much exposed to the weather and to the enemy; and shall I go and 
 take my ease and pleasure at my own house?" No, he protests he will not 
 do it. Now,

 (1.) This was in itself a generous resolution, and showed Uriah to be a
 man of a public spirit, bold and hardy, and mortified to the delights 
 of sense.  In times of public difficulty and danger it does not become 
 us to repose ourselves in security, or roll ourselves in pleasure, or, 
 with the king and Haman, to sit down to drink when the <I>city Shushan 
 was perplexed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:15">Esth. iii. 15</A>.

 We should voluntarily endure hardness when the church of God is
 constrained to endure it.

 (2.) It might have been of use to awaken David's conscience, and make
 his heart to smite him for what he had done. 

 [1.] That he had basely abused so brave a man as Uriah was, a man so
 heartily concerned for him and his kingdom, and that acted for him and 
 it with so much vigour.  

 [2.] That he was himself so unlike him. The consideration of the public
 hardships and hazards kept Uriah from lawful pleasures, yet could not 
 keep David, though more nearly interested, from unlawful ones. Uriah's 
 severity to himself should have shamed David for his indulgence of 
 himself. The law was, <I>When the host goeth forth against the enemy 
 then,</I> in a special manner, <I>keep thyself from every wicked 
 thing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:9">Deut. xxiii. 9</A>.

 Uriah outdid that law, but David violated it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a
 letter to Joab, and sent <I>it</I> by the hand of Uriah.
 &nbsp; 15 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the
 forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he
 may be smitten, and die.
 &nbsp; 16 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he
 assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men
 <I>were.</I>
 &nbsp; 17 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and
 there fell <I>some</I> of the people of the servants of David; and
 Uriah the Hittite died also.
 &nbsp; 18 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the
 war;
 &nbsp; 19 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an
 end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,
 &nbsp; 20 And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto
 thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did
 fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?
 &nbsp; 21 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman
 cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died
 in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant
 Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
 &nbsp; 22 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that
 Joab had sent him for.
 &nbsp; 23 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed
 against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon
 them even unto the entering of the gate.
 &nbsp; 24 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants;
 and <I>some</I> of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah
 the Hittite is dead also.
 &nbsp; 25 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto
 Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth
 one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the
 city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.
 &nbsp; 26 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was
 dead, she mourned for her husband.
 &nbsp; 27 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her
 to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But
 the thing that David had done displeased the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When David's project of fathering the child upon Uriah himself failed, 
 so that, in process of time, Uriah would certainly know the wrong that 
 had been done him, to prevent the fruits of his revenge, the devil put 
 it into David's heart to take him off, and then neither he nor 
 Bath-sheba would be in any danger (what prosecution could there be when 
 there was no prosecutor?), suggesting further that, when Uriah was out 
 of the way, Bath-sheba might, if he pleased, be his own for ever. 
 Adulteries have often occasioned murders, and one wickedness must be 
 covered and secured with another. The beginnings of sin are therefore 
 to be dreaded; for who knows where they will end? It is resolved in 
 David's breast (which one would think could never possibly have 
 harboured so vile a thought) that Uriah must die. That innocent, 
 valiant, gallant man, who was ready to die for his prince's honour, 
 must die by his prince's hand. David has sinned, and Bath-sheba has 
 sinned, and both against him, and therefore he must die; David 
 determines he must. Is this the man whose heart smote him because he 
 had cut off Saul's skirt? <I>Quantum mutatus ab illo!--But ah, how
 changed!</I> Is this he that executed judgment and justice to all his 
 people? How can he now do so unjust a thing?  See how fleshly lusts war 
 against the soul, and what devastations they make in that war; how they 
 blink the eyes, harden the heart, sear the conscience, and deprive men 
 of all sense of honour and justice. <I>Whoso committeth adultery with a 
 woman lacketh understanding</I> and quite loses it; <I>he that doth it 
 destroys his own soul,</I>

 But, as the eye of the adulterer, so the hand of the murderer seeks
 concealment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:14,15">Job xxiv. 14, 15</A>.

 Works of darkness hate the light. When David bravely slew Goliath it
 was done publicly, and he gloried in it; but, when he basely slew 
 Uriah, it must be done clandestinely, for he is ashamed of it, and well 
 he may. Who would do a thing that he dare not own? The devil, having as 
 a poisonous serpent, put it into David's heart to murder Uriah, as a 
 subtle serpent he puts it into his head how to do it. Not as Absalom 
 slew Amnon, by commanding his servants to assassinate him, nor as Ahab 
 slew Naboth by suborning witnesses to accuse him, but by exposing him 
 to the enemy, a way of doing it which, perhaps, would not seem so 
 odious to conscience and the world, because soldiers expose themselves 
 of course. If Uriah had not been in that dangerous post, another must; 
 he has (as we say) a chance for his life; if he fight stoutly, he may 
 perhaps come off; and, if he die, it is in the field of honour, where a 
 soldier would choose to die; and yet all this will not save it from 
 being a wilful murder, of malice prepense.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Orders are sent to Joab to set Uriah in the front of the hottest 
 battle, and then to desert him, and abandon him to the enemy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 This was David's project to take off Uriah, and it succeeded, as he
 designed. Many were the aggravations of this murder.

 1. It was deliberate. He took time to consider of it; and though he had
 time to consider of it, for he wrote a letter about it, and though he 
 had time to have countermanded the order afterwards before it could be 
 put in execution, yet he persisted in it. 

 2. He sent the letter by Uriah himself, than which nothing could be
 more base and barbarous, to make him accessory to his own death. And 
 what a paradox was it that he could bear such a malice against him in 
 whom yet he could repose such a confidence as that he would carry 
 letters which he must not know the purport of. 

 3. Advantage must be taken of Uriah's own courage and zeal for his king
 and country, which deserve the greatest praise and recompence, to 
 betray him the more easily to his fate.  If he had not been forward to 
 expose himself, perhaps he was a man of such importance that Joab could 
 not have exposed him; and that this noble fire should be designedly 
 turned upon himself was a most detestable instance of ingratitude. 

 4.  Many must be involved in the guilt. Joab, the general, to whom the
 blood of his soldiers, especially the worthies, ought to be precious, 
 must do it; he, and all that retire from Uriah when they ought in 
 conscience to support and second him, become guilty of his death. 

 5.  Uriah cannot thus die alone: the party he commands is in danger of
 being cut off with him; and it proved so: some of the people, even the 
 servants of David (so they are called, to aggravate David's sin in 
 being so prodigal of their lives), fell with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Nay, this wilful misconduct by which Uriah must be betrayed might be of
 fatal consequence to the whole army, and might oblige them to raise the 
 siege.

 6. It will be the triumph and joy of the Ammonites, the sworn enemies
 of God and Israel; it will gratify them exceedingly. David prayed for 
 himself, that he might not fall into the hands of man, nor flee from 
 his enemies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:13,14"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 13, 14</A>);

 yet he sells his servant Uriah to the Ammonites, and not for any
 iniquity in his hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Joab executes these orders. In the next assault that is made upon 
 the city Uriah has the most dangerous post assigned him, is encouraged 
 to hope that if he be repulsed by the besieged he shall be relieved by 
 Joab, in dependence on which he marches on with resolution, but, 
 succours not coming on, the service proves too hot, and he is slain in 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 It was strange that Joab would do such a thing merely upon a letter,
 without knowing the reason. But,

 1. Perhaps he supposed Uriah had been guilty of some great crime, to
 enquire into which David had sent for him, and that, because he would 
 not punish him openly, he took this course with him to put him to 
 death. 

 2. Joab had been guilty of blood, and we may suppose it pleased him
 very well to see David himself falling into the same guilt, and he was 
 willing enough to serve him in it, that he might continue to be 
 favourable to him. It is common for those who have done ill themselves 
 to desire to be countenanced therein by others doing ill likewise, 
 especially by the sins of those that are eminent in the profession of 
 religion. Or, perhaps, David knew that Joab had a pique against Uriah, 
 and would gladly be avenged on him; otherwise Joab, when he saw cause, 
 knew how to dispute the king's orders, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:5,24:3"><I>ch.</I> xix. 5; xxiv. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He sends an account of it to David. An express is despatched away 
 immediately with a report of this last disgrace and loss which they had 
 sustained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 And, to disguise the affair,

 1. He supposes that David would appear to be angry at his bad conduct,
 would ask why they came so near the wall

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 did they not know that Abimelech lost his life by doing do? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 We had the story

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:53">Judg. ix. 53</A>),

 which book, it is likely, was published as a part of the sacred history
 in Samuel's time; and (be it noted to their praise, and for imitation) 
 even the soldiers were conversant with their bibles, and could readily 
 quote the scripture-story, and make use of it for admonition to 
 themselves not to run upon the same attempts which they found had been 
 fatal. 

 2. He slyly orders the messenger to soothe it with telling him that
 Uriah the Hittite was dead also, which gave too broad an intimation to 
 the messenger, and by him to others, that David would be secretly 
 pleased to hear that; for murder will out. And, when men do such base 
 things, they must expect to be bantered and upbraided with them, even 
 by their inferiors. The messenger delivered his message agreeably to 
 orders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:22-24"><I>v.</I>  22-24</A>.

 He makes the besieged to sally out first upon the besiegers (<I>they
 came out unto us into the field</I>), represents the besiegers as doing
 their part with great bravery (<I>we were upon them even to the 
 entering of the gate</I>--we forced them to retire into the city with 
 precipitation), and so concludes with a slight mention of the slaughter 
 made among them by some shot from the wall: <I>Some of the king's 
 servants are dead,</I> and particularly <I>Uriah the Hittite,</I> an 
 officer of note, stood first in the list of the slain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. David receives the account with a secret satisfaction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Let not Joab be displeased, for David is not. He blames not his
 conduct, nor thinks they did wrong in approaching so near the wall; all 
 is well now that Uriah is put out of the way.  This point being gained, 
 he can make light of the loss, and turn it off easily with an excuse: 
 <I>The sword devours one as well as another;</I> it was a chance of 
 war, nothing more common. He orders Joab to make the battle more strong 
 next time, while he, by his sin, was weakening it, and provoking God to 
 blast the undertaking.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He marries the widow in a little time. She submitted to the ceremony 
 of mourning for her husband as short a time as custom would admit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 and then David took her to his house as his wife, and she bore him a
 son. Uriah's revenge was prevented by his death, but the birth of the 
 child so soon after the marriage published the crime. Sin will have 
 shame. Yet that was not the worst of it: <I>The thing that David had 
 done displeased the Lord.</I> The whole <I>matter of Uriah</I> (as it 
 is called,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:5">1 Kings xv. 5</A>),

 the adultery, falsehood, murder, and this marriage at last, it was all
 displeasing to the Lord. He had pleased himself, but displeased God. 
 Note, God sees and hates sin in his own people. Nay, the nearer any are 
 to God in profession the more displeasing to him their sins are; for in 
 them there is more ingratitude, treachery, and reproach, than in the 
 sins of others. Let none therefore encourage themselves in sin by the 
 example of David; for those that sin as he did will fall under the 
 displeasure of God as he did. Let us therefore stand in awe and sin 
 not, not sin after the similitude of his transgression.</P>
