 The Jewish church puts on quite another face in this book from what it 
 had appeared with; its state much better, and more pleasant, than it 
 was of late in Babylon, and yet far inferior to what it had been 
 formerly. The dry bones here live again, but <I>in the form of a 
 servant;</I> the yoke of their captivity is taken off, but the marks of 
 it in their galled necks remain. Kings we hear no more of; <I>the crown 
 has fallen from their heads.</I> Prophets they are blessed with, to 
 direct them in their re-establishment, but, after a while, prophecy 
 ceases among them, till the great prophet appears, and his fore-runner. 
 The history of this book is the accomplishment of Jeremiah's prophecy 
 concerning the return of the Jews out of Babylon at the end of seventy 
 years, and a type of the accomplishment of the prophecies of the 
 Apocalypse concerning the deliverance of the gospel church out of the 
 New-Testament Babylon. Ezra preserved the records of that great 
 revolution and transmitted them to the church in this book. His name 
 signifies a helper; and so he was to that people. A particular account 
 concerning him we shall meet with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:1-28"><I>ch.</I> vii.</A>,

 where he himself enters upon the stage of action. The book gives us an
 account,

 I. Of the Jews' return out of their captivity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:1-2:70"><I>ch.</I> i., ii.</A>

 II. Of the building of the temple, the opposition it met with, and yet
 the perfecting of it at last,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:1-6:22"><I>ch.</I> iii.-vi.</A>

 III. Of Ezra's coming to Jerusalem,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:1-8:36"><I>ch.</I> vii., viii.</A>

 IV. Of the good service he did there, in obliging those that had
 married strange wives to put them away,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:1-10:44"><I>ch.</I> ix., x.</A>

 This beginning again of the Jewish nation was small, yet its latter end
 greatly increased.</P>
