 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a
 proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and <I>put it</I> also in
 writing, saying,
 &nbsp; 2  Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of heaven hath
 given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to
 build him a house at Jerusalem, which <I>is</I> in Judah.
 &nbsp; 3  Who <I>is there</I> among you of all his people? his God be with
 him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which <I>is</I> in Judah, and
 build the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, (he <I>is</I> the God,)
 which <I>is</I> in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 4  And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let
 the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and
 with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the
 house of God that <I>is</I> in Jerusalem.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It will be proper for us here to consider, 

 1. What was the state of the captive Jews in Babylon. It was upon many
 accounts very deplorable; they were under the power of those that hated 
 them, had nothing they could call their own; they had no temple, no 
 altar; if they sang psalms, their enemies ridiculed them; and yet they 
 had prophets among them. Ezekiel and Daniel were kept distinct from the 
 heathen. Some of them were preferred at court, others had comfortable 
 settlements in the country, and they were all borne up with hope that, 
 in due time, they should return to their own land again, in expectation 
 of which they preserved among them the distinction of their families, 
 the knowledge of their religion, and an aversion to idolatry. 

 2. What was the state of the government under which they were. 
 Nebuchadnezzar carried many of them into captivity in the first year of 
 his reign, which was the fourth of Jehoiakim; he reigned forty-five 
 years, his son Evil-merodach twenty-three, and his grandson Belshazzar 
 three years, which make up the seventy years. So Dr. Lightfoot, It is 
 charged upon Nebuchadnezzar that he <I>opened not the house of his 
 prisoners,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:17">Isa. xiv. 17</A>.

 And, if he had shown mercy to the poor Jews, Daniel told him it would
 have been the <I>lengthening of his tranquillity,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:27">Dan. iv. 27</A>.

 But the measure of the sins of Babylon was at length full, and then
 destruction was brought upon them by Darius the Mede and Cyrus the 
 Persian, which we read of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:31">Dan. v.</A>

 Darius, being old, left the government to Cyrus, and he was employed as
 the instrument of the Jews' deliverance, which he gave orders for as 
 soon as ever he was master of the kingdom of Babylon, perhaps in 
 contradiction to Nebuchadnezzar, whose family he had cut off, and 
 because he took a pleasure in undoing what he had done, or in policy, 
 to recommend his newly-acquired dominion as merciful and gentle, or (as 
 some think) in a pious regard to the prophecy of Isaiah, which had been 
 published, and well known, above 150 years before, where he was 
 expressly named as the man that should do this for God, and for whom 
 God would do great things

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:28,45:1">Isa. xliv. 28; xlv. 1</A>,

 &c.), and which perhaps was shown to him by those about him. His name
 (some say) in the Persian language signifies the <I>sun,</I> for he 
 brought light and healing to the church of God, and was an eminent type 
 of Christ the <I>Sun of righteousness.</I> Some was that his name 
 signifies a <I>father,</I> and Christ is the everlasting Father. Now 
 here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Whence this proclamation took its rise. <I>The Lord stirred up the 
 spirit of Cyrus.</I> Note, The hearts of kings are in the hand of the 
 Lord, and, like the rivulets of water, he turneth them which way soever 
 he will. It is said of Cyrus that he knew not God, nor how to serve 
 him; but God knew him, and how to serve himself by him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:4">Isa. xlv. 4</A>.

 God governs the world by his influence on the spirits of men, and,
 whatever good is done at any time, it is God that stirs up the spirit 
 to do it, puts thoughts into the mind, gives to the understanding to 
 form a right judgment, and directs the will which way he pleases. 
 Whatever good offices therefore are, at any time, done for the church 
 of God, he must have the glory of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reference it had to the prophecy of Jeremiah, by whom God had 
 not only promised that they should return, but had fixed the time, 
 which set time to favour Sion had now come. Seventy years were 
 determined 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:12,29:10">Jer. xxv. 12; xxix. 10</A>);

 and he that kept the promise made concerning Israel's deliverance out
 of <I>Egypt to a day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:41">Exod. xii. 41</A>)
 
 was doubtless as punctual to this. What Cyrus now did was long
 since said to be the <I>confirming of the word of God's servants,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26">Isa. xliv. 26</A>.

 Jeremiah, while he lived, was hated and despised; yet thus did
 Providence honour him long after, that a mighty monarch was influenced 
 to act in pursuance of the word of the Lord by his mouth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The date of this proclamation. It was in his first year, not the 
 first of his reign over Persia, the kingdom he was born to, but the 
 first of his reign over Babylon, the kingdom he had conquered. Those 
 are much honoured whose spirits are stirred up to begin with God and to 
 serve him in their first years.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The publication of it, both by word of mouth (he <I>caused a voice 
 to pass throughout all his kingdom,</I> like a jubilee-trumpet, a 
 joyful sabbatical year after many melancholy ones, proclaiming liberty 
 to the captives), and also in black and white: he put it in writing, 
 that it might be the more satisfactory, and might be sent to those 
 distant provinces where the ten tribes were scattered in Assyria and 
 Media, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:6">2 Kings xvii. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The purport of this proclamation of liberty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The preamble shows the causes and considerations by which he was 
 influenced, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It should seem, his mind was enlightened with the knowledge of
 <I>Jehovah</I> (for so he calls him), the God of Israel, as the only 
 <I>living and true God,</I> the <I>God of heaven,</I> who is the 
 sovereign Lord and disposer of all <I>the kingdoms of the earth;</I> of 
 him he says

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:3">(<I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>He is the God,</I> God alone, God above all. Though he had not known 
 God by education, God made him so far to know him now as that he did 
 this service with an eye to him. He professes that he does it, 

 (1.) In gratitude to God for the favours he had bestowed upon him:
 <I>The God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth.</I> 
 This sounds a little vain-glorious, for there were <I>many kingdoms of 
 the earth</I> which he had nothing to do with; but he means that God 
 had given him all that was given to Nebuchadnezzar, whose dominion, 
 Daniel says, was <I>to the end of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:22,5:19">Dan. iv. 22; v. 19</A>.

 Note, God is the fountain of power; the kingdoms of the earth are at
 his disposal; whatever share any have of them they have from him: and 
 those whom God has entrusted with great power and large possessions 
 should look upon themselves as obliged thereby to do much for him.

 (2.) In obedience to God. He hat <I>charged me to build him a house at
 Jerusalem;</I> probably by a dream or vision of the night, confirmed by 
 comparing it with the prophecy of Isaiah, where his doing it was 
 foretold. Israel's disobedience to God's charge, which they were often 
 told of, is aggravated by the obedience of this heathen king.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He gives free leave to all the Jews that were in his dominions to go 
 up to Jerusalem, and to <I>build the temple of the Lord</I> there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 His regard to God made him overlook,

 (1.) The secular interest of his government. It would have been his
 policy to keep so great a number of serviceable men in his dominions, 
 and seemed impolitic to let them go and take root again in their own 
 land; but piety is the best policy.

 (2.) The honour of the religion of his country. Why did he not order
 them to build a temple to the gods of Babylon or Persia? He believed 
 the God of Israel to be the <I>God of heaven,</I> and therefore obliged 
 his Israel to worship him only. Let them <I>walk in the name of the 
 Lord their God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He subjoins a brief for a collection to bear the charges of such as 
 were poor and not able to bear their own, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 "Whosoever remaineth, because he has not the means to bear his charges
 to Jerusalem, <I>let the men of his place help him.</I>" Some take it 
 as an order to the king's officers to supply them out of his revenue, 
 as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:8"><I>ch.</I> vi. 8</A>.

 But it may mean a warrant to the captives to ask and receive the alms
 and charitable contributions of all the king's loving subjects. And we 
 may suppose the Jews had conducted themselves so well among their 
 neighbours that they would be as forward to accommodate them because 
 they loved them as the Egyptians were because they were weary of them.  
 At least many would be kind to them because they saw the government 
 would take it well. Cyrus not only gave his good wishes with those that 
 went (<I>Their God be with them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 but took care also to furnish them with such things as they needed. He
 took it for granted that those among them who were of ability would 
 offer their <I>free-will offerings for the house of God,</I> to promote 
 the rebuilding of it. But, besides that, he would have them supplied 
 out of his kingdom. Well-wishers to the temple should be well-doers for 
 it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin,
 and the priests, and the Levites, with all <I>them</I> whose spirit
 God had raised, to go up to build the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> which
 <I>is</I> in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 6  And all they that <I>were</I> about them strengthened their hands
 with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts,
 and with precious things, beside all <I>that</I> was willingly
 offered.
 &nbsp; 7  Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of
 Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;
 &nbsp; 8  Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand
 of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar,
 the prince of Judah.
 &nbsp; 9  And this <I>is</I> the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a
 thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,
 &nbsp; 10  Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second <I>sort</I> four
 hundred and ten, <I>and</I> other vessels a thousand.
 &nbsp; 11  All the vessels of gold and of silver <I>were</I> five thousand
 and four hundred. All <I>these</I> did Sheshbazzar bring up with <I>them
 of</I> the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto
 Jerusalem.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How Cyrus's proclamation succeeded with others.

 1. He having given leave to the Jews to go up to Jerusalem, many of
 them went up accordingly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The leaders herein were the <I>chief of the fathers</I> of Judah and
 Benjamin, eminent and experienced men, from whom it might justly be 
 expected that, as they were above their brethren in dignity, so they 
 should go before them in duty. The priests and Levites were (as became 
 them) with the first that set their faces again towards Zion. If any 
 good work is to be done, let ministers lead in it. Those that 
 accompanied them were such as God had inclined to go up. The same God 
 that had raised up the spirit of Cyrus to proclaim this liberty raised 
 up their spirits to take the benefit of it; for it was done, <I>not by 
 might, nor by power, but by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:6">Zech. iv. 6</A>.

 The temptation perhaps was strong to some of them to stay in Babylon.
 They had convenient settlements there, had contracted an agreeable 
 acquaintance with the neighbours, and were ready to say, <I>It is good 
 to be here.</I> The discouragements of their return were many and 
 great, the journey long, their wives and children unfit for travelling, 
 their own land was to them a strange land, the road to it an unknown 
 road. Go up to Jerusalem! And what should they do there? It was all in 
 ruins, and in the midst of enemies to whom they would be an easy prey. 
 Many were wrought upon by these considerations to stay in Babylon, at 
 least not to go with the first.  But there were some that got over 
 these difficulties, that ventured to break the ice, and feared not the 
 lion in the way, the lion in the streets; and they were those whose 
 spirits God raised. He, by his Spirit and grace, filled them with a 
 generous ambition of liberty, a gracious affection to their own land, 
 and a desire of the free and public exercise of their religion. Had God 
 left them to themselves, and to the counsels of flesh and blood, they 
 would have staid in Babylon; but he put it into their hearts to set 
 their faces Zionward, and, as strangers, to ask the way thither 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:5">Jer. l. 5</A>);

 for they, being a new generation, went out like their father Abraham
 from this land of the Chaldees, not knowing whither they went, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:8">Heb. xi. 8</A>.

 Note, Whatever good we do, it is owing purely to the grace of God, and
 he raises up our spirits to the doing of it, <I>works in us both to 
 will and to do.</I> Our spirits naturally incline to this earth and to 
 the things of it. If they move upwards, in any good affections or good 
 actions, it is God that raises them. The call and offer of the gospel 
 are like Cyrus's proclamation. <I>Deliverance is preached to the 
 captives,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:18">Luke iv. 18</A>.

 Those that are bound under the unrighteous dominion of sin, and bound
 over to the righteous judgment of God, may be made free by Jesus 
 Christ. Whoever will, by repentance and faith, return to God, his duty 
 to God, his happiness in God, Jesus Christ has opened the way for him, 
 and let him go up out of the slavery of sin into the <I>glorious 
 liberty of the children of God.</I> The offer is general to all. Christ 
 makes it, in pursuance of the grant which the Father has made him of 
 <I>all power both in heaven and in earth</I> (a much greater dominion 
 than that given to Cyrus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 and of the charge given him to <I>build God a house,</I> to set him up
 a church in the world, a kingdom among men. Many that hear this joyful 
 sound choose to sit still in Babylon, are in love with their sins and 
 will not venture upon the difficulties of a holy life; but some there 
 are that break through the discouragements, and resolve to <I>build the 
 house of God,</I> to make heaven of their religion, whatever it cost 
 them, and they are those <I>whose spirit God has raised</I> above the 
 world and the flesh and whom he has made <I>willing in the day of his 
 power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.

 Thus will the heavenly Canaan be replenished, though many perish in
 Babylon; and the gospel-offer will not be made in vain.

 2. Cyrus having given order that their neighbours should help them,
 they did so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 All those that were about them furnished them with plate and goods to
 bear the charges of their journey, and to help them in building and 
 furnishing both their own houses and God's temple.  As the tabernacle 
 was made of the spoils of Egypt, and the first temple built by the 
 labours of the strangers, so the second by the contributions of the 
 Chaldeans, all intimating the admission of the Gentiles into the church 
 in due time. God can, where he pleases, incline the hearts of strangers 
 to be kind to his people, and make those to strengthen their hands that 
 have weakened them. <I>The earth helped the woman. Besides what was 
 willingly offered</I> by the Jews themselves who staid behind, from a 
 principle of love to God and his house, much was offered, as one may 
 say, unwillingly by the Babylonians, who were influenced to do it by a 
 divine power on their minds of which they themselves could give no 
 account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 How this proclamation was seconded by Cyrus himself. To give proof of 
 the sincerity of his affection to the house of God, he not only 
 released the people of God, but restored the vessels of the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.
 
 Observe here,

 1. How careful Providence was of the vessels of the temple, that they
 were not lost, melted down, or so mixed with other vessels that they 
 could not be known, but that they were all now forthcoming. Such care 
 God has of the living <I>vessels of mercy, vessels of honour,</I> of 
 whom it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:19,20">2 Tim. ii. 19, 20</A>),

 <I>The Lord knows those that are his,</I> and they shall <I>none of
 them perish.</I> 

 2. Though they had been put into an idol's temple, and probably used in
 the service of idols, yet they were given back, to be used for God.  
 God will recover his own; and the spoil of the strong man armed shall 
 be converted to the use of the conqueror. 

 3. Judah had a prince, even in captivity. Sheshbazzar, supposed to be
 the same with Zerubbabel, is here called <I>prince of Judah;</I> the 
 Chaldeans called him <I>Sheshbazzar,</I> which signifies <I>joy in 
 tribulation;</I> but among his own people he went by the name of 
 <I>Zerubbabel--a stranger in Babylon;</I> so he looked upon himself, 
 and considered Jerusalem his home, though, as Josephus says, he was 
 captain of the life-guard to the king of Babylon. He took care of the 
 affairs of the Jews, and had some authority over them, probably from 
 the death of Jehoiachin, or Jeconiah, who made him his heir, he being 
 of the house of David. 

 4. To him the sacred vessels were numbered out

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and he took care for their safe conveyance to Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 It would encourage them to build the temple that they had so much rich
 furniture ready to put into it when it was built. Though God's 
 ordinances, like the vessels of the sanctuary, may be corrupted and 
 profaned by the New-Testament Babylon, they shall, in due time, be 
 restored to their primitive use and intention; for not one jot or 
 tittle of divine institution shall fall to the ground.</P>
