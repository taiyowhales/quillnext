 Nehemiah, having finished what he undertook for the fencing and filling 
 of the holy city, returned to the king his master, who was not willing 
 to be long without him, as appears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>).

 But, after some time, he obtained leave to come back again to
 Jerusalem, to redress grievances, and purge out some corruptions which 
 had crept in in his absence; and very active he was in reforming 
 several abuses, which here we have an account of.

 I. He turned out from Israel the mixed multitude, the Moabites and
 Ammonites especially, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 With a particular indignation, he expelled Tobiah out of the lodgings
 he had got in the court of the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:4-9">ver. 4-9</A>.

 II. He secured the maintenance of the priests and Levites to them more
 firmly than it had been, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:10-14">ver. 10-14</A>.

 III. He restrained the profanation of the sabbath day, and provided for
 the due sanctification of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:15-22">ver. 15-22</A>.

 IV. He checked the growing mischief of marrying strange wives, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:23-31">ver. 23-31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of
 the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and
 the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for
 ever;
 &nbsp; 2  Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and
 with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse
 them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.
 &nbsp; 3  Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they
 separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
 &nbsp; 4  And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of
 the chamber of the house of our God, <I>was</I> allied unto Tobiah:
 &nbsp; 5  And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime
 they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels,
 and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was
 commanded <I>to be given</I> to the Levites, and the singers, and the
 porters; and the offerings of the priests.
 &nbsp; 6  But in all this <I>time</I> was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two
 and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the
 king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:
 &nbsp; 7  And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that
 Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts
 of the house of God.
 &nbsp; 8  And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the
 household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.
 &nbsp; 9  Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither
 brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat
 offering and the frankincense.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was the honour of Israel, and the greatest preservation of their 
 holiness, that they were a peculiar people, and were so to keep 
 themselves, and not to mingle with the nations, nor suffer any of them 
 to incorporate with them. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The law to this purport, which happened to be read <I>on that day, 
 in the audience of the people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 on the day of the dedication of the wall, as it should seem, for with
 their prayers and praises they joined the reading of the word; and 
 though it was long after that the other grievances, here mentioned, 
 were redressed by Nehemiah's power, yet this of the mixed multitude 
 might be redressed then by the people's own act, for so it seems to be, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Or, perhaps, it was on the anniversary commemoration of that day, some
 years after, and therefore said to be <I>on that day.</I> They found a 
 law, that the Ammonites and Moabites should not be naturalized, should 
 not settle among them, nor unite with them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The reason given is because they had been injurious and ill-natured to
 the Israel of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 had not shown them common civility, but sought their ruin, though they
 not only did them no harm, but were expressly forbidden to do them any. 
 This law we have, with this reason,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:3-5">Deut. xxiii. 3-5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The people's ready compliance with this law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 See the benefit of the public reading of the word of God; when it is
 duly attended to it discovers to us sin and duty, good and evil, and 
 shows us wherein we have erred. Then we profit by the discovery when by 
 it we are wrought upon to separate ourselves from all that evil to 
 which we had addicted ourselves. They <I>separated from Israel all the 
 mixed multitude,</I> which had of old been a snare to them, for the 
 <I>mixed multitude fell a lusting,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:4">Num. xi. 4</A>.

 These inmates they expelled, as usurpers and dangerous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The particular case of Tobiah, who was an Ammonite, and to whom, 
 it is likely, the historian had an eye in the recital of the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and the reason of it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 For he had the same enmity to Israel that his ancestors had, the spirit
 of an Ammonite, witness his indignation at Nehemiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:10"><I>ch.</I> ii. 10</A>)

 and the opposition he had given to his undertakings,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:7,8"><I>ch.</I> iv. 7, 8</A>.

 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How basely Eliashib the chief priest took this Tobiah in to be a 
 lodger even in the courts of the temple. 
 
 (1.) He was allied to Tobiah
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 by marriage first and then by friendship. His grandson had married
 Sanballat's daughter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Probably some other of his family had married Tobiah's, and (would you
 think it?) the high priest thought the alliance an honour to his 
 family, and was very proud of it, though really it was his greatest 
 disgrace, and what he had reason to be ashamed of. It was expressly 
 provided by the law that the high priest should marry <I>one of his own 
 people,</I> else he <I>profanes his seed among his people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+21:14,15">Lev. xxi. 14, 15</A>.

 And for Eliashib to contract an alliance with an Ammonite, a
 <I>servant</I> (for so he is called) and to value himself upon it, 
 probably because he has a wit and a beau, and cried up for a fine 
 gentleman

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:19"><I>ch.</I> vi. 19</A>),

 was such a contempt of the crown of his consecration as one would not
 wish should be told in Gath or published in the streets of Ashkelon. 
 
 (2.) Being allied to him, he must be acquainted with him. Tobiah, being
 a man of business, has often occasion to be at Jerusalem, I doubt upon 
 no good design. Eliashib is fond of his new kinsman, pleased with his 
 company, and must have him as near him as he can. He has not a room for 
 him stately enough in his own apartment, in the courts of the temple; 
 therefore, out of several little chambers which had been used for 
 store-chambers, by taking down the partitions, he contrived to make one 
 great chamber, a state-room for Tobiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 A wretched thing it was,
 
 [1.] That Tobiah the Ammonite should be entertained with respect in
 Israel, and have a magnificent reception. 

 [2.] That the high priest, who should have taught the people the law
 and set them a good example, should, contrary to the law, give him 
 entertainment, and make use of the power he had, as overseer of the 
 chambers of the temple, for that purpose. 

 [3.] That he should lodge him in the courts of God's house, as if to
 confront God himself; this was next to setting up an idol there, as the 
 wicked kings of old had done.  An Ammonite must not <I>come into the 
 congregation;</I> and shall one of the worst and vilest of the 
 Ammonites be courted into the temple itself, and caressed there? 

 [4.] That he should throw out the stores of the temple, to make room
 for him, and so expose them to be lost, wasted, and embezzled, though 
 they were the <I>portions of the priests,</I> merely to gratify Tobiah. 
 Thus did he <I>corrupt the covenant of Levi,</I> as Malachi complained 
 at this time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:8"><I>ch.</I> ii. 8</A>.

 Well might Nehemiah add 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>But all this time was not I at Jerusalem.</I> If he had been there,
 the high priest durst not have done such a thing. The envious one, who 
 sows tares in God's field, knows how to take an opportunity to do it 
 when the <I>servants sleep</I> or are absent,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:25">Matt. xiii. 25</A>.

 The golden calf was made when Moses was in the mount.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How bravely Nehemiah, the chief governor, threw him out, and all 
 that belonged to him, and restored the chambers to their proper use. 
 When he came to Jerusalem, and was informed by the good people who were 
 troubled at it what an intimacy had grown between their chief priest 
 and their chief enemy, it <I>grieve him sorely</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>)

 that God's house should be so profaned, his enemies so caressed and
 trusted, and his cause betrayed by him that should have been its 
 protector and patron. Nothing grieves a good man, a good magistrate, 
 more than to see the ministers of God's house do any wicked thing. 
 Nehemiah has power and he will use it for God.

 (1.) Tobiah shall be expelled. He fears not disobliging him, fears not
 his resentments, or Eliashib's, nor excuses himself from interposing in 
 an affair that lay within the jurisdiction of the high priest; but, 
 like one zealously affected in a good thing, he expels the intruder, by 
 casting forth all his household stuff. He did not seize it for his own 
 use, but cast it out, that Tobiah, who it is probable was now absent, 
 when he came again, might have no conveniences for his reception there. 
 Our Saviour thus <I>cleansed the temple,</I> that the <I>house of 
 prayer</I> might not be a <I>den of thieves.</I> And thus those that 
 would expel sin out of their hearts, those living temples, must throw 
 out its household stuff and all the provision made for it, strip it, 
 starve it, and take away all those things that are the food and fuel of 
 lust; this is, in effect, to mortify it.

 (2.) The temple stores shall be brought in again, and the <I>vessels of
 the house of God put in their places;</I> but the chambers must first 
 be sprinkled with the water of purification, and so cleansed, because 
 they had been profaned. Thus, when sin is cast out of the heart by 
 repentance, let the blood of Christ be applied to it by faith, and then 
 let it be furnished with the graces of God's Spirit for every good 
 work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not
 been given <I>them:</I> for the Levites and the singers, that did the
 work, were fled every one to his field.
 &nbsp; 11  Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house
 of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in
 their place.
 &nbsp; 12  Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new
 wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
 &nbsp; 13  And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the
 priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and
 next to them <I>was</I> Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah:
 for they were counted faithful, and their office <I>was</I> to
 distribute unto their brethren.
 &nbsp; 14  Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my
 good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the
 offices thereof.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is another grievance redressed by Nehemiah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The Levites had been wronged. This was the grievance: their 
 <I>portions had not been given them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Perhaps Tobiah, when he took possession of the store-chambers, seized
 the stores too, and, by the connivance of Eliashib, converted them to 
 his own use. The complaint is not that they were not collected from the 
 people, but that they were not given to the Levites, and the Levites 
 were so modest as not to sue for them; <I>for the Levites and singers 
 fled every one to his field.</I> This comes in as a reason either,

 (1.) Why their payments were withheld. The Levites were non-residents:
 when they should have been doing their work about the temple, they were 
 at their farms in the country; and therefore the people were little 
 inclined to give them their maintenance. If ministers have not the 
 encouragement they should have, let them consider whether they 
 themselves be not accessory to the contempt they are under, by the 
 neglect of their business. Or rather,

 (2.) It is the reason why Nehemiah soon perceived that their dues had
 been denied them, because he missed them from their posts. "Where are 
 the singers" (said Nehemiah); "why do not they attend according to 
 their office, to praise God?" "Why, truly, they have gone every one to 
 his country seat, to get a livelihood for themselves and their families 
 out of their grounds; for their profession would not maintain them." A 
 scandalous maintenance makes a scandalous ministry.  The work is 
 neglected because the workmen are. It was not long since the payment of 
 the salaries appointed for the singers was put into a very good method

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+12:47"><I>ch.</I> xii. 47</A>);

 and yet how soon did it fail for want of being looked after!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Nehemiah laid the fault upon the rulers, who should have taken care 
 that the Levites minded their business and had all due encouragement 
 therein. This is required from Christian magistrates, that they use 
 their power to oblige ministers to do their duty, and people to do 
 theirs. Nehemiah began with the rulers, and called them to an account: 
 "<I>Why is the house of God forsaken?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Why are the Levites starved out of it? Why did not you take notice of
 this and prevent it?" The people <I>forsook the Levites,</I> which was 
 expressly forbidden

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:19,14:27">Deut. xii. 19; xiv. 27</A>);

 and then the Levites forsook their post in the house of God. Both
 ministers and people who forsake religion and the services of it, and 
 magistrates too who do not what they can to keep them to it, will have 
 a great deal to answer for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He delayed not to bring the dispersed Levites to <I>their 
 places</I> again, and set them in <I>their stations</I> (as the word 
 is), 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 A Levite in his field (<I>clericus in foro--a minister keeping the
 market</I>) is out of his station.  God's house is his place, and there 
 let him be found. Many that are careless would do much better than they 
 do if they were but called upon. <I>Say to Archippus, Take heed to thy 
 ministry.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He obliged the people to bring in their tithes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 His zeal provoked theirs; and, when they saw the Levites at their work,
 they could not for shame withhold their wages any longer, but honestly 
 and cheerfully brought them in. The better church-work is done the 
 better will church-dues be paid.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He provided that just and prompt payment should be made of the 
 Levites' stipends. Commissioners were appointed to see to this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 and they were such as <I>were accounted faithful,</I> that is, had
 approved themselves so in other trusts committed to them, and so had 
 <I>purchased to themselves this good degree,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:13">1 Tim. iii. 13</A>.

 Let men be tried first and then trusted, tried in the less and then
 trusted with more. Their office was to receive and pay, to distribute 
 to their brethren in due season and due proportions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Having no recompence (it is a question whether he had thanks) from 
 those for whom he did these good services, he looks up to God as his 
 paymaster 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Remember me, O my God! concerning this.</I> Nehemiah was a man much
 in pious ejaculations; on every occasion he looked up to God, and 
 committed himself and his affairs to him. 

 1. He here reflects with comfort and much satisfaction upon what he had
 done for the house of God and the offices thereof; it pleased him to 
 think that he had been any way instrumental to revive and support 
 religion in his country and to reform what was amiss. What kindness any 
 show to God's ministers, thus shall it be returned into their own 
 bosoms, in the secret joy they shall have there, not only in having 
 done well, but in having done good, good to many, good to souls. 

 2. He here refers it to God to consider him for it, not in pride, or as
 boasting of what he had done, much less depending upon it as his 
 righteousness, or as if he thought he had made God a debtor to him, but 
 in a humble appeal to him concerning his integrity and honest intention 
 in what he had done, and a believing expectation that he would not be 
 unrighteous to <I>forget his work and labour of love,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:10">Heb. vi. 10</A>.
 
 Observe how modest he is in his requests. He only prays, <I>Remember
 me,</I> not <I>Reward me--Wipe not out my good deeds,</I> not 
 <I>Publish them, Record them.</I> Yet he was rewarded and his good 
 deeds were recorded; for God does more than we are able to ask. Note, 
 Deeds done <I>for the house of God and the offices of it,</I> for the 
 support of religion and the encouragement of it, are good deeds. There 
 is both righteousness and godliness in them, and God will certainly 
 remember them, and not wipe them out; they shall in no wise lose their 
 reward.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  In those days saw I in Judah <I>some</I> treading wine presses on
 the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also
 wine, grapes, and figs, and all <I>manner of</I> burdens, which they
 brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified
 <I>against them</I> in the day wherein they sold victuals.
 &nbsp; 16  There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish,
 and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children
 of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 17  Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto
 them, What evil thing <I>is</I> this that ye do, and profane the
 sabbath day?
 &nbsp; 18  Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all
 this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath
 upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
 &nbsp; 19  And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began
 to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should
 be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after
 the sabbath: and <I>some</I> of my servants set I at the gates, <I>that</I>
 there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
 &nbsp; 20  So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged
 without Jerusalem once or twice.
 &nbsp; 21  Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge
 ye about the wall? if ye do <I>so</I> again, I will lay hands on you.
 From that time forth came they no <I>more</I> on the sabbath.
 &nbsp; 22  And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse
 themselves, and <I>that</I> they should come <I>and</I> keep the gates, to
 sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, <I>concerning</I>
 this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is another instance of that blessed reformation in which Nehemiah 
 was so active. He revived sabbath-sanctification, and maintained the 
 authority of the fourth commandment; and a very good deed this was for 
 the house of God and the offices thereof, for, where holy time is 
 over-looked and made nothing of, it is not strange if all holy duties 
 be neglected. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A remonstrance of the abuse. The law of the sabbath was very strict 
 and much insisted one, and with good reason, for religion is never in 
 the throne while sabbaths are trodden under foot. But Nehemiah 
 discovered even in Judah, among those to whom sabbaths were given for a 
 sign, this law wretchedly violated. His own eyes were his informers. 
 Magistrates who are in care to discharge their duty aright will as much 
 as may be <I>see with their own eyes,</I> and <I>accomplish a diligent 
 search</I> to find out that which is evil. To his great grief it 
 appeared that there was a general profanation of the sabbath, that holy 
 day, even in Jerusalem, that holy city, which was so lately dedicated 
 to God. 

 1. The husbandmen trod their wine-presses and brought home their corn
 on that day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 through there was an express command that <I>in earing-time, and in
 harvest-time, they should rest</I> on the sabbaths

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:21">Exod. xxxiv. 21</A>),

 because then they might be tempted to take a greater liberty, and to
 fancy that God would indulge them in it. 

 2. The carriers <I>loaded their asses with all manner of burdens,</I>
 and made no scruple of it, though there was a particular proviso in the 
 law for the cattle resting

 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+5:14">Deut. v. 14</A>)

 and that they should <I>bear no burden on the sabbath day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:21">Jer. xvii. 21</A>.

 3. The hawkers, and pedlars, and petty chapmen, that were men of Tyre,
 that famous trading city, <I>sold all manner of wares</I> on the 
 sabbath day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 and the children of Judah and Jerusalem had so little grace as to buy
 of them, and so encourage them in making our Father's day a day of 
 merchandise, contrary to the law of the fourth commandment, which 
 forbids the <I>doing any manner of work.</I> No wonder there was a 
 general decay of religion and corruption of manners among this people 
 when they <I>forsook the sanctuary</I> and <I>profaned the 
 sabbath.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reformation of it. Those that are jealous for the honour of God 
 cannot bear to see his sabbath profaned. Observe in what method this 
 good man proceeded in his zeal for the sabbath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>He testified against those</I> who profaned it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>,
 
 and again
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 He not only expressed his own dislike of it, but endeavoured to
 convince them that it was a great sin, and showed them the testimony of 
 the word of God against it. He would not punish it till he had laid 
 open the evil of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He reasoned with the rulers concerning it, took the nobles of Judah 
 to task, and contended with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The greatest of men are not too high to be told of their faults by
 those whose proper office it is to reprove them; nay, great men should 
 be, as here, contended with in the first place, because of the 
 influence they have upon others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He charges them with it: <I>You do it.</I> They did not carry 
 corn, nor sell fish, but, 

 [1.] They connived at those that did, and did not use their power to
 restrain them, and so made themselves guilty, as those magistrates do 
 who bear the sword in vain. 

 [2.] They set a bad example in other things. If the nobles allowed
 themselves in sports and recreations, in idle visits and idle talk, on 
 the sabbath day, the men of business, both in city and country, would 
 profane it by their worldly employments, as more justifiable. We must 
 be responsible for the sins which others are led to commit by our 
 example.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He charges it upon them as an evil thing, for so it is, proceeding 
 from a great contempt of God and our own souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He reasons the case with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 and shows them that sabbath breaking was one of the sins for which God
 had brought judgments upon them, and that if they did not take warning, 
 but returned to the same sins again, they had reason to expect further 
 judgments: <I>You bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the 
 sabbath.</I> Thus Ezra concluded, <I>If we again break thy 
 commandments, wilt not thou be angry with us till thou hast consumed 
 us?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:14">Ezra ix. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He took care to prevent the profanation of the sabbath, as one that 
 aimed only at reformation. If he could reform them, he would not punish 
 them, and, if he should punish them, it was but that he might reform 
 them. This is an example to magistrates to be heirs of restraint, and 
 prudently to use the bit and bridle, that there may be no occasion for 
 the lash. 

 (1.) He ordered the gates of Jerusalem to be kept shut from the evening
 before the sabbath to the morning after, and set his own servants 
 (whose care, courage and honesty, he could confide in) to watch them, 
 that no burdens should be brought in on the sabbath day, nor late the 
 night before, nor early in the morning after, lest sabbath time should 
 be encroached upon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Those that came in to worship in the courts of the temple were no doubt
 admitted to pass and repass, but none that came to sell goods; 
 <I>they</I> were forced to <I>lodge without the city</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 where no doubt they wished the sabbath were gone, that they might sell
 corn.

 (2.) He threatened those who came with goods to the gates, who pressed
 hard for entrance, telling them that, if they came again, he would 
 certainly lay hands on them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 and this deterred them from coming any more. Note, If reformers will
 but put on resolution, more may be done towards the breaking of bad 
 customs than they can imagine. Vice connived at is indeed a daring 
 thing, and will bid defiance to counsel and reproof; but it may be made 
 cowardly, and will be so when magistrates make themselves a terror to 
 it. <I>The king that sits on the throne of judgment scatters away all 
 evil with his eyes.</I>

 (3.) He charged the Levites to take care about the due sanctifying of
 the sabbath, that they should cleanse themselves in the first place, 
 and so give a good example to the people, and <I>that they should</I> 
 some of them <I>come and keep the gates,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Because he and his servants must shortly return to court, he would
 leave this charge with some that might abide by it, that not only when 
 he was present, but in his absence, the sabbath might be sanctified.  
 Then there is likely to be a reformation, in this and other respects, 
 when magistrates and ministers join their forces. The courage, zeal, 
 and prudence of Nehemiah in this matter, are here recorded for our 
 imitation; and we have reason to think that the cure he wrought was 
 lasting; for, in our Saviour's time, we find the Jews in the other 
 extreme, over-scrupulous in the ceremonial part of 
 sabbath-sanctification.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He concludes this passage with a prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 in which observe,
 
 (1.) The petitions: <I>Remember me</I> (as the thief on the cross,
 <I>Lord, remember me</I>); that is enough. God's thoughts to us ward 
 are very precious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:5">Ps. xl. 5</A>.

 He adds, <I>Spare me.</I> So far is he from thinking that what he had
 done did properly merit a reward in strict justice that he cries 
 earnestly to God to <I>spare him,</I> as Jeremiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+15:15"><I>ch.</I> xv. 15</A>),

 <I>Take me not away in thy long-suffering</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+10:24"><I>ch.</I> x. 24</A>),
 
 <I>Correct me not in anger,</I> and
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+17:17"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 17</A>),

 <I>Be not a terror to me.</I> Note, The best saints, even when they do
 the best actions, stand in need of <I>sparing mercy;</I> for <I>there 
 is not a just man that doeth good and sinneth not.</I> 

 (2.) The plea: <I>According to the greatness</I> (or multitude) <I>of
 thy mercies.</I> Note, God's mercy is what we must depend upon, and not 
 any merit of our own, when we appear before God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  In those days also saw I Jews <I>that</I> had married wives of
 Ashdod, of Ammon, <I>and</I> of Moab:
 &nbsp; 24  And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and
 could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the
 language of each people.
 &nbsp; 25  And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote
 certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear
 by God, <I>saying,</I> Ye shall not give your daughters unto their
 sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.
 &nbsp; 26  Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet
 among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of
 his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even
 him did outlandish women cause to sin.
 &nbsp; 27  Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to
 transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?
 &nbsp; 28  And <I>one</I> of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the
 high priest, <I>was</I> son in law to Sanballat the Horonite:
 therefore I chased him from me.
 &nbsp; 29  Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the
 priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the
 Levites.
 &nbsp; 30  Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the
 wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;
 &nbsp; 31  And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the
 firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here one instance more of Nehemiah's pious zeal for the 
 purifying of his countrymen as a peculiar people to God; that was the 
 thing he aimed at in the use of his power, not the enriching of 
 himself. See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How they had corrupted themselves by marrying strange wives. This 
 was complained of in Ezra's time, and much done towards a reformation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:1-10:44">Ezra ix. and x.</A>

 But, when the unclean spirit is cast out, if a watchful eye be not kept
 upon him, he will re-enter; so he did here. Though in Ezra's time those 
 that had married strange wives were forced to put them away, which 
 could not but occasion trouble and confusion in families, yet others 
 would not take warning. <I>Nitimur in vetitum--we still lean towards 
 what is forbidden.</I> Nehemiah, like a good governor, enquired into 
 the state of the families of those that were under his charge, that he 
 might reform what was amiss in them, and so heal the streams by healing 
 the springs.

 1. He enquired whence they had their wives, and found that many of the
 Jews had <I>married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 either because they were fond of what was far-fetched or because they
 hoped by these alliances to strengthen and enrich themselves. See how 
 God by the prophet reproves this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:11">Mal. ii. 11</A>.

 <I>Judah has dealt treacherously,</I> and broken covenant with God, the
 covenant made in Ezra's time with reference to this very thing; he has 
 <I>profaned the holiness of the Lord</I> by <I>marrying the 
 daughter</I> (that is, the worshipper) <I>of a strange god.</I> 

 2. He talked with the children, and found they were <I>children of
 strangers,</I> for their <I>speech betrayed them.</I> The children were 
 bred up with their mothers, and learned of them and their nurses and 
 servants to speak, so that they could not speak the Jews' language, 
 could not speak it at all, or not readily, or not purely, but <I>half 
 in the speech of Ashdod,</I> or Ammon, or Moab, according as the 
 country was which the mother was a native of.  Observe,

 (1.) Children, in their childhood, learn much of their mothers.
 <I>Partus sequitur ventrem--they are prone to imitate their 
 mothers.</I>

 (2.) If either side be bad, the corrupt nature will incline the
 children to take after that, which is a good reason why Christians 
 should not be unequally yoked.

 (3.) In the education of children great care should be taken about the
 government of their tongues, that they learn not the language of 
 Ashdod, any impious or impure talk, any corrupt communication.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What course Nehemiah took to purge out this corruption, when he 
 discovered how much it had prevailed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He showed them the evil of it, and the obligation he lay under to 
 witness against it. He did not seek an occasion against them, but this 
 was an iniquity to be punished by the judge, and which he must by no 
 means connive at 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 "<I>Shall we hearken to you,</I> who endeavour to palliate and excuse
 it? No, it is an evil, a great evil, it is a <I>transgression against 
 our God, to marry strange wives,</I> and we must do our utmost to put a 
 stop to it. You beg that they may not be divorced from you, but we 
 cannot hearken to you, for there is no other remedy to clear us from 
 the guilt and prevent infection."

 (1.) He quotes a precept, to prove that it was in itself a great sin;
 and makes them swear to that precept: <I>You shall not give your 
 daughters unto their sons,</I> &c., which is taken from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:3">Deut. vii. 3</A>.

 When we would reclaim people from sin we must show them the sinfulness
 of it in the glass of the commandment. 

 (2.) He quotes a precedent, to show the pernicious consequences of it,
 which made it necessary to be animadverted upon by the government

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things?</I> The falls of
 great and good men are recorded in order that we may take warning by 
 them to shun the temptations which they were overcome by. Solomon was 
 famous for wisdom; there was no king like him for it; yet, when he 
 married strange wives, his wisdom could not secure him from their 
 snares, nay, it departed from him, and he did very foolishly. He was 
 beloved of God, but his marrying strange wives threw him out of God's 
 favour, and went near to extinguish the holy fire of grace in his soul: 
 he was king over all Israel; but his doing this occasioned the loss of 
 ten of his twelve tribes. You plead that you can marry strange wives 
 and yet retain the purity of Israelites; but Solomon himself could not; 
 even <I>him did outlandish women cause to sin.</I> Therefore let him 
 that <I>thinks he stands take heed lest he fall</I> when he runs upon 
 such a precipice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He showed himself highly displeased at it, that he might awaken them 
 to a due sense of the evil of it: <I>He contended with them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 They offered to justify themselves in what they did, but he showed them
 how frivolous their excuses were, and argued it warmly with them. When 
 he had silenced them he <I>cursed them,</I> that is, he denounced the 
 judgments of God against them, and showed them what their sin deserved. 
 He then picked out some of them that were more obstinate than the rest, 
 and fit to be made examples, and <I>smote them</I> (that is, ordered 
 them to be beaten by the proper officers according to the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:2,3">Deut. xxv. 2, 3</A>),

 to which he added this further mark of infamy that he <I>plucked off
 their hair,</I> or cut or shaved it off; for it may so be understood. 
 Perhaps they had prided themselves in their hair, and therefore he took 
 it off to deform and humble them, and put them to shame; it was, in 
 effect, to stigmatize them, at least for a time.  Ezra, in this case, 
 had plucked off his own hair, in holy sorrow for the sin; Nehemiah 
 plucked off their hair, in a holy indignation at the sinners. See the 
 different tempers of wise, and good, and useful men, and the divers 
 graces, as well as divers gifts, of the same Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He obliged them not to take any more such wives, and separated those 
 whom they had taken: <I>He cleansed them from all strangers,</I> both 
 men and women 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 and made them promise with an oath that they would never do so again,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Thus did he try all ways and means to put a stop to this mischief and
 to prevent another relapse into this disease.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He took particular care of the priests' families, that they might 
 not lie under this stain, this guilt. He found, upon enquiry, that a 
 branch of the high priest's own family, one of his grandsons, had 
 married a daughter of Sanballat, that notorious enemy of the Jews 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:10,4:1"><I>ch.</I> ii. 10; iv. 1</A>),

 and so had, in effect, twisted interests with the Samaritans, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.
 
 How little love had that man either to God or his country who could
 make himself in duty and interest a friend to him that was a sworn 
 enemy to both.  It seems this young priest would not put away his wife, 
 and therefore Nehemiah <I>chased him from him,</I> deprived him, 
 degraded him, and made him for ever incapable of the priesthood. 
 Josephus says that this expelled priest was Manasseh, and that when 
 Nehemiah drove him away he went to his father-in-law Sanballat, who 
 built him a temple upon Mount Gerazim, like that at Jerusalem, and 
 promised him he should be high priest in it, and that then was laid the 
 foundation of the Samaritans' pretensions, which continued warm to our 
 Saviour's time. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:20">John iv. 20</A>,

 <I>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain.</I> When Nehemiah had thus
 expelled one that had forfeited the honour of the priesthood he again 
 posted the <I>priests and Levites every one in his business,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 
 It was no loss to them to part with one that was the scandal of their
 cloth; the work would be done better without him. When Judas had gone 
 out Christ said, <I>Now is the Son of Man glorified,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:30,31">John xiii. 30, 31</A>.

 Here are Nehemiah's prayers on this occasion. 

 (1.) He prays, <I>Remember them, O my God!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 "Lord, convince and convert them; put them in mind of what they should
 be and do, that they may come to themselves." Or, "Remember them to 
 reckon with them for their sin; remember it against them." If we take 
 it so, this prayer is a prophecy that God would remember it against 
 them. Those that defile the priesthood despise God, and shall be 
 lightly esteemed.  Perhaps they were too many and too great for him to 
 deal with. "Lord" (says he), "deal thou with them; take the work into 
 thy own hands."

 (2.) He prays, <I>Remember me, O my God!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 The best services done to the public have sometimes been forgotten by
 those for whom they were done

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:15">Eccl. ix. 15</A>);

 therefore Nehemiah refers it to God to recompense him, takes him for his
 paymaster, and then doubts not but he shall be well paid. This may well 
 be the summary of our petitions; we need no more to make us happy than 
 this: <I>Remember me, O my God! for good.</I></P>
