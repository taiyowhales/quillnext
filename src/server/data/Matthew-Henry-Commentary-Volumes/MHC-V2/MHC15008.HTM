 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  These <I>are</I> now the chief of their fathers, and <I>this is</I> the
 genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign
 of Artaxerxes the king.
 &nbsp; 2  Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar;
 Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush.
 &nbsp; 3  Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah:
 and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males a hundred
 and fifty.
 &nbsp; 4  Of the sons of Pahath-moab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and
 with him two hundred males.
 &nbsp; 5  Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him
 three hundred males.
 &nbsp; 6  Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with
 him fifty males.
 &nbsp; 7  And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and
 with him seventy males.
 &nbsp; 8  And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael,
 and with him fourscore males.
 &nbsp; 9  Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him
 two hundred and eighteen males.
 &nbsp; 10  And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with
 him a hundred and threescore males.
 &nbsp; 11  And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and
 with him twenty and eight males.
 &nbsp; 12  And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and
 with him a hundred and ten males.
 &nbsp; 13  And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names <I>are</I> these,
 Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males.
 &nbsp; 14  Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them
 seventy males.
 &nbsp; 15  And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to
 Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the
 people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of
 Levi.
 &nbsp; 16  Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for
 Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and
 for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib,
 and for Elnathan, men of understanding.
 &nbsp; 17  And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the
 place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo,
 <I>and</I> to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that
 they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.
 &nbsp; 18  And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a
 man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the
 son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren,
 eighteen;
 &nbsp; 19  And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari,
 his brethren and their sons, twenty;
 &nbsp; 20  Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had
 appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty
 Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Ezra, having received his commission from the king, beats up for 
 volunteers, as it were, sets up an ensign to assemble the outcasts of 
 Israel and the dispersed of Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:12">Isa. xi. 12</A>.

 "Whoever of the sons of Sion, that <I>swell with the daughters of
 Babylon,</I> is disposed to go to Jerusalem, now that the temple there 
 is finished and the temple-service set a-going, now is their time." Now 
 one would think that under such a leader, with such encouragements, all 
 the Jews should at length have <I>shaken themselves from their 
 dust,</I> and <I>loosed the bands of their neck,</I> according to that 
 call,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:1,2">Isa. lii. 1, 2</A>,

 &c.
 I wonder how any of them could read that chapter and yet stay behind. 
 But multitudes did. They loved their ease better than their religion, 
 thought themselves well off where they were, and either believed not 
 that Jerusalem would better their condition or durst not go thither 
 through any difficulties. But here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That some offered themselves willingly to go with Ezra. The heads of 
 the several families are here named, for their honour, and the numbers 
 of the males that each brought in, amounting in all to 1496. Two 
 priests are named 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 and one of the sons of David; but, it should seem, they came without
 their families, probably intending to see how they liked Jerusalem and 
 then either to send for their families or return to them as they saw 
 cause. Several of their families, or clans, here named, we had before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:3-20"><I>ch.</I> ii.</A>

 Some went up from them at that time, more went up now, as God inclined
 their hearts; some were called into the vineyard at the third hour, 
 others not till the eleventh, yet even those were not rejected. But 
 here we read of <I>the last sons of Adonikam</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 which some understand to their dispraise, that they were the last that
 enlisted themselves under Ezra; I rather understand it to their honour, 
 that now all the sons of that family returned and none staid 
 behind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the Levites who went in this company were in a manner pressed 
 into the service. Ezra appointed a general rendezvous of all his 
 company at a certain place upon new-year's day, the first day of the 
 first month. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:9"><I>ch.</I> vii. 9</A>.

 Then and there he took a view of them, and mustered them, and (which
 was strange) <I>found there none of the sons of Levi,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Some priests there were, but no others that were Levites. Where was the
 spirit of that sacred tribe? Ezra, a priest, like Moses proclaims, 
 <I>Who is on the Lord's side?</I> They, unlike to Levi, shrink, and 
 desire to <I>abide among the sheep-folds to hear the bleatings of the 
 flock.</I> Synagogues we suppose they had in Babylon, in which they 
 prayed, and preached, and kept sabbaths (and, when they could not have 
 better, they had reason to be thankful for them); but now that the 
 temple at Jerusalem was opened, to the service of which they were 
 ordained, they ought to have preferred the gates of Zion before all 
 those synagogues. It is upon record here, to their reproach; but 
 <I>tell it not in Gath.</I> Ezra, when he observed that he had no 
 Levites in his retinue, was much at a loss. He had money enough for the 
 service of the temple, but wanted men. The king and princes had more 
 than done their part, but the sons of Levi had not half done theirs.  
 Eleven men, chief men, and men of understanding, he chooses out of his 
 company, to be employed for the filling up of this lamentable vacancy; 
 and here we are informed,

 1. Of their being sent. Ezra sent them to a proper place, where there
 as a college of Levites, <I>the place Casiphia,</I> probably a street 
 or square in Babylon allowed for that purpose--<I>Silver Street</I> one 
 may call it, for <I>ceseph</I> signifies <I>silver.</I> He sent them to 
 a proper person, to Iddo, the chief president of the college, not to 
 urge him to come himself (we will suppose him to be old and unfit for 
 such a remove), but to send some of the juniors, <I>ministers for the 
 house of our God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The furnishing of God's house with good ministers is a good work, which
 will redound to the comfort and credit of all that have a hand in it.

 2. Of their success. They did not return without their errand, but,
 though the warning was short, they brought about forty Levites to 
 attend Ezra, Sherebiah, noted as a very intelligent man, and eighteen 
 with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>).

 Hashabiah, and Jeshaiah, and twenty with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 By this it appears that they were not averse to go, but were slothful
 and inattentive, and only wanted to be called upon and excited to go.  
 What a pity it is that good men should omit a good work, merely for 
 want of being spoken to! What a pity that they should need it, but, if 
 they do, what a pity that they should be left without it! Of the 
 Nethinim, the servitors of the sacred college, the <I>species 
 infima--the lowest order</I> of the temple ministers, more appeared 
 forward to go than of the Levites themselves. Of them 220, upon this 
 hasty summons, enlisted themselves, and had the honour to be expressed 
 by name in Ezra's muster-roll, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 "Thus," says Ezra, "were we furnished with Levites, <I>by the good hand
 of our God upon us.</I>" If, where ministers have been wanting, the 
 vacancies are well supplied, let God have the glory, and his good hand 
 be acknowledged as qualifying them for the service, inclining them to 
 it, and then opening a door of opportunity for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that
 we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right
 way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.
 &nbsp; 22  For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers
 and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we
 had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God <I>is</I> upon
 all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath <I>is</I>
 against all them that forsake him.
 &nbsp; 23  So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was
 intreated of us.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Ezra has procured Levites to go along with him; but what will that 
 avail, unless he have God with him? That is therefore his chief care. 
 In all our ways we must acknowledge God, and in those particularly 
 wherein we are endeavouring to serve the interest of his kingdom among 
 men. Ezra does so here. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The stedfast confidence he had in God and in his gracious 
 protection. He told the king 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 what principles he went upon, that those who seek God are safe under
 the shadow of his wings, even in their greatest dangers, but that those 
 who forsake him are continually exposed, even when they are most 
 secure. God's servants have his power engaged for them; his enemies 
 have it engaged against them. This Ezra believed with his heart, and 
 with his mouth made confession of it before the king; and therefore he 
 was ashamed to ask of the king a convoy, lest thereby he should give 
 occasion to the king, and those about him, to suspect either God's 
 power to help his people or Ezra's confidence in that power. Those that 
 trust in God, and triumph in him, will be ashamed of seeking to the 
 creature for protection, especially of using any sorry shifts for their 
 own safety, because thereby they contradict themselves and their own 
 confidence. Not but that those who depend upon God must use proper 
 means for their preservation, and they need not be ashamed to do so; 
 but, when the honour of God is concerned, one would rather expose 
 one's-self than do any thing to the prejudice of that, which ought to 
 be dearer to us than our lives.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The solemn application he made to God in that confidence: He 
 <I>proclaimed a fast,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 No doubt he had himself begged of God direction in this affair from the
 first time he had it in his thoughts; but for public mercies public 
 prayers must be made, that all who are to share in the comfort of them 
 may join in the request for them. Their fasting was,

 1. To express their humiliation. This he declares to be the intent and
 meaning of it. "<I>that we might afflict ourselves before our God</I> 
 for our sins, and so be qualified for the pardon of them." When we are 
 entering upon any new condition of life our care should be to bring 
 none of the guilt of the sins of our former condition into it. When we 
 are in any imminent peril let us be sure to make our peace with God, 
 and then we are safe: nothing can do us any real hurt. 

 2. To excite their supplications. Prayer was always joined with 
 religious fasting.  Their errand to the throne of grace was <I>to seek 
 of God the right way,</I> that is, to commit themselves to the guidance 
 of the divine Providence, to put themselves under the divine 
 protection, and to beg of God to guide and keep them in their journey 
 and bring them safely to their journey's end. They were strangers in 
 the road, were to march through their enemies' countries, and had not a 
 pillar of cloud and fire to lead them, as their fathers had; but they 
 believed that the power and favour of God, and the ministration of his 
 angels, would be to them instead of that, and hoped by prayer to obtain 
 divine assistance. Note, All our concerns about ourselves, our 
 families, and our estates, it is our wisdom and duty by prayer to 
 commit to God, and leave the care of with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:6">Phil. iv. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The good success of their doing so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>We besought our God</I> by joint-prayer, <I>and he was entreated of
 us.</I> They had some comfortable assurance in their own minds that 
 their prayers were answered, and the event declared it; for never any 
 that sought God in earnest sought him in vain.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests,
 Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
 &nbsp; 25  And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the
 vessels, <I>even</I> the offering of the house of our God, which the
 king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel <I>there</I>
 present, had offered:
 &nbsp; 26  I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents
 of silver, and silver vessels a hundred talents, <I>and</I> of gold
 a hundred talents;
 &nbsp; 27  Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two
 vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.
 &nbsp; 28  And I said unto them, Ye <I>are</I> holy unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; the
 vessels <I>are</I> holy also; and the silver and the gold <I>are</I> a
 freewill offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of your fathers.
 &nbsp; 29  Watch ye, and keep <I>them,</I> until ye weigh <I>them</I> before the
 chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of
 Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 30  So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the
 silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring <I>them</I> to
 Jerusalem unto the house of our God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the particular care which Ezra took of the 
 treasure he had with him, that belonged to God's sanctuary, Observe, 

 1.  Having committed the keeping of it to God, he committed the keeping
 of it to proper men, whose business it was to watch it, though without 
 God they would have waked in vain. Note, Our prayers must always be 
 seconded with our endeavours; the care of Christ's gospel, his church, 
 and ordinances, must not be so left with him but that it must also be 
 <I>committed to faithful men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:2">2 Tim. ii. 2</A>.

 2. Having prayed to God to preserve all the substance they had with
 them, he shows himself especially solicitous for that part of it which 
 belonged to the house of God and was an offering to him. Do we expect 
 that God should, by his providence, keep that which belongs to us? Let 
 us, by his grace, keep that which belongs to him. Let God's honour and 
 interest be our care; and then we may expect that our lives and 
 comforts will be his.  Observe,

 (1.) The persons to whom he delivered the offerings of the house of
 God. Twelve chief priests, and as many Levites, he appointed to this 
 trust

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:24,30"><I>v.</I> 24, 30</A>),

 who were bound by their office to take care of the things of God, and
 were in a particular manner to have the benefit of these sacred 
 treasures. Ezra tells them why he put those things into their hands

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>You are holy unto the Lord, the vessels are holy also;</I> and who
 so fit to take care of holy things as holy persons? Those that have the 
 dignity and honour of the priesthood must take along with them the 
 trust and duty of it. The prophet is foretelling the return of God's 
 people and ministers out of Babylon, when he gives the solemn charge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:11">Isa. lii. 11</A>),

 <I>Be you clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.</I>

 (2.) The great exactness with which he lodged this trust in their
 hands: He <I>weighed to them the silver, the gold, and the vessels</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 because he expected to have it from them again by weight. In all trust,
 but especially sacred ones, we ought to be punctual, and preserve a 
 right understanding on both sides. In Zerubbabel's time the vessels 
 were delivered by number, here by weight, that all might be 
 forth-coming and it might easily appear if any were missing, to 
 intimate that such as are entrusted with holy things (as all the 
 stewards of the mysteries of God are) are concerned to remember, both 
 in receiving their trust and in discharging it, that they must shortly 
 give a very particular account of it, that they may be faithful to it 
 and so give up their account with joy.

 (3.) The charge he have them with these treasures

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 "<I>Watch you, and keep them,</I> that they be not lost, nor embezzled,
 nor mingled with the other articles. Keep them together; keep them by 
 themselves; keep them safely, till you weigh them in the temple, before 
 the great men there," hereby intimating how much it was their concern 
 to be careful and faithful and how much it would be their honour to be 
 found so. Thus when Paul charges Timothy with the gospel treasure he 
 bids him keep it <I>until the appearing of Jesus Christ,</I> and his 
 appearing before him to give account of his trust, when his fidelity 
 would be his crown.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth
 <I>day</I> of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of
 our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the
 enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
 &nbsp; 32  And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
 &nbsp; 33  Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the
 vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth
 the son of Uriah the priest; and with him <I>was</I> Eleazar the son
 of Phinehas; and with them <I>was</I> Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and
 Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;
 &nbsp; 34  By number <I>and</I> by weight of every one: and all the weight
 was written at that time.
 &nbsp; 35  <I>Also</I> the children of those that had been carried away,
 which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings
 unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety
 and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats <I>for</I> a
 sin offering: all <I>this was</I> a burnt offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 36  And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's
 lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and
 they furthered the people, and the house of God.

 We are now to attend Ezra to Jerusalem, a journey of about four months 
 in all; but his multitude made his marches slow and his stages short. 
 Now here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That his God was good, and he acknowledged his goodness: <I>The hand 
 of our God was upon us,</I> to animate us for our undertaking. To him 
 they owed it, 

 1. That they were preserved in their journey, and not all cut off; for
 there were enemies that <I>laid wait for them by the way</I> to do them 
 a mischief, or at least, like Amalek, to <I>smite the hindmost of 
 them,</I> but God protected them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Even the common perils of journeys are such as oblige us to sanctify
 our going out with prayer and our returns in peace with praise and 
 thanksgiving; much more ought God to be thus eyed in such a dangerous 
 expedition as this was. 

 2. That they were brought in safety to their journey's end, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Let those that have stedfastly set their faces towards the new
 Jerusalem proceed and persevere to the end <I>till they appear before 
 God in Zion,</I> and they shall find that he <I>who has begun the good 
 work will perform it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That his treasurers were faithful. When they had come to Jerusalem 
 they were impatient to be discharged of their trust, and therefore 
 applied to the great men of the temple, who received it from them and 
 gave them an acquittance in full, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:33,34">v. 33, 34</A>.

 It is a great ease to one's mind to be discharged from a trust, and a
 great honour to one's name to be able to make it appear that it has 
 been faithfully discharged.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That his companions were devout. As soon as they came to be near 
 the altar they thought themselves obliged to offer sacrifice, whatever 
 they had done in Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 That will be dispensed with when we want opportunity which when the
 door is opened again will be expected from us. It is observable,

 1. That among their sacrifices they had a sin-offering; for it is the 
 atonement that sweetens and secures every mercy to us, which will not 
 be truly comfortable unless <I>iniquity be taken away</I> and our peace 
 made with God. 

 2. That the number of their offerings related to the number of the
 tribes, twelve bullocks, twelve he-goats, and ninety-six rams (that is, 
 eight times twelve), intimating the union of the two kingdoms, 
 according to what was foretold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:22">Ezek. xxxvii. 22</A>.

 They did not any longer go two tribes one way and ten another, but all
 the twelve met by their representatives at the same altar.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That even the enemies of the Jews became their friends, bowed to 
 Ezra's commission, and, instead of hindering the people of God, 
 furthered them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 purely in complaisance to the king: when he appeared moderate they all
 coveted to appear so too. <I>Then had the churches rest.</I></P>
