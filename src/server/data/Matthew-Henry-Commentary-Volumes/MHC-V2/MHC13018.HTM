 David's piety and his prayer we had an account of in the foregoing 
 chapter; here follows immediately that which one might reasonably 
 expect, an account of his prosperity; for those that seek first the 
 kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof, as David did, shall have 
 other things added to them as far as God sees good for them. Here is, 
 
 I. His prosperity abroad. He conquered the Philistines

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:1">ver. 1</A>),

 the Moabites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:2">ver. 2</A>),

 the king of Zobah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>),

 the Syrians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:5-8">ver. 5-8</A>),

 made the king of Hamath his tributary 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>),

 and the Edomites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:12,13">ver. 12, 13</A>.

 II. His prosperity at home. His court and kingdom flourished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:14-17">ver. 14-17</A>.

 All this we had an account of before,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the
 Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of
 the hand of the Philistines.
 &nbsp; 2  And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants,
 <I>and</I> brought gifts.
 &nbsp; 3  And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he
 went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
 &nbsp; 4  And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven
 thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also
 houghed all the chariot <I>horses,</I> but reserved of them a hundred
 chariots.
 &nbsp; 5  And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king
 of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
 &nbsp; 6  Then David put <I>garrisons</I> in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians
 became David's servants, <I>and</I> brought gifts. Thus the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 preserved David whithersoever he went.
 &nbsp; 7  And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
 of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 8  Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer,
 brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen
 sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>After this,</I> it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 David did those great exploits.  After the sweet communion he had had
 with God by the word and prayer, as mentioned in the foregoing chapter, 
 he went on his work with extraordinary vigour and courage, 
 <I>conquering and to conquer.</I> Thus Jacob, after his vision, lifted 
 up his feet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+29:1">Gen. xxix. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have taken a view of these victories before, and shall now only 
 observe, 

 1. Those that have been long enemies to the Israel of God will be
 brought down at last. The Philistines had, for several generations, 
 been vexatious to Israel, but now <I>David subdued them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Thus shall all opposing <I>rule, principality, and power,</I> be, at
 the end of time, put down by the Son of David, and the most inveterate 
 enemies shall fall before him. 

 2. Such is the uncertainty of this world that frequently men lose their
 wealth and power when they think to confirm it. Hadarezer was smitten 
 <I>as he went to establish his dominion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 3. <I>A horse is a vain thing for safety,</I> so David said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:17">Ps. xxxiii. 17</A>),

 and it seems he believed what he said, for he <I>houghed the
 chariot-horses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 Being resolved not to trust to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:7">Ps. xx. 7</A>),

 he would not use them. 

 4. The enemies of God's church are often made to ruin themselves by
 helping one another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The Syrians of Damascus were smitten when they came to help Hadarezer.
 When hand thus joins in hand they shall not only not go unpunished, but 
 thereby they shall be gathered <I>as the sheaves into the floor,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:11,12">Mic. iv. 11, 12</A>.

 5. The <I>wealth of the sinner</I> sometimes proves to have been
 <I>laid up for the just.</I> The <I>Syrians brought gifts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Their shields of gold and their brass were brought to Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 As the tabernacle was built of the spoils of the Egyptians, so the
 temple of the spoils of other Gentile nations, a happy presage of the 
 interest the Gentiles should have in the gospel church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all
 the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;
 &nbsp; 10  He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his
 welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against
 Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and
 <I>with him</I> all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.
 &nbsp; 11  Them also king David dedicated unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, with the
 silver and the gold that he brought from all <I>these</I> nations;
 from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and
 from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
 &nbsp; 12  Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in
 the valley of salt eighteen thousand.
 &nbsp; 13  And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became
 David's servants. Thus the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> preserved David whithersoever he
 went.
 &nbsp; 14  So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and
 justice among all his people.
 &nbsp; 15  And Joab the son of Zeruiah <I>was</I> over the host; and
 Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.
 &nbsp; 16  And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of
 Abiathar, <I>were</I> the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
 &nbsp; 17  And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <I>was</I> over the Cherethites
 and the Pelethites; and the sons of David <I>were</I> chief about the
 king.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here let us learn, 

 1. That it is our interest to make those our friends who have the 
 presence of God with them. The king of Hamath, hearing of David's great 
 success, sent to congratulate him and to court his favour with a noble 
 present, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 It is in vain to contend with the Son of David.  <I>Kiss the Son,</I>
 therefore, <I>lest he be angry;</I> let the kings and judges of the 
 earth, and all inferior people too, be thus wise, thus instructed. The 
 presents we are to bring him are not <I>vessels of gold and silver,</I> 
 as here (those shall be welcomed to him who have no such presents to 
 bring), but our hearts and sincere affections, our whole selves, we 
 must present to him as living sacrifices.

 2. That what God blesses us with we must honour him with.  The presents
 of his friends, as well as the spoils of his enemies, <I>David 
 dedicated unto the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 that is, he laid them up towards the building and enriching of the
 temple. That is most truly and most comfortably our own which we have 
 consecrated unto the Lord, and which we use for his glory. Let our 
 <I>merchandise and our hire be holiness to the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+23:18">Isa. xxiii. 18</A>.

 3.  That those who take God along with them whithersoever they go may
 expect to prosper, and be preserved, whithersoever they go. It was said 
 before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 and here it is repeated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 that <I>the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.</I> Those are
 always under the eye of God that have God always in their eye. 

 4. God gives men power, not that they may look great with it, but that
 they may do good with it. When David reigned over all Israel he 
 <I>executed judgment and justice among all his people,</I> and so 
 answered the end of his elevation. He was not so intent on his 
 conquests abroad as to neglect the administration of justice at home.  
 Herein he served the purposes of the kingdom of providence, and of that 
 God who <I>sits in the throne judging right;</I> and he was an eminent 
 type of the Messiah, the <I>sceptre of whose kingdom is a right 
 sceptre.</I></P>
