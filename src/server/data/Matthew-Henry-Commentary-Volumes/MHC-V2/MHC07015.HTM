 Samson, when he courted an alliance with the Philistines, did but seek 
 an occasion against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+14:4"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 4</A>.

 Now here we have a further account of the occasions he took to weaken
 them, and to avenge, not his own, but Israel's quarrels, upon them.  
 Everything here is surprising; if any thing be thought incredible, 
 because impossible, it must be remembered that with God nothing is 
 impossible, and it was by the Spirit of the Lord coming upon him that 
 he was both directed to and strengthened for those unusual ways of 
 making war. 

 I. From the perfidiousness of his wife and her father, he took occasion
 to burn their corn,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. From the Philistines' barbarous cruelty to his wife and her father,
 he took occasion to smite them with a great slaughter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:6-8">ver.  6-8</A>.

 III.  From the treachery of his countrymen, who delivered him bound to
 the Philistines, he took occasion to kill 1000 of them with the 
 jaw-bone of an ass, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:9-17">ver. 9-17</A>.

 IV. From the distress he was then in for want of water, God took
 occasion to show him favour in a seasonable supply,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of
 wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he
 said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father
 would not suffer him to go in.
 &nbsp; 2 And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly
 hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: <I>is</I> not her
 younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of
 her.
 &nbsp; 3 And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more
 blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.
 &nbsp; 4 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took
 firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the
 midst between two tails.
 &nbsp; 5 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let <I>them</I> go into
 the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the
 shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards <I>and</I>
 olives.
 &nbsp; 6 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they
 answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had
 taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the
 Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
 &nbsp; 7 And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will
 I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
 &nbsp; 8 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and
 he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Samson's return to his wife, whom he had left in displeasure; not 
 hearing perhaps that she was given to another, when time had a little 
 cooled his resentments, he came back to her, <I>visited her with a 
 kid,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The value of the present was inconsiderable, but it was intended as a
 token of reconciliation, and perhaps was then so used, when those that 
 had been at variance were brought together again; he sent this, that he 
 might sup with her in her apartments, and she with him, on his 
 provision, and so they might be friends again. It was generously done 
 of Samson, though he was the party offended and the superior relation, 
 to whom therefore she was bound in duty to sue for peace and to make 
 the first motion of reconciliation. When differences happen between 
 near relations, let hose be ever reckoned the wisest and the best that 
 are most forward to forgive and forget injuries and most willing to 
 stoop and yield for peace' sake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The repulse he met with. Her father forbade him to come near her; 
 for truly he had married her to another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 He endeavours,

 1. To justify himself in this wrong: <I>I verily thought that thou
 hadst utterly hated her.</I> A very ill opinion he had of Samson, 
 measuring that Nazarite by the common temper of the Philistines; could 
 he think worse of him than to suspect that, because he was justly angry 
 with his wife, he utterly hated her, and, because he had seen cause to 
 return to his father's house for a while, therefore he had abandoned 
 her for ever? Yet this is all he had to say in excuse of this injury. 
 Thus he made the worst of jealousies to patronize the worst of 
 robberies. But it will never bear us out in doing ill to say, "We 
 thought others designed ill." 

 2. He endeavours to pacify Samson by offering him his younger daughter,
 whom, because the handsomer, he thought Samson might accept, in full 
 recompence for the wrong. See what confusions those did admit and bring 
 their families to that were not governed by the fear and law of God, 
 marrying a daughter this week to one and next week to another, giving a 
 man one daughter first and then another. Samson scorned his proposal; 
 he knew better things than <I>to take a wife to her sister,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+18:18">Lev. xviii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The revenge Samson took upon the Philistines for this abuse. Had 
 he designed herein only to plead his own cause he would have challenged 
 his rival, and would have chastised him and his father-in-law only. But 
 he looks upon himself as a public person, and the affront as done to 
 the whole nation of Israel, for probably they put this slight upon him 
 because he was of that nation, and pleased themselves with it, that 
 they had put such an abuse upon an Israelite; and therefore he resolves 
 to do the Philistines a displeasure, and does not doubt but this 
 treatment which he had met with among them would justify him in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines.</I> He had done
 what became him in offering to be reconciled to his wife, but, she 
 having rendered it impracticable, now they could not blame him if he 
 showed his just resentment. Note, When differences arise we ought to do 
 our duty in order to the ending of them, and then, whatever the ill 
 consequences of them may be, we shall be blameless. Now the way Samson 
 took to be revenged on them was by setting their corn-fields on fire, 
 which would be a great weakening and impoverishing to the country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 1. The method he took to do it was very strange. He sent 150 couple of
 foxes, tied tail to tail, into the corn-fields; every couple had a 
 stick of fire between their tails, with which, being terrified, they 
 ran into the corn for shelter, and so set fire to it; thus the fire 
 would break out in many places at the same time, and therefore could 
 not be conquered, especially if this was done, as it is probable it 
 was, in the night. He might have employed men to do it, but perhaps he 
 could not find Israelites enough that had courage to do it, and he 
 himself could do it but in one place at a time, which would not effect 
 his purpose. We never find Samson, in any of his exploits, making use 
 of any person whatsoever, either servant or soldier, therefore, in this 
 project, he chose to make use of foxes as his incendiaries. They had 
 injured Samson by their subtlety and malice, and now Samson returns the 
 injury by subtle foxes and mischievous fire-brands. By the meanness and 
 weakness of the animals he employed, he designed to put contempt upon 
 the enemies he fought against. This stratagem is often alluded to to 
 show how the church's adversaries, that are of different interests and 
 designs among themselves, that look and draw contrary ways in other 
 things, yet have often united in a fire-brand, some cursed project or 
 other, to waste the church of God, and particularly to kindle the fire 
 of division in it. 

 2. The mischief he hereby did to the Philistines was very great. It was
 in the time of wheat harvest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 so that the straw being dry it soon burnt the shocks of corn that were
 cut, and <I>the standing corn, and the vineyards and olives.</I> This 
 was a waste of the good creatures, but where other acts of hostility 
 are lawful destroying the forage is justly reckoned to be so: if he 
 might take away their lives, he might take away their livelihood. And 
 God was righteous in it: the <I>corn, and the wine, and the oil,</I> 
 which they had prepared for Dagon, to be a meat-offering to him, were 
 thus, in the season thereof, made a burnt-offering to God's 
 justice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The Philistines' outrage against Samson's treacherous wife and her 
 father. Understanding that they had provoked Samson to do this mischief 
 to the country, the rabble set upon them and burnt them with fire, 
 perhaps in their own house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Samson himself they durst not attack, and therefore, with more justice
 than perhaps they themselves designed in it, they wreak their vengeance 
 upon those who, they could not but own, had given him cause to be 
 angry. Instead of taking vengeance upon Samson, they took vengeance for 
 him, when he, out of respect to the relation he had stood in to them, 
 was not willing to do it for himself.  See his hand in it <I>to whom 
 vengeance belongs.</I> Those that deal treacherously shall be spoiled 
 and dealt treacherously with; and <I>the Lord is known by these 
 judgments which he executes,</I> especially when, as here, he makes use 
 of his people's enemies as instruments for revenging one upon another 
 his people's quarrels. When a barbarous Philistine sets fire to a 
 treacherous one, the <I>righteous</I> may <I>rejoice to see the 
 vengeance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:10,11">Ps. lviii. 10, 11</A>.

 Thus shall <I>the wrath of man praise God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:10">Ps. lxxvi. 10</A>.

 The Philistines had threatened Samson's wife, that, if she would not
 get the riddle out of him, they would <I>burn her and her father's 
 house with fire,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+14:15"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 15</A>.

 She, to save herself and oblige her countrymen, betrayed her husband;
 and what came of it? The very thing that she feared, and sought by sin 
 to avoid, came upon her; she and her father's house were burnt with 
 fire, and her countrymen, whom she sought to oblige by the wrong she 
 did to her husband, brought this evil upon her. The mischief we seek to 
 escape by any unlawful practices we often pull upon our own heads. 
 <I>He that will</I> thus <I>save his life shall lose it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The occasion Samson took hence to do them a yet greater mischief, 
 which touched their bone and their flesh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 "<I>Though you have done this</I> to them, and thereby shown what you
 would do to me if you could, yet that shall not deter me from being 
 further vexatious to you." Or, "Though you think, by doing this, you 
 have made me satisfaction for the affront I received among you, yet I 
 have Israel's cause to plead as a public person, and for the wrongs 
 done to them <I>I will be avenged on you,</I> and, if you will then 
 forbear your insults, I will cease, aiming at no more than the 
 deliverance of Israel." So he <I>smote them hip and thigh with a great 
 stroke,</I> so the word is. We suppose the wounds he gave them to have 
 been mortal, as wounds in the hip or thigh often prove, and therefore 
 translate it, <I>with a great slaughter.</I> Some think he only lamed 
 them, disabled them for service, as horses were houghed or ham-strung. 
 It seems to be a phrase used to express a desperate attack; he killed 
 them pell-mell, or routed them horse and foot. He smote them with his 
 hip upon thigh, that is, with the strength he had, not in his arms and 
 hands, but in his hips and thighs, for he kicked and spurned at them, 
 and so mortified them, <I>trod them in his anger,</I> and <I>trampled 
 them in his fury,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:3">Isa. lxiii. 3</A>.

 And, when he had done, he retired to a natural fortress in the top of
 the rock Etam, where he waited to see whether the Philistines would be 
 tamed by the correction he had given them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and
 spread themselves in Lehi.
 &nbsp; 10 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us?
 And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as
 he hath done to us.
 &nbsp; 11 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock
 Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines
 <I>are</I> rulers over us? what <I>is</I> this <I>that</I> thou hast done unto
 us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done
 unto them.
 &nbsp; 12 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that
 we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson
 said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me
 yourselves.
 &nbsp; 13 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee
 fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not
 kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him
 up from the rock.
 &nbsp; 14 <I>And</I> when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted
 against him: and the Spirit of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came mightily upon him,
 and the cords that <I>were</I> upon his arms became as flax that was
 burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.
 &nbsp; 15 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his
 hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.
 &nbsp; 16 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon
 heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.
 &nbsp; 17 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking,
 that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that
 place Ramath-lehi.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Samson violently pursued by the Philistine. They went up in a body, 
 a more formidable force than they had together when Samson smote them 
 hip and thigh; and they pitched in Judah, and spread themselves up and 
 down the country, to find out Samson, who they heard had come this way, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 When the men of Judah, who had tamely submitted to their yoke, pleaded
 that they had paid their tribute, and that none of their tribe had 
 given them any offence, they freely own they designed nothing in this 
 invasion but to seize Samson; they would fight <I>neither against small 
 nor great,</I> but only that judge of Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 to <I>do to him as he has done to us,</I> that is, to smite his hip and
 thigh, as he did ours--<I>an eye for an eye.</I> Here was an army sent 
 against one man, for indeed he was himself an army.  Thus a whole band 
 of men was sent to seize our Lord Jesus, that blessed Samson, though a 
 tenth part would have served now that his hour had come, and ten times 
 as many would have done nothing if he had not yielded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Samson basely betrayed and delivered up by the men of Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Of Judah were they? Degenerate branches of that valiant tribe! Utterly
 unworthy to carry in their standard <I>the lion of the tribe of 
 Judah.</I> Perhaps they were disaffected to Samson because he was not 
 of their tribe. Out of a foolish fondness for their forfeited 
 precedency, they would rather be oppressed by Philistines than rescued 
 by a Danite. Often has the church's deliverance been obstructed by such 
 jealousies and pretended points of honour. Rather it was because they 
 stood in awe of the Philistines, and were willing, at any rate, to get 
 them out of their country. If their spirits had not been perfectly 
 cowed and broken by their sins and troubles, and they had not been 
 given up to a spirit of slumber, they would have taken this fair 
 opportunity to shake off the Philistine's yoke. If they had had the 
 least spark of ingenuousness and courage remaining in them, having so 
 brave a man as Samson was to head them, they would now have made one 
 bold struggle for the recovery of their liberty; but no marvel if those 
 that had debased themselves to hell in the worship of their dung-hill 
 gods 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:9">Isa. lvii. 9</A>)

 thus debased themselves to the dust, in submission to their insulting
 oppressors.  Sin dispirits men, nay, it infatuates them, and hides from 
 their eyes the things that belong to their peace.  Probably Samson went 
 into the border of that country to offer his service, <I>supposing his 
 brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver 
 them,</I> as Moses did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:25">Acts vii. 25</A>.

 But they thrust him from them, and very disingenuously,

 1. Blamed him for what he had done against the Philistines, as if he
 had done them a great injury. Such ungrateful returns have those often 
 received that have done the best service imaginable to their country. 
 Thus our Lord Jesus did many good works, and for these they were ready 
 to stone him. 

 2.  They begged of him that he would suffer them to bind him, and
 deliver him up to the Philistines. Cowardly unthankful wretches! Fond 
 of their fetters and in love with servitude! Thus the Jews delivered up 
 our Saviour, under pretence of a fear lest the Romans should come and 
 take away their place and nation. With what a sordid servile spirit do 
 they argue, <I>Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us?</I> 
 And whose fault was that? They knew they had no right to rule over 
 them, nor would they have been sold into their hands if they had not 
 first <I>sold themselves to work wickedness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Samson tamely yielding to be bound by his countrymen, and 
 delivered into the hands of his enraged enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 Now easily could he have beaten them off, and kept the top of his rock
 against these 3000 men, and none of them all could, or durst, have laid 
 hands on him; but he patiently submitted,

 1. That he might give an example of great meekness, mixed with great
 strength and courage; as one that had rule over his own spirit, he knew 
 how to yield as well as how to conquer. 

 2. That, by being delivered up to the Philistine, he might have an
 opportunity of making a slaughter among them. 

 3. That he might be a type of Christ, who, when he had shown what he
 could do, in striking those down that came to seize him, yielded to be 
 bound and led as a <I>lamb to the slaughter.</I> Samson justified 
 himself in what he had done against the Philistines: "<I>As they did to 
 me, so I did to them;</I> it was a piece of necessary justice, and they 
 ought not to retaliate it upon me, for they began." He covenants with 
 the men of Judah that, if he put himself into their hands, they should 
 not fall upon him themselves, because then he should be tempted to fall 
 upon them, which he was very loth to do. This they promised him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and then he surrendered. The men of Judah, being his betrayers, were in
 effect his murderers; they would not kill him themselves, but they did 
 that which was worse, they delivered him into the hands of the 
 uncircumcised Philistines, who they knew would do worse than kill him, 
 would abuse and torment him to death. Perhaps they thought, as some 
 think Judas did when he betrayed Christ, that he would by his great 
 strength deliver himself out of their hands; but no thanks to them if 
 he had delivered himself, and, if they thought he would do so, they 
 might of themselves have thought this again, that he could and would 
 deliver them too if they would adhere to him and make him their head.  
 Justly is their misery prolonged who, to oblige their worst enemies, 
 thus abuse their best friend. Never were men so infatuated except those 
 who thus treated our blessed Saviour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Samson making his part good against the Philistines, even when he 
 was delivered into their hands, fast pinioned with two new cords. The 
 Philistines, when they had him among them, <I>shouted against him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 so triumphing in their success, and insulting over him. If God had not
 tied their hands faster than the men of Judah had tied his, they would 
 have shot at him (as their archers did at Saul) to dispatch him 
 immediately, rather than have shouted at him, and given him time to 
 help himself.  But their security and joy were a presage of their ruin.  
 When they shouted against him as a man run down, confident that all was 
 their own, then the <I>Spirit of the Lord came upon him,</I> came 
 mightily upon him, inspired him with more than ordinary strength and 
 resolution. Thus fired, 

 1. He presently got clear of his bonds. The two new cords, upon the
 first struggle he gave, broke, and were <I>melted</I> (as the original 
 word is) from off his hands, no doubt to the great amazement and terror 
 of those that shouted against him, whose shouts were hereby turned into 
 shrieks. Observe, When the <I>Spirit of the Lord came upon him, his 
 cords were loosed. Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is 
 liberty,</I> and those are free indeed who are thus freed. This 
 typified the resurrection of Christ by the power of the Spirit of 
 holiness. In it he loosed the bands of death, and its cords, the 
 grave-clothes, fell from his hands without being loosed, as Lazarus's 
 were, because it was impossible that the mighty Saviour should be 
 holden of them; and thus he triumphed over the powers of darkness that 
 shouted against him, as if they had him sure. 

 2. He made a great destruction among the Philistines, who all gathered
 about him to make sport with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 See how poorly he was armed: he had no better weapon than the jaw-bone
 of an ass, and yet what execution he did with it! he never laid it out 
 of his hand till he had with it laid 1000 Philistines dead upon the 
 spot; and thus that promise was more than accomplished.  <I>One of you 
 shall chase a thousand,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+23:10">Josh. xxiii. 10</A>.

 A jaw-bone was an inconvenient thing to grasp, and, one would think,
 might easily be wrested out of his hand, and a few such blows as he 
 gave with it might have crushed and broken it, and yet it held good to 
 the last. Had it been the jaw-bone of a lion, especially that which he 
 himself had slain, it might have helped to heighten his fancy and to 
 make him think himself the more formidable; but to take the bone of 
 that despicable animal was to do wonders by <I>the foolish things of 
 the world,</I> that the <I>excellency of the power might be of God and 
 not of man.</I> One of David's worthies slew 300 Philistines at once, 
 but it was <I>with a spear,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+11:11">1 Chron. xi. 11</A>.

 Another slew of them till his hand was weary and stuck to his sword, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:10">2 Sam. xxiii. 10</A>.

 But they all came short of Samson. What could be thought too hard, too
 much, for him to do, on whom the Spirit of the Lord came mightily! 
 <I>Through God we shall do valiantly.</I> It was strange the men of 
 Judah did not now come in to his aid: cowards can strike a falling 
 enemy. But he was to be a type of him that <I>trod the wine-press 
 alone.</I></P>

 V. Samson celebrating his own victory, since the men of Judah would not 
 do even that for him. He composed a short song, which he sang to 
 himself, for the daughters of Israel did not meet him, as afterwards 
 they did Saul, to sing, with more reason, <I>Samson hath slain his 
 thousands.</I> The burden of this song was, <I>With the jaw-bone of an 
 ass, heaps upon heaps, have I slain a thousand men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The same word in Hebrew (<I>chamor</I>) signifies both an <I>ass</I>
 and a <I>heap,</I> so that this is an elegant paronomasia, and 
 represents the Philistines falling as tamely as asses. He also gave a 
 name to the place, to perpetuate the Philistines' disgrace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 <I>Ramath-lehi,</I> the <I>lifting up of the jaw-bone.</I> Yet he did
 not vain-gloriously carry the bone about with him for a show, but threw 
 it away when he had done with it. So little were relics valued 
 then.</P>

 Here is, 

 I. The distress which Samson was in after this great performance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>He was sore athirst.</I> It was a natural effect of the great heat
 he had been in, and the great pains he had taken; his zeal consumed 
 him, ate him up, and made him forget himself, till, when he had time to 
 pause a little, he found himself reduced to the last extremity for want 
 of water and ready to faint. Perhaps there was a special hand of God in 
 it, as there was in the whole transaction; and God would hereby keep 
 him from being proud of his great strength and great achievements, and 
 let him know that he was but a man, and liable to the calamities that 
 are common to men. And Josephus says, It was designed to chastise him 
 for not making mention of God and his hand in his memorial of the 
 victory he had obtained, but taking all the praise to himself: <I>I 
 have slain a thousand men;</I> now that he is ready to die for thirst 
 he is under a sensible conviction that his own arm could not have saved 
 him, without God's right hand and arm. Samson had drunk largely of the 
 blood of the Philistines, but blood will never quench any man's thirst. 
 Providence so ordered it that there was no water near him, and he was 
 so fatigued that he could not go far to seek it; the men of Judah, one 
 would think, should have met him, now that he had come off a conqueror, 
 <I>with bread and wine,</I> as Melchizedek did Abram, to atone for the 
 injury they had done him; but so little notice did they take of their 
 deliverer that he was ready to perish for want of a draught of water. 
 Thus are the greatest slights often put upon those that do the greatest 
 services. Christ on the cross, said, <I>I thirst.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His prayer to God in this distress. Those that forget to attend God 
 with their praises may perhaps be compelled to attend him with their 
 prayers. Afflictions are often sent to bring unthankful people to God. 
 Two things he pleads with God in this prayer, 

 1. His having experienced the power and goodness of God in his late
 success: <I>Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy 
 servant.</I> He owns himself God's servant in what he had been doing: 
 "Lord, wilt thou not own a poor servant of thine, that has spent 
 himself in thy service?  <I>I am thine, save me.</I>" He calls his 
 victory a <I>deliverance,</I> a <I>great</I> deliverance; for, if God 
 had not helped him, he had not only not conquered the Philistines, but 
 had been swallowed up by them.  He owns it to come from God, and now 
 corrects his former error in assuming it too much to himself; and this 
 he pleads in his present strait. Note, Past experiences of God's power 
 and goodness are excellent pleas in prayer for further mercy.  "Lord, 
 thou hast delivered often, wilt thou not deliver still?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:10">2 Cor. i. 10</A>.

 Thou hast begun, wilt thou not finish? Thou hast done the greater, wilt
 thou not do the less?" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:13">Ps. lvi. 13</A>.

 2. His being now exposed to his enemies: "<I>Lest I fall into the hands
 of the uncircumcised,</I> and then they will triumph, will <I>tell it 
 in Gath, and in the streets of Ashkelon;</I> and will it not redound to 
 God's dishonour of his champion become so easy a prey to the 
 uncircumcised?" The best pleas are those taken from God's glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The seasonable relief God sent him. God heard his prayer, and sent 
 him water, either out of the bone or out of the earth through the bone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 That bone which he had made an instrument of God's service God, to
 recompense him, made an instrument of his supply. But I rather incline 
 to our marginal reading: <I>God clave a hollow place that was in 
 Lehi:</I> the place of this action was, from the jaw-bone, called 
 <I>Lehi;</I> even before the action we find it so called,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:9,14"><I>v.</I> 9, 14</A>.

 And there, in that field, or hill, or plain, or whatever it was, that
 was so called, God caused a fountain suddenly and seasonably to open 
 just by him, and water to spring up out of it in abundance, which 
 continued a well ever after. Of this fair water he drank, and his 
 spirits revived. We should be more thankful for the mercy of water did 
 we consider how ill we can spare it. And this instance of Samson's 
 relief should encourage us to trust in God, and seek to him, for, when 
 he pleases, he can <I>open rivers in high places.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:17,18">Isa. xli. 17, 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The memorial of this, in the name Samson gave to this upstart 
 fountain, <I>En-hakkore, the well of him that cried,</I> thereby keeping 
 in remembrance both his own distress, which occasioned him to cry, and 
 God's favour to him, in answer to his cry.  Many a spring of comfort 
 God opens to his people, which may fitly be called by this name; it is
 <I>the well of him that cried.</I> Samson had given a name to the place 
 which denoted him great and triumphant--<I>Ramath-lehi,</I> the
 <I>lifting up of the jaw-bone;</I> but here he gives it another name, 
 which denotes him needy and dependent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The continuance of Samson's government after these achievements, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+15:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 At length Israel submitted to him whom they had betrayed. Now it was
 past dispute that God was with him, so that henceforward they all owned 
 him and were directed by him as their judge. <I>The stone which the 
 builders refused became the head-stone.</I> It intimates the low 
 condition of Israel that the government was dated by <I>the days of the 
 Philistines;</I> yet it was a mercy to Israel that, though they were 
 oppressed by a foreign enemy, yet they had a judge that preserved order 
 and kept them from ruining one another. Twenty years his government 
 continued, according to the usages of the judges' administration; but 
 of the particulars we have no account, save of the beginning of his 
 government in this chapter and the end of it in the next.</P>
