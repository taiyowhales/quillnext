 This chapter gives us a further account of Gideon's victory over the 
 Midianites, with the residue of the story of his life and government. 
 
 I. Gideon prudently pacifies the offended Ephraimites,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. He bravely pursues the flying Midianites,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:4,10-12">ver. 4, 10-12</A>.

 III. He justly chastises the insolence of the men of Succoth and
 Penuel, who basely abused him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>),

 and were reckoned with for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:13-17">ver. 13-17</A>.

 IV. He honourably slays the two kings of Midian, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:18-21">ver.  18-21</A>.

 V. After all this he modestly declines the government of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:22,23">ver. 22, 23</A>.

 VI.  He foolishly gratified the superstitious humour of his people by
 setting up an ephod in his own city, which proved a great snare, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:24-27">ver. 24-27</A>.

 VII. He kept the country quiet for forty years, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:28">ver.  28</A>.

 VIII.  He died in honour, and left a numerous family behind him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:29-32">ver. 29-32</A>.

 IX. Both he and his God were soon forgotten by ungrateful Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:33-35">ver. 33-35</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us
 thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with
 the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.
 &nbsp; 2 And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of
 you? <I>Is</I> not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than
 the vintage of Abiezer?
 &nbsp; 3 God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian,
 Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you?
 Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 No sooner were the Midianites, the common enemy, subdued, than, through 
 the violence of some hot spirits, the children of Israel were ready to 
 quarrel among themselves; an unhappy spark was struck, which, if Gideon 
 had not with a great deal of wisdom and grace extinguished immediately, 
 might have broken out into a flame of fatal consequence. The 
 Ephraimites, when they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon as 
 general, instead of congratulating him upon his successes and 
 addressing him with thanks for his great services, as they ought to 
 have done, picked a quarrel with him and grew very hot upon it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their accusation was very peevish and unreasonable: <I>Why didst 
 thou not call us when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Ephraim was brother to Manasseh, Gideon's tribe, and had the 
 pre-eminence in Jacob's blessing and in Moses's, and therefore was very 
 jealous of Manasseh, lest that tribe should at any time eclipse the 
 honour of theirs. Hence we find Manasseh against Ephraim and Ephraim 
 against Manasseh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:21">Isa. ix. 21</A>.

 <I>A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city, and their
 contentions are as the bars of a castle,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:19">Prov. xviii. 19</A>.

 But how unjust was their quarrel with Gideon!  They were angry that he 
 did not send for them to begin the attack upon Midian, as well as to 
 follow the blow. Why were they not called to lead the van? The post of 
 honour, they thought, belonged to them. But, 

 1.  Gideon was called of God, and must act as he directed; he neither
 took the honour to himself nor did he himself dispose of honours, but 
 left it to God to do all. So that the Ephraimites, in this quarrel, 
 reflected upon the divine conduct; and what was Gideon that they 
 <I>murmured against him?</I> 

 2.  Why did not the Ephraimites offer themselves willingly to the 
 service?  They knew the enemy was in their country, and had heard of 
 the forces that were raising to oppose them, to which they ought to 
 have joined themselves, in zeal for the common cause, though they had 
 not a formal invitation. Those seek themselves more than God that stand 
 upon a point of honour to excuse themselves from doing real service to 
 God and their generation. In Deborah's time there was a root of 
 Ephraim,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:14"><I>ch.</I> v. 14</A>.

 Why did not this appear now? The case itself called them, they needed
 not wait for a call from Gideon. 

 3. Gideon had saved their credit in not calling them. If he had sent
 for them, no doubt may of them would have gone back with the 
 faint-hearted, or been dismissed with the lazy, slothful, and 
 intemperate; so that by not calling them he prevented the putting of 
 those slurs upon them. Cowards will seem valiant when the danger is 
 over, but those consult their reputation who try not their courage when 
 danger is near.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Gideon's answer was very calm and peaceable, and was intended not 
 so much to justify himself as to please and pacify them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 He answers them, 

 1. With a great deal of meekness and temper. He did not resent the 
 affront, nor answer anger with anger, but mildly reasoned the case with 
 them, and he won as true honour by this command which he had over his 
 own passion as by his victory over the Midianites. <I>He that is slow 
 to anger is better than the mighty.</I> 

 2. With a great deal of modesty and humility, magnifying their 
 performances above his own: <I>Is not the gleaning of the grapes of 
 Ephraim,</I> who picked up the stragglers of the enemy, and cut off 
 those of them that escaped, <I>better than the vintage of 
 Abiezer</I>--a greater honour to them, and better service to the 
 country, than the first attack Gideon made upon them?  The destruction 
 of the church's enemies is compared to a vintage,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:18">Rev. xiv. 18</A>.

 In this he owns their gleanings better than his gatherings.  The 
 improving of a victory is often more honourable, and of greater 
 consequence, than the winning of it; in this they had signalized 
 themselves, and their own courage and conduct, or, rather, God had 
 dignified them; for thought, to magnify their achievements, he is 
 willing to diminish his own performances, yet he will not take any 
 flowers from God's crown to adorn theirs with: "<I>God has delivered 
 into your hands the princes of Midian,</I> and a great slaughter has 
 been made of the enemy by your numerous hosts, and <I>what was I able 
 to do</I> with 300 men, <I>in comparison of you</I> and your brave 
 exploits?" Gideon stands here a very great example of self-denial, and 
 this instance shows us,

 (1.) That humility of deportment is the best way to remove envy. It is 
 true even right works are often envied, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:4">Eccl. iv. 4</A>.

 Yet they are not so apt to be so when those who do them appear not to
 be proud of them.  Those are malignant indeed who seek to cast down 
 from their excellency those that humble and abase themselves,

 (2.) It is likewise the surest method of ending strife, for <I>only by 
 pride comes contention,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+13:10">Prov. xiii. 10</A>.

 (3.) Humility is most amiable and admirable in the midst of great 
 attainments and advancements.  Gideon's conquests did greatly set off 
 his condescensions. 

 (4.) It is the proper act of humility to <I>esteem others better than 
 ourselves,</I> and <I>in honour to prefer one another.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now what was the issue of this controversy? The Ephraimites had 
 <I>chidden with him sharply</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 forgetting the respect due to their general and one whom God had 
 honoured, and giving vent to their passion in a very indecent liberty 
 of speech, a certain sign of a weak and indefensible cause. Reason runs 
 low when the chiding flies high.  But Gideon's <I>soft answer turned 
 away their wrath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:1">Prov. xv. 1</A>.

 <I>Their anger was abated towards him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It is intimated that they retained some resentment, but he prudently 
 overlooked it and let it cool by degrees. Very great and good men must 
 expect to have their patience tried by the unkindnesses and follies 
 even of those they serve and must not think it strange.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 And Gideon came to Jordan, <I>and</I> passed over, he, and the
 three hundred men that <I>were</I> with him, faint, yet pursuing
 <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 5 And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves
 of bread unto the people that follow me; for they <I>be</I> faint, and
 I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.
 &nbsp; 6 And the princes of Succoth said, <I>Are</I> the hands of Zebah and
 Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine
 army?
 &nbsp; 7 And Gideon said, Therefore when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath delivered Zebah
 and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the
 thorns of the wilderness and with briers.
 &nbsp; 8 And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them
 likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of
 Succoth had answered <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 9 And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come
 again in peace, I will break down this tower.
 &nbsp; 10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna <I>were</I> in Karkor, and their hosts
 with them, about fifteen thousand <I>men,</I> all that were left of
 all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an
 hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.
 &nbsp; 11 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on
 the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host
 was secure.
 &nbsp; 12 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and
 took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited
 all the host.
 &nbsp; 13 And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the
 sun <I>was up,</I>
 &nbsp; 14 And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired
 of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the
 elders thereof, <I>even</I> threescore and seventeen men.
 &nbsp; 15 And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah
 and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, <I>Are</I> the
 hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should
 give bread unto thy men <I>that are</I> weary?
 &nbsp; 16 And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the
 wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of
 Succoth.
 &nbsp; 17 And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of
 the city.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Gideon, as a valiant general, pursuing the remaining Midianites, and 
 bravely following his blow. A very great slaughter was made of the 
 enemy at first: 120,000 <I>men that drew the sword,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Such a terrible execution did they make among themselves, and so easy a 
 prey were they to Israel. But, it seems, the two kings of Midian, being 
 better provided than the rest for an escape, with 15,000 men got over 
 Jordan before the passes could be secured by the Ephraimites, and made 
 towards their own country. Gideon thinks he does not fully execute his 
 commission to save Israel if he let them escape. He is not content to 
 chase them out of the country, but he will <I>chase them out of the 
 world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:18">Job xviii. 18</A>.

 This resolution is here pushed on with great firmness, and crowned with
 great success.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His firmness was very exemplary. He effected his purpose under the 
 greatest disadvantages and discouragements that could be. 

 (1.) He took none with him but his 300 men, who now laid aside their 
 trumpets and torches, and betook themselves to their swords and spears. 
 God had said, <I>By these 300 men will I save you</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:7"><I>ch.</I> vii. 7</A>);

 and, confiding in that promise, Gideon kept to them only, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He expected more from 300 men, supported by a particular promise, than 
 from so many thousands supported only by their own valour.

 (2.) They were <I>faint, and yet pursuing,</I> much fatigued with what 
 they had done, and yet eager to do more against the enemies of their 
 country.  Our spiritual warfare must thus be prosecuted with what 
 strength we have, though we have but little; it is many a time the true 
 Christina's case, fainting and yet pursuing. 

 (3.) Though he met with discouragement from those of his own people, 
 was jeered for what he was doing, as going about what he could never 
 accomplish, yet he went on with it. If those that should be our helpers 
 in the way of our duty prove hindrances to us, let not this drive us 
 off from it. Those know not how to value God's acceptance that know not 
 how to despise the reproaches and contempts of men. 

 (4.) He made a very long march by <I>the way of those that dwelt in 
 tents</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 either because he hoped to find them kinder to him than the men of 
 Succoth and Penuel, that dwelt in walled towns (sometimes there is more
 generosity and charity found in country tents than in city palaces), or 
 because that was a road in which he would be least expected, and 
 therefore that way it would be the greater surprise to them. It is 
 evident he spared no pains to complete his victory. Now he found it an 
 advantage to have his 300 men such as could bear hunger, and thirst, 
 and toil. It should seem, he set upon the enemy by night, as he had 
 done before, for <I>the host was secure.</I> The security of sinners 
 often proves their ruin, and dangers are most fatal when least 
 feared.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His success was very encouraging to resolution and industry in a 
 good cause. He routed the army 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and took the two kings prisoners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Note, The fear of the wicked shall come upon him.  Those that think to 
 run <I>from the sword of the Lord and of Gideon</I> do but run 
 <I>upon</I> it. If he <I>flee from the iron weapon,</I> yet <I>the bow 
 of steel shall strike him through;</I> for <I>evil pursueth 
 sinners.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is Gideon, as a righteous judge, chastising the insolence of 
 the disaffected Israelites, the men of Succoth and the men of Penuel, 
 both in the tribe of Gad, on the other side Jordan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their crime was great. Gideon, with a handful of feeble folk was 
 pursuing the common enemy, to complete the deliverance of Israel. His 
 way led him through the city of Succoth first and afterwards of Penuel. 
 He expected not that the magistrates should meet him in their 
 formalities, congratulate him upon his victory, present him with the 
 keys of their city, and give him a treat, much less that they should 
 send forces in to his assistance, though he was entitled to all this; 
 but he only begs some necessary food for his soldiers that were ready 
 to faint for want, and he does it very humbly and importunately: 
 <I>Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow 
 me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The request would have been reasonable if they had been but poor 
 travellers in distress; but considering that they were soldiers, 
 <I>called, and chose, and faithful</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:14">Rev. xvii. 14</A>),

 men whom God had greatly honoured and to whom Israel was highly 
 obliged, who had done great service to their country and were now doing 
 more,--that they were conquerors, and had power to put them under 
 contribution,--and that they were fighting God's battles and 
 Israel's,--nothing could be more just than that their brethren should 
 furnish them with the best provisions their city afforded. But the 
 princes of Succoth neither <I>feared God nor regarded man.</I> For, 
 
 (1.) In contempt of God, they refused to answer the just demands of him 
 whom God had raised up to save them, affronted him, bantered him, 
 despised the success he had already been honoured with, despaired of 
 the success of his present undertaking, did what they could to 
 discourage him in prosecuting the war, and were very willing to believe 
 that the remaining forces of Midian, which they had now seen march 
 through their country, would be too hard for him: <I>Are the hands of 
 Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand?</I> "No, nor ever will be," so they 
 conclude, judging by the disproportion of numbers. 

 (2.) The bowels of their compassion were shut up against their 
 brethren; they were as destitute of love as they were of faith, would 
 not give morsels of bread (so some read it) to those that were ready to 
 perish. Were these princes? were these Israelites?  unworthy either 
 title, base and degenerate men! Surely they were worshippers of Baal, 
 or in the interests of Midian. The men of Penuel gave the same answer 
 to the same request, defying <I>the sword of the Lord and of 
 Gideon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The warning he gave them of the punishment of their crime was very 
 fair. 

 (1.) He did not punish it immediately, because he would not lose so 
 much time from the pursuit of the enemy that were flying from him, 
 because he would not seem to do it in a neat of passion, and because he 
 would do it more to their shame and confusion when he had completed his 
 undertaking, which they thought impracticable. But, 

 (2.) He told them how he would punish it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:7,9"><I>v.</I> 7, 9</A>),

 to show the confidence he had of success in the strength of God, and 
 that, if they had the least grain of grace and consideration left, they 
 might upon second thoughts repent of their folly, humble themselves, 
 and contrive how to atone for it, by sending after him succours and 
 supplies, which if they had done, no doubt, Gideon would have pardoned 
 them. God gives notice of danger, and space to repent, that sinners may 
 <I>flee from the wrath to come.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The warning being slighted, the punishment, though very severe, was 
 really very just.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The princes of Succoth were first made examples. Gideon got 
 intelligence of their number, seventy-seven men, their names, and 
 places of abode, which were described in writing to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 And, to their great surprise, when they thought he had scarcely 
 overtaken the Midianites, he returned a conqueror. His 300 men were now 
 the ministers of his justice; they secured all these princes, and 
 brought them before Gideon, who showed them his royal captives in 
 chains. "These are the men you thought me an unequal match for, and 
 would give me no assistance in the pursuit of," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 And he punished them with thorns and briers, but, it should seem, not 
 unto death. With these, 

 [1.] He tormented their bodies, either by scourging or by rolling them 
 in the thorns and briers; some way or other he <I>tore their flesh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Those shall have judgment without mercy that have shown no mercy.  
 Perhaps he observed them to be soft and delicate men, who despised him 
 and his company for their roughness and hardiness, and therefore Gideon 
 thus mortified them for their effeminacy. 

 [2.] He instructed their minds: With these <I>he taught the men of 
 Succoth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The correction he gave them was intended, not for destruction, but 
 wholesome discipline, to make them wiser and better for the future.  
 <I>He made them know</I> (so the word is), made them know themselves 
 and their folly, God and their duty, made them know who Gideon was, 
 since they would not know by the success wherewith God had crowned him.  
 Note, Many are taught with the briers and thorns of affliction that 
 would not learn otherwise. God gives <I>wisdom</I> by <I>the rod and 
 reproof, chastens</I> and <I>teaches,</I> and by correction <I>opens 
 the ear to discipline.</I> Our blessed Saviour, though he was a Son, 
 yet <I>learnt obedience by the things which he suffered,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:8">Heb. v. 8</A>.
 
 Let every <I>pricking brier,</I> and <I>grieving thorn,</I> especially
 when it becomes a <I>thorn in the flesh,</I> be thus interpreted, thus 
 improved. "By this God designs to teach me; what good lesson shall I 
 learn?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The doom of the men of Penuel comes next, and it should seem he 
 used them more severely than the other, for good reason, no doubt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:17"><I>v.</I>  17</A>.

 [1.] He <I>beat down their tower,</I> of which they gloried, in which 
 they trusted, perhaps scornfully advising Gideon and his men rather to 
 secure themselves in that than to pursue the Midianites. What men make 
 their pride is justly by its ruin made their shame.

 <I>were they</I> whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou
 <I>art,</I> so <I>were</I> they; each one resembled the children of a king.

 &nbsp; 20 And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, <I>and</I> slay them.
 But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he <I>was</I>
 yet a youth.
 &nbsp; 21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us:
 for as the man <I>is, so is</I> his strength. And Gideon arose, and
 slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that <I>were</I>
 on their camels' necks.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Judgment began <I>at the house of God,</I> in the just correction of 
 the men of Succoth and Penuel, who were Israelites, but it did not end 
 there. The kings of Midian, when they had served to demonstrate 
 Gideon's victories, and grace his triumphs, must now be reckoned with. 
 
 1. They are indicted for the murder of Gideon's brethren some time ago
 at Mount Tabor. When the children of Israel, for fear of the 
 Midianites, made themselves <I>dens in the mountains</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:2"><I>ch.</I> vi. 2</A>),
 
 those young men, it is likely, took shelter in that mountain, where
 they were found by these two kings, and most basely and barbarously 
 slain in cold blood. When he asks them <I>what manner of men they 
 were</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 it is not because he was uncertain of the thing, or wanted proof of it; 
 he was not so little concerned for his brethren's blood as not to 
 enquire it out before now, nor were these proud tyrants solicitous to 
 conceal it. But he puts that question to them that by their 
 acknowledgment of the more than ordinary comeliness of the persons they 
 slew their crime might appear the more heinous, and consequently their 
 punishment the more righteous. They could not but own that, though they 
 were found in a mean and abject condition, yet they had an unusual 
 greatness and majesty in their countenances, not unlike Gideon himself 
 at this time: they <I>resembled the children of a king,</I> born for 
 something great. 

 2. Being found guilty of this murder by their own confession, Gideon,
 though he might have put them to death as Israel's judge for the 
 injuries done to that people in general, as Oreb and Zeeb

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:25"><I>ch.</I> vii. 25</A>),

 yet chooses rather to put on the character of an <I>avenger of
 blood,</I> as next of kin to the persons slain: <I>They were my 
 brethren,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Their other crimes might have been forgiven, at least Gideon would not 
 have slain them himself, let them have answered it to the people; but 
 <I>the voice of his brethren's blood cries,</I> cries <I>to him,</I> 
 now it is in the power of his hand to avenge it, and therefore there is 
 no remedy--by him must <I>their blood be shed,</I> though they were 
 kings. Little did they think to hear of this so long after; but murder 
 seldom goes unpunished even in this life. 

 3.  The execution is done by Gideon himself with his own hand, because
 he was the <I>avenger of blood;</I> he bade his son slay them, for he 
 was a near relation to the persons murdered, and fittest to be his 
 father's substitute and representative, and he would thus train him up 
 to the acts of justice and boldness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 But,

 (1.) The young man himself desired to be excused; he feared, though 
 they were bound and could make no resistance, <I>because he was yet a 
 youth,</I> and not used to such work: courage does not always run in 
 the blood. 

 (2.) The prisoners themselves desired that Gideon would excuse it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 begged that, if they must die, they might die <I>by his own hand,</I> 
 which would be somewhat more honourable to them, and more easy; for by 
 his great strength they would sooner be dispatched and rid out of their 
 pain.  <I>As is the man, so is his strength.</I> Either they mean it of 
 themselves (they were men of such strength as called for a better hand 
 than that young man's to overpower quickly) or of Gideon, "Thou art at 
 thy full strength; he has not yet come to it; therefore be thou the 
 executioner." From those that are grown up to maturity, it is expected 
 that what they do in any service be done with so much the more 
 strength. Gideon dispatched them quickly, and seized the <I>ornaments 
 that were on their camels' necks, ornaments like the moon,</I> so it is 
 in the margin, either badges of their royalty or perhaps of their 
 idolatry, for Ashteroth was represented by the moon, as Baal by the 
 sun. With there he took all their other ornaments, as appears 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>,
 
 where we find that he did not put them to so good a use as one would 
 have wished. The destruction of these two kings, and that of the two 
 princes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:25"><I>ch.</I> vii. 25</A>)

 is long afterwards pleaded as a precedent in prayer for the ruin of
 others of the church's enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:11">Ps. lxxxiii. 11</A>,

 <I>Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and all their princes as Zebah
 and Zalmunna,</I> let them all be but off in like manner.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us,
 both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast
 delivered us from the hand of Midian.
 &nbsp; 23 And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither
 shall my son rule over you: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall rule over you.
 &nbsp; 24 And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you,
 that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For
 they had golden earrings, because they <I>were</I> Ishmaelites.)
 &nbsp; 25 And they answered, We will willingly give <I>them.</I> And they
 spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of
 his prey.
 &nbsp; 26 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was
 a thousand and seven hundred <I>shekels</I> of gold; beside ornaments,
 and collars, and purple raiment that <I>was</I> on the kings of
 Midian, and beside the chains that <I>were</I> about their camels'
 necks.
 &nbsp; 27 And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city,
 <I>even</I> in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it:
 which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.
 &nbsp; 28 Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so
 that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in
 quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Gideon's laudable modesty, after his great victory, in refusing the 
 government which the people offered him. 

 1. It was honest in them to offer it: <I>Rule thou over us, for thou
 hast delivered us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 They thought it very reasonable that he who had gone through the toils 
 and perils of their deliverance should enjoy the honour and power of 
 commanding them ever afterwards, and very desirable that he who in this 
 great and critical juncture had had such manifest tokens of God's 
 presence with him should ever afterwards preside in their affairs. Let 
 us apply it to the Lord Jesus: he hath delivered us out of the hands of 
 our enemies, our spiritual enemies, the worst and most dangerous, and 
 therefore it is fit he should rule over us; for how can we be better 
 ruled than by one that appears to have so great an interest in heaven 
 and so great a kindness for this earth? We are delivered that we may 
 <I>serve him without fear,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:74,75">Luke i. 74, 75</A>.

 2. It was honourable in him to refuse it: <I>I will not rule over
 you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 What he did was with a design to serve them, not to rule them--to make 
 them safe, easy, and happy, not to make himself great or honourable. 
 And, as he was not ambitious of grandeur himself, so he did not covet 
 to entail it upon his family: "<I>My son shall not rule over you,</I> 
 either while I live or when I am gone, <I>but the Lord shall</I> still 
 <I>rule over you,</I> and constitute your judges by the special 
 designation of his own Spirit, as he has done." This intimates,

 (1.) His modesty, and the mean opinion he had of himself and his own 
 merits. He thought the honour of doing good was recompence enough for 
 all his services, which needed not to be rewarded with the honour of 
 bearing sway. <I>He that is greatest, let him be your minister.</I> 
 
 (2.) His piety, and the great opinion he had of God's government. 
 Perhaps he discerned in the people a dislike of the theocracy, or 
 divine government, a desire of a king like the nations, and thought 
 they availed themselves of his merits as a colourable pretence to move 
 for this change of government. But Gideon would by no means admit it. 
 No good man can be pleased with any honour done to himself which ought 
 to be peculiar to God. <I>Were you baptized in the name of Paul?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:13">1 Cor. i. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Gideon's irregular zeal to perpetuate the remembrance of this 
 victory by an ephod made of the choicest of the spoils. 

 1. He asked the men of Israel to give him the ear-rings of their prey;
 for such ornaments they stripped the slain of in abundance. These he 
 demanded, either because they were the finest gold, and therefore 
 fittest for a religious use, or because they had had as ear-rings some 
 superstitious signification, which he thought too well of. Aaron called 
 for the ear-rings to make the golden calf of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:2">Exod. xxxii. 2</A>.

 These Gideon begged 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 And he had reason enough to think that those who offered him a crown, 
 when he declined it, would not deny him their ear-rings, when he begged 
 them, nor did they, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 2. He himself added the spoil he took from the kings of Midian, which, 
 it should seem, had fallen to his share, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:26"><I>v.</I>  26</A>.

 The generals had that part of the prey which was most splendid, the 
 <I>prey of divers colours,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:30"><I>ch.</I> v. 30</A>.

 3. Of this he made an ephod, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 It was plausible enough, and might be well intended to preserve a 
 memorial of so divine a victory in the judge's own city. But it was a 
 very unadvised thing to make that memorial to be an ephod, a sacred 
 garment. I would gladly put the best construction that can be upon the 
 actions of good men, and such a one we are sure Gideon was. But we have 
 reason to suspect that this ephod had, as usual, a teraphim annexed to 
 it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:4">Hos. iii. 4</A>),

 and that, having an altar already built by divine appointment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:26"><I>ch.</I> vi. 26</A>),

 which he erroneously imagined he might still use for sacrifice, he
 intended this for an oracle, to be consulted in doubtful cases. So the 
 learned Dr. Spencer supposes. Each tribe having now very much its 
 government within itself, they were too apt to covet their religion 
 among themselves. We read very little of Shiloh, and the ark there, in 
 all the story of the Judges. Sometimes by divine dispensation, and much 
 oftener by the transgression of men, that law which obliged them to 
 worship only at that one altar seems not to have been so religiously 
 observed as one would have expected, any more than afterwards, when in 
 the reigns even of very good kings <I>the high places were not taken 
 away,</I> from which we may infer that that law had a further reach as 
 a type of Christ, by whose mediation alone all our services are 
 accepted. Gideon therefore, through ignorance or inconsideration, 
 sinned in making this ephod, though he had a good intention in it. 
 Shiloh, it is true, was not far off, but it was in Ephraim, and that 
 tribe had lately disobliged him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 which made him perhaps not care to go so often among them as his 
 occasions would lead him to consult the oracle, and therefore he would 
 have one nearer home. However this might be honestly intended, and at 
 first did little hurt, yet in process of time, 

 (1.) <I>Israel went a whoring after it,</I> that is, they deserted 
 God's altar and priesthood, being fond of change, and prone to 
 idolatry, and having some excuse for paying respect to this ephod, 
 because so good a man as Gideon had set it up, and by degrees their 
 respect to it grew more and more superstitious. Note, Many are led into 
 false ways by one false step of a good man. The beginning of sin, 
 particularly of idolatry and will-worship, <I>is as the letting forth 
 of water,</I> so it has been found in the fatal corruptions of the 
 church of Rome; therefore <I>leave it off before it be meddled 
 with.</I> 

 (2.) It became a snare to Gideon himself, abating his zeal for the 
 house of God in his old age, and much more to his house, who were drawn 
 by it into sin, and it proved the ruin of the family.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Gideon's happy agency for the repose of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 The Midianites that had been so vexatious gave them no more 
 disturbance.  Gideon, though he would not assume the honour and power 
 of a king, governed as a judge, and did all the good offices he could 
 for his people; so that <I>the country was in quietness forty 
 years.</I> Hitherto the times of Israel had been reckoned by forties. 
 Othniel judged forty years, Ehud eighty--just two forties, Barak forty, 
 and now Gideon forty, providence so ordering it to bring in mind the 
 forty years of their wandering in the wilderness. <I>Forty years long 
 was I grieved with this generation.</I> And see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:6">Ezek. iv. 6</A>.

 After these, Eli ruled forty years 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:18">1 Sam. iv. 18</A>),

 Samuel and Saul forty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:21">Acts xiii. 21</A>),

 David forty, and Solomon forty.  Forty years is about an age.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>29 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own
 house.
 &nbsp; 30 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten:
 for he had many wives.
 &nbsp; 31 And his concubine that <I>was</I> in Shechem, she also bare him a
 son, whose name he called Abimelech.
 &nbsp; 32 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was
 buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the
 Abiezrites.
 &nbsp; 33 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the
 children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim,
 and made Baal-berith their god.
 &nbsp; 34 And the children of Israel remembered not the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their
 God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies
 on every side:
 &nbsp; 35 Neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,
 <I>namely,</I> Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had
 showed unto Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the conclusion of the story of Gideon. 

 1. He lived privately,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 He was not puffed up with his great honours, did not covet a palace or 
 castle to dwell in, but retired to the house he had lived in before his 
 elevation. Thus that brave Roman Who was called from the plough upon a 
 sudden occasion to command the army when the action was over returned 
 to his plough again. 

 2. His family was multiplied. He had many wives (therein he
 transgressed the law); by them he had seventy sons

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 but by a concubine he had one whom he named <I>Abimelech</I> (which
 signifies, <I>my father a king</I>), that proved the ruin of his
 family, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 3. He died in honour, in a good old age, when he had lived as long as 
 he was capable of serving God and his country; and who would desire to 
 live any longer? And he was <I>buried in the sepulchre of his 
 fathers.</I> 

 4. After his death the people corrupted themselves, and went all to
 naught. As soon as ever Gideon was dead, who had kept them close to the 
 worship of the God of Israel, they found themselves under no restraint, 
 and then they <I>went a whoring after Baalim,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 They went a whoring first after another ephod

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 for which irregularity Gideon had himself given them too much occasion, 
 and now they went a whoring after another god. False worships made way 
 for false deities. They now chose a new god

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:8"><I>ch.</I> v. 8</A>),

 a god of a new name, <I>Baal-berith</I> (a goddess, say some); Berith,
 some think, was Berytus, the place where the Phoenicians worshipped 
 this idol. The name signifies <I>the Lord of a covenant.</I> Perhaps he 
 was so called because his worshippers joined themselves by covenant to 
 him, in imitation of Israel's covenanting with God; for the devil is 
 God's ape. In this revolt of Israel to idolatry they showed, 

 (1.) Great ingratitude to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>They remembered not the Lord,</I> not only who had delivered them 
 into the hands of their enemies, to punish them for their idolatry, but 
 who had also <I>delivered them out of the hands of their enemies,</I> 
 to invite them back again into his service; both the judgments and the 
 mercies were forgotten, and the impressions of them lost. 

 (2.) Great ingratitude to Gideon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 A great deal of <I>goodness he had shown unto Israel,</I> as a father 
 to his country, for which they ought to have been kind to his family 
 when he was gone, for that is one way by which we ought to show 
 ourselves grateful to our friends and benefactors, and may be returning 
 their kindnesses when they are in their graves. But Israel showed not 
 this kindness to Gideon's family, as we shall find in the next chapter. 
 No wonder if those who forget their God forget their friends.</P>
