 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Several things in this chapter itself are very instructive and of great 
 use; but the design of recording the story of it is to show how way was 
 made for Esther to the crown, in order to her being instrumental to 
 defeat Haman's plot, and this long before the plot was laid, that we 
 may observe and admire the foresight and vast reaches of Providence. 
 "Known unto God are all his works" before-hand. Ahasuerus the king, 

 I.  In his height feasts all his great men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. In his heat he divorces his queen, because she would not come to
 him when he sent for her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:10-22">ver. 10-22</A>.

 This shows how God serves his own purposes even by the sins and follies
 of men, which he would not permit if he know not how to bring good out 
 of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this <I>is</I>
 Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, <I>over</I> an
 hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)
 &nbsp; 2  <I>That</I> in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the
 throne of his kingdom, which <I>was</I> in Shushan the palace,
 &nbsp; 3  In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his
 princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the
 nobles and princes of the provinces, <I>being</I> before him:
 &nbsp; 4  When he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the
 honour of his excellent majesty many days, <I>even</I> a hundred and
 fourscore days.
 &nbsp; 5  And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto
 all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto
 great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the
 king's palace;
 &nbsp; 6  <I>Where were</I> white, green, and blue, <I>hangings,</I> fastened
 with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars
 of marble: the beds <I>were of</I> gold and silver, upon a pavement of
 red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.
 &nbsp; 7  And they gave <I>them</I> drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels
 being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance,
 according to the state of the king.
 &nbsp; 8  And the drinking <I>was</I> according to the law; none did compel:
 for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house,
 that they should do according to every man's pleasure.
 &nbsp; 9  Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women <I>in</I> the
 royal house which <I>belonged</I> to king Ahasuerus.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Which of the kings of Persia this Ahasuerus was the learned are not 
 agreed. Mordecai is said to have been one of those that were 
 <I>carried</I> captive from <I>Jerusalem</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:5,6"><I>ch.</I> ii. 5, 6</A>),

 whence it should seem that this Ahasuerus was one of the first kings of
 that empire. Dr. Lightfoot thinks that he was that Artaxerxes who 
 hindered the building of the temple, who is called also 
 <I>Ahasuerus</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:6,7">Ezra iv. 6, 7</A>),

 after his great-grandfather of the Medes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:1">Dan. ix. 1</A>.

 We have here an account,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the vast extent of his dominion. In the time of Darius and Cyrus 
 there were but 120 princes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:1">
 Dan. vi. 1</A>);

 now there were 127, <I>from India to Ethiopia,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It had become an over-grown kingdom, which in time would sink with its
 own weight, and, as usual, would lose its provinces as fast as it got 
 them. If such vast power be put into a bad hand, it is able to do so 
 much the more mischief; but, if into a good hand, it is able to do so 
 much the more good. Christ's kingdom is, or shall be, far larger than 
 this, when the kingdoms of the world shall all become his; and it shall 
 be everlasting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the great pomp and magnificence of his court. When he found 
 himself fixed in his throne, the pride of his heart rising with the 
 grandeur of his kingdom, he made a most extravagant feast, wherein he 
 put himself to vast expense and trouble only <I>to show the riches of 
 his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 This was vain glory, an affection of pomp to no purpose at all; for
 none questioned the riches of his kingdom, nor offered to vie with him 
 for honour. If he had shown the riches of his kingdom and the honour of 
 his majesty, as some of his successors did, in contributing largely 
 towards the building of the temple and the maintaining of the temple 
 service 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:8,7:22">Ezra vi. 8, vii. 22</A>),

 it would have turned to a much better account. Two feasts Ahasuerus
 made:--

 1. One for his nobles and princes, which lasted <I>a hundred and eighty
 days,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 Not that he feasted the same persons every day for all that time, but
 perhaps the nobles and princes of one province one day, of another 
 province another day, while thus he and his constant attendants fared 
 sumptuously every day. The Chaldee paraphrast (who is very bold in his 
 additions to the story of this book) says that there had been a 
 rebellion among his subjects and that this feast was kept for joy of 
 the quashing of it.

 2.  Another was made for <I>all the people, both great and small,</I>
 which lasted <I>seven days,</I> some one day and some another; and, 
 because no house would hold them, they were entertained <I>in the court 
 of the garden,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The hangings with which the several apartments were divided or the
 tents which were there pitched for the company, were very fine and 
 rich; so were the beds or benches on which they sat, and the pavement 
 under their feet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Better is a dinner of herbs with quietness, and the enjoyment of one's
 self and a friend, than this banquet of wine with all the noise and 
 tumult that must needs attend it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Of the good order which in some respects was kept there 
 notwithstanding. We do not find this like Belshazzar's feast, in which 
 dunghill-gods were praised and the vessels of the sanctuary profaned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:3,4">Dan. v. 3, 4</A>.

 Yet the Chaldee paraphrase says that the vessels of the sanctuary were
 used in this feast, to the great grief of the pious Jews. It was not 
 like Herod's feast, which reserved a prophet's head for the last dish. 
 Two things which are laudable we may gather from the account here given 
 of this feast:--

 1. That there was no forcing of healths, nor urging of them: <I>The
 drinking was according to the law,</I> probably some law lately made; 
 <I>none did compel,</I> no, not by continual proposing of it (as 
 Josephus explains it); they did not send the glass about, but every man 
 drank as he pleased

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 so that if there were any that drank to excess it was their own fault,
 a fault which few would commit when the king's order put an honour upon 
 sobriety. This caution of a heathen prince, even when he would show his 
 generosity, may shame many who are called Christians, who think they do 
 not sufficiently show their good housekeeping, nor bid their friends 
 welcome, unless they make them drunk, and, under pretence of sending 
 the health round, send the sin round, and death with it. There is a woe 
 to those that do so; let them read it and tremble, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:15,16">Hab. ii. 15, 16</A>.

 It is robbing men of their reason, their richest jewel, and making them
 fools, the greatest wrong that can be.

 2. That there was no mixed dancing; for the gentlemen and ladies were
 entertained asunder, not as in the feast of Belshazzar, whose wives and 
 concubines drank with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:2">Dan. v. 2</A>),

 or that of Herod, whose daughter <I>danced before him.</I> Vashti
 feasted the women in her own apartment; not openly in the court of the 
 garden, but <I>in the royal house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Thus, while the king showed the honour of his majesty, she and her
 ladies showed the honour of their modesty, which is truly the majesty 
 of the fair sex.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry
 with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and
 Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served
 in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
 &nbsp; 11  To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown
 royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty: for she
 <I>was</I> fair to look on.
 &nbsp; 12  But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's
 commandment by <I>his</I> chamberlains: therefore was the king very
 wroth, and his anger burned in him.
 &nbsp; 13  Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times,
 (for so <I>was</I> the king's manner toward all that knew law and
 judgment:
 &nbsp; 14  And the next unto him <I>was</I> Carshena, Shethar, Admatha,
 Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, <I>and</I> Memucan, the seven princes of
 Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, <I>and</I> which sat the
 first in the kingdom;)
 &nbsp; 15  What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law,
 because she hath not performed the commandment of the king
 Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?
 &nbsp; 16  And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti
 the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all
 the princes, and to all the people that <I>are</I> in all the
 provinces of the king Ahasuerus.
 &nbsp; 17  For <I>this</I> deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all
 women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes,
 when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti
 the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.
 &nbsp; 18  <I>Likewise</I> shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day
 unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the
 queen. Thus <I>shall there arise</I> too much contempt and wrath.
 &nbsp; 19  If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from
 him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the
 Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before
 king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto
 another that is better than she.
 &nbsp; 20  And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be
 published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the
 wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and
 small.
 &nbsp; 21  And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the
 king did according to the word of Memucan:
 &nbsp; 22  For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into
 every province according to the writing thereof, and to every
 people after their language, that every man should bear rule in
 his own house, and that <I>it</I> should be published according to the
 language of every people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a damp to all the mirth of Ahasuerus's feast; it ended in 
 heaviness, not as Job's children's feast by a wind from the wilderness, 
 not as Belshazzar's by a hand-writing on the wall, but by is own folly. 
 An unhappy falling out there was, at the end of the feast, between the 
 king and queen, which broke of the feast abruptly, and sent the guests 
 away silent and ashamed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It was certainly the king's weakness to send for Vashti into his 
 presence when he was drunk, and in company with abundance of gentlemen, 
 many of whom, it is likely, were in the same condition. <I>When his 
 heart was merry with wine</I> nothing would serve him but Vashti must 
 come, well dressed as she was, with <I>the crown on her head,</I> that 
 the princes and people might see what a handsome woman she was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 Hereby,

 1. He dishonoured himself as a husband, who ought to protect, but by no
 means expose, the modesty of his wife, who ought to be to her <I>a 
 covering of the eyes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:16">Gen. xx. 16</A>),

 not to uncover them. 

 2. He diminished himself as a king, in commanding that from his wife
 which she might refuse, much to the honour of her virtue. It was 
 against the custom of the Persians for the women to appear in public, 
 and he put a great hardship upon her when he did not court, but command 
 her to do so uncouth a thing, and make her a show.  If he had not been 
 put out of the possession of himself by drinking to excess, he would 
 not have done such a thing, but would have been angry at any one that 
 should have mentioned it. When the wine is in the wit is out, and men's 
 reason departs from them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. However, perhaps it was not her wisdom to deny him. <I>She refused 
 to come</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 though he sent his command by seven honourable messengers, and
 publicly, and Josephus says sent again and again, yet she persisted in 
 her denial. Had she come, while it was evident that she did it in pure 
 obedience, it would have been no reflection upon her modesty, nor a bad 
 example. The thing was not in itself sinful, and therefore to obey 
 would have been more her honour than to be so precise. Perhaps she 
 refused in a haughty manner, and then it was certainly evil; she 
 <I>scorned to come at the king's commandment.</I> What a mortification 
 was this to him! While he was showing the glory of his kingdom he 
 showed the reproach of his family, that he had a wife that would do as 
 she pleased. Strifes between yoke-fellows are bad enough at any time, 
 but before company they are very scandalous, and occasion blushing and 
 uneasiness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The king thereupon grew outrageous. He that had rule over 127 
 provinces had no rule over his own spirit, but his <I>anger burned in 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He would have consulted his own comfort and credit more if he had
 stifled his resentment, had passed by the affront his wife gave him, 
 and turned it off with a jest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Though he was very angry, he would not do any thing in this matter 
 till he advised with his privy-counsellors; as he had seven 
 chamberlains to execute his orders, who are named 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 so he had seven counsellors to direct his orders. The greater power a
 man has the greater need he has of advice, that he may not abuse his 
 power. Of these counsellors it is said that they were learned men, for 
 they <I>knew law</I> and <I>judgment,</I>that they were wise men, for 
 they <I>knew the times,</I>and that the king put great confidence in 
 them and honour upon them, for they <I>saw the king's face and sat 
 first in the kingdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 In the multitude of such counsellors there is safety. Now here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The question proposed to this cabinet-council 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to the law?</I>
 Observe,

 (1.) Though it was the queen that was guilty, the law must have its
 course.

 (2.) Though the king was very angry, yet he would do nothing but what
 he was advised was according to law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The proposal which Memucan made, that Vashti should be divorced for 
 her disobedience. Some suggest that he gave this severe advice, and the 
 rest agreed to it, because they knew it would please the king, would 
 gratify both his passion now and his appetite afterwards. But Josephus 
 says that, on the contrary, he had a strong affection for Vashti, and 
 would not have put her away for this offence if he could legally have 
 passed it by; and then we must suppose Memucan, in his advice, to have 
 had a sincere regard to justice and the public good. 

 (1.) He shows what would be the bad consequences of the queen's
 disobedience to her husband, if it were passed by and not animadverted 
 upon, that it would embolden other wives both to disobey their husbands 
 and to domineer over them. Had this unhappy falling out between the 
 king and his wife, wherein she was conqueror, been private, the error 
 would have remained with themselves and the quarrel might have been 
 settled privately between themselves; but it happening to be public, 
 and perhaps the ladies that were now feasting with the queen having 
 shown themselves pleased with her refusal, her bad example would be 
 likely to have a bad influence upon all the families of the kingdom. If 
 the queen must have her humour, and the king must submit to it (since 
 the houses of private persons commonly take their measures from the 
 courts of princes), the wives would be haughty and imperious and would 
 scorn to obey their husbands, and the poor despised husbands might fret 
 at it, but could not help themselves; for the <I>contentions of a wife 
 are a continual dropping,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:13,27:15">Prov. xix. 13; xxvii. 15</A>;

 and see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:9,25:24">Prov. xxi. 9; xxv. 24</A>.

 When wives <I>despise their husbands,</I> whom they ought to
 <I>reverence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:33">Eph. v. 33</A>),

 and contend for <I>dominion</I> over those to whom they ought to be in
 <I>subjection</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:1">1 Pet. iii. 1</A>),

 there cannot but be continual guilt and grief, confusion and every evil
 work. And great ones must take heed of setting copies of this kind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:16-18"><I>v.</I> 16-18</A>.

 (2.) He shows what would be the good consequence of a decree against
 Vashti that she should be divorced. We may suppose that before they 
 proceeded to this extremity they sent to Vashti to know if she would 
 yet submit, cry <I>Peccavi--I have done wrong,</I> and ask the king's 
 pardon, and that, if she had done so, the mischief of her example would 
 have been effectually prevented, and process would have been stayed; 
 but it is likely she continued obstinate, and insisted upon it as her 
 prerogative to do as she pleased, whether it pleased the king or no, 
 and therefore they gave this judgment against her, that she <I>come no 
 more before the king,</I> and this judgment so ratified as never to be 
 reversed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The consequence of this, it was hoped, would be that <I>the wives would
 give to their husbands honour,</I> even the wives of the <I>great,</I> 
 notwithstanding their own greatness, and the wives of the <I>small,</I> 
 notwithstanding the husband's meanness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 and thus every man would bear rule in his own house, as he ought to do,
 and, the wives being subject, the children and servants would be so 
 too. It is the interest of states and kingdoms to provide that good 
 order be kept in private families.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The edict that passed according to this proposal, signifying that 
 the queen was divorced for contumacy, according to the law, and that, 
 if other wives were in like manner undutiful to their husbands, they
 must expect to be in like manner disgraced 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>):

 were they better than the queen? Whether it was the passion or the
 policy of the king that was served by this edict, God's providence 
 served its own purpose by it, which was to make way for Esther to the 
 crown.</P>
