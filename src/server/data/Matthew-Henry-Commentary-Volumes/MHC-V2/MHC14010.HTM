 This chapter is copied almost verbatim from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:1-19,2Ch+10:1-19">1 Kings xii. 1-19</A>,

 where it was opened at large. Solomon's defection from God was not
 repeated, but the defection of the ten tribes from his family is, in 
 this chapter, where we find, 

 I. How foolish Rehoboam was in his treating with them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+10:1,5-14">ver. 1, 5-14</A>.

 II. How wicked the people were in complaining of Solomon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+10:2-4">ver.  2-4</A>)

 and forsaking Rehoboam,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+10:16-19">ver. 16-19</A>.

 III. How just and righteous God was in all this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+10:15">ver. 15</A>.

 His counsel was thereby fulfilled. With him are strength and wisdom;
 both the deceived and the deceiver (the fool and the knave) are his
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:16">Job xii. 16</A>),
 
 that is, are made use of by him to suit his purposes.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel
 come to make him king.
 &nbsp; 2  And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
 <I>was</I> in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon
 the king, heard <I>it,</I> that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 3  And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came
 and spake to Rehoboam, saying,
 &nbsp; 4  Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou
 somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke
 that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
 &nbsp; 5  And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days.
 And the people departed.
 &nbsp; 6  And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had
 stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What
 counsel give ye <I>me</I> to return answer to this people?
 &nbsp; 7  And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this
 people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will
 be thy servants for ever.
 &nbsp; 8  But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and
 took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him,
 that stood before him.
 &nbsp; 9  And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return
 answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease
 somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?
 &nbsp; 10  And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto
 him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto
 thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou <I>it</I>
 somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little
 <I>finger</I> shall be thicker than my father's loins.
 &nbsp; 11  For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put
 more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I
 <I>will chastise you</I> with scorpions.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe here, 

 1. The wisest and best cannot give every body content. Solomon enriched
 and advanced his kingdom, did all (one would think) that could be done 
 to make then happy and easy; and yet either he was indiscreet in 
 burdening them with the imposition of taxes and services, or at least 
 there was some colour of reason to think him so.  No man is perfectly 
 wise. It is probable that it was when Solomon had declined from God and 
 his duty that his wisdom failed him, and God left him to himself to act 
 in this impolitic manner. Even Solomon's treasures were exhausted by 
 his love of women; and probably it was to maintain them, and their 
 pride, luxury, and idolatry, that he burdened his subjects. 

 2.  Turbulent and ungrateful spirits will find fault with the
 government, and complain of grievances, when they have very little 
 reason to do so.  Had they not peace in Solomon's time? They were never 
 plundered by invaders, as formerly, never put in fear by the alarms of 
 war, nor obliged to hazard their lives in the high places of the field.  
 Had they not plenty--meat enough, and money enough? What would they 
 more?  <I>O fortunatos nimium, sua si bona norint!</I>--<I>O happy, if 
 they knew their happy state!</I> And yet they complain that Solomon 
 made their yoke grievous. If any complain thus of the yoke of Christ, 
 that they might have a pretence to break his bands in sunder and cast 
 away his cords from them, we are sure that he never gave them any cause 
 at all for the complaint, whatever Solomon did. <I>His yoke is easy, 
 and his burden is light.</I> He never <I>made us serve with an 
 offering, nor wearied us with incense.</I> 

 3. Many ruin themselves and their interests by trampling upon and
 provoking their inferiors.  Rehoboam thought that because he was king 
 he might assume as much authority as his father had done, might have 
 what he would, and do what he would, and carry all before him. But, 
 though he wore his father's crown, he wanted his father's brains, and 
 ought to have considered that, being quite a different man from what 
 his father was, he ought to take other measures. Such a wise man as 
 Solomon may do as we will, but such a fool as Rehoboam must do as he 
 can. The high-mettled horse may be kicked and spurred by him that has 
 the art of managing him; but, if an unskilful horseman do it, it is at 
 his peril. Rehoboam paid dearly for threatening, and talking big, and 
 thinking to carry matters with a high hand. It was Job's wisdom, as 
 well as his virtue, that he <I>despised not the cause of his 
 man-servant or maid-servant,</I> when they argued with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:13">Job xxxi. 13</A>),

 but heard them patiently, considered their reasons, and gave them a
 soft answer. And a similar tender consideration of those in subjection, 
 and a forwardness to make them easy, will be the comfort and praise of 
 all in authority, in the church, in the state, and in families. 

 4.  Moderate counsels are generally wisest and best. Gentleness will do
 what violence will not do. Most people love to be accosted mildly.  
 Rehoboam's old experienced counsellors directed him to this method

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to
 them,</I> and thou art sure of them for ever." Good words cost nothing 
 but a little self-denial, and yet they purchase good things. 

 5. God often fulfils the counsels of his own wisdom by infatuating men,
 and giving them up to the counsels of their own folly. No more needs to 
 be done to ruin men than to leave them to themselves, and their own 
 pride and passion.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third
 day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.
 &nbsp; 13  And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam
 forsook the counsel of the old men,
 &nbsp; 14  And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying,
 My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father
 chastised you with whips, but I <I>will chastise you</I> with
 scorpions.
 &nbsp; 15  So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was
 of God, that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> might perform his word, which he spake by
 the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
 &nbsp; 16  And when all Israel <I>saw</I> that the king would not hearken
 unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion
 have we in David? and <I>we have</I> none inheritance in the son of
 Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: <I>and</I> now, David, see
 to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.
 &nbsp; 17  But <I>as for</I> the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities
 of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
 &nbsp; 18  Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that <I>was</I> over the tribute;
 and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.
 But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to <I>his</I> chariot, to
 flee to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 19  And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this
 day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may learn here, 

 1. That when public affairs are in a ferment violent proceedings do but
 make bad worse. Rough answers (such as Rehoboam here gave) do but stir 
 up anger and bring oil to the flames. The pilot has need to steer 
 steadily in a storm.  Many have been driven to the mischief they did 
 not intend by being too severely dealt with for what they did intend. 
 
 2. That, whatever the devices and designs of men are, God is, by all,
 doing his own work, and fulfilling the word which he has spoken, no 
 iota or tittle of which shall fall to the ground. The cause of the 
 king's obstinacy and thoughtlessness was <I>of God, that he might 
 perform the word which he spoke by Ahijah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This does not at all excuse Rehoboam's folly, nor lessen the guilt of
 his haughtiness and passion, that God was pleased to serve his own ends 
 by them.

 3.  That worldly wealth, honour, and dominion, are very uncertain
 things.  <I>Solomon reigned over all Israel,</I> and, one would think, 
 had done enough to secure the monarchy entire to his family for many 
 ages; and yet he is scarcely cold in his grave before ten of the twelve 
 tribes finally revolt from his son. All the good services he had done 
 for Israel were now forgotten: <I>What portion have we in David?</I> 
 Thus is the government of Christ cast off by many, notwithstanding all 
 he has done to bind the children of men for ever to himself; they say, 
 <I>We will not have this man to reign over us.</I> But this rebellion 
 will certainly be their ruin. 

 4. That God often visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the
 children. Solomon forsakes God, and therefore not he, but his son after 
 him, is forsaken by the greatest part of his people. Thus God, by 
 making the penal consequences of sin to last long and visibly to 
 continue after the sinner's death, would give an indication of its 
 malignity, and perhaps some intimation of the perpetuity of its 
 punishment. He that sins against God not only wrongs his soul, but 
 perhaps wrongs his seed more than he thinks of. 

 5. That, when God is fulfilling his threatenings, he will take care of
 that, at the same time, promises do not fall to the ground. When 
 Solomon's iniquity is remembered, and for it his son loses ten tribes, 
 David's piety is not forgotten, nor the promise made to him; but for 
 the sake of that his grandson had two tribes preserved to him. The 
 failings of the saints shall not frustrate any promise made to Christ 
 their Head.  They shall be chastised, but the covenant not broken,
