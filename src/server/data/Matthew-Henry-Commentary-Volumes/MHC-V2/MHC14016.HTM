 This chapter concludes the history of the reign of Asa, but does not
 furnish so pleasing an account of his latter end as we had of his
 beginning. 

 I. Here is a foolish treaty with Benhadad king of Syria, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:1-6">ver.  1-6</A>.

 II.  The reproof which God sent him for it by a prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 III.  Asa's displeasure against the prophet for his faithfulness,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king
 of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent
 that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.
 &nbsp; 2  Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of
 the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> and of the king's house, and sent to
 Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,
 &nbsp; 3  <I>There is</I> a league between me and thee, as <I>there was</I>
 between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver
 and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that
 he may depart from me.
 &nbsp; 4  And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains
 of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon,
 and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.
 &nbsp; 5  And it came to pass, when Baasha heard <I>it,</I> that he left off
 building of Ramah, and let his work cease.
 &nbsp; 6  Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the
 stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was
 building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 How to reconcile the date of this event with the history of the kings I 
 am quite at a loss. Baasha died in the twenty-sixth year of Asa, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:8">1 Kings xvi. 8</A>.

 How then could this be done in his thirty-sixth year, when Baasha's
 family was quite cut off, and Omri was upon the throne? It is generally 
 said to be meant of the thirty-sixth year of the kingdom of Asa, 
 namely, that of Judah, beginning from the first of Rehoboam, and so it 
 coincides with the sixteenth of Asa's reign; but then

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:19"><I>ch.</I> xv. 19</A>

 must be so understood; and how could it be spoken of as a great thing 
 that there was no more war till the fifteenth year of Asa, when that 
 passage immediately before was in his fifteenth year?

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:10"><I>ch.</I> xv. 10</A>),

 and after this miscarriage of his, here recorded, he had wars, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 Josephus places it in his twenty-sixth year, and then we must suppose a
 mistake in the transcriber here and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:19"><I>ch.</I> xv. 19</A>,

 the admission of which renders the computation easy. This passage we
 had before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:17-24">1 Kings xv. 17</A>,

 &c.) and Asa was in several ways faulty in it. 

 1. He did not do well to make a league with Benhadad, a heathen king,
 and to value himself so much upon it as he seems to have done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Had he relied more upon his covenant, and his father's, with God, he
 would not have boasted so much of his league, and his father's, with 
 the royal family of Syria.  

 2. If he had had a due regard to the honour of Israel in general, he
 would have found some other expedient to give Baasha a diversion than 
 by calling in a foreign force, and inviting into the country a common 
 enemy, who, in process of time, might be a plague to Judah too. 

 3. It was doubtless a sin in Benhadad to break his league with Baasha
 upon no provocation, but merely through the influence of a bribe; and, 
 if so, certainly it was a sin in Asa to move him to it, especially to 
 hire him to do it. The public faith of kings and kingdoms must not be 
 made so cheap a thing. 

 4. To take silver and gold out of the house of the Lord for this
 purpose was a great aggravation of the sin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Must the temple be plundered to serve his carnal politics? He had
 better have brought gifts and offerings with prayers and supplications, 
 to the house of the Lord, that he might have engaged God on his side 
 and made him his friend; then he would not have needed to be at this 
 expense to make Benhadad his friend. 

 5. It was well if Asa had not to answer for all the mischief that the
 army of Benhadad did unjustly to the cities of Israel, all the blood 
 they shed and all the spoil they made,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Perhaps Asa intended not that they should carry the matter so far. But
 those that draw others to sin know not what they do, nor where it will 
 end. The beginning of sin is as the letting forth of water. However the 
 project succeeded. Benhadad gave Baasha a powerful diversion, obliged 
 him to leave off building Ramah and betake himself to the defence of 
 his own country northward, which gave Asa an opportunity, not only to 
 demolish his fortifications, but to seize the materials and convert 
 them to his own use.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah,
 and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria,
 and not relied on the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, therefore is the host of the
 king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.
 &nbsp; 8  Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very
 many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, he delivered them into thine hand.
 &nbsp; 9  For the eyes of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> run to and fro throughout the whole
 earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of <I>them</I> whose heart
 <I>is</I> perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly:
 therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.
 &nbsp; 10  Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison
 house; for <I>he was</I> in a rage with him because of this <I>thing.</I>
 And Asa oppressed <I>some</I> of the people the same time.
 &nbsp; 11  And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they <I>are</I>
 written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
 &nbsp; 12  And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was
 diseased in his feet, until his disease <I>was</I> exceeding <I>great:</I>
 yet in his disease he sought not to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, but to the
 physicians.
 &nbsp; 13  And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and
 fortieth year of his reign.
 &nbsp; 14  And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made
 for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which
 was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds <I>of spices</I>
 prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great
 burning for him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A plain and faithful reproof given to Asa by a prophet of the Lord, 
 for making this league with Baasha. The reprover was Hanani the seer, 
 the father of Jehu, another prophet, whom we read of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:1,2Ch+19:2">1 Kings xvi. 1; 2 Chron. xix. 2</A>.

 We observed several things amiss in Asa's treaty with Benhadad. But
 that which the prophet here charges upon him as the greatest fault he 
 was guilty of in that matter is his <I>relying on the king of Syria and 
 not on the Lord his God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.</I>

 He thought that, though God was on his side, this would not stand him
 in stead unless he had Benhadad on his side, that God either could not 
 or would not help him, but he must take this indirect course to help 
 himself. Note, God is much displeased when he is distrusted and when an 
 arm of flesh is relied on more than his power and goodness. By putting 
 our confidence in God we give honour to him, and therefore he thinks 
 himself affronted if we give that honour to another. He plainly tells 
 the king that herein he had done foolishly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 It is a foolish thing to lean on a broken reed, when we have the rock
 of ages to rely upon.  To convince him of his folly he shows him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he acted against his experience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He, of all men, had no reason to distrust God, who had found him such a
 present powerful helper, by whom he had been made to triumph over a 
 threatening enemy, as his father before him, <I>because he relied upon 
 the Lord his God,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:18,14:11"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 18; xiv. 11</A>.

 "<I>What!</I>" said the prophet, "Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim
 a huge host, enough to swallow up a kingdom? And yet, <I>because thou 
 didst rely on the Lord, he delivered them into thy hand;</I> and was 
 not he sufficient to help thee against Baasha?" Note, The many 
 experiences we have had of the goodness of God to us aggravate our 
 distrust of him. Has he not helped us in six troubles? And have we any 
 reason to suspect him in the seventh? But see how deceitful our hearts 
 are! We trust in God when we have nothing else to trust to, when need 
 drives us to him; but, when we have other things to stay on, we are apt 
 to stay too much on them and to lean on our own understanding as long 
 as that has any thing to offer; but a believing confidence will be in 
 God only, when a smiling world courts it most.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he acted against his knowledge of God and his providence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 Asa could not be ignorant that <I>the eyes of the Lord run to and fro
 through the earth, strongly to hold with those</I> (so it may be read) 
 <I>whose heart is perfect towards him;</I> that is, 

 (1.) That God governs the world in infinite wisdom, and the creatures,
 and all their actions, are continually under his eye. The eye of 
 Providence is quick-sighted--it <I>runs;</I> it is intent--it runs 
 <I>to and fro;</I> it reaches far--<I>through the whole earth,</I> no 
 corner of which is from under it, not the most dark or distant; and his 
 eye directs his hand, and the arm of his power; for he shows himself 
 strong. Does Satan walk to and fro in the earth? Providence <I>runs</I> 
 to and fro, is never out of the way, never to seek, never at a loss.

 (2.) That God governs the world for the good of his people, does all in
 pursuance of the counsels of his love concerning their salvation, all 
 <I>for Jacob his servant's sake, and Israel his elect,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:4">Isa. xlv. 4</A>.
 
 <I>Christ is head over all things to his church,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:22">Eph. i. 22</A>.

 (3.) That those whose hearts are upright with him may be sure of his
 protection and have all the reason in the world to depend upon it. He 
 is able to protect them in the way of their duty (for wisdom and might 
 are his), and he actually intends their protection. A practical 
 disbelief of this is at the bottom of all our departures from God and 
 double-dealing with him. Asa could not trust God and therefore made 
 court to Benhadad.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he acted against his interest. 

 (1.) He had lost an opportunity of checking the growing greatness of
 the king of Syria,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 His <I>host has escaped out of thy hand,</I> which otherwise would have
 joined with Baasha's and fallen with it.

 (2.) He had incurred God's displeasure and henceforth must expect no
 peace, but the constant alarms of war, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Those that cannot find in their hearts to trust God forfeit his
 protection and throw themselves out of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Asa's displeasure at this reproof. Though it came from God by one 
 that was known to be his messenger, though the reproof was just and the 
 reasoning fair, and all intended for his good, yet he was wroth with 
 the seer for telling him of his folly; nay, <I>he was in a rage with 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Is this Asa? Is this he whose heart was perfect with the Lord all his
 days? Well, let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall. A 
 wise man, and yet in a rage! An Israelite, and yet in a rage with a 
 prophet! A good man, and yet impatient of reproof, and that cannot bear 
 to be told of his faults! Lord, what is man, when God leaves him to 
 himself? Those that idolize their own conduct cannot bear 
 contradiction; and those that indulge a peevish passionate temper may 
 be transported by it into impieties as well as into indecencies, and 
 will, some time or other, fly in the face of God himself. See what gall 
 and wormwood this root of bitterness bore.

 1. In his rage he committed the prophet to the jail, <I>put him in a
 prison-house,</I> as a malefactor, <I>in the stocks</I> (so some read 
 it,) or into <I>little-ease.</I> God's prophets meet with many that 
 cannot bear reproof, but take it much amiss, yet they must do their 
 duty. 

 2. Having proceeded thus far, <I>he oppressed some of the people,</I>
 probably such as owned the prophet in his sufferings, or were known to 
 be his particular friends. He that abused his power for the persecuting 
 of God's prophet was left to himself further to abuse it for the 
 crushing of his own subjects, whereby he weakened himself and lost his 
 interest.  Most persecutors have been tyrants.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His sickness. Two years before he died <I>he was diseased in his 
 feet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 afflicted with the gout in a high degree. He had put the prophet in the
 stocks, and now God put him in the stocks; so his punishment answered 
 his sin. <I>His disease was exceedingly great;</I> it came to the 
 height (so some); it flew up to his head (so others), and then it was 
 mortal. This was his affliction; but his sin was that in his disease, 
 instead of seeking to the Lord for relief, he <I>sought to the 
 physicians.</I> His making use of physicians was his duty; but trusting 
 to them, and expecting that from them which was to be had from God 
 only, were his sin and folly. The help of creatures must always be used 
 with an eye to the Creator, and in dependence upon him, who makes every 
 creature that to us which it is, and without whom the most skilful and 
 faithful are physicians of no value. Some think that these physicians 
 were strangers to the commonwealth of Israel, and were a sort of 
 conjurers, to whom he applied as if there were not a God in Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His death and burial. His funeral had something of extraordinary 
 solemnity in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 They made a very magnificent <I>burying for him.</I> I am loth to think
 (as some do) that he himself ordered this funeral pomp, and that it was 
 an instance of his vanity, that he would be buried like the Gentiles, 
 and not after the way of the Jews. It is said indeed, <I>He digged the 
 sepulchre for himself,</I> as one mindful of his grave; but I am 
 willing to believe that this funeral pomp was rather an expression of 
 the great respect his people retained for him, notwithstanding the 
 failings and infirmities of his latter days. It was agreed to do him 
 honour at his death. Note, The eminent piety and usefulness of good men 
 ought to be remembered to their praise, though they have had their 
 blemishes. Let their faults be buried in their graves, while their 
 services are remembered over their graves. He that said, <I>There is 
 not a just man that doeth good and sinneth not, yet</I> said also, 
 <I>The memory of the just is blessed;</I> and let it be so.</P>
