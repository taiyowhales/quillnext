 We left Samuel and Saul walking together, probably some private way
 over the fields down from Ramah, perhaps in the paths of the vineyards,
 and Saul expecting to hear from Samuel the word of God. Now here we
 have, 
 
 I. The anointing of Saul then and there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:1">ver. 1</A>.

 The signs Samuel gave him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:2-6">ver. 2-6</A>.

 And instructions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:7-8">ver. 7-8</A>.

 II. The accomplishment of those signs to the satisfaction of Saul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>.

 III. His return to his father's house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:14-16">ver. 14-16</A>.

 IV. His public election by lot, and solemn inauguration, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:17-25">ver.  17-25</A>.

 V.  His return to his own city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:26,27">ver. 26, 27</A>.

 It is a great work that is here a doing, the setting up not only of a
 monarch, but of monarchy itself, in Israel; and therefore in all the 
 advances towards it much of God is seen.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured <I>it</I> upon his
 head, and kissed him, and said, <I>Is it</I> not because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 anointed thee <I>to be</I> captain over his inheritance?
 &nbsp; 2 When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find
 two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at
 Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest
 to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the
 asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
 &nbsp; 3 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt
 come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men
 going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another
 carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of
 wine:
 &nbsp; 4 And they will salute thee, and give thee two <I>loaves</I> of
 bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.
 &nbsp; 5 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where <I>is</I> the
 garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou
 art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of
 prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a
 tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall
 prophesy:
 &nbsp; 6 And the Spirit of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will come upon thee, and thou
 shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
 &nbsp; 7 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, <I>that</I>
 thou do as occasion serve thee; for God <I>is</I> with thee.
 &nbsp; 8 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I
 will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, <I>and</I> to
 sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou
 tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Samuel is here executing the office of a prophet, giving Saul full 
 assurance from God that he should be king, as he was afterwards, 
 according to these prophecies which went before of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He <I>anointed him</I> and <I>kissed him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 This was not done in a solemn assembly, but it was done by divine
 appointment, which made up the want of all external solemnities, nor 
 was it ever the less valid for its being done in private, under a 
 hedge, or, as the Jews say, by <I>a fountain.</I> God's institutions 
 are great and honourable, though the circumstances of their 
 administration be ever so mean and despicable.

 1. Samuel, by anointing Saul, assured him that it was God's act to make
 him king: <I>Is it not because the Lord hath anointed thee?</I> And, in 
 token of that, the high priest was anointed to his office, to signify 
 the conferring of those gifts upon him that were requisite for the 
 discharge of its duties, and the same was intimated in the anointing of 
 kings; for whom God calls he qualifies, and suitable qualifications 
 furnish good proof of a commission. These sacred unctions, then used, 
 pointed at the great Messiah, or anointed one, the king of the church, 
 and high priest of our profession, who was anointed with the oil of the 
 Spirit, not by measure, but without measure, and above all the priests 
 and princes of the Jewish church. It was common oil, no doubt, which 
 Samuel used, and we read not of his blessing it or praying over it. But 
 it was only a vial of oil that he anointed him with, the vessel 
 brittle, because his kingdom would soon be cracked and broken, and the 
 quantity small, because he had but little of the Spirit conferred upon 
 him to what David had, who was therefore anointed with a horn of oil, 
 as were Solomon and Jehu with a box of oil. 

 2. By kissing him, he assured him of his own approbation of the choice,
 not only his consent to it, but his complacency in it, though it 
 abridged his power and eclipsed his glory and the glory of his family. 
 "<I>God has anointed thee,</I>" says Samuel, "<I>to be king,</I> and I 
 am satisfied and very well pleased, in pledge of which take this kiss." 
 It was likewise a kiss of homage and allegiance; hereby he not only 
 owns him to be king, but his king, and in this sense we are commanded 
 to <I>kiss the Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:12">Ps. ii. 12</A>.

 God has anointed him, and therefore we must thus acknowledge him and do
 homage to him.  In Samuel's explication of the ceremony, he reminds 
 him,

 (1.) Of the nature of the government to which he is called. He was
 anointed to be a captain, a commander indeed, which bespeaks honour and 
 power, but a commander in war, which bespeaks care, and toil, and 
 danger.

 (2.) Of the origin of it: <I>The Lord hath anointed thee.</I> By him he
 ruled, and therefore must rule for him, in dependence on him, and with 
 an eye to his glory.

 (3.) Of the end of it. It is over his inheritance, to take care of
 that, protect it, and order all the affairs of it for the best, as a 
 steward whom a great man sets over his estate, to manage it for his 
 service and give an account of it to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. For his further satisfaction he gives him some signs, which should 
 come to pass immediately, this very day; and they were such as would 
 not only confirm the word of Samuel in general, and prove him a true 
 prophet, but would confirm this word to Saul in particular, that he 
 should be king. 

 1. He should presently meet with some that would bring him intelligence
 from home of the care his father's house was in concerning him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 These he would meet hard by Rachel's sepulchre.  The first place Samuel
 directed him to was a sepulchre, the sepulchre of one of his ancestors, 
 for Rachel died in travail with Benjamin; there he must read a lecture 
 of his own mortality, and now that he had a crown in his eye must think 
 of his grave, in which all his honour would be laid in the dust. Here 
 two men would meet him, perhaps sent on purpose to look after him, and 
 would tell him the asses were found, and his father was in pain 
 concerning him, saying, <I>What shall I do for my son?</I> He would 
 reckon it happened well that he met with these messengers; and it is 
 good to eye Providence in favourable conjunctures (though the matter be 
 minute) and to be encouraged to trust it in greater matters. 

 2. He should next meet with others going to Bethel, where, it should
 seem, there was a high place for religious worship, and these men were 
 bringing their sacrifices thither, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 It was a token for good to one that was designed for the government of
 Israel, wherever he came, to meet with people going to worship God. It 
 is supposed that those kids and loaves, and the bottle of wine which 
 the three men had with them, were designed for sacrifice, with the 
 meat-offerings and drink-offerings that were to attend the sacrifice; 
 yet Samuel tells Saul that they will give him two of their loaves, and 
 he must take them. Such a present would look to us now like the 
 relieving of a beggar. Saul must hereafter remember the time when he 
 received alms, and must therefore be humble and charitable to the poor.  
 But perhaps it would then be construed a fit present for a prince; and, 
 as such, Saul must receive it, the first present that was brought to 
 him, by such as knew not what they did, nor why they did it, but God 
 put it into their hearts, which made it the more fit to be a sign to 
 him.  These two loaves, which were the first tribute paid to this 
 newly-anointed king, might serve for an admonition to him not to spend 
 the wealth of his crown in luxury, but still to be content with plain 
 food. Bread is the staff of life.

 3. The most remarkable sign of all would be his joining with a company
 of prophets that he should meet with, under the influence of a spirit 
 of prophecy, which should at that time come upon him. What God works in 
 us by his Spirit serves much more for the confirming of faith than any 
 thing wrought for us by his providence. He here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>)
 
 tells him,

 (1.) Where this would happen: <I>At the hill of God,</I> where there
 was a <I>garrison of the Philistines,</I> which is supposed to be near 
 Gibeah, his own city, for there was the Philistines' garrison,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:3"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 3</A>.

 Perhaps it was one of the articles of Samuel's agreement with them that
 they should have a garrison there, or, rather, after they were subdued 
 in the beginning of his time they got ground again, so far as to force 
 this garrison into that place, and thence God raised up the man that 
 should chastise them.  There was a place that was called the <I>hill of 
 God,</I> because of one of the schools of the prophets built upon it; 
 and such respect did even Philistines themselves pay to religion that a 
 garrison of their soldiers suffered a school of God's prophets to live 
 peaceably by them, and did not only not dislodge them, but not restrain 
 nor disturb the public exercises of their devotion. 

 (2.) Upon what occasion; he should meet <I>a company of prophets with
 music before them, prophesying,</I> and with them he should join 
 himself. These prophets were not (as it should seem) divinely inspired 
 to foretel things to come, nor did God reveal himself to them by dreams 
 and visions, but they employed themselves in the study of the law, in 
 instructing their neighbours, and in the acts of piety, especially in 
 praising God, wherein they were wonderfully assisted and enlarged by 
 the Spirit of God. It was happy for Israel that they had not only 
 prophets, but companies of prophets, who gave them good instructions 
 and set them good examples, and helped very much to keep up religion 
 among them. Now the word of the Lord was not precious, as it had been 
 when Samuel was first raised up, who had been instrumental in founding 
 these colleges, or religious houses, whence, it is probable, the 
 synagogues took their rise. What a pity was it that Israel should be 
 weary of the government of such a man, who though he had not, as a man 
 of war, expelled the Philistines, yet (which was a greater kindness to 
 Israel) had, as a man of God, settled the schools of the prophets!  
 Music was then used as a proper means to dispose the mind to receive 
 the impressions of the good Spirit, as it did Elisha's,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:15">2 Kings iii. 15</A>.

 But we have no reason to look for the same benefit by it now, unless we
 saw it as effectual as it was then in Saul's case, to drive away the 
 evil spirit. These prophets had been at the high place, probably 
 offering sacrifice, and now they came back singing psalms. We should 
 come from holy ordinances with our hearts greatly enlarged in holy joy 
 and praise. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+138:5">Ps. cxxxviii. 5</A>.

 Saul should find himself strongly moved to join with them, and should
 be turned thereby <I>into another man</I> from what he had been while 
 he lived in a private capacity. The Spirit of God, by his ordinances, 
 changes men, wonderfully transforms them; Saul, by praising God in the 
 communion of saints, became another man, but whether a new man or no 
 may be questioned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He directs him to proceed in the administration of his government 
 as Providence should lead him, and as Samuel should advise him. 

 1. He must follow Providence in ordinary cases

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Do as occasion shall serve thee.</I> Take such measures as thy own
 prudence shall direct thee." But, 

 2. In an extraordinary strait that would hereafter befal him at Gilgal,
 and would be the most critical juncture of all, when he would have 
 special need of divine aids, he must wait for Samuel to come to him, 
 and must tarry <I>seven days</I> in expectation of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 How his failing in this matter proved his fall we find afterwards,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:11"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 11</A>.

 It was now a plain intimation to him that he was upon his good
 behaviour, and, though a king, must act under the direction of Samuel, 
 and do as he should order him. The greatest of men must own themselves 
 in subjection to God and his word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  And it was <I>so,</I> that when he had turned his back to go from
 Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to
 pass that day.
 &nbsp; 10 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of
 prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he
 prophesied among them.
 &nbsp; 11 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw
 that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people
 said one to another, What <I>is</I> this <I>that</I> is come unto the son
 of Kish? <I>Is</I> Saul also among the prophets?
 &nbsp; 12 And one of the same place answered and said, But who <I>is</I>
 their father? Therefore it became a proverb, <I>Is</I> Saul also among
 the prophets?
 &nbsp; 13 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the
 high place.
 &nbsp; 14 And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither
 went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that
 <I>they were</I> no where, we came to Samuel.
 &nbsp; 15 And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel
 said unto you.
 &nbsp; 16 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the
 asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof
 Samuel spake, he told him not.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Saul has now taken his leave of Samuel, much amazed, we may well 
 suppose, at what has been done to him, almost ready to question whether 
 he be awake or no, and whether it be not all a dream. Now here we are 
 told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What occurred by the way, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Those signs which Samuel had given him came to pass very punctually;
 but that which gave him the greatest satisfaction of all was this, he 
 found immediately that God had given him <I>another heart.</I> A new 
 fire was kindled in his breast, such as he had never before been 
 acquainted with: seeking the asses is quite out of his mind, and he 
 thinks of nothing but fighting the Philistines, redressing the 
 grievances of Israel, making laws, administering justice, and providing 
 for the public safety; these are the things that now fill his head. He 
 finds himself raised to such a pitch of boldness and bravery as he 
 never thought he should be conscious of. He has no longer the heart of 
 a husbandman, which is low, and mean, and narrow, and concerned only 
 about his corn and cattle; but the heart of a statesman, a general, a 
 prince. Whom God calls to any service he will make fit for it. If he 
 advance to another station, he will give another heart, to those who 
 sincerely desire to serve him with their power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What occurred when he came near home. They came to <I>the hill</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 that is, to <I>Gibeah,</I> or <I>Geba,</I> which signifies <I>a
 hill,</I> and so the Chaldee here takes it as a proper name; he met 
 with the prophets as Samuel had told him, and the Spirit of God came 
 upon him, strongly and suddenly (so the word signifies), but not so as 
 to rest and abide upon him. It came on so as to go off quickly.  
 However, for the present, it had a strange effect upon him; for he 
 immediately joined with the prophets in their devotion, and that with 
 as much decorum and as great a transport of affection as any of them: 
 <I>He prophesied among them.</I> Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His prophesying was publicly taken notice of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 He was now among his acquaintance, who, when they saw him among the
 prophets, called one another to come and see a strange sight. This 
 would prepare them to accept him as a king, though one of themselves, 
 when they had seen how God had advanced him to the honour of a prophet. 
 The seventy elders prophesied before they were made judges, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:25">Num. xi. 25</A>.
 
 Now,

 (1.) They all wondered to see Saul among the prophets: <I>What is this
 that has come to the son of Kish?</I> Though this school of the 
 prophets was near his father's house, yet he had never associated with 
 them, nor shown them any respect, perhaps had sometimes spoken slightly 
 of them; and now to see him prophesying among them was a surprise to 
 them, as it was long after when his namesake, in the New Testament, 
 preached that gospel which he had before persecuted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:21">Acts ix. 21</A>.

 Where God gives another heart it will soon show itself.

 (2.) One of them, that was wiser than the rest, asked, "<I>Who is their
 father,</I> or instructor?  Is is not God? Are they not all taught of 
 him? Do they not all owe their gifts to him? And is he limited? Cannot 
 he make Saul a prophet, as well as any of them, if he please?" Or, "Is 
 not Samuel their father?" Under God, he was so; and Saul had now lately 
 been with him, which, by his servant, he might know. No marvel for him 
 to prophesy who lay last night under Samuel's roof.

 (3.) It became a proverb, commonly used in Israel, when they would
 express their wonder at a bad man's either becoming good, or at least 
 being found in good company, <I>Is Saul among the prophets?</I> Note, 
 Saul among the prophets is a wonder to a proverb. Let not the worst be 
 despaired of, yet let not an external show of devotion, and a sudden 
 change for the present, be too much relied on; for Saul among the 
 prophets was Saul still.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His being anointed was kept private. When he had done prophesying, 
 
 (1.) It should seem he uttered all his words before the Lord, and
 recommended the affair to his favour, for he went straight <I>to the 
 high place</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 to give God thanks for his mercies to him and to pray for the
 continuance of those mercies. But,

 (2.) He industriously concealed from his relations what had passed. His
 uncle, who met with him either at the high place or as soon as he came 
 home, examined him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Saul owned, for his servant knew it, that they had been with Samuel,
 and that he told them the asses were found, but said not a word of 
 <I>the kingdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.
 
 This was an instance,

 [1.] Of his humility. Many a one would have been so elated with this
 surprising elevation as to proclaim it upon the house-top.  But Saul, 
 though he might please himself with it in his own breast, did not pride 
 himself in it among his neighbours. The heirs of the kingdom of glory 
 are well enough pleased that <I>the world knows them not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:1">1 John iii. 1</A>.

 [2.] Of his prudence. Had he been forward to proclaim it, he would have
 been envied, and he knew not what difficulty that might have created 
 him. Samuel had communicated it to him as a secret, and he knows how to 
 keep counsel. Thus it appears that he had another heart, a heart fit 
 for government. 

 [3.] Of his dependence upon God. He does not go about to make an
 interest for himself, but leaves it to God to carry on his own work by 
 Samuel, and, for his own part, sits still, to see how the matter will 
 fall.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  And Samuel called the people together unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to
 Mizpeh;
 &nbsp; 18 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered
 you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all
 kingdoms, <I>and</I> of them that oppressed you:
 &nbsp; 19 And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved
 you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye
 have said unto him, <I>Nay,</I> but set a king over us. Now therefore
 present yourselves before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by your tribes, and by your
 thousands.
 &nbsp; 20 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come
 near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
 &nbsp; 21 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by
 their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son
 of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be
 found.
 &nbsp; 22 Therefore they enquired of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> further, if the man
 should yet come thither. And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> answered, Behold, he hath
 hid himself among the stuff.
 &nbsp; 23 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among
 the people, he was higher than any of the people from his
 shoulders and upward.
 &nbsp; 24 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 hath chosen, that <I>there is</I> none like him among all the people?
 And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.
 &nbsp; 25 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and
 wrote <I>it</I> in a book, and laid <I>it</I> up before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. And
 Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.
 &nbsp; 26 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a
 band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
 &nbsp; 27 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us?
 And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held
 his peace.

 Saul's nomination to the throne is here made public, in a general 
 assembly of the elders of Israel, the representatives of their 
 respective tribes at Mizpeh. It is probable that this convention of the 
 states was called as soon as conveniently it might, after Saul was 
 anointed, for, if there must be a change in their government, the 
 sooner the better: it might be of bad consequence to be long in the 
 doing. The people having met in a solemn assembly, in which God was in 
 a peculiar manner present (and therefore it is said they were <I>called 
 together unto the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),
 
 Samuel acts for God among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He reproves them for casting off the government of a prophet, and 
 desiring that of a captain. 
 
 1. He shows them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 how happy they had been under the divine government; when God ruled
 them, he <I>delivered them out of the hand of those that oppressed 
 them,</I> and what would they desire more? Could the mightiest man of 
 valour do that for them which the Almighty God had done? 

 2. He likewise shows them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 what an affront they had put upon God (who had himself saved them
 <I>out of all their tribulations,</I> by his own power, and by such as 
 he had immediately called and qualified) in desiring a king to save 
 them. He tells them in plain terms, "<I>You have this day rejected your 
 God;</I> you have in effect done it: so he construes it, and he might 
 justly, for your so doing, reject you." Those that can live better by 
 sense than by faith, that stay themselves upon an arm of flesh rather 
 than upon the almighty arm, forsake a fountain of living waters for 
 broken cisterns. And some make their obstinacy in this matter to be a 
 presage of their rejecting Christ, in casting off whom they cast off 
 God, that he should not reign over them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He puts them upon choosing their king by lot. He knew whom God had 
 chosen, and had already anointed him, but he knew also the peevishness 
 of that people, and that there were those among them who would not 
 acquiesce in the choice if it depended upon his single testimony; and 
 therefore, that every tribe and every family of the chosen tribe might 
 please themselves with having a chance for it, he calls them to the 
 lot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Benjamin is taken out of all the tribes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 and out of that tribe Saul the son of Kish, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 By this method it would appear to the people, as it already appeared to
 Samuel, that Saul was appointed of God to be king; for <I>the disposal 
 of the lot is of the Lord.</I> It would also prevent all disputes and 
 exceptions; for <I>the lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth 
 between the mighty.</I> When the tribe of Benjamin was taken, they 
 might easily foresee that they were setting up a family that would soon 
 be put down again; for dying Jacob had, by the spirit of prophecy, 
 entailed the dominion upon Judah. Judah is the tribe that must <I>rule 
 as a lion; Benjamin</I> shall only <I>ravin as a wolf,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10,27">Gen. xlix. 10, 27</A>.

 Those therefore that knew the scriptures could not be very fond of the
 doing of that which they foresaw must, ere long, be undone again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It is with much ado, and not without further enquiries of the 
 Lord, that Saul is at length produced. When the lot fell upon him, 
 every one expected he should answer to his name at the first call, but, 
 instead of that, none of his friends could find him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 he had <I>hidden himself among the stuff</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 so little fond was he now of that power which yet, when he was in
 possession of, he could not without the utmost indignation think of 
 parting with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He withdrew, in hopes that, upon his not appearing, they would 
 proceed to another choice, or thus to express his modesty; for, by what 
 had already passed, he knew he must be the man. We may suppose he was 
 at this time really averse to take upon him the government, 

 (1.) Because he was conscious to himself of unfitness for so great a
 trust.  He had not been bred up to books, or arms, or courts, and 
 feared he should be guilty of some fatal blunder.

 (2.) Because it would expose him to the envy of his neighbours that
 were ill-affected towards him.

 (3.) Because he understood, by what Samuel had said, that the people
 sinned in asking a king, and it was in anger that God granted their 
 request. 

 (4.) Because the affairs of Israel were at this time in a bad posture;
 the Philistines were strong, the Ammonites threatening: and he must be 
 bold indeed that will set sail in a storm.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But the congregation, believing that choice well made which God 
 himself made, would leave no way untried to find him out on whom the 
 lot fell. <I>They enquired of the Lord,</I> either by the high priest, 
 and his breast-plate of judgment, or by Samuel, and his spirit of 
 prophecy; and the Lord directed them where they should find him, hidden 
 among the carriages, and thence <I>they fetched him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Note, None will be losers at last by their humility and modesty.
 Honour, like the shadow, follows those that flee from it, but flees 
 from those that pursue it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Samuel presents him to the people, and they accept him. He needed 
 not to mount the bench, or scaffold, to be seen; when he stood upon 
 even ground with the rest he was seen above them all, for he was taller 
 than any of them by <I>head and shoulders, </I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 "Look you," said Samuel, "what a king God has chosen for you, just such
 a one as you wished for; <I>there is none like him among all the 
 people,</I> that has so much majesty in his countenance and such a 
 graceful stateliness in his mien; he is in the crowd like a cedar among 
 the shrubs. Let your own eyes be judges, is he not a brave and gallant 
 man?" The people hereupon signified their approbation of the choice, 
 and their acceptance of him; they <I>shouted and said, Let the king 
 live,</I> that is, "Let him long reign over us in health and 
 prosperity." Subjects were wont to testify their affection and 
 allegiance to their prince by their good wishes, and those turned (as 
 our translation does this) into addresses to God. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:15">Ps. lxxii. 15</A>,

 <I>Prayer shall be made for him continually.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:1">Ps. xx. 1</A>.

 Samuel had told them they would soon be weary of their king, but, in
 the mind they are now in, they will never be so: <I>Let the king 
 live.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Samuel settles the original contract between them, and leaves it 
 upon record, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 He had before told them <I>the manner of the king</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:11"><I>ch.</I> viii. 11</A>),

 how he would abuse his power; now he tells them <I>the manner of the
 kingdom,</I> or rather the law, or judgment, or constitution, of it, 
 what power the prince might challenge and the utmost of the property 
 the subject might claim. He fixed the land-marks between them, that 
 neither might encroach upon the other. Let them rightly understand one 
 another at first, and let the agreement remain in black and white, 
 which will tend to preserve a good understanding between them ever 
 after. The learned bishop Patrick thinks he now repeated and registered 
 what he had told them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:11"><I>ch.</I> viii. 11</A>)

 of the arbitrary power their kings would assume, that it might
 hereafter be a witness against them that they had drawn the calamity 
 upon themselves, for they were warned what it would come to and yet 
 they would have a king.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The convention was dissolved when the solemnity was over: <I>Samuel 
 sent every man to his house.</I> Here were no votes passed, nor, for 
 aught that appears, so much as a motion made, for the raising of money 
 to support the dignity of their new-elected king; if therefore he 
 afterwards thinks fit to take what they do not think fit to give (which 
 yet it was necessary that he should have), they must thank themselves. 
 They went every man to his house, pleased with the name of a king over 
 them, and <I>Saul also went home to Gibeah,</I> to his father's house, 
 not puffed up with the name of a kingdom under him. At Gibeah he had no 
 palace, no throne, no court, yet thither he goes. If he must be a king, 
 as one mindful of the rock out of which he was hewn, he will make his 
 own city the royal city, nor will he be ashamed (as too many are when 
 they are preferred) of his mean relations. Such a humble spirit as this 
 puts a beauty and lustre upon great advancements. The condition rising, 
 and the mind not rising with it, behold how good and pleasant it is!  
 But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How did the people stand affected to their new king? The generality 
 of them, it should seem, did not show themselves much concerned: They 
 <I>went every man to his own house.</I> Their own domestic affairs lay 
 nearer their hearts than any interests of the public; this was the 
 general temper. But, 

 (1.) There were some so faithful as to attend him: <I>A band of men
 whose hearts God had touched,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Not the body of the people, but a small company, who because they were
 fond of their own choice of a king, or because they had so much more 
 sense than their neighbours as to conclude that if he was a king he 
 ought to be respected accordingly, went with him to Gibeah, as his 
 life-guard. They were those <I>whose hearts God had touched,</I> in 
 this instance, to do their duty. Note, Whatever good there is in us, or 
 is done by us, at any time, it must be ascribed to the grace of God. If 
 the heart bend at any time the right way, it is because he has touched 
 it. One touch is enough, when it is divine.

 (2.) There were others so spiteful as to affront him; children of
 Belial, men that would endure no yoke, that would be pleased with 
 nothing that either God or Samuel did; they <I>despised him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>)

 for the meanness of his tribe and family, the smallness of his estate,
 and the privacy of his education; and they said, <I>How shall this man 
 save us?</I> Yet they did not propose any man more likely; nor, 
 whomsoever they had, must their salvation come from the man, but from 
 God. They would not join with their neighbours in testifying an 
 affection to him and his government, by bringing him presents, or 
 addressing him upon his accession to the crown. Perhaps those 
 discontented spirits were most earnest for a king, and yet, now that 
 they had one, they quarrelled with him, because he was not altogether 
 such a one as themselves. It was reason enough for them not to like him 
 because others did. Thus differently are men affected to our exalted 
 Redeemer. God hath set him king upon the holy hill of Sion.  There is a 
 remnant that submit to him, rejoice in him, bring him presents, and 
 follow him wherever he goes; and they are those <I>whose hearts God has 
 touched,</I> whom he has <I>made willing in the day of his power.</I> 
 But there are others who despise him, who ask, <I>How shall this man 
 save us?</I> They are offended in him, stumble at his external 
 meanness, and they will be broken by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How did Saul resent the bad conduct of those that were disaffected 
 to his government? <I>He held his peace.</I> Margin, <I>He was as 
 though he had been deaf.</I> He was so far from resenting it that he 
 seemed not to take notice of it, which was an evidence of his humility
 and modesty, and the mercifulness of his disposition, and also that he 
 was well satisfied with his title to the crown; for those are commonly 
 most jealous of their honour, and most revengeful of affronts, that 
 gain their power by improper means. Christ held his peace when he was 
 affronted, for it was the day of his patience; but there is a day of 
 recompence coming.</P>
