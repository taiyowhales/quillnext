 This is called the Hebrew <I>Shepher Shophtim,</I> the <I>Book of 
 Judges,</I> which the Syriac and Arabic versions enlarge upon, and call 
 it, <I>The Book of the Judges of the Children of Israel;</I> the 
 judgments of that nation being peculiar, so were their judges, whose 
 office differed vastly from that of the judges of other nations. The 
 LXX. entitles it only <B><I>Kritai,</I></B> <I>Judges.</I> It is
 the history of the <I>commonwealth of Israel,</I> during the government 
 of the judges from Othniel to Eli, so much of it as God saw fit to 
 transmit to us. It contains the history (according to Dr. Lightfoot's 
 computation) of 299 years, reckoning to Othniel of Judah forty years, 
 to Ehud of Benjamin eighty years, to Barak of Naphtali forty years, to 
 Gideon of Manasseh forty years, to Abimelech his son three years, to 
 Tola of Issachar twenty-three, to Jair of Manasseh twenty-two, to 
 Jephtha of Manasseh six, to Ibzan of Judah seven, to Elon of Zebulun 
 ten, to Abdon of Ephraim eight, to Samson of Dan twenty, in all 299. As 
 for the years of their servitude, as were Eglon is said to oppress them 
 eighteen years and Jabin twenty years, and so some others, those must 
 be reckoned to fall in with some or other of the years of the judges. 
 The judges here appear to have been of eight several tribes; that 
 honour was thus diffused, until at last it centred in Judah. Eli and 
 Samuel, the two judges that fall not within this book, were of Levi. It
 seems, there was no judge of Reuben or Simeon, Gad or Asher. The
 history of these judges in their order we have in this book

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:1-16:31">to the end of <I>ch.</I> xvi</A>.

 And then in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:1-21:25">last five chapters</A>

 we have an account of some particular memorable events which happened,
 as the story of Ruth did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:1">Ruth i. 1</A>)

 <I>in the days when the judges ruled,</I> but it is not certain in
 which judge's days; but they are put together at the end of the book, 
 that the thread of the general history might not be interrupted. Now as 
 to the state of the commonwealth of Israel during this period, 

 I. They do not appear here either so great or so good as one might have
 expected the character of such a peculiar people would be, that were 
 governed by such laws and enriched by such promises. We find them 
 wretchedly corrupted, and wretchedly oppressed by their neighbours 
 about them, and nowhere in all the book, either in war or council, do 
 they make any figure proportionable to their glorious entry into 
 Canaan. What shall we say to it? God would hereby show us the 
 lamentable imperfection of all persons and things under the sun, that 
 we may look for complete holiness and happiness in the other world, and 
 not in this. Yet, 

 II. We may hope that though the historian in this book enlarges most
 upon their provocations and grievances, yet there was a face of 
 religion upon the land; and, however there were those among them that 
 were drawn aside to idolatry, yet the tabernacle-service, according to 
 the law of Moses, was kept up, and there were many that attended it. 
 Historians record not the common course of justice and commerce in a 
 nation, taking that for granted, but only the wars and disturbances 
 that happen; but the reader must consider the other, to balance the 
 blackness of them. 

 III. It should seem that in these times each tribe had very much its
 government in ordinary within itself, and acted separately, without one 
 common head, or council, which occasioned many differences among 
 themselves, and kept them from being or doing any thing considerable.

 IV. The government of the judges was not constant, but occasional; when 
 it is said that after Ehud's victory <I>the land rested eighty 
 years,</I> and after Barak's <I>forty</I>, it is not certain that they 
 lived, much less that they governed, so long; but they and the rest 
 were raised up and animated by the Spirit of God to do particular 
 service to the public when there was occasion, to <I>avenge Israel of 
 their enemies,</I> and to purge Israel of their idolatries, which are 
 the two things principally meant by their judging Israel. Yet Deborah, 
 as a prophetess, was attended for judgment by all Israel, before there 
 was occasion for her agency in war,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:4"><I>ch.</I> iv. 4</A>.

 V. During the government of the judges, God was in a more especial
 manner Israel's king; so Samuel tells them when they were resolved to 
 throw off this form of government,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:12">1 Sam. xii. 12</A>.

 God would try what his own law and the constitutions of that would do
 to keep them in order, and it proved that when <I>there was no king in 
 Israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes;</I> he 
 therefore, towards the latter end of this time, made the government of 
 the judges more constant and universal that it was at first, and at 
 length gave them David, a king after his own heart; then, and not till 
 then, Israel began to flourish, which should make us very thankful for 
 magistrates both supreme and subordinate, for they are <I>ministers of 
 God unto us for good.</I> Four of the judges of Israel are canonized

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:32">Heb. xi. 32</A>),

 Gideon, Barak, Samson, and Jephtha. The Learned bishop Patrick thinks
 the prophet Samuel was the penman of this Book.</P>
