 This chapter gives us a more particular account of the distribution of 
 the priests and Levites into their respective classes, for the more 
 regular discharge of the duties of their offices, according to their 
 families. 
 
 I. Of the priests,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now <I>these are</I> the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons
 of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
 &nbsp; 2  But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no
 children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's
 office.
 &nbsp; 3  And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of
 Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their
 offices in their service.
 &nbsp; 4  And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar
 than of the sons of Ithamar; and <I>thus</I> were they divided. Among
 the sons of Eleazar <I>there were</I> sixteen chief men of the house
 of <I>their</I> fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according
 to the house of their fathers.
 &nbsp; 5  Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the
 governors of the sanctuary, and governors <I>of the house</I> of God,
 were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.
 &nbsp; 6  And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, <I>one</I> of the
 Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok
 the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and <I>before</I> the
 chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal
 household being taken for Eleazar, and <I>one</I> taken for Ithamar.
 &nbsp; 7  Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to
 Jedaiah,
 &nbsp; 8  The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
 &nbsp; 9  The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
 &nbsp; 10  The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
 &nbsp; 11  The ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
 &nbsp; 12  The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
 &nbsp; 13  The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
 &nbsp; 14  The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
 &nbsp; 15  The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses,
 &nbsp; 16  The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel,
 &nbsp; 17  The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to
 Gamul,
 &nbsp; 18  The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth
 to Maaziah.
 &nbsp; 19  These <I>were</I> the orderings of them in their service to come
 into the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, according to their manner, under
 Aaron their father, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel had commanded him.

 The particular account of these establishments is of little use to us 
 now; but, when Ezra published it, it was of great use to direct their 
 church affairs after their return from captivity into the old channel 
 again. The title of this record we have 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>--

 <I>These are the
 divisions of the sons of Aaron,</I> not by which they divided one from 
 another, or were at variance one with another (it is a pity there 
 should ever be any such divisions among the sons of Israel, but 
 especially among the sons of Aaron), but the distribution of them in 
 order to the dividing of their work among themselves; it was a division 
 which God made, and was made for him. 

 1. This distribution was made for the more regular discharge of the
 duties of their office. God was, and still is, the God of order, and 
 not of confusion, particularly in the things of his worship. Number 
 without order is but a clog and an occasion of tumult; but when every 
 one has, and knows, and keeps, his place and work, the more the better. 
 In the mystical body, every member has its use, for the good of the 
 whole,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:4,5,1Co+12:12">Rom. xii. 4, 5; 1 Cor. xii. 12</A>.

 2.  It was made by lot, that the disposal thereof might be of the Lord,
 and so all quarrels and contentions might be prevented, and no man 
 could be charged with partiality, nor could any say that they had wrong 
 done them. As God is the God or order, so he is the God of peace. 
 Solomon says of the lot that it <I>causeth contention to cease.</I> 

 3.  The lot was cast publicly, and with great solemnity, in the
 presence of the king, princes, and priests, that there might be no room 
 for any fraudulent practices or the suspicion of them. The lot is an 
 appeal to God, and ought to be managed with corresponding reverence and 
 sincerity. Matthias was chosen to the apostleship by lot, with prayer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:24,26">Acts i. 24, 26</A>),

 and I know not but it might be still used in faith in parallel cases,
 as an instituted ordinance. We have here the name of the public notary 
 that was employed in writing the names, and drawing the lots,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Shemaiah, one of the Levites.</I> 

 4. What those priests were chosen to was to preside in the affairs of
 the sanctuary

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+24:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 in their several courses and turns. That which was to be determined by
 the lot was only the precedency, not who should serve (for they chose 
 all the chief men), but who should serve first, and who next, that 
 every one might know his course, and attend in it. Of the twenty-four 
 chief men of the priests sixteen were of the house of Eleazar and eight 
 of Ithamar; for the house of Ithamar may well be supposed to have 
 dwindled since the sentence passed on the family of Eli, who was of 
 that house. The method of drawing the lots is intimated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 one chief household being taken for Eleazar, and one for Ithamar. The
 sixteen chief names of Eleazar were put in one urn, the eight for 
 Ithamar in another, and they drew out of them alternately, as long as 
 those for Ithamar lasted, and then out of those only for Eleazar, or 
 two for Eleazar, and then one for Ithamar, throughout. 

 5.  Among these twenty-four courses the eighth is that of Abijah or
 Abia

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+24:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 which is mentioned
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:5">Luke i. 5</A>)

 as the course which Zechariah was of, the father of John the Baptist,
 by which it appears that these courses which David now settled, though 
 interrupted perhaps in the bad reigns and long broken off by the 
 captivity, yet continued in succession till the destruction of the 
 second temple by the Romans. And each course was called by the name of 
 him in whom it was first founded, as the high priest is here called 
 <I>Aaron</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+24:19"><I>v.</I>  19</A>),

 because succeeding in his dignity and power, though we read not of any
 of them that bore that name. Whoever was high priest must be reverenced 
 and observed by the inferior priests as their father, as Aaron their 
 father. Christ is high priest over the house of God, to whom all 
 believers, being made priests, are to be in subjection.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  And the rest of the sons of Levi <I>were these:</I> Of the sons
 of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.
 &nbsp; 21  Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first
 <I>was</I> Isshiah.
 &nbsp; 22  Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth;
 Jahath.
 &nbsp; 23  And the sons <I>of Hebron;</I> Jeriah <I>the first,</I> Amariah the
 second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.
 &nbsp; 24  <I>Of</I> the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah;
 Shamir.
 &nbsp; 25  The brother of Michah <I>was</I> Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah;
 Zechariah.
 &nbsp; 26  The sons of Merari <I>were</I> Mahli and Mushi: the sons of
 Jaaziah; Beno.
 &nbsp; 27  The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur,
 and Ibri.
 &nbsp; 28  Of Mahli <I>came</I> Eleazar, who had no sons.
 &nbsp; 29  Concerning Kish: the son of Kish <I>was</I> Jerahmeel.
 &nbsp; 30  The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These
 <I>were</I> the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.
 &nbsp; 31  These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the
 sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and
 Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and
 Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger
 brethren.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Most of the Levites here named were mentioned before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:16-23"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 16</A>,

 &c.
 They were of those who were to attend the priests in the service of the 
 house of God. But they are here mentioned again as heads of the 
 twenty-four courses of Levites (and about so many are here named), who 
 were to attend the twenty-four courses of the priests: they are 
 therefore said to <I>cast lots over against their brethren</I> (so they
 are called, not their <I>lords</I>), <I>the sons of Aaron,</I> who were 
 not to lord it over God's <I>clergy,</I> as the original word is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:3">1 Pet. v. 3</A>.

 And, that the whole disposal of the affair might be of the Lord, the
 principal fathers cast lots over against their younger brethren; that 
 is, those that were of the elder house came upon he level with those of 
 the younger families, and took their place, not by seniority, but as 
 God by the lot directed. Note, In Christ no difference is made between 
 bond and free, elder and younger. The younger brethren, if they be 
 faithful and sincere, shall be no less acceptable to Christ than the 
 principal fathers.</P>
