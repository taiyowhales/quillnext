 In the foregoing chapter we have David made king, by which the civil 
 government was happily settled. In this chapter care is taken about 
 religion. 

 I. David consults with the representatives of the people about bringing
 up the ark out of its obscurity into a public place; and it is resolved 
 on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. With a great deal of solemnity and joy, it is carried from
 Kirjath-jearim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:5-8">ver. 5-8</A>.

 III. Uzza is struck dead for touching it, which, for the present,
 spoils the solemnity and stops the proceedings,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And David consulted with the captains of thousands and
 hundreds, <I>and</I> with every leader.
 &nbsp; 2  And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If <I>it
 seem</I> good unto you, and <I>that it be</I> of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God, let us
 send abroad unto our brethren every where, <I>that are</I> left in all
 the land of Israel, and with them <I>also</I> to the priests and
 Levites <I>which are</I> in their cities <I>and</I> suburbs, that they may
 gather themselves unto us:
 &nbsp; 3  And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we
 enquired not at it in the days of Saul.
 &nbsp; 4  And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the
 thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
 &nbsp; 5  So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt
 even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from
 Kirjath-jearim.
 &nbsp; 6  And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, <I>that is,</I> to
 Kirjath-jearim, which <I>belonged</I> to Judah, to bring up thence the
 ark of God the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that dwelleth <I>between</I> the cherubims, whose
 name is called <I>on it.</I>
 &nbsp; 7  And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the
 house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.
 &nbsp; 8  And David and all Israel played before God with all <I>their</I>
 might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and
 with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. David's pious proposal to bring up the ark of God to Jerusalem, that
 the royal city might be the holy city,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:1-3"><I>v.</I> 1-3</A>.

 This part of the story we had not in Samuel. We may observe in this
 proposal,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That as soon as David was well seated on his throne he had thoughts 
 concerning the ark of God: <I>Let us bring the ark to us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Two things he aimed at herein:--

 (1.) To do honour to God, by showing respect to his ark, the token of 
 his presence. As soon as he had power in his hand he would use it for 
 the advancement and encouragement of religion.  Note, It ought to be 
 the first and great care of those that are enriched and preferred to 
 honour God with their honours, and to serve him, and the interests of 
 his kingdom among men, with their wealth and power. David said not, 
 "What pompous thing shall I do now?" or, "What pleasant thing?" but, 
 "What pious thing?" 

 (2.) To have the comfort and benefit of that sacred oracle. "Let us 
 bring it to us, not only that we may be a credit to it, but that it may 
 be a blessing to us." Those that honour God profit themselves. Note, It 
 is the wisdom of those who are setting out in the world to take God's 
 ark with them, to make his oracles their counsellors and his laws their 
 rule. Those are likely to proceed in the favour of God who thus begin 
 in the fear of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he consulted with the leaders of the people about it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 Though it was without doubt a very good work, and being king, he had
 the authority to command the doing of it, yet he chose rather to do it 
 by consultation, 

 (1.) That he might show respect to the great men of the kingdom and put
 honour upon them. Though they made him king, yet he would not rule with 
 a high hand. He did not say, "We will and command, and it is our royal 
 pleasure, that you do so and so; and we will be obeyed," but, "<I>If it 
 seem good to you,</I> and you think that the motion comes from the Lord 
 our God, let us send out orders for this purpose." No prince that is 
 wise will covet to be absolute. The people's allegiance is best secured 
 by taking their concurrence in their representatives. Happy then art 
 thou, O Britain!

 (2.). That he might be advised by them in the manner of doing it,
 whether just now, whether publicly. David was a very intelligent man 
 himself, and yet consulted with his captains; <I>for in the multitude 
 of counsellors there is safety.</I> It is wisdom to make use of the 
 wisdom of others.

 (3.) That, they joining in it, it might pass the better for a national
 act and so might procure a national blessing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he would have all the people summoned to attend on this 
 occasion, both for the honour of the ark and for the people's 
 satisfaction and edification, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) He calls the common people <I>brethren,</I> which bespeaks his
 humility and condescension (notwithstanding his advancement), and the 
 tender concern he had for them. Thus our Lord Jesus is not ashamed to 
 call his people brethren, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:11">Heb. ii. 11</A>.

 (2.) He speaks of the people as a remnant that had escaped: <I>Our
 brethren that are left in all the land of Israel.</I> They had been 
 under scattering providences. Their wars with the Philistines, and with 
 the house of Saul, had wasted the country and cut off many. We now hope 
 to see an end of these troubles. Let those that are left be quickened 
 by late judgments, and present mercies, to seek unto God.

 (3.) He takes care that the priests and Levites especially should be
 summoned to attend the ark; for it was their province in a particular 
 manner. Thus Christian magistrates should stir up ministers to do their 
 duty when they see them remiss.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That all this is upon supposition that it is <I>of the Lord their 
 God.</I> "Though it should <I>seem good to you</I> and me, yet if it be 
 not <I>of the Lord our God,</I> we will not do it." What ever we 
 undertake, this must be our enquiry, "Is it of the Lord? Is it 
 agreeable to his mind? Can we approve ourselves to him in it? May we 
 expect that he will own us?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That thus it was requisite they should amend what has been amiss in 
 the last reign, and, as it were, atone for their neglect: "For <I>we 
 enquired not at it in the days of Saul,</I> and this was the reason why 
 things went so ill with us: let that original error be amended, and 
 then we may hope to see our affairs in a better posture." Observe, 
 David makes no peevish reflections upon Saul. He does not say, "Saul 
 never cared for the ark, at least in the latter end of this reign;" 
 but, in general, <I>We enquired not at it,</I> making himself with 
 others guilty of this neglect. It better becomes us to judge ourselves 
 than others. Humble good men lament their own share in national guilt, 
 and take shame to themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:5-19">Dan. ix. 5</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The people's ready agreement to this proposal 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The thing</I> was <I>right in the eyes of all the people.</I> Nobody
 could say to the contrary, but that it was a very good work and very 
 seasonable; so that it was resolved, <I>nemine 
 contradicente</I>--<I>unanimously,</I> that they would do so. Those 
 that prudently proposed a good work, and lead in it, will perhaps find 
 a more ready concurrence in it than they expected. Great men know not 
 what a great deal of good they are capable of doing by their influence 
 on others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The solemnity of bringing up the ark, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:5-8"><I>v.</I> 5</A>,

 &c., which we read
 before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:1-3">2 Sam. vi. 1</A>,

 &c. Here therefore we shall only observe, 

 1. That it is worth while to travel far to attend the ark of God. They
 came out of all parts of the country, from the <I>river of Egypt,</I> 
 the utmost part south, to the entering of Hemath, which lay furthest 
 north,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 to grace this solemnity. 

 2. That we have reason greatly to rejoice in the revival of neglected
 ordinances and the return of the tokens of God's presence. When the 
 light of religion shines out of obscurity, when it is openly and freely 
 professed, is brought into reputation, and countenanced by princes and 
 great ones, it is such a happy omen to a people as is worthy to be 
 welcomed with all possible expressions of joy. 

 3. When, after long disuse, ordinances come to be revived, it is too
 common for even wise and good men to make some mistakes. Who would have 
 thought that David would commit such an error as this, to carry the ark 
 upon a cart? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Because the Philistines so carried it, and a special providence drove
 the cart

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:12">1 Sam. vi. 12</A>),

 he thought they might do so too. But we must walk by rule, not by
 example when it varies from the rule, no, not even by those examples 
 which Providence has owned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza
 put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.
 &nbsp; 10  And the anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was kindled against Uzza, and he
 smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died
 before God.
 &nbsp; 11  And David was displeased, because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had made a breach
 upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.
 &nbsp; 12  And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I
 bring the ark of God <I>home</I> to me?
 &nbsp; 13  So David brought not the ark <I>home</I> to himself to the city
 of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the
 Gittite.
 &nbsp; 14  And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in
 his house three months. And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> blessed the house of
 Obed-edom, and all that he had.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This breach upon Uzza, which caused all the joy to cease, we had an 
 account of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:6-8">2 Sam. vi. 6</A>,

 &c.

 1. Let the sin of Uzza warn us all to take heed of presumption,
 rashness, and irreverence, in dealing about holy things 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 and not to think that a good intention will justify a bad action. In
 our communion with God we must carefully watch over our own hearts, 
 lest familiarity breed contempt, and we think God is in any way 
 beholden to us. 

 2. Let the punishment of Uzza convince us that the God with whom we
 have to do is a jealous God. His death, like that of Nadab and Abihu, 
 proclaims aloud that God will be <I>sanctified in those that come nigh 
 unto him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:3">Lev. x. 3</A>),

 and that the nearer any are to him the more displeased he is with their
 presumptions.  Let us not dare to trifle with God in our approaches to 
 him; and yet let us, through Christ, <I>come boldly to the throne of 
 grace;</I> for we are under the dispensation of liberty and grace, not 
 of bondage and terror.  

 3. Let the damp this gave to the joy of Israel be a memorandum to us
 always to rejoice with trembling, and to <I>serve the Lord with 
 fear,</I> even when we <I>serve him with gladness.</I> 

 4.  Let David's displeasure upon this occasion caution us to take heed
 to our spirits when we are under divine rebukes, lest, instead of 
 submitting to God, we quarrel with him. If God be angry with us, shall 
 we dare to be angry with him? 

 5.  Let the stop thus put to the solemnity caution us not to be driven
 off from our duty by those providences which are only intended to drive 
 us from our sins. David should have gone on with the work 
 notwithstanding the breach made upon Uzza; so might the breach have 
 been made up. 

 6.  Let the blessing which the ark brought with it to the house of 
 Obed-edom encourage us to welcome God's ordinances into our houses, as 
 those that believe the ark is a guest that nobody shall lose by; not 
 let it be less precious to us for its being to some a stone of 
 stumbling and a rock of offence. If the gospel be to some a savour of 
 death unto death, as the ark was to Uzza, yet let us receive it in the 
 love of it and it will be to us a saviour of life unto life.</P>
