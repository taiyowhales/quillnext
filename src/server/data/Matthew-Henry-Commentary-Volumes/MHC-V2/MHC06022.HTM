 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Many particular things we have read concerning the two tribes and a 
 half, though nothing separated them from the rest of the tribes except 
 the river Jordan, and this chapter is wholly concerning them. 

 I.  Joshua's dismission of the militia of those tribes from the camp of
 Israel, in which the had served as auxiliaries, during all the wars of 
 Canaan, and their return thereupon to their own country,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II.  The altar they built on the borders of Jordan, in token of their
 communion with the land of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:10">ver. 10</A>.

 III. The offence which the rest of the tribes took at this altar, and
 the message they sent thereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:11-20">ver. 11-20</A>.

 IV. The apology which the two tribes and a half made for what they had
 done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:21-29">ver. 21-29</A>.

 V. The satisfaction which their apology gave to the rest of the tribes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:30-34">ver.  30-34</A>.

 And (which is strange), whereas in most differences that happen there
 is a fault on both sides, on this there was fault on no side; none (for 
 aught that appears) were to be blamed, but all to be praised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the
 half tribe of Manasseh,
 &nbsp; 2 And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I
 commanded you:
 &nbsp; 3 Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day,
 but have kept the charge of the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 &nbsp; 4 And now the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God hath given rest unto your brethren,
 as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto
 your tents, <I>and</I> unto the land of your possession, which Moses
 the servant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> gave you on the other side Jordan.
 &nbsp; 5 But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law,
 which Moses the servant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> charged you, to love the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his
 commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all
 your heart and with all your soul.
 &nbsp; 6 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went
 unto their tents.
 &nbsp; 7 Now to the <I>one</I> half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had
 given <I>possession</I> in Bashan: but unto the <I>other</I> half thereof
 gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward.
 And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he
 blessed them,
 &nbsp; 8 And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto
 your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with
 gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment:
 divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
 &nbsp; 9 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
 half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children
 of Israel out of Shiloh, which <I>is</I> in the land of Canaan, to go
 unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession,
 whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by
 the hand of Moses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The war being ended, and ended gloriously, Joshua, as a prudent 
 general, disbands his army, who never designed to make war their trade, 
 and sends them home, to enjoy what they had conquered, and to beat 
 their swords into plough-shares and their spears into pruning-hooks; 
 and particularly the forces of these separate tribes, who had received 
 their inheritance on the other side Jordan from Moses upon this 
 condition, that their men of war should assist the other tribes in the 
 conquest of Canaan, which they promised to do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:32">Num. xxxii. 32</A>),

 and renewed the promise to Joshua at the opening of the campaign,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:16">Josh. i. 16</A>.

 And, now that they had performed their bargain, Joshua publicly and
 solemnly in Shiloh gives them their discharge. Whether this was done,
 as it was placed, not till after the land was divided, as some think,
 or whether after the war was ended, and before the division was made,
 as others think (because there was no need of their assistance in
 dividing the land, but only in conquering it, nor were there any of
 their tribes employed as commissioners in that affair, but only of the
 other ten,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+34:18-28">Num. xxxiv. 18</A>,

 &c.), this is certain, it was not done till after Shiloh
 was made the head-quarters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and the land was begun to be divided before they removed from Gilgal,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+14:6"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is probable that this army of Reubenites and Gadites, which had led 
 the van in all the wars of Canaan, had sometimes, in the intervals of 
 action, and when the rest of the army retired into winter-quarters, 
 some of them at least, made a step over Jordan, for it was not far, to 
 visit their families, and to look after their private affairs, and 
 perhaps tarried at home, and sent others in their room more 
 serviceable; but still these two tribes and a half had their quota of 
 troops ready, 40,000 in all, which, whenever there was occasion, 
 presented themselves at their respective posts, and now attended in a 
 body to receive their discharge. Though their affection to their 
 families, and concern for their affairs, could not but make them, after 
 so long an absence, very desirous to return, yet, like good soldiers, 
 they would not move till they had orders from their general. So, though 
 our heavenly Father's house above be ever so desirable (it is bishop 
 Hall's allusion), yet must we stay on earth till our warfare be 
 accomplished, wait for a due discharge, and not anticipate the time of 
 our removal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Joshua dismisses them to the <I>land of their possession,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 Those that were first in the assignment of their lot were last in the
 enjoyment of it; they got the start of their brethren in title, but 
 their brethren were before them in full possession; so <I>the last 
 shall be first, and the first last,</I> that there may be something of 
 equality.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He dismisses them with their pay; for who goes a warfare at his own 
 charge? <I>Return with much riches unto your tents,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Though all the land they had helped to conquer was to go to the other
 tribes, yet they should have their share of the plunder, and had so, 
 and this was all the pay that any of the soldiers expected; for the 
 wars of Canaan bore their own charges. "Go," says Joshua, "go home to 
 your tents," that is, "your houses," which he calls <I>tents,</I> 
 because they had been so much used to tents in the wilderness; and 
 indeed the strongest and stateliest houses in this world are to be 
 looked upon but as tents, mean and movable in comparison with our house 
 above. "Go home <I>with much riches,</I> not only cattle, the spoil of 
 the country, but silver and gold, the plunder of the cities, and,"

 1. "Let your brethren whom you leave behind have your good word, who 
 have allowed you your share in full, though the land is entirely 
 theirs, and have not offered to make any drawback. Do not say that you 
 are losers by us." 

 2. "Let your brethren whom you go to, who abode by the stuff, have some 
 share of the spoil: <I>Divide the spoil with your brethren,</I> as that 
 was divided which was taken in the war with Midian, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:27">Num. xxxi. 27</A>.

 Let your brethren that have wanted you all this while be the better for
 you when you come home."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He dismisses them with a very honourable character. Though their 
 service was a due debt, and the performance of a promise, and they had 
 done no more than was their duty to do, yet he highly commends them; 
 not only gives them up their bonds, as it were, now that they had 
 fulfilled the condition, but applauds their good services. Though it 
 was by the favour of God and his power that Israel got possession of 
 this land, and he must have all the glory, yet Joshua thought there was 
 a thankful acknowledgment due to their brethren who assisted them, and 
 whose sword and bow were employed for them. God must be chiefly eyed in 
 our praises, yet instruments must not be altogether overlooked. He here 
 commends them, 

 1. For the readiness of their obedience to their commanders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 When Moses was gone, they remembered and observed the charge he had 
 given them; and all the orders which Joshua, as general of the forces, 
 had issued out, they had carefully obeyed, went, and came, and did, as 
 he appointed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:9">Matt. viii. 9</A>.

 It is as much as any thing the soldier's praise to observe the word of
 command. 

 2. For the constancy of their affection and adherence to their 
 brethren: <I>You have not left them these many days.</I> How many days 
 he does not say, nor can we gather it with certainty from any other 
 place. Calvisius and others of the best chronologers compute that the 
 conquering and dividing of the land was the work of about six or seven 
 years, and so long these separate tribes attended their camp, and did 
 them the best service they could. Note, It will be the honour of those 
 that have espoused the cause of God's Israel, and twisted interests 
 with them, to adhere to them, and never to leave them till God has 
 given them rest, and then they shall rest with them. 

 3. For the faithfulness of their obedience to the divine law. They had 
 not only done their duty to Joshua and Israel, but, which was best of 
 all, they had made conscience of their duty to God: <I>You have kept 
 the charge,</I> or, as the word is, <I>You have kept the keeping,</I> 
 that is, "You have carefully and circumspectly kept the <I>commandment 
 of the Lord your God,</I> not only in this particular instance of 
 continuing in the service of Israel to the end of the war, but, in 
 general, you have kept up religion in your part of the camp, a rare and 
 excellent thing among soldiers, and where it is worthy to be 
 praised."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He dismisses them with good counsel, not to cultivate their ground, 
 fortify their cities, and, now that their hands were inured to war and 
 victory, to invade their neighbours, and so enlarge their own 
 territories, but to keep up serious godliness among them in the power 
 of it. They were not political but pious instructions that he gave 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 1. In general, to <I>take diligent heed to do the commandment and the 
 law.</I> Those that have the commandment have it in vain unless they 
 <I>do</I> the commandment; and it will not be done aright (so apt are 
 we to turn aside, and so industrious are our spiritual enemies to turn 
 us aside) unless we take heed, diligent heed.  

 2. In particular, to <I>love the Lord our God,</I> as the best of 
 beings, and the best of friends; and as far as this principle rules in 
 the heart, and is the spring of its pulses, there will be a constant 
 care and sincere endeavour to <I>walk in his ways,</I> in all his ways, 
 even those that are narrow and up-hill, in every particular instance, 
 in all manner of conversation to <I>keep his commandments,</I> at all 
 times and in all conditions with purpose of heart to <I>cleave unto 
 him,</I> and to serve him and his honour, and the interest of his 
 kingdom among men, <I>with all our heart and with all our soul.</I> 
 What good counsel was here given to them is given to us all. God give 
 us grace to take it!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He dismisses them with a blessing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 particularly the half tribe of Manasseh, to which Joshua, as an 
 Ephraimite, was somewhat nearer akin than to the other two, and who 
 perhaps were the more loth to depart because they left one half of 
 their own tribe behind them, and therefore, bidding often farewell, and 
 lingering behind, had a second dismission and blessing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Joshua not only prayed for them as a friend, but blessed them as a
 father in the name of the Lord, recommending them, their families, and 
 affairs, to the grace of God.  Some by the blessing Joshua gave them 
 understand the presents he made them, in recompence of their services; 
 but Joshua being a prophet, and having given them one part of a 
 prophet's reward in the instructions he gave them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 no doubt we must understand this of the other, even the prayers he made 
 for them, as one having authority, and as God's vicegerent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Being thus dismissed, they returned to <I>the land of their 
 possession</I> in a body 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 ferry-boats being, it is likely, provided for their repassing Jordan. 
 Though masters of families may sometimes have occasion to be absent, 
 long absent, from their families, yet, when their business abroad is 
 finished, they must remember home is their place, from which they ought 
 not to wander as a bird from her nest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that <I>are</I> in
 the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of
 Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by
 Jordan, a great altar to see to.
 &nbsp; 11 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children
 of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh
 have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the
 borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 12 And when the children of Israel heard <I>of it,</I> the whole
 congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves
 together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.
 &nbsp; 13 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben,
 and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh,
 into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,
 &nbsp; 14 And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince
 throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one <I>was</I> a head
 of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.
 &nbsp; 15 And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the
 children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land
 of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,
 &nbsp; 16 Thus saith the whole congregation of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, What trespass
 <I>is</I> this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to
 turn away this day from following the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, in that ye have
 builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>?
 &nbsp; 17 <I>Is</I> the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we
 are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in
 the congregation of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 &nbsp; 18 But that ye must turn away this day from following the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>?
 and it will be, <I>seeing</I> ye rebel to day against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that
 to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.
 &nbsp; 19 Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession <I>be</I>
 unclean, <I>then</I> pass ye over unto the land of the possession of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, wherein the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s tabernacle dwelleth, and take
 possession among us: but rebel not against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, nor rebel
 against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 our God.
 &nbsp; 20 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the
 accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel?
 and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The pious care of the separated tribes to keep their hold of 
 Canaan's religion, even when they were leaving Canaan's land, that they 
 might not be as the <I>sons of the stranger, utterly separated from 
 God's people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:3">Isa. lvi. 3</A>.

 In order to this, they built a great altar on the borders of Jordan, to 
 be a witness for them that they were Israelites, and as such 
 <I>partakers of the altar of</I> the Lord,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:18">1 Cor. x. 18</A>.

 When they came to Jordan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 they did not consult how to preserve the remembrance of their own 
 exploits in the wars of Canaan, and the services they had done their 
 brethren, by erecting a monument to the immortal honour of the two 
 tribes and a half; but their relation to the church of God, together 
 with their interest in the communion of saints, is that which they are 
 solicitous to preserve and perpetuate the proofs and evidences of; and 
 therefore without delay, when the thing was first proposed by some 
 among them, who, though glad to think that they were going towards 
 home, were sorry to think that they were going from the altar of God, 
 immediately they erected this altar, which served as a bridge to keep 
 up their fellowship with the other tribes in the things of God. Some 
 think they built this altar on the Canaan-side of Jordan, in the lot of 
 Benjamin, that, looking over the river, they might see the figure of 
 the altar at Shiloh, when they could not conveniently go to it; but it 
 is more likely that they built it on their own side of the water, for 
 what had they to do to build on another man's land without his consent? 
 And it is said to be <I>over-against</I> the land of Canaan; nor would 
 there have been any cause of suspecting it designed for sacrifice if 
 they had not built it among themselves. This altar was very innocently 
 and honestly designed, but it would have been well if, since it had in 
 it an appearance of evil, and might be an occasion of offence to their 
 brethren, they had consulted the oracle of God about it before they did 
 it, or at least acquainted their brethren with their purpose, and given 
 them the same explication of their altar before, to prevent their 
 jealousy, which they did afterwards, to remove it. Their zeal was 
 commendable, but it ought to have been guided with discretion. There 
 was no need to hasten the building of an altar for the purpose for 
 which they intended this, but they might have taken time to consider 
 and take advice; yet, when their sincerity was made to appear, we do 
 not find that they were blamed for their rashness. God does, and men 
 should, overlook the weakness of an honest zeal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The holy jealousy of the other tribes for the honour of God and his 
 altar at Shiloh. Notice was immediately brought to the princes of 
 Israel of the setting up of this altar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 And they, knowing how strict and severe that law was which required
 them to offer all their sacrifices in the place which God should 
 choose, and not elsewhere

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:5-7">Deut. xii. 5-7</A>),

 were soon apprehensive that the setting up of another altar was an
 affront to the choice which God had lately made of a place to put his 
 name in, and had a direct tendency to the worship of some other God. 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their suspicion was very excusable, for it must be confessed the 
 thing, <I>prima facie--at first sight,</I> looked ill, and seemed to
 imply a design to set up and maintain a competitor with the altar at 
 Shiloh. It was no strained <I>innuendo</I> from the building of an 
 altar to infer an intention to offer sacrifice upon it, and that might 
 introduce idolatry and end in a total apostasy from the faith and 
 worship of the God of Israel. So great a matter might this fire kindle. 
 God is jealous for his own institutions, and therefore we should be so 
 too, and afraid of every thing that looks like, or leads to, 
 idolatry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their zeal, upon this suspicion, was very commendable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 When they apprehended that these tribes, which by the river Jordan were 
 separated from them, were separating themselves from God, they took it 
 as the greatest injury that could be done to themselves, and showed a 
 readiness, if it were necessary, to put their lives in their hands in 
 defence of the altar of God, and to take up arms for the chastising and 
 reducing of these rebels, and to prevent the spreading of the 
 infection, if no gentler methods would serve, by cutting off from their 
 body the gangrened member. They all gathered together, and Shiloh was 
 the place of their rendezvous, because it was in defence of the divine 
 charter lately granted to that place that they now appeared; their 
 resolution was as became a kingdom of priests, who, being devoted to 
 God and his service, did not <I>acknowledge their brethren</I> nor 
 <I>know their own children,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:9">Deut. xxxiii. 9</A>.

 They would immediately <I>go up to war against them</I> if it appeared
 they had revolted from God, and were in rebellion against him. Though 
 they were <I>bone of their bone,</I> had been <I>companions with them 
 in tribulation</I> in the wilderness, and serviceable to them in the 
 wars of Canaan, yet, if they turn to <I>serve other gods,</I> they will 
 treat them as enemies, not as sons of Israel, but as <I>children of 
 whoredoms,</I> for so God had appointed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:12-18">Deut. xiii. 12</A>,

 &c. They had but lately sheathed their swords,
 and retired from the perils and fatigues of war to the rest God had 
 given them, and yet they are willing to begin a new war rather than be 
 any way wanting in their duty to restrain, repress, and revenge, 
 idolatry, and every step towards it--a brave resolution, and which shows
 them hearty for their religion, and, we hope, careful and diligent in 
 the practice of it themselves. Corruptions in religion are best dealt 
 with at first, before they get head and plead prescription.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Their prudence in the prosecution of this zealous resolution is no 
 less commendable. God had appointed them, in cases of this nature, to 
 <I>enquire and make search</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:14">Deut. xiii. 14</A>),

 that they might not wrong their brethren under pretence of righting
 their religion; accordingly they resolve here not to send forth their 
 armies, to wage war, till they had first sent their ambassadors to 
 enquire into the merits of the cause, and these men of the first rank, 
 one out of each tribe, and Phinehas at the head of them to be their 
 spokesman, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Thus was their zeal for God tempered, guided, and governed by the
 <I>meekness of wisdom.</I> He that knows all things, and hates all evil 
 things, would not punish the worst of criminals but he would first 
 <I>go down and see,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:21">Gen. xviii. 21</A>.

 Many an unhappy strife would be prevented, or soon healed by an
 impartial and favourable enquiry into that which is the matter of the 
 offence. The rectifying of mistakes and misunderstandings, and the 
 setting of misconstrued words and actions in a true light, would be the 
 most effectual way to accommodate both private and public quarrels, and 
 bring them to a happy period.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The ambassadors' management of this matter came fully up to the 
 sense and spirit of the congregation concerning it, and bespeaks much 
 both of zeal and prudence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The charge they draw up against their brethren is indeed very 
 high, and admits no other excuse than that it was in their zeal for the 
 honour of God, and was now intended to justify the resentments of the 
 congregation at Shiloh and to awaken the supposed delinquents to clear 
 themselves, otherwise they might have suspended their judgment, or 
 mollified it at least, and not have taken it for granted, as they do 
 here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 that the building of this altar was <I>a trespass against the God of 
 Israel,</I> and a trespass no less heinous than the revolt of soldiers 
 from their captain (<I>you turn from following the Lord</I>), and the
 rebellion of subjects against their sovereign: <I>that you might rebel 
 this day against the Lord.</I> Hard words. It is well they were not 
 able to make good their charge. Let not innocency think it strange to 
 be thus misrepresented and accused. <I>They laid to my charge things 
 that I knew not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The aggravation of the crime charged upon their brethren is 
 somewhat far-fetched: Is <I>the iniquity of Peor too little for us?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Probably that is mentioned because Phinehas, the first commissioner in
 this treaty, had signalized himself in that matter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:7">Num. xxv. 7</A>),

 and because we may suppose they were not about the very place in which 
 that iniquity was committed on the other side Jordan. It is good to 
 recollect and improve those instances of the wrath of God, revealed 
 from heaven <I>against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men,</I> 
 which have fallen out in our own time, and which we ourselves have been 
 eye-witnesses of. He reminds them of the iniquity of Peor,

 [1.] As a very great sin, and very provoking to God. The building of
 this altar seemed but a small matter, but it might lead to an iniquity 
 as bad as that of Peor, and therefore must be crushed in its first 
 rise. Note, The remembrance of great sins committed formerly should 
 engage us to stand upon our guard against the least occasions and 
 beginnings of sin; for the way of sin is down-hill. 

 [2.] As a sin that the whole congregation had smarted for: "<I>There 
 was a plague in the congregation of the Lord,</I> of which, in one day, 
 there died no fewer than 24,000; was not that enough for ever to warn 
 you against idolatry?  What! will you bring upon yourselves another 
 plague? Are you so mad upon an idolatrous altar that you will run 
 yourselves thus upon the sword's point of God's judgments? Does not our 
 camp still feel from that sin and the punishment of it? We <I>are not 
 cleansed from it unto this day;</I> there are remaining sparks," 
 <I>First,</I> "Of the infection of that sin; some among us so inclined 
 to idolatry that if you set up another altar they will soon take 
 occasion from that, whether you intend it or no, to worship another 
 God." <I>Secondly,</I> "Of the wrath of God against us for that sin. We 
 have reason to fear that, if we provoke God by another sin <I>to 
 visit,</I> he will remember against us the iniquity of Peor, as he 
 threatened to do that of the golden calf,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:34">
 Exod. xxxii. 34</A>.

 And dare you wake the sleeping lion of divine vengeance?" Note, It is a
 foolish and dangerous thing for people to think their former sins 
 little, <I>too little for them,</I> as those do who add sin to sin, and 
 so <I>treasure up wrath against the day of wrath.</I> Let therefore the 
 time past suffice,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:3">1 Pet. iv. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The reason they give for their concerning themselves so warmly in 
 this matter is very sufficient. They were obliged to it, in their own 
 necessary defence, by the law of self-preservation: "For, if you revolt 
 from God to-day, who knows but to-morrow his judgments may break in 
 upon the <I>whole congregation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 as in the case of Achan? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:20"><I>v.</I>  20</A>.

 He sinned, and we all smarted for it, by which we should receive
 instruction, and from what God did then infer what he may do, and fear 
 what he will do, if we do not witness against your sin, who are so 
 many, and punish it." Note, The conservators of the public peace are 
 obliged, in justice to the common safety, to use their power for the 
 restraining and suppressing of vice and profaneness, lest, if it be 
 connived at, the sin thereby become national, and bring God's judgments 
 upon the community. Nay, we are all concerned to reprove our neighbour 
 when he does amiss, lest we bear sin for him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:17">Lev. xix. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The offer they make is very fair and kind
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 that if they thought the land of their possession unclean, for want of 
 an altar, and therefore could not be easy without one, rather than they 
 should set up another in competition with that at Shiloh they should be 
 welcome to come back to the land <I>where the Lord's tabernacle 
 was,</I> and settle there, and they would very willingly straiten 
 themselves to make room for them. By this they showed a sincere and 
 truly pious zeal against schism, that rather than their brethren should 
 have any occasion to set up a separate altar, though their pretence for 
 it, as here supposed, was very weak and grounded upon a great mistake, 
 yet they were willing to part with a considerable share of the land 
 which God himself had by the lot assigned them, to comprehend them and 
 take them in among them. This was the spirit of Israelites indeed.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
 half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the
 thousands of Israel,
 &nbsp; 22 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of gods, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of gods, he knoweth, and
 Israel he shall know; if <I>it be</I> in rebellion, or if in
 transgression against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, (save us not this day,)
 &nbsp; 23 That we have built us an altar to turn from following the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or
 if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> himself require
 <I>it;</I>
 &nbsp; 24 And if we have not <I>rather</I> done it for fear of <I>this</I>
 thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our
 children, saying, What have ye to do with the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel?
 &nbsp; 25 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath made Jordan a border between us and you,
 ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the

 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:

 our generations after us, that we might do the service of the

 sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may
 not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the

 say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say

 fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it
 <I>is</I> a witness between us and you.
 &nbsp; 29 God forbid that we should rebel against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and turn
 this day from following the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to build an altar for burnt
 offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the
 altar of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God that <I>is</I> before his tabernacle.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may suppose there was a general convention called of the princes and 
 great men of the separate tribes, to give audience to these 
 ambassadors; or perhaps the army, as it came home, was still encamped 
 in a body, and not yet dispersed; however it was, there were enough to 
 represent the two tribes and a half, and to give their sense. Their 
 reply to the warm remonstrance of the ten tribes is very fair and 
 ingenuous. They do not retort their charge, upbraid them with the 
 injustice and unkindness of their threatenings, nor reproach them for 
 their rash and hasty censures, but give them a soft answer which turns 
 away wrath, avoiding all those <I>grievous words which stir up 
 anger;</I> they demur not to their jurisdiction, nor plead that they 
 were not account able to them for what they had done, nor bid them mind 
 their own business, but, by a free and open declaration of their 
 sincere intention in what they did, free themselves from the imputation 
 they were under, and set themselves right in the opinion of their 
 brethren, to do which they only needed to state the case and put the 
 matter in a true light.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They solemnly protest against any design to use this altar for 
 sacrifice or offering, and therefore were far from setting it up in 
 competition with the altar at Shiloh, or from entertaining the least 
 thought of deserting that. They had indeed set up that which had the 
 shape and fashion of an altar, but they had not dedicated it to a 
 religious use, had had no solemnity of its consecration, and therefore 
 ought not to be charged with a design to put it to any such use. To 
 gain credit to this protestation here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A solemn appeal to God concerning it, with which they begin their 
 defence, intending thereby to give glory to God first, and then to give 
 satisfaction to their brethren, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 (1.) A profound awe and reverence of God are expressed in the form of 
 their appeal: <I>The Lord God of gods, the Lord God of gods, he 
 knows.</I> Or, as it might be read somewhat closer to the original, 
 <I>The God of gods, Jehovah, the God of gods, Jehovah, he knows,</I> 
 which bespeaks his self-existence and self-sufficiency; he is Jehovah, 
 and has sovereignty and supremacy over all beings and powers 
 whatsoever, even those that are called <I>gods,</I> or that are 
 worshipped. This brief confession of their faith would help to obviate 
 and remove their brethren's suspicion of them, as if they intended to 
 desert the God of Israel, and worship other gods: how could those 
 entertain such a thought who believed him to be God over all? Let us 
 learn hence always to speak of God with reverence and seriousness, and 
 to mention his name with a solemn pause.  Those who make their appeals 
 to heaven with a slight, careless, "God knows," have reason to fear 
 lest they take his name in vain, for it is very unlike this appeal. 
 
 (2.) It is a great confidence of their own integrity which they express 
 in the matter of their appeal. They refer the controversy to the God of 
 gods, whose judgment, we are sure, is <I>according to truth,</I> such 
 as the guilty have reason to dread and the upright to rejoice in. 
 "<I>If</I> it be <I>in rebellion or transgression</I> that we have 
 built this altar, to confront the altar of the Lord at Shiloh, to make 
 a party, or to set up any new gods or worships,"

 [1.] "<I>He knows it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 for he is perfectly acquainted with the thoughts and intents of the 
 heart, and particularly with all inclinations to idolatry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:20,21">Ps. xliv. 20,  21</A>);

 this is in a particular manner before him. We believe he knows it, and 
 we cannot by any arts conceal it from him."

 [2.] "<I>Let him require it,</I> as we know he will, for he is a 
 jealous God." Nothing but a clear conscience would have thus imprecated 
 divine justice to avenge the rebellion if there had been any. Note, 
 <I>First,</I> In every thing we do in religion, it highly concerns us 
 to approve ourselves to God in our integrity therein, remembering that 
 he knows the heart.  <I>Secondly,</I> When we fall under the censures 
 of men, it is very comfortable to be able with a humble confidence to 
 appeal to God concerning our sincerity. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:3,4">1 Cor. iv. 3, 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A sober apology presented to their brethren: <I>Israel, he shall 
 know.</I> Though the record on high, and the witness in our bosoms, are 
 principally to be made sure for us, yet there is a satisfaction besides 
 which we owe to our brethren who doubt concerning our integrity, and 
 which we should be ready to give with meekness and fear. If our
 sincerity be known to God, we should study likewise to let others know 
 it by its fruits, especially those who, though they mistake us, yet 
 show a zeal for the glory of God, as the ten tribes here did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. A serious abjuration or renunciation of the design which they were 
 suspected to be guilty of. With this they conclude their defence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:29"><I>v.</I>  29</A>):

 "<I>God forbid that we should rebel against the Lord,</I> as we own we 
 should if we had set up this altar for burnt-offerings; no, we abhor 
 the thought of it. We have as great a value and veneration for the 
 altar of the Lord at Shiloh as any of the tribes of Israel have, and 
 are as firmly resolved to adhere to it and constantly to attend it; we 
 have the same concern that you have for the purity of God's worship and 
 the unity of his church; far be it, far be it from us, to think of 
 turning away from following God."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They fully explain their true intent and meaning in building this 
 altar; and we have all the reason in the world to believe that it is a 
 true representation of their design, and not advanced now to palliate 
 it afterwards, as we have reason to think that these same persons meant 
 very honestly when they petitioned to have their lot on that side 
 Jordan, though then also is was their unhappiness to be misunderstood 
 even by Moses himself. In their vindication, they make it out that the 
 building of this altar was so far from being a step towards a 
 separation from their brethren, and from the altar of the Lord at 
 Shiloh, that, on the contrary, it was really designed for a pledge and 
 preservative of their communion with their brethren and with the altar 
 of God, and a token of their resolution to <I>do the service of the 
 Lord before him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),
 
 and to continue to do so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They gave an account of the fears they had lest, in process of time, 
 their posterity, being seated at such a distance from the tabernacle, 
 should be looked upon and treated as strangers to the commonwealth of 
 Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 it was for fear of this thing, and the word signifies a great 
 perplexity and solicitude of mind which they were in, until they eased 
 themselves by this expedient. As they were returning home (and we may 
 suppose it was not thought of before, else they would have made Joshua 
 acquainted with their purpose), some of them in discourse started this 
 matter, and the rest took the hint, and represented to themselves and 
 one another a very melancholy prospect of what might probably happen in 
 after-ages, that their children would be looked upon by the other 
 tribes as having no interest in the altar of God and the sacrifices 
 there offered. Now indeed they were owned as brethren, and were as 
 welcome at the tabernacle as any other of the tribes; but what if their 
 children after them should be disowned? They, by reason of their 
 distance, and the interposition of Jordan, which it was not easy at all 
 times to pass and repass, could not be so numerous and constant in 
 their attendance on the three yearly feasts as the other tribes, to 
 make a continual claim to the privileges of Israelites, and would 
 therefore be looked upon as inconsiderable members of their church, and 
 by degrees would be rejected as not members of it at all: <I>So shall 
 your children</I> (who in their pride will be apt to monopolize the 
 privileges of the altar) <I>make our children</I> (who perhaps will not 
 be so careful as they ought to be to keep hold of those privileges) 
 <I>cease from fearing the Lord.</I> Note, 

 (1.) Those that are cut off from public ordinances are likely to lose 
 all religion, and will by degrees cease from fearing the Lord. Though 
 the form and profession of godliness are kept up by many without the 
 life and power of it, yet the life and power of it will not long be 
 kept up without the form and profession.  You take away grace if you 
 take away the means of grace.  

 (2.) Those who have themselves found the comfort and benefit of God's 
 ordinances cannot but desire to preserve and perpetuate the entail of 
 them upon their seed, and use all possible precautions that their 
 children after them may not be <I>made to cease from following the 
 Lord,</I> or be looked upon as having no part in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The project they had to prevent this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:26-28"><I>v.</I> 26-28</A>.

 "Therefore, to secure an interest in the altar of God to those who
 shall come after us, and to prove their title to it, <I>we said, Let us 
 build an altar, to be a witness between us and you,</I>" that, having 
 this copy of the altar in their custody, it might be produced as an 
 evidence of their right to the privilege of the original. Every one 
 that saw this altar, and observed that it was never used for sacrifice 
 and offering, would enquire what was the meaning of it, and this answer 
 would be given to that enquiry, that it was built by those separate 
 tribes, in token of their communion with their brethren and their 
 joint-interest with them in the altar of the Lord. Christ is the great 
 altar that sanctifies every gift; the best evidence of our interest in 
 him will be the pattern of his Spirit in our hearts, and our conformity 
 to him. If we can produce this it will be a testimony for us that we 
 have <I>a part in the Lord,</I> and an earnest of our perseverance in 
 following him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>30 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the
 congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which <I>were</I>
 with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the
 children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased
 them.
 &nbsp; 31 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the
 children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the
 children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I>
 among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the

 &nbsp; 32 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
 returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of
 Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the
 children of Israel, and brought them word again.
 &nbsp; 33 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the
 children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up
 against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children
 of Reuben and Gad dwelt.
 &nbsp; 34 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called
 the altar <I>Ed:</I> for it <I>shall be</I> a witness between us that the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the good issue of this controversy, which, if there had 
 not been on both sides a disposition to peace, as there was on both 
 sides a zeal for God, might have been of ill consequence; for quarrels 
 about religion, for want of wisdom and love, often prove the most 
 fierce and most difficult to be accommodated. But these contending 
 parties, when the matter was fairly stated and argued, were so happy as 
 to understand one another very well, and so the difference was 
 presently compromised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The ambassadors were exceedingly pleased when the separate tribes 
 had given in a protestation of the innocency of their intentions in 
 building this altar. 

 1. The ambassadors did not call in question their sincerity in that 
 protestation, did not say, "You tell us you design it not for sacrifice 
 and offering, but who can believe you? What security will you give us 
 that it shall never be so used?" No. <I>Charity believes all things, 
 hopes all things,</I> believes and hopes the best, and is very loth to 
 give the lie to any. 

 2. They did not upbraid them with the rashness and unadvisedness of 
 this action, did not tell them, "If you would do such a thing, and with 
 this good intention, yet you might have had so much respect for Joshua 
 and Eleazar as to have advised with them, or at least have made them 
 acquainted with it, and so have saved the trouble and expense of this 
 embassy." But a little want of consideration and good manners should be 
 excused and overlooked in those who, we have reason to think, mean 
 honestly. 

 3. Much less did they go about to fish for evidence to make out their 
 charge, because they had once exhibited it, but were glad to have their 
 mistake rectified, and were not at all ashamed to own it.  Proud and 
 peevish spirits, when they have passed an unjust censure upon their 
 brethren, though ever so much convincing evidence be brought of the 
 injustice of it, will stand to it, and can by no means be persuaded to 
 retract it.  These ambassadors were not so prejudiced; their brethren's 
 vindication pleased them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 They looked upon their innocency as a token of God's presence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 especially when they found that what was done was so far from being an 
 indication of their growing cool to the altar of God that, one the 
 contrary, it was a fruit of their zealous affection to it: <I>You have 
 delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord,</I> that 
 is, "You have not, as we feared, delivered them into the hand of the 
 Lord, or exposed them to his judgments by the trespass we were jealous 
 of."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The congregation was abundantly satisfied when their ambassadors 
 reported to them their brethren's apology for what they had done. It 
 should seem they staid together, at least by their representatives, 
 until they heard the issue 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);

 and when they understood the truth of the matter it pleased them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 and they <I>blessed God.</I> Note, Our brethren's constancy in 
 religion, their zeal for the power of godliness, and their keeping the 
 <I>unity of the Spirit</I> in faith and love, notwithstanding the 
 jealousies conceived of them as breaking the unity of the church, are 
 things which we should be very glad to be satisfied of, and should make 
 the matter both of our rejoicing and of our thanksgiving; let God have 
 the glory of it, and let us take the comfort of it. Being thus 
 satisfied, they laid down their arms immediately, and were so far from 
 any thoughts of prosecuting the war they had been meditating against 
 their brethren that we may suppose them wishing for the next feast, 
 when they should meet them at Shiloh.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The separate tribes were gratified, and, since they had a mind to 
 preserve among them this pattern of the altar of God, though there was 
 not likely to be that occasion for it which they fancied, yet Joshua 
 and the princes let them have their humour, and did not give orders for 
 the demolishing of it, though there was as much reason to fear that it 
 might in process of time be an occasion of idolatry as there was to 
 hope that ever it might be a preservation from idolatry. Thus did 
 <I>the strong bear the infirmities of the weak.</I> Only care was taken 
 that they having explained the meaning of their altar, that it was
 intended for no more than a testimony of their communion with the altar 
 at Shiloh, this explanation should be recorded, which was done 
 according to the usage of those times by giving a name to it signifying
