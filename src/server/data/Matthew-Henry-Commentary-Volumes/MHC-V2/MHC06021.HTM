 It had been often said that the tribe of Levi should have "no 
 inheritance with their brethren," no particular part of the country 
 assigned them, as the other tribes had, no, not the country about 
 Shiloh, which one might have expected to be appropriated to them as the 
 lands of the church; but, though they were not thus cast into a country 
 by themselves, it appears, by the provision made for them in this 
 chapter, that they were no losers, but the rest of the tribes were very 
 much gainers, by their being dispersed. We have here, 

 I. The motion they made to have their cities assigned them, according
 to God's appointment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The nomination of the cities accordingly out of the several tribes,
 and the distribution of them to the respective families of this tribe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:3-8">ver. 3-8</A>.

 III. A catalogue of the cities, forty-eight in all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:9-42">ver. 9-42</A>.

 IV. A receipt entered in full of all that God had promised to his
 people Israel,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto
 Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the
 heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel;
 &nbsp; 2 And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan,
 saying, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities
 to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.
 &nbsp; 3 And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their
 inheritance, at the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, these cities and
 their suburbs.
 &nbsp; 4 And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and
 the children of Aaron the priest, <I>which were</I> of the Levites,
 had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of
 Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
 &nbsp; 5 And the rest of the children of Kohath <I>had</I> by lot out of
 the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of
 Dan, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
 &nbsp; 6 And the children of Gershon <I>had</I> by lot out of the families
 of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out
 of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh
 in Bashan, thirteen cities.
 &nbsp; 7 The children of Merari by their families <I>had</I> out of the
 tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the
 tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
 &nbsp; 8 And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these
 cities with their suburbs, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded by the hand of
 Moses.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The Levites' petition presented to this general convention of the 
 states, now sitting at Shiloh,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 
 Observe,

 1. They had not their lot assigned them till they made their claim. 
 There is an inheritance provided for all the saints, that royal 
 priesthood, but then they must petition for it. <I>Ask, and it shall be 
 given you.</I> Joshua had quickened the rest of the tribes who were 
 slack to put in their claims, but the Levites, it may be supposed, knew 
 their duty and interest better than the rest, and were therefore 
 forward in this matter, when it came to their turn, without being 
 called upon. They build their claim upon a very good foundation, not 
 their own merits nor services, but the divine precept: "<I>The Lord 
 commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities,</I> commanded you to 
 grant them, which implied a command to us to ask them." Note, The 
 maintenance of ministers is not an arbitrary thing, left purely to the 
 good-will of the people, who may let them starve if they please; no, as 
 the God of Israel commanded that the Levites should be well provided 
 for, so has the Lord Jesus, the King of the Christian church, ordained, 
 and a perpetual ordinance it is that <I>those who preach the gospel 
 should live of the gospel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:14">1 Cor. ix. 14</A>),

 and should live comfortably. 

 2. They did not make their claim till all the rest of the tribes were 
 provided for, and then they did it immediately. There was some reason 
 for it; every tribe must first know their own, else they would not know 
 what they gave the Levites, and so it could not be such a reasonable 
 service as it ought to be. But it is also an instance of their 
 humility, modesty, and patience (and Levites should be examples of 
 these and other virtues), that they were willing to be served last, and 
 they fared never the worse for it. Let not God's ministers complain if 
 at any time they find themselves postponed in men's thoughts and cares, 
 but let them make sure of the favour of God and the honour that comes 
 from him, and then they may well enough afford to bear the slights and 
 neglects of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The Levites' petition granted immediately, without any dispute, the 
 princes of Israel being perhaps ashamed that they needed to be called 
 upon in this matter, and that the motion had not been made among 
 themselves for the settling of the Levites.  

 1. The children of Israel are said to give the cities for the Levites. 
 God had appointed how many they should be in all, forty-eight. It is 
 probable that Joshua and the princes, upon consideration of the extent 
 and value of the lot of each tribe as it was laid before them, had 
 appointed how many cities should be taken out of each; and then the 
 fathers of the several tribes themselves agreed which they should be, 
 and therefore are said to give them, as an offering, to the Lord; so 
 God had appointed. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:8">Num. xxxv. 8</A>,

 <I>Every one shall give of his cities to the Levites.</I> Here God
 tried their generosity, and it was found to praise and honour, for it 
 appears by the following catalogue that the cities they gave to the 
 Levites were generally some of the best and most considerable in each 
 tribe. And it is probable that they had an eye to the situation of 
 them, taking care they should be so dispersed as that no part of the 
 country should be too far distant from a Levites' city.

 2. They gave them <I>at the commandment of the Lord,</I> that is, with 
 an eye to the command and in obedience to it, which was it that 
 sanctified the grant.  They gave the number that God commanded, and it 
 was well this matter was settled that the Levites might not ask more 
 nor the Israelites offer less. They gave them also with their suburbs, 
 or glebe-lands, belonging to them, so many cubits by measure from the 
 walls of the city, as God had commanded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:4,5">Num. xxxv. 4, 5</A>),

 and did not go about to cut them short. 

 3. When the forty-eight cities were pitched upon, they were divided 
 into four lots, as they lay next together, and then by lot were 
 determined to the four several families of the tribe of Levi. When the 
 Israelites had surrendered the cities into the hand of God, he would 
 himself have the distributing of them among his servants.

 (1.) The family of Aaron, who were the only priests, had for their 
 share the thirteen cities that were given by the tribes of Judah, 
 Simeon, and Benjamin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 God in wisdom ordered it thus, that though Jerusalem itself was not one
 of their cities, it being as yet in the possession of the Jebusites 
 (and those generous tribes would not mock the Levites, who had another 
 warfare to mind, with a city that must be recovered by the sword before 
 it could be enjoyed), yet the cities that fell to their lot were those 
 which lay next to Jerusalem, because that was to be, in process of 
 time, the holy city, where their business would chiefly lie.

 (2.) The Kohathite-Levites (among whom were the posterity of Moses,
 though never distinguished from them) had the cities that lay in the 
 lot of Dan, which lay next to Judah, and in that of Ephraim, and the 
 half-tribe of Manasseh, which lay next to Benjamin.  So those who 
 descended from Aaron's father joined nearest to Aaron's sons. 

 (3.) Gershon was the eldest son of Levi, and therefore, though the 
 younger house of the Kohathites was preferred before his, yet his 
 children had the precedency of the other family of Merari, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 (4.) The Merarites, the youngest house, had their lot last, and it lay 
 furthest off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The rest of the sons of Jacob had a lot for every tribe only, but Levi,
 God's tribe, had a lot for each of its families; for there is a 
 particular providence directing and attending the removals and 
 settlements of ministers, and appointing where those shall fix who are 
 to be the lights of the world.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and
 out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which
 are <I>here</I> mentioned by name,
 &nbsp; 10 Which the children of Aaron, <I>being</I> of the families of the
 Kohathites, <I>who were</I> of the children of Levi, had: for theirs
 was the first lot.
 &nbsp; 11 And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak,
 which <I>city is</I> Hebron, in the hill <I>country</I> of Judah, with the
 suburbs thereof round about it.
 &nbsp; 12 But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave
 they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
 &nbsp; 13 Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron
 with her suburbs, <I>to be</I> a city of refuge for the slayer; and
 Libnah with her suburbs,
 &nbsp; 14 And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,
 &nbsp; 15 And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,
 &nbsp; 16 And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, <I>and</I>
 Beth-shemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two
 tribes.
 &nbsp; 17 And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs,
 Geba with her suburbs,
 &nbsp; 18 Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four
 cities.
 &nbsp; 19 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, <I>were</I>
 thirteen cities with their suburbs.
 &nbsp; 20 And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites
 which remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the
 cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
 &nbsp; 21 For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount
 Ephraim, <I>to be</I> a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with
 her suburbs,
 &nbsp; 22 And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Beth-horon with her
 suburbs; four cities.
 &nbsp; 23 And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs,
 Gibbethon with her suburbs,
 &nbsp; 24 Aijalon with her suburbs, Gath-rimmon with her suburbs; four
 cities.
 &nbsp; 25 And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her
 suburbs, and Gath-rimmon with her suburbs; two cities.
 &nbsp; 26 All the cities <I>were</I> ten with their suburbs for the
 families of the children of Kohath that remained.
 &nbsp; 27 And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the
 Levites, out of the <I>other</I> half tribe of Manasseh <I>they gave</I>
 Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, <I>to be</I> a city of refuge for
 the slayer; and Beesh-terah with her suburbs; two cities.
 &nbsp; 28 And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs,
 Dabareh with her suburbs,
 &nbsp; 29 Jarmuth with her suburbs, En-gannim with her suburbs; four
 cities.
 &nbsp; 30 And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs,
 Abdon with her suburbs,
 &nbsp; 31 Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four
 cities.
 &nbsp; 32 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her
 suburbs, <I>to be</I> a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammoth-dor
 with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.
 &nbsp; 33 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their
 families <I>were</I> thirteen cities with their suburbs.
 &nbsp; 34 And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of
 the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her
 suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,
 &nbsp; 35 Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four
 cities.
 &nbsp; 36 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and
 Jahazah with her suburbs,
 &nbsp; 37 Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs;
 four cities.
 &nbsp; 38 And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her
 suburbs, <I>to be</I> a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim
 with her suburbs,
 &nbsp; 39 Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four
 cities in all.
 &nbsp; 40 So all the cities for the children of Merari by their
 families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites,
 were <I>by</I> their lot twelve cities.
 &nbsp; 41 All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the
 children of Israel <I>were</I> forty and eight cities with their
 suburbs.
 &nbsp; 42 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about
 them: thus <I>were</I> all these cities.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a particular account of the cities which were given to the 
 children of Levi out of the several tribes, not only to be occupied and 
 inhabited by them, as tenants to the several tribes in which they 
 lay--no, their interest in them was not dependent and precarious, but to
 be owned and possessed by them as lords and proprietors, and as having 
 the same title to them that the rest of the tribes had to their cities 
 or lands, as appears by the law which preserved the house in the 
 Levites' cities from being alienated any longer than till the year of 
 jubilee, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:32,33">Lev. xxv. 32, 33</A>.

 Yet it is probable that the Levites having only the cities and suburbs, 
 while the land about pertained to the tribes in which they lay, those 
 of that tribe, for the convenience of occupying that land, might 
 commonly rent houses of the Levites, as they could spare them in their 
 cities, and so live among them as their tenants. Several things may be 
 observed in this account, besides what was observed in the law 
 concerning it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:1-34">Num. xxxv</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the Levites were dispersed into all the tribes, and not 
 suffered to live all together in any one part of the country. This 
 would find them all with work, and employ them all for the good of 
 others; for ministers, of all people, must neither be idle nor live to 
 themselves or to one another only. Christ left his twelve disciples 
 together in a body, but left orders that they should in due time 
 disperse themselves, that they might <I>preach the gospel to every 
 creature.</I> The mixing of the Levites thus with the other tribes 
 would be an obligation upon them to walk circumspectly, and as became 
 their sacred function, and to avoid every thing that might disgrace it. 
 Had they lived all together, they would have been tempted to wink at 
 one another's faults, and to excuse one another when they did amiss; 
 but by this means they were made to see the eyes of all Israel upon 
 them, and therefore saw it their concern to walk so as that their 
 ministry might in nothing be blamed nor their high character suffer by 
 their ill carriage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That every tribe of Israel was adorned and enriched with its share 
 of Levites' cities in proportion to its compass, even those that lay 
 most remote. They were all God's people, and therefore they all had 
 Levites among them. 
 
 1. To show kindness to, as God appointed them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:19,14:29">Deut. xii. 19; xiv. 29</A>.

 They were God's receivers, to whom the people might give their grateful
 acknowledgments of God's goodness, as the occasion and disposition 
 were. 

 2. To receive advice and instruction from; when they could not go up to 
 the tabernacle, to consult those who attended there, they might go to a 
 Levites' city, and be taught the good knowledge of the Lord.  Thus God 
 set up a candle in every room of his house, to give light to all his 
 family; as those that attended the altar <I>kept the charge of the 
 Lord,</I> to see that no divine appointment was neglected there, so 
 those that were scattered in the country had their charge too, which 
 was to see that no idolatrous superstitious usages were introduced at a 
 distance and to watch for the souls of God's Israel.  Thus did God 
 graciously provide for the keeping up of religion among them, and that 
 they might have the word nigh them; yet, blessed be God, we, under the 
 gospel, have it yet nigher, not only Levites in every county, but 
 Levites in every parish, whose office it is still to teach the people 
 knowledge, and to go before them in the things of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That there were thirteen cities, and those some of the best, 
 appointed for the priests, the sons of Aaron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Aaron left but two sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, yet his family was now so
 much increased, and it was foreseen that it would in process of time 
 grow so numerous, as to replenish all these cities, though a 
 considerable number must of necessity be resident wherever the ark and 
 the altar were. We read in both Testaments of such numbers of priests 
 that we may suppose none of all the families of Israel that came out of 
 Egypt increased afterwards so much as that of Aaron did; and the 
 promise afterwards to the house of Aaron is, <I>God shall increase you 
 more and more, you and your children,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:12,14">Ps.  cxv. 12, 14</A>.

 He will raise up a <I>seed to serve him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That some of the Levites' cities were afterwards famous upon other 
 accounts. Hebron was the city in which David began his reign, and in 
 Manhanaim, another Levites' city 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 he lay, and had his headquarters when he fled from Absalom.  The first 
 Israelite that ever wore the title of king (namely, Abimelech, the son
 of Gideon) reigned in Shechem, another Levites' city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:21"><I>v.</I>  21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That the number of them in all was more than of most of the tribes, 
 except Judah, though the tribe of Levi was one of the least of the 
 tribes, to show how liberal God is, and his people should be, to his 
 ministers; yet the disproportion will not appear so great as at first 
 it seems, if we consider that the Levites had cities only with their 
 suburbs to dwell in, but the rest of the tribes, besides their cities 
 (and those perhaps were many more than are named in the account of 
 their lot), had many unwalled towns and villages which they inhabited, 
 besides country houses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Upon the whole, it appears that effectual care was taken that the 
 Levites should live both comfortably and usefully: and those, whether 
 ministers or others, for whom Providence has done well, must look upon 
 themselves as obliged thereby to do good, and, according as their 
 capacity and opportunity are, to serve their generation.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>43 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to
 give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt
 therein.
 &nbsp; 44 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> gave them rest round about, according to all
 that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of
 all their enemies before them; the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> delivered all their
 enemies into their hand.
 &nbsp; 45 There failed not ought of any good thing which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had
 spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the conclusion of this whole matter, the foregoing history 
 summed up, and, to make it appear the more bright, compared with the 
 promise of which it was the full accomplishment. God's word and his 
 works mutually illustrate each other. The performance makes the promise 
 appear very true and the promise makes the performance appear very 
 kind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God had promised to give the seed of Abraham the land of Canaan for 
 a possession, and now at last he performed this promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 <I>They possessed it, and dwelt therein.</I> Though they had often 
 forfeited the benefit of that promise, and God had long delayed the 
 performance of it, yet at last all difficulties were conquered, and 
 Canaan was their own. And the promise of the heavenly Canaan is as sure 
 to all God's spiritual Israel, for it is the promise of him that cannot 
 lie.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God had promised to give them rest in that land, and now they had 
 rest round about, rest from the fatigues of their travel through the 
 wilderness (which tedious march, perhaps, was long in their bones), 
 rest from their wars in Canaan, and the insults which their enemies 
 there had at first offered them. They now dwelt, not only in 
 habitations of their own, but those quiet and peaceable ones; though 
 there were Canaanites that remained, yet none that had either strength 
 or spirit to attack them, nor so much as give them an alarm. This rest 
 continued till they by their own sin and folly put thorns into their 
 own beds and their own eyes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God had promised to give them victory and success in their wars, 
 and this promise likewise was fulfilled: <I>There stood not a man 
 before them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 They had the better in every battle, and which way soever they turned
 their forces they prospered. It is true there were Canaanites now 
 remaining in many parts of the land, and such as afterwards made head 
 against them, and became very formidable. But,

 1.  As to the present remains of the Canaanites, they were no 
 contradiction to the promise, for God had said he would not drive them 
 out all at once, but by <I>little and little,</I>

 They had now as much in their full possession as they had occasion for
 and as they had hands to manage, so that the Canaanites only kept 
 possession of some of the less cultivated parts of the country against 
 the beasts of the field, till Israel, in process of time, should become 
 numerous enough to replenish them. 

 2. As to the after prevalency of the Canaanites, that was purely the 
 effect of Israel's cowardice and slothfulness, and the punishment of 
 their sinful inclination to the idolatries and other abominations of 
 the heathen, whom the Lord would have cast out before them but that 
 they harboured and indulged them. So that the foundation of God stands 
 sure.  Israel's experience of God's fidelity is here upon record, and 
 is an acquittance under their hands to the honour of God, the 
 vindication of his promise which had been so often distrusted, and the 
 encouragement of all believers to the end of the world: <I>There failed 
 not any good thing,</I> no, nor <I>aught</I> of any good thing (so full 
 is it expressed), <I>which the Lord had spoken unto the house of 
 Israel,</I> but in due time <I>all came to pass,</I>

 Such an acknowledgment as this, here subscribed by Joshua in the name
 of all Israel, we afterwards find made by Solomon, and all Israel did 
 in effect say <I>Amen</I> to it,

 The inviolable truth of God's promise, and the performance of it to the
 utmost, are what all the saints have been ready to bear their testimony 
 to; and, if in any thing the performance has seemed to come short, they 
 have been as ready to own that they themselves must bear all the 
 blame.</P>
