 We have here the history of the reign of Joash, the progress of which, 
 and especially its termination, were not of a piece with its beginning, 
 nor shone with so much lustre. How wonderfully he was preserved for the 
 throne, and placed in it, we read before; now here we are told how he 
 began in the spirit, but ended in the flesh. 

 I. In the beginning of his time, while Jehoiada lived, he did well;
 particularly, he took care to put the temple in good repair, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:1-14">ver. 1-14</A>.

 II. In the latter end of his time, after Jehoiada's death, he
 apostatized from God, and his apostasy was his ruin. 

 1. He set up the worship of Baal again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:15-18">ver. 15-18</A>),

 though warned to the contrary,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:19">ver.  19</A>.

 2. He put Zechariah the prophet to death because he reproved him for
 what he had done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:20-22">ver. 20-22</A>.

 3. The judgments of God came upon him for it. The Syrians invaded him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:23,24">ver. 23, 24</A>.

 He was struck with sore diseases; his own servants conspired against
 him and slew him; and, as a mark of infamy upon him, he was not buried
 in the burying-place of the kings,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Joash <I>was</I> seven years old when he began to reign, and he
 reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also <I>was</I>
 Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
 &nbsp; 2  And Joash did <I>that which was</I> right in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
 &nbsp; 3  And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and
 daughters.
 &nbsp; 4  And it came to pass after this, <I>that</I> Joash was minded to
 repair the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 5  And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and
 said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all
 Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year,
 and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened
 <I>it</I> not.
 &nbsp; 6  And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto
 him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of
 Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, <I>according to the
 commandment</I> of Moses the servant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and of the
 congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?
 &nbsp; 7  For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up
 the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> did they bestow upon Baalim.
 &nbsp; 8  And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it
 without at the gate of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9  And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to
 bring in to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> the collection <I>that</I> Moses the servant of
 God <I>laid</I> upon Israel in the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 10  And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought
 in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
 &nbsp; 11  Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought
 unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they
 saw that <I>there was</I> much money, the king's scribe and the high
 priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and
 carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and
 gathered money in abundance.
 &nbsp; 12  And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of
 the service of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and hired masons and
 carpenters to repair the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and also such as
 wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 13  So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them,
 and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.
 &nbsp; 14  And when they had finished <I>it,</I> they brought the rest of
 the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels
 for the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>even</I> vessels to minister, and to
 offer <I>withal,</I> and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And
 they offered burnt offerings in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> continually
 all the days of Jehoiada.

 This account of Joash's good beginnings we had as it stands here 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:1-21">2 Kings xii. 1</A>,

 &c., though the latter part of this chapter, concerning his
 apostasy, we had little of there. What is good in men we should take 
 all occasions to speak of and often repeat it; what is evil we should 
 make mention of but sparingly, and no more than is needful. We shall 
 here only observe, 

 1. That it is a happy thing for young people, when they are setting out
 in the world, to be under the direction of those that are wise and good 
 and faithful to them, as Joash was under the influence of Jehoiada, 
 during whose time he <I>did that which was right.</I> Let those that 
 are young reckon it a blessing to them, and not a burden and check upon 
 them, to have those with them that will caution them against that which 
 is evil and advise and quicken them to that which is good; and let them 
 reckon it not a mark of weakness and subjection, but of wisdom and 
 discretion, to hearken to such. He that will not be counselled cannot 
 be helped. It is especially prudent for young people to take advice in 
 their marriages, as Joash did, who left it to his guardian to choose 
 him his wives, because Jezebel and Athaliah had been such plagues, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This is a turn of life which often proves either the making or marring
 of young people, and therefore should be attended to with great care.

 2. Men may go far in the external performances of religion, and keep
 long to them, merely by the power of their education and the influence 
 of their friends, who yet have no hearty affection for divine things 
 nor any inward relish of them. Foreign inducements may push men on to 
 that which is good who are not actuated by a living principle of grace 
 in their hearts. 

 3. In the outward expressions of devotion it is possible that those who
 have only the form of godliness may out-strip those who have the power 
 of it.  Joash is more solicitous and more zealous about the repair of 
 the temple than Jehoiada himself, whom he reproves for his remissness 
 in that matter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It is easier to build temples than to be temples to God.

 4. The repairing of churches is a good work, which all in their places
 should promote, for the decency and conveniency of religious 
 assemblies. The learned tell us that in the Christian church, 
 anciently, part of the tithes were applied that way. 

 5. Many a good work would be done that now lies undone if there were
 but a few active men to stir in it and to put it forward. When Joash 
 found the money did not come in as he expected in one way he tried 
 another way, and that answered the intention. Many have honesty enough 
 to follow that have not zeal enough to lead in that which is good. The 
 throwing of money into a chest, through a hole in the lid of it, was a 
 way that had not been used before, and perhaps the very novelty of the 
 thing made it a successful expedient for the raising of money; a great 
 deal was thrown in and with a great deal of cheerfulness: they all 
 rejoiced, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 An invention to please people's humour may sometimes bring them to
 their duty.  Wisdom herein is profitable to direct.

 6.  Faithfulness is the greatest praise and will be the greatest
 comfort of those that are entrusted with public treasure or employed in 
 public business. The king and Jehoiada faithfully paid the money to the 
 workmen, who faithfully did the work,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died;
 a hundred and thirty years old <I>was he</I> when he died.
 &nbsp; 16  And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,
 because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward
 his house.
 &nbsp; 17  Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah,
 and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto
 them.
 &nbsp; 18  And they left the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of their fathers,
 and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and
 Jerusalem for this their trespass.
 &nbsp; 19  Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and they testified against them: but they would not give
 ear.
 &nbsp; 20  And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of
 Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto
 them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 he hath also forsaken you.
 &nbsp; 21  And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones
 at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 22  Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which
 Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when
 he died, he said, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> look upon <I>it,</I> and require <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 23  And it came to pass at the end of the year, <I>that</I> the host
 of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and
 Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among
 the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of
 Damascus.
 &nbsp; 24  For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of
 men, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> delivered a very great host into their hand,
 because they had forsaken the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of their fathers. So they
 executed judgment against Joash.
 &nbsp; 25  And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in
 great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the
 blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his
 bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but
 they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.
 &nbsp; 26  And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son
 of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a
 Moabitess.
 &nbsp; 27  Now <I>concerning</I> his sons, and the greatness of the burdens
 <I>laid</I> upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold,
 they <I>are</I> written in the story of the book of the kings. And
 Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a sad account of the degeneracy and apostasy of Joash. God 
 had done great things for him; he had done something for God; but now 
 he proved ungrateful to his God and false to the engagements he had 
 laid himself under to him. <I>How has the gold become dim, and the most 
 fine gold changed!</I> Here we find,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The occasions of his apostasy. When he did that which was right it 
 was <I>not with a perfect heart.</I> He never was sincere, never acted 
 from principle, but in compliance to Jehoiada, who had helped him to 
 the crown, and because he had been protected in the temple and rose 
 upon the ruins of idolatry; and therefore, when the wind turned, he 
 turned with it. 

 1. His good counsellor left him, and was by death removed from him. It
 was a mercy to him and his kingdom that Jehoiada lived so long-130 
 years

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 by which it appears that he was born in Solomon's time, and had lived
 six entire reigns before this. It was an encouragement to him to go on 
 in that good way which Jehoiada had trained him up in to see what 
 honour was done to Jehoiada at his death: <I>They buried him among the 
 kings,</I> with this honourable encomium (perhaps it was part of the 
 inscription on his grave-stone), that <I>he had done good in 
 Israel.</I> Judah is called <I>Israel,</I> because, the other tribes 
 having revolted from God, they only were Israelites indeed. Note, It is 
 the greatest honour to do good in our generations, and those who <I>do 
 that which is good shall have praise of the same.</I> He had done good 
 towards God; not that any man's goodness can extend unto him, but he 
 had done good towards his house, in reviving the temple service,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+23:8"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 8</A>.

 Note, Those do the greatest good to their country that lay out
 themselves in their places to promote religion.  Well, Jehoiada 
 finished his course with honour; but the little religion that Joash had 
 was all buried in his grave, and, after his death, both king and 
 kingdom miserably degenerated. See how much one head may sustain, and 
 what a great judgment to any prince or people the death of godly, 
 zealous, useful men is. See how necessary it is that, as our Saviour 
 speaks, we <I>have salt in ourselves,</I> that we act in religion from 
 an inward principle, which will carry us on through all changes. Then 
 the loss of a parent, a minister, a friend, will not involve the loss 
 of our religion. 

 2. Bad counsellors got about him, insinuated themselves into his
 affections, wheedled him, flattered him, <I>made obeisance</I> to him, 
 and, instead of condoling, congratulated him upon the death of his old 
 tutor, as his release from the discipline he had been so long under, 
 unworthy a man, a king. They tell him he must be priest-ridden no 
 longer, he is now discharged from <I>grave lessons and restraints,</I> 
 he may do as he pleases: and (would you think it?) the princes of Judah 
 were the men that were so industrious to debauch him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 His father and grandfather were corrupted by the house of Ahab, from
 whom no better could be expected. But that the princes of Judah should 
 be seducers to their king was very sad. But those that incline to the 
 <I>counsels of the ungodly</I> will never want ungodly counsellors.  
 They <I>made obeisance to the king,</I> flattered him into an opinion 
 of his absolute power, promised to stand by him in making his royal 
 will and pleasure pass for a law, any divine precept or institution to 
 the contrary in any wise notwithstanding. And he hearkened to them: 
 their discourse pleased him, and was more agreeable than Jehoiada's 
 dictates used to be. Princes and inferior people have been many a time 
 thus flattered into their ruin by those who have promised them liberty 
 and dignity, but who have really brought them into the greatest 
 servitude and disgrace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The apostasy itself: <I>They left the house of God, and served 
 groves and idols,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 The princes, it is likely, had a request to the king, which they tell
 him they durst not offer while Jehoiada lived; but now they hope it 
 will give no offence: it is that they may set up the groves and idols 
 again which were thrown down in the beginning of his reign, for they 
 hate to be always confined to the dull old-fashioned service of the 
 temple. And he not only gave them leave to do it themselves, but he 
 joined with them. The king and princes, who, a little while ago, were 
 repairing the temple, now forsook the temple; those who had pulled down 
 groves and idols now themselves served them.  So inconstant a thing is 
 man and so little confidence is to be put in him!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The aggravations of this apostasy and the additions of guilt to 
 it. God <I>sent prophets to them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 to reprove them for their wickedness, and to tell them what would be in
 the end thereof, and so <I>to bring them again unto the Lord.</I> It is 
 the work of ministers to bring people, not to themselves, but to 
 God--to bring those again to him who have gone a whoring from him. In 
 the most degenerate times God <I>left not himself without witness;</I> 
 though they had dealt very disingenuously with God, yet he sent 
 prophets to them to convince and instruct them, and to assure them that 
 they should find favour with him if yet they would return; for he would 
 rather sinners should <I>turn and live</I> than <I>go on and die,</I> 
 and those that perish shall be left inexcusable. The prophets did their 
 part: <I>they testified against them;</I> but, few or none <I>received 
 their testimony.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They slighted all the prophets; they would not give ear, were so 
 strangely wedded to their idols that no reproofs, warnings, 
 threatenings, nor any of the various methods which the prophets took to 
 convince them would reclaim them. Few would hear them, fewer would heed 
 them, but fewest of all would believe them or be governed by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They slew one of the most eminent, <I>Zechariah the son of 
 Jehoiada,</I> and perhaps others. Concerning him observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The message which he delivered to them in the name of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 The people were assembled in the court of the temple (for they had not
 quite left it), probably on occasion of some solemn feast, when this 
 Zechariah, being filled with the spirit of prophecy, and known (it is 
 likely) to be a prophet, stood up in some of the desks that were in the 
 court of the priests, and very plainly, but without any provoking 
 language, told the people of their sin and what would be the 
 consequences of it. He did not impeach any particular persons, nor 
 predict any particular judgments, as sometimes the prophets did, but as 
 inoffensively as possible reminded them of what was written in the law. 
 Let them but look into their Bibles, and there they would find, 

 [1.] The precept they broke: "<I>You transgress the commandments of the
 Lord,</I> you know you do so, in serving groves and idols: and why will 
 you so offend God and wrong yourselves?" 

 [2.] The penalty they incurred: "You know, if the word of God be true,
 you cannot prosper in this evil way; never expect to do ill and fare 
 well. Nay, you find already that <I>because you have forsaken the Lord 
 he hath forsaken you,</I> as he told you he would,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:25,31:16,17">Deut. xxix. 25; xxxi. 16, 17</A>.

 This is the work of ministers, by the word of God, as a lamp and a
 light, to expose the sin of men and expound the providences of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The barbarous treatment they gave him for his kindness and 
 faithfulness in delivering this message to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 By the conspiracy of the princes, or some of their party, and <I>by the
 commandment of the king,</I> who thought himself affronted by this fair 
 warning, they stoned him to death immediately, not under colour of law, 
 accusing him as a blasphemer, a traitor, or a false prophet, but in a 
 popular tumult, <I>in the court of the house of the Lord</I>--as horrid 
 a piece of wickedness as perhaps any we read of in all the history of 
 the kings. The <I>person</I> was sacred--a priest, the <I>place</I> 
 sacred--the court of the temple (the inner court, <I>between the porch 
 and the altar</I>), the <I>message</I> yet more sacred, and we have
 reason to think that they knew it came from the spirit of prophecy. The 
 reproof was just, the warning fair, both backed with scripture, and the 
 delivery very gentle and tender; and yet so impudently and daringly do 
 they defy God himself that nothing less than the blood of the prophet 
 can satisfy their indignation at the prophecy. <I>Be astonished, O 
 heavens! at this,</I> and <I>tremble, O earth!</I> that ever such 
 villany should be committed by men, by Israelites, in contempt and 
 violation of every thing that is just, honourable, and sacred--that a 
 king, a king in covenant with God, should command the murder of one 
 whom it was his office to protect and countenance! The Jews say there 
 were seven transgressions in this; for they killed a priest, a prophet, 
 a judge, they shed innocent blood, and polluted the court of the 
 temple, the sabbath, and the day of expiation: for on that day, their 
 tradition says, this happened.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The aggravation of this sin, that this Zechariah, who suffered 
 martyrdom for his faithfulness to God and his country, was the son of 
 Jehoiada, who had done so much good in Israel, and particularly had 
 been as a father to Joash, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The affront done by it to God, and the contempt put on religion, are
 not so particularly taken notice of as the ingratitude there was in it 
 to the memory of Jehoiada. He remembered not the kindness of the 
 father, but slew the son for doing his duty, and what the father would 
 have done if he had been there.  Call a man ungrateful, and you can 
 call him no worse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The dying martyr's prophetic imprecation of vengeance upon his 
 murderers: <I>The Lord look upon it, and require it!</I> This came not 
 from a spirit of revenge, but a spirit of prophecy: <I>He will require 
 it.</I> This would be the continual cry of the blood they shed, as 
 Abel's blood cried against Cain: "Let the God to whom vengeance belongs 
 demand blood for blood. He will do it, for he is righteous." This 
 precious blood was quickly reckoned for in the judgments that came upon 
 this apostate prince; it came into the account afterwards in the 
 destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans--their misusing the prophets
 was that which brought upon them ruin without remedy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:16"><I>ch.</I> xxxvi. 16</A>);

 nay, our Saviour makes the persecutors of him and his gospel answerable
 for the blood of this Zechariah; so loud, so long, does the blood of 
 the martyrs cry. See

 Such as this is the cry of the souls under the altar

 IV. The judgments of God which came upon Joash for this aggravated 
 wickedness of his. 

 1. A small army of Syrians made themselves masters of Jerusalem,
 destroyed the princes, plundered the city, and sent the spoil of it to 
 Damascus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 God's people, while they kept in with God, had often been conquerors
 when the enemy had the advantage of the greater number; but now, on the 
 contrary, an inconsiderable handful of Syrians routed a <I>very great 
 host of Israelites, because they had forsaken the Lord God of their 
 fathers,</I> and then they were not only put upon the level with their 
 enemies, but opposed them with the utmost disadvantage; for their God 
 not only departed from them, but <I>turned to be their enemy and fought 
 against them.</I> The Syrians were employed as instruments in God's 
 hand to <I>execute judgments against Joash,</I> though they little 
 thought so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:6,7">Isa. x. 6, 7</A>,

 and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:30">Deut. xxxii. 30</A>.

 2. God smote him with great diseases, of body, or mind, or both, either
 like his grandfather

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+21:18"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 18</A>),

 or, like Saul, an evil spirit from God troubling him. While he was
 plagued with the Syrians he thought that, if he could but get clear of 
 them, he should do well enough. But, before they departed from him, God 
 smote him with diseases. If vengeance pursue men, the end of one 
 trouble will but be the beginning of another. 

 3. His own servants conspired against him.  Perhaps he began to hope
 his disease would be cured--he was but a middle-aged man and might 
 recover it; but <I>he that cometh up out of the pit shall fall into the 
 snare.</I> When he thought he should escape death by sickness he met it 
 by the sword. They slew him in his bed <I>for the blood of the sons of 
 Jehoiada,</I> by which it should seem that he did not only slay 
 Zechariah, but others of the sons of Jehoiada for his sake. Perhaps 
 those that slew him <I>intended</I> to take vengeance for that blood; 
 but, whether they did or not, this was what God intended in permitting 
 them to slay him.  Those that drink the blood of the saints shall have 
 their own blood given them to drink, for they are worthy. The regicides 
 are here named

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 and it is observable that the mothers of them both were foreigners, one
 an Ammonitess and the other a Moabitess. The idolatrous kings, it is 
 likely, countenanced those marriages which the law prohibited for the 
 prevention of idolatry; and see how they resulted in their own 
 destruction. 

 4. His people would not bury him in the sepulchres of the kings because
 he had stained his honour by his mal-administration.  <I>Let him not be 
 written with the righteous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:28">Ps. lxix. 28</A>.

 These judgments are called the <I>burdens laid upon him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 for the wrath of God is a heavy burden, too heavy for any man to bear.
 Or it may be meant of the threatenings denounced against him by the 
 prophets, for those are called <I>burdens.</I> Usually God sets some 
 special marks of his displeasure upon apostates in this life, for 
 warning to all to <I>remember Lot's wife.</I></P>
