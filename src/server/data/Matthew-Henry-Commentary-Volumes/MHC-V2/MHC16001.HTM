 Here we first meet with Nehemiah at the Persian court, where we find
 him,

 I. Inquisitive concerning the state of the Jews and Jerusalem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Informed of their deplorable condition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:3">ver. 3</A>.

 III. Fasting and praying thereupon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:4">ver. 4</A>),

 with a particular account of his prayer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:5-11">ver. 5-11</A>.

 Such is the rise of this great man, by piety, not by policy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to
 pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in
 Shushan the palace,
 &nbsp; 2  That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and <I>certain</I> men
 of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped,
 which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 3  And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the
 captivity there in the province <I>are</I> in great affliction and
 reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also <I>is</I> broken down, and the
 gates thereof are burned with fire.
 &nbsp; 4  And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat
 down and wept, and mourned <I>certain</I> days, and fasted, and prayed
 before the God of heaven,
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What a tribe Nehemiah was of does nowhere appear; but, if it be true 
 (which we are told by the author of the Maccabees, 
 
 <U>2 Mac. i. 18</U>)

 that he offered sacrifice, we must conclude him to have been a priest.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Nehemiah's station at the court of Persia. We are here told that he 
 was <I>in Shushan the palace,</I> or royal city, of the king of Persia, 
 where the court was ordinarily kept 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 and
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 that he was <I>the king's cup-bearer.</I> Kings and great men probably
 looked upon it as a piece of state to be attended by those of other 
 nations. By this place at court he would be the better qualified for 
 the service of his country in that post for which God had designed him, 
 as Moses was the fitter to govern for being bred up in Pharaoh's court, 
 and David in Saul's. He would also have the fairer opportunity of 
 serving his country by his interest in the king and those about him. 
 Observe, He is not forward to tell us what great preferment he had at 
 court; it is not till the end of the chapter that he tells us he was 
 <I>the king's cup-bearer</I> (a place of great trust, as well as of 
 honour and profit), when he could not avoid the mentioning of it 
 because of the following story; but at first he only said, <I>I was in 
 Shushan the palace.</I> We may hence learn to be humble and modest, and 
 slow to speak of our own advancements. But in the providences of God 
 concerning him we may observe, to our comfort, 

 1. That when God has work to do he will never want instruments to do it
 with. 

 2. That those whom God designs to employ in his service he will find
 out proper ways both to fit for it and to call to it. 

 3. That God has his remnant in all places; we read of Obadiah in the
 house of Ahab, saints in Caesar's household, and a devout Nehemiah in
 Shushan the palace. 

 4. That God can make the courts of princes sometimes nurseries and
 sometimes sanctuaries to the friends and patrons of the church's 
 cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Nehemiah's tender and compassionate enquiry concerning the state of 
 the Jews in their own land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It happened that a friend and relation of his came to the court, with 
 some other company, by whom he had an opportunity of informing himself 
 fully how it went with the children of the captivity and what posture 
 Jerusalem, the beloved city, was in. Nehemiah lived at ease, in honour 
 and fulness, himself, but could not forget that he was an Israelite, 
 nor shake off the thoughts of his brethren in distress, but in spirit 
 (like Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+7:23">Acts vii. 23</A>)

 he <I>visited them and looked upon their burdens.</I> As distance of
 place did not alienate his affections from them (though they were out 
 of sight, yet not out of mind), so neither did, 

 1. The dignity to which he was advanced. Though he was a great man, and
 probably rising higher, yet he did not think it below him to take 
 cognizance of his brethren that were low and despised, nor was he 
 ashamed to own his relation to them and concern for them. 

 2. The diversity of their sentiments from his, and the difference of 
 their practice accordingly. Though he did not go to settle at Jerusalem 
 himself (as we think he ought to have done now that liberty was 
 proclaimed), but conformed to the court, and staid there, yet he did 
 not therefore judge nor despise those that had returned, nor upbraid 
 them as impolitic, but kindly concerned himself for them, was ready to 
 do them all the good offices he could, and, that he might know which 
 way to do them a kindness, <I>asked concerning them.</I> Note, It is 
 lawful and good to enquire, "What news?" We should enquire especially 
 concerning the state of the church and religion, and how it fares with 
 the people of God; and the design of our enquiry must be, not that, 
 like the Athenians, we may have something to talk of, but that we may 
 know how to direct our prayers and our praises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The melancholy account which is here given him of the present 
 state of the Jews and Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Hanani, the person he enquired of, has this character given of him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:2"><I>ch.</I> vii. 2</A>),

 that he <I>feared God above many,</I> and therefore would not only
 speak truly, but, when he spoke of the desolations of Jerusalem, would 
 speak tenderly. It is probable that his errand to court at this time 
 was to solicit some favour, some relief or other, that they stood in 
 need of. Now the account he gives is, 

 1. That the holy seed was miserably trampled on and abused, <I>in great
 affliction and reproach,</I> insulted upon all occasions by their 
 neighbours, and <I>filled with the scorning of those that were at 
 ease.</I> 

 2. That the holy city was exposed and in ruins.  <I>The wall of 
 Jerusalem was</I> still <I>broken down, and the gates</I> were, as the 
 Chaldeans left them, in ruins. This made the condition of the 
 inhabitants both very despicable under the abiding marks of poverty and 
 slavery, and very dangerous, for their enemies might when they pleased 
 make an easy prey of them. The temple was built, the government 
 settled, and a work of reformation brought to some head, but here was 
 one good work yet undone; this was still wanting. Every Jerusalem, on 
 this side the heavenly one, will have some defect or other in it, for 
 the making up of which it will required the help and service of its 
 friends.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The great affliction this gave to Nehemiah and the deep concern it 
 put him into, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 1. He <I>wept and mourned.</I> It was not only just when he heard the
 news that he fell into a passion of weeping, but his sorrow continued 
 <I>certain days.</I> Note, The desolations and distresses of the church 
 ought to be the matter of our grief, how much soever we live at ease. 
 
 2. He <I>fasted and prayed;</I> not in public (he had no opportunity of 
 doing that), but <I>before the God of heaven,</I> who sees in secret, 
 and will reward openly. By his fasting and praying,

 (1.) He consecrated his sorrows, and directed his tears aright,
 <I>sorrowed after a godly sort,</I> with an eye to God, because his 
 name was reproached in the contempt cast on his people, whose cause 
 therefore he thus commits to him.

 (2.) He eased his sorrows, and unburdened his spirit, by pouring out
 his complaint before God and leaving it with him.

 (3.) He took the right method of fetching in relief for his people and
 direction for himself in what way to serve them. Let those who are 
 forming any good designs for the service of the public take God along 
 with them for the first conception of them, and utter all their 
 projects before him; this is the way to prosper in them.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And said, I beseech thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of heaven, the great and
 terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love
 him and observe his commandments:
 &nbsp; 6  Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that
 thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before
 thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants,
 and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have
 sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.
 &nbsp; 7  We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept
 the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou
 commandedst thy servant Moses.
 &nbsp; 8  Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy
 servant Moses, saying, <I>If</I> ye transgress, I will scatter you
 abroad among the nations:
 &nbsp; 9  But <I>if</I> ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do
 them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part
 of the heaven, <I>yet</I> will I gather them from thence, and will
 bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name
 there.
 &nbsp; 10  Now these <I>are</I> thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast
 redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
 &nbsp; 11  O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to
 the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who
 desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant
 this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was
 the king's cupbearer.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Nehemiah's prayer, a prayer that has reference to all the 
 prayers which he had for some time before been putting up to God day 
 and night, while he continued his sorrows for the desolations of 
 Jerusalem, and withal to the petition he was now intending to present 
 to the king his master for his favour to Jerusalem. We may observe in 
 this prayer,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His humble and reverent address to God, in which he prostrates 
 himself before him, and gives unto him the glory due unto his name, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 It is much the same with that of Daniel,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:4"><I>ch.</I> ix. 4</A>.

 It teaches us to draw near to God, 

 1. With a holy awe of his majesty and glory, remembering that he is the 
 God of heaven, infinitely above us, and sovereign Lord over us, and 
 that he is <I>the great and terrible God,</I> infinitely excelling all 
 the principalities and powers both of the upper and of the lower world, 
 angels and kings; and he is a God to be worshipped with fear by all his 
 people, and whose powerful wrath all his enemies have reason to be 
 afraid of. Even the terrors of the Lord are improvable for the comfort 
 and encouragement of those that trust in him. 

 2. With a holy confidence in his grace and truth, for he <I>keepeth 
 covenant and mercy for those that love him,</I> not only the mercy that 
 is promised, but even more than he promised: nothing shall be thought 
 too much to be done for those that <I>love him and keep his 
 commandments.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His general request for the audience and acceptance of all the 
 prayers and confessions he now made to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Let thy ear be attentive to the prayer,</I> not which I <I>say</I>
 (barely <I>saying</I> prayer will not serve), but which I <I>pray</I> 
 before thee (then we are likely to speed in praying when we pray in 
 praying), and let <I>they eyes be open</I> upon the heart from which 
 the prayer comes, and the case which is in prayer laid before thee." 
 God <I>formed the eye</I> and <I>planted the ear;</I> and therefore 
 shall he not see clearly? shall not he hear attentively?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His penitent confession of sin; not only Israel has sinned (it was 
 no great mortification to him to own that), but <I>I and my father's 
 house have sinned,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Thus does he humble himself, and take shame to himself, in this
 confession. <I>We have</I> (I and my family among the rest) <I>dealt 
 very corruptly against thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 In the confession of sin, let these two things be owned as the
 malignity of it--that it is a corruption of ourselves and an affront to 
 God; it is <I>dealing corruptly against God,</I> setting up the 
 corruptions of our own hearts in opposition to the commands of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The pleas he urges for mercy for his people Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He pleads what God had of old said to them, the rule he had settled 
 of his proceedings towards them, which might be the rule of their 
 expectations from him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 He had said indeed that, if they broke covenant with him, he would
 <I>scatter them among the nations,</I> and that threatening was 
 fulfilled in their captivity: never was people so widely dispersed as 
 Israel was at this time, though at first so closely incorporated; but 
 he had said withal that if they <I>turned to him</I> (as now they began 
 to do, having renounced idolatry and kept to the temple service) he 
 would <I>gather them again.</I> This he quotes from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:1-5">Deut. xxx. 1-5</A>,

 and begs leave to put God in mind of it (though the Eternal Mind needs
 no remembrancer) as that which he guided his desires by, and grounded 
 his faith and hope upon, in praying this prayer: <I>Remember, I beseech 
 thee, that word;</I> for thou hast said, <I>Put me in remembrance.</I> 
 He had owned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>We have not kept the judgments which thou commandedst thy servant
 Moses;</I> yet he begs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 Lord, <I>remember the word which thou commandedst thy servant
 Moses;</I> for the covenant is often said to be commanded. If God were 
 not more mindful of his promises than we are of his precepts we should 
 be undone. Our best pleas therefore in prayer are those that are taken 
 from the promise of God, the <I>word on which he has caused us to 
 hope,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:49">Ps. cxix. 49</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He pleads the relation wherein of old they stood to God: "These are 
 <I>thy servants and thy people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 whom thou hast set apart for thyself, and taken into covenant with
 thee. Wilt thou suffer thy sworn enemies to trample upon and oppress
 thy sworn servants? If thou wilt not appear for thy people, whom wilt
 thou appear for?" See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:19">Isa. lxiii. 19</A>.

 As an evidence of their being God's servants he gives them this
 character

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>They desire to fear thy name;</I> they are not only called by thy
 name, but really have a reverence for thy name; they now worship thee, 
 and thee only, according to thy will, and have an awe of all the 
 discoveries thou art pleased to make of thyself; this they have a 
 desire to do," which denotes,

 (1.) Their good will to it. "It is their constant care and endeavour to
 be found in the way of their duty, and they aim at it, though in many 
 instances they come short."

 (2.) Their complacency in it. "They take pleasure to fear thy name (so
 it may be read), not only do their duty, but do it with delight." Those 
 shall graciously be accepted of God that truly desire to fear his name; 
 for such a desire is his own work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He pleads the great things God had formerly done for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 "<I>Whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power,</I> in the days of old.
 Thy power is still the same; wilt thou not therefore still redeem them
 and perfect their redemption? Let not those be overpowered by the enemy
 that have a God of infinite power on their side."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> He concludes with a particular petition, that God would
 prosper him in his undertaking, and give him favour with the king:
 <I>this man</I> he calls him, for the greatest of men are but men
 before God; they must know themselves to be so

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:20">Ps. ix. 20</A>),

 and others must know them to be so. <I>Who art thou that thou shouldst
 be afraid of a man? Mercy in the sight of this man</I> is what he prays 
 for, meaning not the king's mercy, but mercy from God in his address to 
 the king. Favour with men is then comfortable when we can see it 
 springing from the mercy of God.</P>
