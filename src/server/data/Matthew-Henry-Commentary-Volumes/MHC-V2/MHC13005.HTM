 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he <I>was</I>
 the firstborn; but, forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed, his
 birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel:
 and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.
 &nbsp; 2  For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him <I>came</I> the
 chief ruler; but the birthright <I>was</I> Joseph's:)
 &nbsp; 3  The sons, <I>I say,</I> of Reuben the firstborn of Israel <I>were,</I>
 Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
 &nbsp; 4  The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his
 son,
 &nbsp; 5  Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son,
 &nbsp; 6  Beerah his son, whom Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria carried
 away <I>captive:</I> he <I>was</I> prince of the Reubenites.
 &nbsp; 7  And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of
 their generations was reckoned, <I>were</I> the chief, Jeiel, and
 Zechariah,
 &nbsp; 8  And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel,
 who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baal-meon:
 &nbsp; 9  And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the
 wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were
 multiplied in the land of Gilead.
 &nbsp; 10  And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites,
 who fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout
 all the east <I>land</I> of Gilead.
 &nbsp; 11  And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land
 of Bashan unto Salchah:
 &nbsp; 12  Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and
 Shaphat in Bashan.
 &nbsp; 13  And their brethren of the house of their fathers <I>were,</I>
 Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and
 Zia, and Heber, seven.
 &nbsp; 14  These <I>are</I> the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son
 of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of
 Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;
 &nbsp; 15  Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house
 of their fathers.
 &nbsp; 16  And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in
 all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders.
 &nbsp; 17  All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham
 king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an extract out of the genealogies,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the tribe of Reuben, where we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The reason why this tribe is thus postponed. It is confessed that 
 Reuben was the first-born of Israel, and, upon that account, might 
 challenge the precedency; but he forfeited his birthright by defiling 
 his father's concubine, and was, for that, sentenced <I>not to 
 excel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:4">Gen. xlix. 4</A>.

 Sin lessens men, thrusts them down from their excellency.
 Seventh-commandment sins especially leave an indelible stain upon men's 
 names and families, a reproach which time will not wipe away. Reuben's 
 seed, to the last, bear the disgrace of Reuben's sin. Yet, though that 
 tribe was degraded, it was not discarded or disinherited. The sullying 
 of the honour of an Israelite is not the losing of his happiness. 
 Reuben loses his birthright, yet it does not devolve upon Simeon the 
 next in order; for it was typical, and therefore must attend, not the 
 course of nature, but the choice of grace. The advantages of the 
 birthright were dominion and a double portion. Reuben having forfeited 
 these, it was thought too much that both should be transferred to any 
 one, and therefore they were divided.

 (1.) Joseph had the double portion; for two tribes descended from him,
 Ephraim and Manasseh, each of whom had a child's part (for so Jacob by 
 faith blessed them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:21,Ge+48:15,22">Heb. xi. 21; Gen. xlviii. 15, 22</A>),

 and each of those tribes was as considerable, and made as good a
 figure, as any one of the twelve, except Judah. But,

 (2.) Judah had the dominion; on him the dying patriarch entailed the
 sceptre, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>.</A>

 Of him came the chief ruler, David first, and, in the fulness of time,
 Messiah the Prince,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:2">Mic. v. 2</A>.

 This honour was secured to Judah, though the birthright was Joseph's;
 and, having this, he needed not envy Joseph the double portion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The genealogy of the princes of this tribe, the chief family of it 
 (many, no doubt, being omitted), to Beerah, who was head of this clan 
 when the king of Assyria carried them captive, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:4-6"><I>v.</I> 4-6</A>.

 Perhaps he is mentioned as prince of the Reubenites at that time
 because he did not do his part to prevent the captivity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The enlargement of the coasts of this tribe. They increasing, and 
 their cattle being multiplied, they crowded out their neighbours the 
 Hagarites, and extended their conquests, though not to the river 
 Euphrates, yet to the wilderness which abutted upon that river, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 Thus God did for his people as he promised them: he cast out the enemy
 from before them by little and little, and gave them their land as they 
 had occasion for it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:30">Exod. xxiii. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the tribe of Gad. Some great families of that tribe are here 
 named 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 seven that were the children of Abihail, whose pedigree is carried
 upwards from the son to the father

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>),

 as that 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>,

 is brought downwards from father to son. These genealogies were
 perfected in the days of Jotham king of Judah, but were begun some 
 years before, in the reign of Jeroboam II, king of Israel. What 
 particular reason there was for taking these accounts then does not 
 appear; but it was just before they were carried away captive by the 
 Assyrians, as appears

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:29,31">2 Kings xv. 29, 31</A>.

 When the judgments of God were ready to break out against them for
 their wretched degeneracy and apostasy then were they priding 
 themselves in their genealogies, that they were the children of the 
 covenant; as the Jews, in our Saviour's time, who, when they were ripe 
 for ruin, boasted, <I>We have Abraham to our father.</I> Or there might 
 be a special providence in it, and a favourable intimation that though 
 they were, for the present, cast out, they were not cast off for ever. 
 What we design to call for hereafter we keep an inventory of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of
 Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and
 to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, <I>were</I> four and forty
 thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the war.
 &nbsp; 19  And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and
 Nephish, and Nodab.
 &nbsp; 20  And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were
 delivered into their hand, and all that <I>were</I> with them: for
 they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them;
 because they put their trust in him.
 &nbsp; 21  And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty
 thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of
 asses two thousand, and of men a hundred thousand.
 &nbsp; 22  For there fell down many slain, because the war <I>was</I> of
 God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.
 &nbsp; 23  And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the
 land: they increased from Bashan unto Baal-hermon and Senir, and
 unto mount Hermon.
 &nbsp; 24  And these <I>were</I> the heads of the house of their fathers,
 even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and
 Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, <I>and</I>
 heads of the house of their fathers.
 &nbsp; 25  And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and
 went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God
 destroyed before them.
 &nbsp; 26  And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of
 Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria, and
 he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and
 the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and
 Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The heads of the half-tribe of Manasseh, that were seated on the other 
 side Jordan, are named here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 Their lot, at first, was Bashan only; but afterwards they increased so
 much in wealth and power that they spread far north, even unto Hermon.
 Two things only are here recorded concerning these tribes on the other 
 side Jordan, in which they were all concerned. They all shared,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In a glorious victory over the Hagarites, so the Ishmaelites were 
 now called, to remind them that they were <I>the sons of the 
 bond-woman,</I> that was <I>cast out.</I> We are not told when this 
 victory was obtained: whether it be the same with that of the 
 Reubenites (which is said 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A> 

 to be <I>in the days of Saul</I>), or whether that success of one of
 these tribes animated and excited the other two to join with them in 
 another expedition, is not certain. It seems, though in Saul's time the 
 common interests of the kingdom were weak and low, some of the tribes 
 that acted separately did well for themselves. We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What a brave army these frontier-tribes brought into the field 
 against the Hagarites, 44,000 men and upwards, all strong, and brave, 
 and skilful in war, so many effective men, that knew how to manage 
 their weapons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 How much more considerable might Israel have been than they were in the
 time of the judges if all the tribes had acted in conjunction!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What course they took to engage God for them: They <I>cried to 
 God,</I> and <I>put their trust in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Now they acted as Israelites indeed.

 (1.) As the seed of believing Abraham, they <I>put their trust in
 God.</I> Though they had a powerful army, they relied not on that, but 
 on the divine power. They depended on the commission they had from God 
 to wage war with their neighbours for the enlarging of their coasts, if 
 there was occasion, even with those that were very far off, besides the 
 devoted nations. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:15">Deut. xx. 15</A>.

 They depended on God's providence to give them success. 

 (2.) As the seed of praying Jacob, <I>they cried unto God,</I>
 especially <I>in the battle,</I> when perhaps, at first, they were in 
 danger of being overpowered. See the like done,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:14">2 Chron. xiii. 14</A>.

 In distress, God expects we should cry to him; he distrains upon us for
 this tribute, this rent. In our spiritual conflicts, we must look up to 
 heaven for strength; and it is the believing prayer that will be the 
 prevailing prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We are told what success they had: <I>God was entreated of them,</I> 
 though need drove them to him; so ready is he to hear and answer 
 prayer. They were helped against their enemies; for God never yet 
 failed any that trusted in him. And then they routed the enemy's army,
 though far superior in number to theirs, slew many 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 took 100,000 prisoners, enriched themselves greatly with the spoil, and
 settled themselves in their country

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>),

 and all this <I>because the war was of God,</I> undertaken in his fear
 and carried on in a dependence upon him. If the battle be the Lord's, 
 there is reason to hope it will be successful. Then we may expect to 
 prosper in any enterprise, and then only, when we take God along with 
 us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They shared, at length, in an inglorious captivity. Had they kept 
 close to God and their duty, they would have continued to enjoy both 
 their ancient lot and their new conquests; but they <I>transgressed 
 against the God of their fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 They lay upon the borders, and conversed most with the neighbouring
 nations, by which means they learned their idolatrous usages and 
 transmitted the infection to the other tribes; for this God had a 
 controversy with them. He was <I>a husband to them,</I> and no marvel 
 that his jealousy burnt like fire when they <I>went a whoring after 
 other gods.</I> Justly is a bill of divorce given to the adulteress. 
 <I>God stirred up the spirit of the kings of Assyria,</I> first one and 
 then another, against them, served his own purposes by the designs of 
 those ambitious monarchs, employed them to chastise these revolters 
 first, and, when that humbled them not, then wholly to <I>root them 
 out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 These tribes were first placed, and they were first displaced. They
 would have the best land, not considering that it lay most exposed. But 
 those who are governed more by sense than by reason or faith in their 
 choices may expect to fare accordingly.</P>
