 The story of this chapter we had just as it is here related in the
 story of the reign of Ahab king of Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:41-50">1 Kings xxii.</A>

 There it looks more creditable to Ahab than any thing else recorded of
 him that he was in league with so good a man as Jehoshaphat; here it is 
 a great blemish in the reign of Jehoshaphat that he thus connected 
 himself with so bad a man as Ahab. Here is, 

 I. The alliance he contracted himself with Ahab, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. His consent to join with him in his expedition for the recovery of
 Ramoth-Gilead out of the hands of the Syrians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 III. Their consulting with the prophets, false and true, before they
 went, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:4-27">ver. 4-27</A>.

 IV. The success of their expedition. Jehoshaphat hardly escaped 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+1*;28-32">ver. 28-32</A>)
 
 and Ahab received his death's wound, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:33,34">ver. 33, 34</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and
 joined affinity with Ahab.
 &nbsp; 2  And after <I>certain</I> years he went down to Ahab to Samaria.
 And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the
 people that <I>he had</I> with him, and persuaded him to go up <I>with
 him</I> to Ramoth-gilead.
 &nbsp; 3  And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
 Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I <I>am</I>
 as thou <I>art,</I> and my people as thy people; and <I>we will be</I> with
 thee in the war.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Jehoshaphat growing greater. It was said before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:5"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 5</A>)

 that he had <I>riches and honour in abundance;</I> and here it is said
 again that his wealth and honour increased upon him by piety and good 
 management.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Not growing wiser, else he would not have joined with Ahab, that 
 degenerate Israelite, who had sold himself to work wickedness. What 
 good could he get by a man that was so bad? What good could he do to a 
 man that was so obstinately wicked--an idolater, a persecutor? With him
 he joined in affinity, that is, married his son Jehoram to Ahab's 
 daughter Athaliah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This was the worst match that ever was made by any of the house of 
 David. I wonder what Jehoshaphat could promise himself by it. 

 (1.) Perhaps pride made the match, as it does many a one, which speeds
 accordingly. His religion forbade him to marry his son to a daughter of 
 any of the heathen princes that were about him--<I>Thou shalt not take 
 their daughters to thy sons;</I> and, having riches and honour in 
 abundance, he thought it a disparagement to marry him to a subject. A 
 king's daughter it must be, and therefore Ahab's, little considering 
 that Jezebel was her mother.

 (2.) Some think he did it in policy, hoping by this expedient to unite
 the kingdoms in his son, Ahab perhaps flattering him with hopes that he 
 would make him his heir, when he intended no such thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This match drew Jehoshaphat, 

 (1.) Into an intimate familiarity with Ahab. He paid him a visit at
 Samaria, and Ahab, proud of the honour which Jehoshaphat did him, gave 
 him a very splendid entertainment, according to the splendour of those 
 times: He <I>killed sheep and oxen for him,</I> plain meat, <I>in 
 abundance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 In this Jehoshaphat did not walk so closely as he should have done in
 the ways of his father David, who <I>hated the congregation of 
 evil-doers and would not sit with the wicked</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:5">Ps. xxvi. 5</A>),

 nor desired to <I>eat of their dainties,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:4">Ps. cxli. 4</A>.

 (2.) Into a league with Ahab against the Syrians. Ahab persuaded him to
 join forces with him in an expedition for the recovery of 
 Ramoth-Gilead, a city in the tribe of Gad, on the other side Jordan. 
 Did not Ahab know that that, and all the other cities of Israel, did of 
 right belong to Jehoshaphat, as heir of the house of David? With what 
 face then could he ask Jehoshaphat to assist him in recovering it for 
 himself, whose title to the crown was usurped and precarious? Yet 
 Jehoshaphat, an easy man, yields to go with him: <I>I am as thou 
 art,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Some men's kindnesses are dangerous, as well as their society
 infectious. The feast Ahab made for Jehoshaphat was designed only to 
 wheedle him into the expedition. The <I>kisses of an enemy are 
 deceitful.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
 thee, at the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to day.
 &nbsp; 5  Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets
 four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead
 to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will
 deliver <I>it</I> into the king's hand.
 &nbsp; 6  But Jehoshaphat said, <I>Is there</I> not here a prophet of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> besides, that we might enquire of him?
 &nbsp; 7  And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, <I>There is</I> yet
 one man, by whom we may enquire of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: but I hate him; for
 he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same <I>is</I>
 Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king
 say so.
 &nbsp; 8  And the king of Israel called for one <I>of his</I> officers, and
 said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
 &nbsp; 9  And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat
 either of them on his throne, clothed in <I>their</I> robes, and they
 sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria;
 and all the prophets prophesied before them.
 &nbsp; 10  And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of
 iron, and said, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, With these thou shalt push
 Syria until they be consumed.
 &nbsp; 11  And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
 Ramoth-gilead, and prosper: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall deliver <I>it</I> into
 the hand of the king.
 &nbsp; 12  And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him,
 saying, Behold, the words of the prophets <I>declare</I> good to the
 king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be
 like one of theirs, and speak thou good.
 &nbsp; 13  And Micaiah said, <I>As</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth, even what my God
 saith, that will I speak.
 &nbsp; 14  And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him,
 Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I
 forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be
 delivered into your hand.
 &nbsp; 15  And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee
 that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>?
 &nbsp; 16  Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the
 mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said,
 These have no master; let them return <I>therefore</I> every man to
 his house in peace.
 &nbsp; 17  And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
 thee <I>that</I> he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?
 &nbsp; 18  Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; I saw
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven
 standing on his right hand and <I>on</I> his left.
 &nbsp; 19  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel,
 that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spake saying
 after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
 &nbsp; 20  Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 said, I will entice him. And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto him, Wherewith?
 &nbsp; 21  And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the
 mouth of all his prophets. And <I>the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT></I> said, Thou shalt entice
 <I>him,</I> and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do <I>even</I> so.
 &nbsp; 22  Now therefore, behold, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath put a lying spirit in
 the mouth of these thy prophets, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath spoken evil
 against thee.
 &nbsp; 23  Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote
 Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> from me to speak unto thee?
 &nbsp; 24  And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when
 thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
 &nbsp; 25  Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him
 back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's
 son;
 &nbsp; 26  And say, Thus saith the king, Put this <I>fellow</I> in the
 prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of
 affliction, until I return in peace.
 &nbsp; 27  And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, <I>then</I>
 hath not the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye
 people.

 This is almost word for word the same with what we had,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:41-50">1 Kings xxii.</A>

 We will not repeat what was there said, nor have we much to add, but
 may take occasion to think, 

 1. Of the great duty of acknowledging God in all our ways <I>and
 enquiring at his word,</I> whatever we undertake.  Jehoshaphat was not 
 willing to proceed till he had done this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 By particular believing prayer, by an unbiased consultation of the
 scripture and our own consciences, and by an observant regard to the 
 hints of providence, we may make such enquiries and very much to our 
 satisfaction.

 2. Of the great danger of bad company even to good men.  Those that
 have more wisdom, grace, and resolution, cannot be sure that they can 
 converse familiarly with wicked people and get no hurt by them. 
 Jehoshaphat here, in complaisance to Ahab, sits in his robes, patiently 
 hearing the false prophets speaking lies in the name of the Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 can scarcely find in his heart to give him a too mild and gentle
 reproof for hating a prophet of the Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and dares not rebuke that false prophet who basely abused the faithful
 seer nor oppose Ahab who committed him to prison. Those who venture 
 among the seats of the scornful cannot come off without a great deal of 
 the guilt attaching to at least the omission of their duty, unless they 
 have such measures of wisdom and courage as few can pretend to. 

 3. Of the unhappiness of those who are surrounded with flatterers,
 especially flattering prophets, who cry peace to them and prophesy 
 nothing but smooth things. Thus was Ahab cheated into his ruin, and 
 justly; for he hearkened to such, and preferred those that humoured him 
 before a good prophet that gave him fair warning of his danger. Those 
 do best for themselves that give their friends leave, and particularly 
 their ministers, to deal plainly and faithfully with them, and take 
 their reproofs not only patiently, but kindly. That counsel is not 
 always best for us that is most pleasing to us. 

 4. Of the power of Satan, by the divine permission, <I>in the children
 of disobedience.</I> One lying spirit can make 400 lying prophets and 
 make use of them to deceive Ahab,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 The devil becomes a murderer by being a liar and destroys men by
 deceiving them. 

 5. Of the justice of God in giving those up to strong delusions, to
 believe a lie, who will not receive the love of the truth, but rebel 
 against it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Let the <I>lying spirit prevail</I> to entice those to their ruin that
 will not be persuaded to their duty and happiness. 

 6. Of the hard case of faithful ministers, whose lot it has often been
 to be hated, and persecuted, and ill-treated, for being true to their 
 God and just and kind to the souls of men. Micaiah, for discharging a 
 good conscience, was buffeted, imprisoned, and condemned to the bread 
 and water of affliction. But he could with assurance appeal to the 
 issue, as all those may do who are persecuted for their faithfulness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 The day will declare who is in the right and who in the wrong, when
 Christ will appear, to the unspeakable consolation of his persecuted 
 people and the everlasting confusion of their persecutors, who will be 
 made <I>to see in that day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
 up to Ramoth-gilead.
 &nbsp; 29  And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will
 disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy
 robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to
 the battle.
 &nbsp; 30  Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the
 chariots that <I>were</I> with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or
 great, save only with the king of Israel.
 &nbsp; 31  And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
 Jehoshaphat, that they said, It <I>is</I> the king of Israel.
 Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat
 cried out, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> helped him; and God moved them <I>to
 depart</I> from him.
 &nbsp; 32  For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots
 perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back
 again from pursuing him.
 &nbsp; 33  And a <I>certain</I> man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the
 king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he
 said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry
 me out of the host; for I am wounded.
 &nbsp; 34  And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of
 Israel stayed <I>himself</I> up in <I>his</I> chariot against the Syrians
 until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, 

 1. Good Jehoshaphat exposing himself in his robes, thereby endangered,
 and yet delivered. We have reason to think that Ahab, while he 
 pretended friendship, really aimed at Jehoshaphat's life, to take him 
 off, that he might have the management of his successor, who was his 
 son-in-law, else he would never have advised him to enter into the 
 battle with his robes on, which was but to make himself an easy mark to 
 the enemy: and, if really he intended that, it was as unprincipled a 
 piece of treachery as ever man was guilty of, and justly was he himself 
 taken in the pit he digged for his friend. The enemy had soon an eye 
 upon the robes, and vigorously attacked the unwary prince who now, when 
 it was too late, wished himself in the habit of the poorest soldier, 
 rather than in his princely raiment. He cried out, either to his
 friends to relieve him (but Ahab took no care of that), or to his 
 enemies, to rectify their mistake, and let them know that he was not 
 the king of Israel. Or perhaps he cried to God for succour and 
 deliverance (to whom else should he cry?) and he found it was not in 
 vain: <I>The Lord helped him out</I> of his distress, by <I>moving the 
 captains to depart from him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 God has all men's hearts in his hand, and turns them as he pleases,
 contrary to their own first intentions, to serve his purposes. Many are 
 moved unaccountably both to themselves and others, but an invisible 
 power moves them. 

 2.  Wicked Ahab disguising himself, arming himself thereby as he
 thought securing himself, and yet slain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+18:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 No art, no arms, can save those whom God has appointed to ruin. What
 can hurt those whom God will protect? And what can shelter those whom 
 God will destroy?  Jehoshaphat is safe in his robes, Ahab killed in his 
 armour; for the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the 
 strong.</P>
