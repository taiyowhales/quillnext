 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein
 Solomon had built the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and his own house,
 &nbsp; 2  That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon
 built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.
 &nbsp; 3  And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.
 &nbsp; 4  And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store
 cities, which he built in Hamath.
 &nbsp; 5  Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the nether,
 fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;
 &nbsp; 6  And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and
 all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all
 that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and
 throughout all the land of his dominion.
 &nbsp; 7  <I>As for</I> all the people <I>that were</I> left of the Hittites, and
 the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
 Jebusites, which <I>were</I> not of Israel,
 &nbsp; 8  <I>But</I> of their children, who were left after them in the
 land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon
 make to pay tribute until this day.
 &nbsp; 9  But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants
 for his work; but they <I>were</I> men of war, and chief of his
 captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen.
 &nbsp; 10  And these <I>were</I> the chief of king Solomon's officers,
 <I>even</I> two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.
 &nbsp; 11  And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the
 city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he
 said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of
 Israel, because <I>the places are</I> holy, whereunto the ark of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath come.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This we had 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+9:10-24">1 Kings ix. 10-24</A>,
 
 and therefore shall only observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Though Solomon was a man of great learning and knowledge, yet he 
 spent his days, not in contemplation, but in action, not in his study, 
 but in his country, in building cities and fortifying them, in a time 
 of peace preparing for a time of war, which is as much a man's business 
 as it is in summer to provide food for winter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. As he was a man of business himself, and did not consult his own 
 ease, so he employed a great many hands, kept abundance of people to 
 work. It is the interest of a state by all means possible to promote 
 and encourage industry, and to keep its subjects from idleness. A great 
 many strangers there were in Israel, many that remained of the 
 Canaanites; and they were welcome to live there, but not to live and do 
 nothing. The men of Laish, who had no business, were an easy prey to 
 the invaders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:7">Judg. xviii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. When Solomon had begun with building the house of God, and made 
 good work and quick work of that, he prospered in all his undertakings, 
 so that <I>he built all that he desired to build,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Those who have a genius for building find that one project draws on
 another, and the latter must amend and improve the former. Now observe,

 1. How the divine providence gratified even Solomon's humour, and gave
 him success, not only in all that he needed to build and that it was 
 for his advantage to build, but in all that he had a mind to build. So 
 indulgent a Father God is sometimes to the innocent desires of his 
 children that serve him. Thus he pleased Jacob with that promise, 
 <I>Joseph shall put his hand on thy eyes.</I> 

 2. Solomon knew how to set bounds to his desires. He was not one of
 those that enlarge them endlessly, and can never be satisfied, but knew 
 when to draw in; for he finished all he desired, and then he desired no 
 more. He did not sit down and fret that he had not more cities to 
 build, as Alexander did that he had not more worlds to conquer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:5">Hab. ii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That one reason why Solomon built a palace on purpose for the 
 queen, and removed her and her court to it, was because he thought it 
 by no means proper that she should <I>dwell in the house of David</I> 
 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 considering that that had been a place of great piety, and perhaps her 
 house was a place of great vanity. She was proselyted, it is likely, to 
 the Jewish religion; but it is a question whether all her servants 
 were. Perhaps they had among them the idols of Egypt, and a great deal 
 of profaneness and debauchery. Now, though Solomon had not zeal and 
 courage enough to suppress and punish what was amiss there, yet he so 
 far consulted the honour of his father's memory that he would not 
 suffer that place to be thus profaned where the ark of God had been and 
 where holy David had prayed many a good prayer and sung many a sweet 
 psalm. Not that all the places where the ark had been were so holy as 
 never to be put to a common use; for then the houses of Abinadab and 
 Obed-edom must have been so. But the place where it had been so long, 
 and had been so publicly attended on, was so venerable that it was not 
 fit to be the place of so much gaiety, not to say iniquity, as was to 
 be found, I fear, in the court that Pharaoh's daughter kept. Note, 
 Between things sacred and things common the ancient landmarks ought to 
 be kept up. It was an outer-court of the temple that was the <I>court 
 of the women.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> on the
 altar of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which he had built before the porch,
 &nbsp; 13  Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to
 the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
 and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, <I>even</I> in the
 feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the
 feast of tabernacles.
 &nbsp; 14  And he appointed, according to the order of David his
 father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the
 Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the
 priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by
 their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God
 commanded.
 &nbsp; 15  And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto
 the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the
 treasures.
 &nbsp; 16  Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the
 foundation of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and until it was finished.
 <I>So</I> the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was perfected.
 &nbsp; 17  Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, at the sea
 side in the land of Edom.
 &nbsp; 18  And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and
 servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the
 servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and
 fifty talents of gold, and brought <I>them</I> to king Solomon.

 Here is, 

 I. Solomon's devotion. The building of the temple was in order to the
 service of the temple. Whatever cost he was at in rearing the 
 structure, if he had neglected the worship that was to be performed 
 there, it would all have been to no purpose. Assisting the devotion of 
 others will not atone for our own neglects. When Solomon had built the 
 temple,

 1. He kept up the holy sacrifices there, according to the law of Moses,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+8:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 In vain had the altar been built, and in vain had fire come down from
 heaven, if sacrifices had not been constantly brought as the food of 
 the altar and the fuel of that fire. There were daily sacrifices, <I>a 
 certain rate every day,</I> as duly as the day came, weekly sacrifices 
 on the sabbath, double to what was offered on other days, monthly 
 sacrifices <I>on the new moons,</I> and yearly sacrifices at the three 
 solemn feasts. Those are spiritual sacrifices that are now required of 
 us, which we are to bring daily and weekly; and it is good to be in a 
 settled method of devotion.

 2. He kept up the holy songs there, according to the <I>law of
 David,</I> who is here called the <I>man of God,</I> as Moses was, 
 because he was both instructed and authorised of God to make these 
 establishments; and Solomon took care to see them observed <I>as the 
 duty of every day required,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Solomon, though a wise and great man and the builder of the temple, did
 not attempt to amend, alter, or add to what the man of God had, in 
 God's name, commanded, but closely adhered to that, and used his 
 authority to have that duly observed; and then <I>none departed from 
 the commandment of the king concerning any matter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 He observed God's laws, and then all obeyed his orders. When the
 service of the temple was put into this good order, then it is said, 
 <I>The house of the Lord was perfected,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The work was the main matter, not the place; the temple was unfinished
 till all this was done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Solomon's merchandise. He did himself in person visit the sea-port 
 towns of Eloth and Ezion-geber; for those that deal much in the world 
 will find it their interest, as far as they can, to inspect their 
 affairs themselves and to see with their own eyes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Canaan was a rich country, and yet must send to Ophir for gold; the
 Israelites were a wise and understanding people, and yet must be 
 beholden to the king of Tyre for <I>men that had knowledge of the 
 seas,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Yet Canaan was God's peculiar land, and Israel God's peculiar people.
 This teaches us that grace, and not gold, is the best riches, and 
 acquaintance with God and his law, not with arts and sciences, the best 
 knowledge.</P>
