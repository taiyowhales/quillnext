 We left the temple-work at a full stop; but, being God's work, it shall 
 be revived, and here we have an account of the reviving of it. It was 
 hindered by might and power, but it was set a-going again "by the 
 Spirit of the Lord of hosts." Now here we are told how that blessed 
 Spirit, 

 I. Warmed its cool-hearted friends and excited them to built, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Cooled its hot-headed enemies, and brought them to better tempers;
 for, though they secretly disliked the work as much as those in the
 foregoing chapter, yet, 

 1. They were more mild towards the builders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:3-5">ver.  3-5</A>.

 2. They were more fair in their representation of the matter to the
 king, of which we have here an account, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:6-17">
 ver.  6-17</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son
 of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that <I>were</I> in Judah and
 Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, <I>even</I> unto them.
 &nbsp; 2  Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the
 son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which <I>is</I> at
 Jerusalem: and with them <I>were</I> the prophets of God helping them.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some reckon that the building of the temple was suspended for only nine 
 years; I am willing to believe that fifteen years were the utmost. 
 During this time they had an altar and a tabernacle, which no doubt 
 they made use of. When we cannot do what we would we must do what we 
 can in the service of God, and be sorry we can do no better. But the 
 counsellors that were hired to hinder the work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:5"><I>ch.</I> iv. 5</A>)

 told them, and perhaps with a pretence to inspiration, that the time
 had not come for the building of the temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:2">Hag. i. 2</A>),

 urging that it was long ere the time came for the building of Solomon's
 temple; and thus the people were made easy in their own <I>ceiled 
 houses,</I> while <I>God's house lay waste.</I> Now here we are told 
 how life was put into that good cause which seemed to lie dead.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They had two good ministers, who, in God's name, earnestly persuaded 
 them to put the wheel of business in motion again.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who these ministers were, namely, the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, 
 who both began to prophesy in the second year of Darius, as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:1,Zec+1:1">Hag. i. 1; Zech. i. 1</A>.

 Note,

 (1.) The temple of God among men is to be built by prophecy, not by
 secular force (that often hinders it, but seldom furthers it), but by 
 <I>the word of God.</I> As the <I>weapons of our warfare,</I> so the 
 instruments of our building, <I>are not carnal,</I> but 
 <I>spiritual,</I> and they are the ministers of the gospel that are the 
 master-builders. 

 (2.) It is the business of God's prophets to stir up God's people to 
 that which is good, and to help them in it, to strengthen their hands, 
 and, by suitable considerations fetched from the word of God, to 
 quicken them to their duty and encourage them in it.

 (3.) It is a sign that God has mercy in store for a people when he 
 raises up prophets among them to be their helpers in the way and work 
 of God, their guides, overseers, and rulers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To whom they were sent. They prophesied unto the <I>Jews</I> (for, 
 as to them pertained the giving of the law, so also the gift of 
 prophecy, and therefore they are called <I>the children of the 
 prophets,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:25">Acts iii. 25</A>,

 because they were educated under their tuition and instruction),
 <I>even unto them, upon them,</I> even <I>upon them</I> (so it is in 
 the original), as Ezekiel prophesied <I>upon the dry bones,</I> that 
 they might live,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:4">Ezek. xxxvii. 4</A>.

 They prophesied <I>against</I> them (so bishop Patrick), for they
 reproved them because they did not build the temple. The word of God, 
 if it be not received now as a testimony to us, will be received now as 
 a testimony to us, will be received another day as a testimony against 
 us, and will judge us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Who sent them. They prophesied in the name, or (as some read it) 
 <I>in the cause,</I> or for the sake, <I>of the God of Israel;</I> they 
 spoke by commission from him, and argued from his authority over them, 
 his interest in them, and the concern of his glory among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They had two good magistrates, who were forward and active in this 
 work. Zerubbabel their chief prince, and Jeshua their chief priest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Those that are in places of dignity and power ought with their dignity
 to put honour upon and with their power to put life into every good 
 work: thus it becomes those that preceded, and those that preside, with 
 an exemplary care and zeal to <I>fulfil all righteousness</I> and to 
 <I>go before in a good work.</I> These great men thought it no 
 disparagement to them, but a happiness, to be taught and prescribed to 
 by the prophets of the Lord, and were glad of their help in reviving 
 this good work. Read the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:1,2,Hag+1:1-15">first chapter of the prophecy of Haggai</A>

 here (for that is the best comment on these two verses) and see what
 great things God does by his word, which he magnifies above all his 
 name, and by his Spirit working with it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side
 the river, and Shethar-boznai, and their companions, and said thus
 unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to
 make up this wall?
 &nbsp; 4  Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names
 of the men that make this building?
 &nbsp; 5  But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews,
 that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to
 Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this
 <I>matter.</I>
 &nbsp; 6  The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the
 river, and Shethar-boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites,
 which <I>were</I> on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:
 &nbsp; 7  They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto
 Darius the king, all peace.
 &nbsp; 8  Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of
 Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great
 stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast
 on, and prospereth in their hands.
 &nbsp; 9  Then asked we those elders, <I>and</I> said unto them thus, Who
 commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?
 &nbsp; 10  We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might
 write the names of the men that <I>were</I> the chief of them.
 &nbsp; 11  And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the
 servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that
 was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel
 builded and set up.
 &nbsp; 12  But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven
 unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king
 of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried
 the people away into Babylon.
 &nbsp; 13  But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon <I>the
 same</I> king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.
 &nbsp; 14  And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God,
 which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that <I>was</I> in
 Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did
 Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were
 delivered unto <I>one,</I> whose name <I>was</I> Sheshbazzar, whom he had
 made governor;
 &nbsp; 15  And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into
 the temple that <I>is</I> in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be
 builded in his place.
 &nbsp; 16  Then came the same Sheshbazzar, <I>and</I> laid the foundation of
 the house of God which <I>is</I> in Jerusalem: and since that time
 even until now hath it been in building, and <I>yet</I> it is not
 finished.
 &nbsp; 17  Now therefore, if <I>it seem</I> good to the king, let there be
 search made in the king's treasure house, which <I>is</I> there at
 Babylon, whether it be <I>so,</I> that a decree was made of Cyrus the
 king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king
 send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, 

 I. The cognizance which their neighbours soon took of the reviving of 
 this good work. A jealous eye, it seems, they had upon them, and no 
 sooner did the Spirit of God stir up the friends of the temple to 
 appear for it than the evil spirit stirred up its enemies to appear 
 against it. While the people built and ceiled their own houses their 
 enemies gave them no molestation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:4">Hag. i. 4</A>),

 though the king's order was to put a stop to the building of the city

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:21"><I>ch.</I> iv. 21</A>);

 but when they fell to work again at the temple then the alarm was
 taken, and all heads were at work to hinder them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 The adversaries are here named: <I>Tatnai</I> and
 <I>Shethar-boznai.</I> The governors we read of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:1-24"><I>ch.</I> iv.</A>)

 were, it is probable, displaced at the beginning of this reign, as is
 usual. It is the policy of princes often to change their deputies, 
 proconsuls, and rulers of provinces. These, though real enemies to the 
 building of the temple, were men of better temper than the other, and 
 made some conscience of telling truth. If <I>all men have not faith</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:2">2 Thess. iii. 2</A>),

 it is well some have, and a sense of honour. The church's enemies are
 not all equally wicked and unreasonable. The historian begins to relate 
 what passed between the builders and those inquisitors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>),

 but breaks off his account, and refers to the ensuing copy of the
 letter they sent to the king, where the same appears more fully and at 
 large, which he began to abridge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 or make an extract out of, though, upon second thoughts, he inserted
 the whole.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The care which the divine Providence took of this good work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 <I>The eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews,</I> who were
 active in the work, so that their enemies could not cause them to 
 cease, as they would have done, till the matter came to Darius. They 
 desired they would only cease till they had instructions from the king 
 about it. But they would not so much as yield them that, for <I>the eye 
 of God was upon them,</I> even their God. And, 

 1. That baffled their enemies, infatuated and enfeebled them, and 
 protected the builders from their malicious designs. While we are 
 employed in God's work we are taken under his special protection; his 
 eye is upon us for good, seven eyes upon one stone in his temple; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:9,4:10">Zech. iii. 9; iv. 10</A>.

 2. That quickened them. The elders of the Jews saw <I>the eye of God
 upon them,</I> to observe what they did and own them in what they did 
 well, and then they had courage enough to face their enemies and to go 
 on vigorously with their work, notwithstanding all the opposition they 
 met with. Our eye upon God, observing his eye upon us, will keep us to
 our duty and encourage us in it when the difficulties are ever so 
 discouraging.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The account they sent to the king of this matter, in which we may 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How fully the elders of the Jews gave the Samaritans an account of 
 their proceedings. They, finding them both busy and prosperous, that 
 all hands were at work to run up this building and that it went on 
 rapidly, put these questions to them:--"By what authority do you do
 these things, and who gave you that authority? Who set you to work? 
 Have you that which will bear you out?" To this they answered that they 
 had sufficient warrant to do what they did; for, 

 (1.) "<I>We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth.</I> The
 God we worship is not a local deity, and therefore we cannot be charged 
 with making a faction, or setting up a sect, in building this temple to 
 his honour: but we pay our homage to a God on whom the whole creation 
 depends, and therefore ought to be protected and assisted by all and 
 hindered by none." It is the wisdom as well as duty of kings to 
 countenance the servants of the <I>God of heaven.</I>

 (2.) "We have a prescription to this house; it was built for the honour
 of our God by Solomon many ages ago. It is no novel invention of our 
 own; we are but <I>raising the foundations of many generations,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:12">Isa. lviii. 12</A>.

 (3.) "It was to punish us for our sins that we were, for a time, put
 out of the possession of this house; not because the gods of the 
 nations had prevailed against our God, but because we had provoked him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 for which he delivered us and our temple into the hands of the king of
 Babylon, but never intended thereby to put a final period to our 
 religion. We were only suspended for a time, not deprived for ever."

 (4.) "We have the royal decree of Cyrus to justify us and bear us out
 in what we do. He not only permitted and allowed us, but charged and 
 commanded us to build this house 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 and to build it in its place
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 the same place where it had stood before." He ordered this, not only in
 compassion to the Jews, but in veneration of their God, saying, <I>He 
 is the God.</I> He also delivered the vessels of the temple to one whom 
 he entrusted to see them restored to their ancient place and use, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 And they had these to show in confirmation of what they alleged.

 (5.) "The building was begun according to this order as soon as ever we
 had returned, so that we have not forfeited the benefit of the order 
 for want of pursuing it in time; still it has been in building, but, 
 because we have met with opposition, it is not finished." But, observe, 
 they mention not the falsehood and malice of the former governors, nor 
 make any complaint of them, though they had cause enough, to teach us 
 not to render bitterness for bitterness, nor the most just reproach for 
 that which is most unjust, but to think it enough if we can obtain fair 
 treatment for the future, without an invidious reference to former 
 injuries, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This is the account they give of their proceedings, not asking what
 authority they had to examine them, nor upbraiding them with their 
 idolatry, and superstitions, and medley religion. Let us learn hence 
 with meekness and fear to <I>give a reason of the hope that is in 
 us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:15">1 Pet. iii. 15</A>),

 rightly to understand, and then readily to declare, what we do in God's
 service and why we do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How fairly the Samaritans represented this to the king. 

 (1.) They called the temple at Jerusalem the <I>house of the great
 God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 for though the Samaritans, as it should seem, had yet gods many and
 lords many, they owned the God of Israel to be the <I>great God,</I> 
 who is above all gods. "It is the house of the <I>great God,</I> and 
 therefore we dare not oppose the building of it without orders from 
 thee."

 (2.) They told him truly what was done, not stating, as their 
 predecessors did, that they were fortifying the city as if they 
 intended war, but only that they were rearing the temple as those that 
 intended worship, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 (3.) They fully represented their plea, told him what they had to say 
 for themselves, and were willing that the cause should be set in a true 
 light.

 (4.) They left it to the king to consult the records whether Cyrus had
 indeed made such a decree, and then to give directions as he should 
 think fit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 We have reason to think that if Artaxerxes, in the foregoing chapter,
 had had the Jews' cause as fairly represented to him as it was here to 
 Darius, he would not have ordered the work to be hindered. God's people 
 could not be persecuted if they were not belied, could not be baited if 
 they were not dressed up in bears' skins. Let but the cause of God and 
 truth be fairly stated, and fairly heard, and it will keep its 
 ground.</P>
