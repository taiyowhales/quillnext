 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Saying and doing are often two things: many are ready to say, "Let us 
 rise up and build," who sit still and do nothing, like that fair-spoken 
 son who said,"I go, Sir, but went not." The undertakers here were none 
 of those. As soon as they had resolved to build the wall about 
 Jerusalem they lost no time, but set about it presently, as we find in 
 this chapter. Let it never be said that we left that good work to be 
 done to-morrow which we might as well have done to-day. This chapter 
 gives an account of two things:--

 I. The names of the builders, which are recorded here to their honour,
 for they were such as herein discovered a great zeal for God and their 
 country, both a pious and a public spirit, a great degree both of 
 industry and courage; and what they did was fit to be thus largely 
 registered, both for their praise and for the encouragement of others 
 to follow their example. 

 II. The order of the building; they took it before them, and ended
 where they began. They repaired, 

 1. From the sheep-gate to the fish-gate,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 2. Thence to the old-gate,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 3. Thence to the valley-gate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:6-12">ver. 6-12</A>.

 4. Thence to the dung-gate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.

 5. Thence to the gate of the fountain,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:15">ver. 15</A>.

 6. Thence to the water-gate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:16-26">ver. 16-26</A>.

 7. Thence by the horse-gate to the sheep-gate again, where they began
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:27-32">ver. 27-32</A>),
 
 and so they brought their work quite round the city.</P>

 &nbsp; 2  And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to
 them builded Zaccur the son of Imri.
 &nbsp; 3  But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who <I>also</I>

 thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.
 &nbsp; 15  But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of
 Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered
 it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars
 thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden,
 and unto the stairs that go down from the city of David.
 &nbsp; 16  After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of
 the half part of Beth-zur, unto <I>the place</I> over against the
 sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto the
 house of the mighty.
 &nbsp; 17  After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next

 Keilah, in his part.
 &nbsp; 18  After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad,

 wall,</I> and the tower which lieth out from the king's high house,
 that <I>was</I> by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The best way to know how to divide this chapter is to observe how the 
 work was divided among the undertakers, that every one might know what 
 he had to do, and mind it accordingly with a holy emulation, and desire 
 to excel, yet without any contention, animosity, or separate interest. 
 No strife appears among them but which should do most for the public 
 good. Several things are observable in the account here given of the 
 building of the wall about Jerusalem:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That Eliashib the high priest, with his brethren the priests, led 
 the van in this troop of builders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Ministers should be foremost in every good work; for their office
 obliges them to teach and quicken by their example, as well as by their 
 doctrine. If there be labour in it, who so fit as they to work? if 
 danger, who so fit as they to venture? The dignity of the high priest 
 was very great, and obliged him to signalize himself in this service. 
 The priests repaired the <I>sheep-gate,</I> so called because through 
 it were brought the sheep that were to be sacrificed in the temple; and 
 therefore the priests undertook the repair of it because <I>the 
 offerings of the Lord made by fire were</I> their inheritance. And of 
 this gate only it is said that <I>they sanctified it</I> with the word 
 and prayer, and perhaps with sacrifices perhaps,

 1. Because it led to the temple; or, 

 2. Because with this the building of the wall began, and it is probable
 (though they were at work in all parts of the wall at the same time) 
 that this was first finished, and therefore at this gate they solemnly 
 committed their city and the walls of it to the divine protection; or, 
 
 3. Because the priests were the builders of it; and it becomes
 ministers above others, being themselves in a peculiar manner 
 sanctified to God, to sanctify to him all their performances, and to do 
 even their common actions <I>after a godly sort.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the undertakers were very many, who each took his share, some 
 more and some less, in this work, according as their ability was. Note, 
 What is to be done for the public good every one should assist in, and 
 further, to the utmost of his place and power. United force will 
 conquer that which no individual dares venture on. Many hands will make 
 light work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That many were active in this work who were not themselves 
 inhabitants of Jerusalem, and therefore consulted purely the public 
 welfare and not any private interest or advantage of their own. Here 
 are the men of Jericho with the first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 the men of Gibeon and Mizpah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and Zanoah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Every Israelite should lend a hand towards the building up of
 Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That several rulers, both of Jerusalem and of other cities, were 
 active in this work, thinking themselves bound in honour to do the 
 utmost that their wealth and power enabled them to do for the 
 furtherance of this good work. But it is observable that they are 
 called rulers of <I>part,</I> or the <I>half part,</I> of their 
 respective cities. One was <I>ruler of the half part of Jerusalem</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 another of part of Beth-haccerem
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 another of part of Mizpah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 another of <I>the half part of Beth-zur</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 
 one was ruler of <I>one half part,</I> and another of <I>the other half
 part, of Keilah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 Perhaps the Persian government would not entrust any one with a strong
 city, but appointed two to be a watch upon each other. Rome had two 
 consuls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is a just reproach fastened upon the nobles of Tekoa, that they 
 <I>put not their necks to the work of their Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 that is, they would not come under the yoke of an obligation to this
 service; as if the dignity and liberty of their peerage were their 
 discharge from serving God and doing good, which are indeed the highest 
 honour and the truest freedom. Let not nobles think any thing below 
 them by which they may advance the interests of their country; for what 
 else is their nobility good for but that it puts them in a higher and 
 larger sphere of usefulness than that in which inferior persons 
 move?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Two persons joined in repairing <I>the old gate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and so were co-founders, and shared the honour of it between them. The
 good work which we cannot compass ourselves we must be thankful to 
 those that will go partners with us in. Some think that this is called 
 the <I>old gate</I> because it belonged to the ancient Salem, which was 
 said to be first built by Melchizedek.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Several good honest tradesmen, as well as priests and rulers, were 
 active in this work--<I>goldsmiths, apothecaries, merchants,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:8,32"><I>v.</I> 8, 32</A>.

 They did not think their callings excused them, nor plead that they
 could not leave their shops to attend the public business, knowing that 
 what they lost would certainly be made up to them by the blessing of 
 God upon their callings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. Some ladies are spoken of as helping forward this work--<I>Shallum
 and his daughters</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 who, though not capable of personal service, yet having their portions
 in their own hands, or being rich widows, contributed money for buying 
 materials and paying workmen. St. Paul speaks of some good women that
 <I>laboured with him in the gospel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:3">Phil. iv. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IX. Of some it is said that they repaired <I>over against their 
 houses</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:10,23,28,29"><I>v.</I> 10, 23, 28, 29</A>),

 and of one (who, it is likely, was only a lodger) that he repaired
 <I>over against his chamber,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 When a general good work is to be done each should apply himself to
 that part of it that falls nearest to him and is within his reach. If 
 every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if 
 every one will mend one, we shall be all mended. If he that has but a 
 chamber will repair before that, he does his part.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 X. Of one it is said that he <I>earnestly</I> repaired that which fell 
 to his share 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)--

 he did it with an inflamed zeal; not that others were cold or
 indifferent, but he was the most vigorous of any of them and 
 consequently made himself remarkable. It is good to be thus
 <I>zealously affected in a good thin;</I> and it is probable that this 
 good man's zeal provoked very many to take the more pains and make the 
 more haste.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 XI. Of one of these builders it is observed that he was <I>the sixth 
 son</I> of his father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 His five elder brethren, it seems, laid not their hand to this work,
 but he did. In doing that which is good we need not stay to see our 
 elders go before us; if they decline it, it does not therefore follow 
 that we must. Thus the younger brother, if he be the better man, and 
 does God and his generation better service, is indeed the better 
 gentleman; those are most honourable that are most useful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 XII. Some of those that had <I>first done helped their fellows,</I> and 
 undertook another share where they saw there was most need. Meremoth 
 repaired, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>

 and again,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 And the Tekoites, besides the piece they repaired

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 
 undertook another piece
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 which is the more remarkable because their nobles set them a bad
 example by withdrawing from the service, which, instead of serving them 
 for an excuse to sit still, perhaps made them the more forward to do 
 double work, that by their zeal they might either shame or atone for 
 the covetousness and carelessness of their nobles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is no mention of any particular share that Nehemiah 
 himself had in this work. A name-sake of his is mentioned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 But did he do nothing? Yes, though he undertook not any particular
 piece of the wall, yet he did more than any of them, for he had the 
 oversight of them all; half of his servants worked where there was most 
 need, and the other half stood sentinel, as we find afterwards

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:16"><I>ch.</I> iv. 16</A>),

 while he himself in his own person walked the rounds, directed and
 encouraged the builders, set his hand to the work where he saw 
 occasion, and kept a watchful eye upon the motions of the enemy, as we 
 shall find in the next chapter. The pilot needs not haul at a rope: it 
 is enough for him to steer.</P>
