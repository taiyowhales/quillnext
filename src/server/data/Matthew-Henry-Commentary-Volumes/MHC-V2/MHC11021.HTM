 Ahab is still the unhappy subject of the sacred history; from the great
 affairs of his camp and kingdom this chapter leads us into his garden,
 and gives us an account of some ill things (and ill indeed they proved
 to him) relating to his domestic affairs.

 I. Ahab is sick for Naboth's vineyard,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. Naboth dies by Jezebel's plot, that the vineyard may escheat to
 Ahab, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:5-14">ver. 5-14</A>.

 III.  Ahab goes to take possession, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:15-16">ver.  15-16</A>.

 IV.  Elijah meets him, and denounces the judgments of God against him
 for his injustice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:17-24">ver.  17-24</A>.

 V. Upon his humiliation a reprieve is granted,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass after these things, <I>that</I> Naboth the
 Jezreelite had a vineyard, which <I>was</I> in Jezreel, hard by the
 palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
 &nbsp; 2 And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard,
 that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it <I>is</I> near
 unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than
 it; <I>or,</I> if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of
 it in money.
 &nbsp; 3 And Naboth said to Ahab, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> forbid it me, that I should
 give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.
 &nbsp; 4 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of
 the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he
 had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And
 he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and
 would eat no bread.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. Ahab coveting his neighbour's vineyard, which unhappily lay near his 
 palace and conveniently for a kitchen-garden. Perhaps Naboth had been 
 pleased that he had a vineyard which lay so advantageously for a 
 prospect of the royal gardens, or the vending of its productions to the 
 royal family; but the situation of it proved fatal to him. If he had 
 had no vineyard, or it had lain obscure in some remote place, he would 
 have preserved his life. But many a man's possessions have been his 
 snare, and his neighbourhood to greatness has been of pernicious 
 consequence. Ahab sets his eye and heart on this vineyard, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It will be a pretty addition to his demesne, a convenient out-let to 
 his palace; and nothing will serve him but it must be his own. He is 
 welcome to the fruits of it, welcome to walk in it; Naboth perhaps 
 would have made him a lease of it for his life, to please him; but 
 nothing will please him unless he have an absolute property in it, he 
 and his heirs for ever. Yet he is not such a tyrant as to take it by 
 force, but fairly proposes either to give Naboth the full value of it 
 in money or a better vineyard in exchange. He had tamely quitted the 
 great advantages God had given him of enlarging his dominion for the 
 honour of his kingdom, by his victory over the Syrians, and now is 
 eager to enlarge his garden, only for the convenience of his house, as 
 if to be penny wise would atone for being pound foolish. To desire a 
 convenience to his estate was not evil (there would be no buying if 
 there were no desire of what is bought; the virtuous woman <I>considers 
 a field and buys it</I>); but to desire any thing inordinately, though
 we would compass it by lawful means, is a fruit of selfishness, as if 
 we must engross all the conveniences, and none must live, or live 
 comfortably, by us, contrary to the law of contentment, and the letter 
 of the tenth commandment, <I>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's 
 house.</I> 

 2. The repulse he met with in this desire. Naboth would by no means 
 part with it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>The Lord forbid it me;</I> and the Lord did forbid it, else he would
 not have been so rude and uncivil to his prince as not to gratify him 
 in so small a matter. Canaan was in a peculiar manner God's land; the 
 Israelites were his tenants; and this was one of the conditions of 
 their leases, that they should not alienate (no, not to one another) 
 any part of that which fell to their lot, unless in case of extreme 
 necessity, and then only till the year of jubilee, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:28">Lev. xxv. 28</A>.

 Now Naboth foresaw that, if his vineyard were sold to the crown, it
 would never return to his heirs, no, not in the jubilee. He would 
 gladly oblige the king, but he must obey God rather than men, and 
 therefore in this matter desires to be excused. Ahab knew the law, or 
 should have known it, and therefore did ill to ask that which his 
 subject could not grant without sin. Some conceive that Naboth looked 
 upon his earthly inheritance as an earnest of his lot in the heavenly 
 Canaan, and therefore would not part with the former, lest it should 
 amount to a forfeiture of the latter. He seems to have been a 
 conscientious man, who would rather hazard the king's displeasure than 
 offend God, and probably was one of the 7000 that had not bowed the 
 knee to Baal, for which, it may be, Ahab owed him a grudge.

 3. Ahab's great discontent and uneasiness hereupon. He was as before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:43"><I>ch.</I> xx. 43</A>)
 
 <I>heavy and displeased</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 grew melancholy upon it, threw himself upon his bed, would not eat nor
 admit company to come to him.  He could by no means digest the affront. 
 His proud spirit aggravated the indignity Naboth did him in denying 
 him, as a thing not to be suffered. He cursed the squeamishness of 
 Naboth's conscience, which he pretended to consult the peace of, and 
 secretly meditated revenge. Nor could he bear the disappointment; it 
 cut him to the heart to be crossed in his desires, and he was perfectly 
 sick for vexation. Note,

 (1.) Discontent is a sin that is its own punishment and makes men 
 torment themselves; it makes the spirit sad, the body sick, and all the 
 enjoyments sour; it is the heaviness of the heart and the rottenness of 
 the bones. 

 (2.) It is a sin that is its own parent. It arises not from the 
 condition, but from the mind. As we find Paul contented in a prison, so 
 Ahab discontent in a palace. He had all the delights of Canaan, that 
 pleasant land, at command the wealth of a kingdom, the pleasures of a 
 court, and the honours and powers of a throne; and <I>yet all this 
 avails him nothing</I> without Naboth's vineyard.  Inordinate desires 
 expose men to continual vexations, and those that are disposed to fret, 
 be they ever so happy, will always find something or other to fret 
 at.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is
 thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?
 &nbsp; 6 And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the
 Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or
 else, if it please thee, I will give thee <I>another</I> vineyard for
 it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.
 &nbsp; 7 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the
 kingdom of Israel? arise, <I>and</I> eat bread, and let thine heart be
 merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
 &nbsp; 8 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed <I>them</I> with
 his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles
 that <I>were</I> in his city, dwelling with Naboth.
 &nbsp; 9 And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and
 set Naboth on high among the people:
 &nbsp; 10 And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness
 against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And
 <I>then</I> carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.
 &nbsp; 11 And the men of his city, <I>even</I> the elders and the nobles
 who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent
 unto them, <I>and</I> as it <I>was</I> written in the letters which she had
 sent unto them.
 &nbsp; 12 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the
 people.
 &nbsp; 13 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat
 before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, <I>even</I>
 against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did
 blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of
 the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.
 &nbsp; 14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is
 dead.
 &nbsp; 15 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was
 stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take
 possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he
 refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but
 dead.
 &nbsp; 16 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead,
 that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the
 Jezreelite, to take possession of it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Nothing but mischief is to be expected when Jezebel enters into the 
 story--<I>that cursed woman,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:34">2 Kings ix. 34</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Under pretence of comforting her afflicted husband, she feeds his 
 pride and passion, and blows the coals of his corruptions. It became 
 her to take notice of his grief and to enquire into the cause of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Those have forgotten both the duty and affection of the conjugal
 relation that interest not themselves in each other's troubles. He told 
 her what troubled him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 yet invidiously concealed Naboth's reason for his refusal, representing
 it as peevish, when it was conscientious--<I>I will not give it 
 thee,</I> whereas he said, <I>I may not.</I> What! says Jezebel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>Dost thou govern Israel? Arise, and eat bread.</I> She does well to
 persuade him to shake off his melancholy, and not to sink under his 
 burden, to be easy and cheerful; whatever was his grief, grieving would 
 not redress it, but pleasantness would alleviate it. Her plea is, 
 <I>Dost thou now govern Israel?</I> This is capable of a good sense: 
 "Does it become so great a prince as thou art to cast thyself down for 
 so small a matter? Thou shamest thyself, and profanest thy crown; it is 
 below thee to take notice of so inconsiderable a thing. Art thou fit to 
 govern Israel, who hast no better a government of thy own passions? Or 
 hast thou so rich a kingdom at command and canst not thou be without 
 this one vineyard?" We should learn to quiet ourselves, under our 
 crosses, with the thoughts of the mercies we enjoy, especially our 
 hopes of the kingdom. But she meant it in a bad sense: "<I>Dost thou 
 govern Israel,</I> and shall any subject thou hast deny thee any thing 
 thou hast a mind to? Art thou a king? It is below thee to buy and pay, 
 much more to beg and pray; use thy prerogative, and take by force what 
 thou canst not compass by fair means; instead of resenting the affront 
 thus, revenge it. If thou knowest not how to support the dignity of a 
 king, let me alone to do it; give me but leave to make use of thy name, 
 and I will soon <I>give thee the vineyard of Naboth;</I> right or 
 wrong, it shall be thy own shortly, and cost thee nothing." Unhappy 
 princes those are, and hurried apace towards their ruin, who have those 
 about them that stir them up to acts of tyranny and teach them how to 
 abuse their power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In order to gratify him, she projects and compasses the death of 
 Naboth. No less than his blood will serve to atone for the affront he 
 has given to Ahab, which she thirsts after the more greedily because of 
 his adherence to the law of the God of Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Had she aimed only at his land, her false witnesses might have sworn 
 him out of that by a forged deed (she could not have set up so weak a 
 title but the elders of Jezreel would have adjudged it good); but 
 <I>the adulteress will hunt for the precious life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:26">Prov. vi. 26</A>.
 
 Revenge is sweet. Naboth must die, and die as a malefactor, to gratify
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Never were more wicked orders given by any prince than those which
 Jezebel sent to the magistrates of Jezreel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.

 She borrows the privy-seal, but the king shall not know what she will
 do with it. It is probable this was not the first time he had lent it 
 to her, but that with it she had signed warrants for the slaying of the 
 prophets. She makes use of the king's name, knowing the thing would 
 please him when it was done, yet fearing he might scruple at the manner 
 of doing it; in short, she commands them, upon their allegiance, to put 
 Naboth to death, without giving them any reason for so doing. Had she 
 sent witnesses to inform against him, the judges (who must go 
 <I>secundum allegata et probata--according to allegations and 
 proofs</I>) might have been imposed upon, and their sentence might have 
 been rather their unhappiness than their crime; but to oblige them to 
 find the witnesses, sons of Belial, to suborn them themselves, and then 
 to give judgment upon a testimony which they knew to be false, was such 
 an impudent defiance to every thing that is just and sacred as we hope 
 cannot be paralleled in any story. She must have looked upon the elders 
 of Jezreel as men perfectly lost to every thing that is honest and 
 honourable when she expected these orders should be obeyed. But she 
 will put them in a way how to do it, having as much of the serpent's 
 subtlety as she had of his poison.

 [1.] It must be done under colour of religion: "<I>Proclaim a fast;</I> 
 signify to your city that you are apprehensive of some dreadful 
 judgment coming upon you, which you must endeavour to avert, not only 
 by prayer, but by finding out and by putting away the accursed thing; 
 pretend to be afraid that there is some great offender among you 
 undiscovered, for whose sake God is angry with your city; charge the 
 people, if they know of any such, on that solemn occasion to inform 
 against him, as they regard the welfare of the city; and at last let 
 Naboth be fastened upon as the suspected person, probably because he 
 does not join with his neighbours in their worship. This may serve for 
 a pretence to <I>set him on high among the people,</I> to call him to 
 the bar. Let proclamation be made that, if any one can inform the court 
 against the prisoner, and prove him to be the Achan, they shall be 
 heard; and then let the witnesses appear to give evidence against him." 
 Note, There is no wickedness so vile, so horrid, but religion has 
 sometimes been made a cloak and cover for it.  We must not think at all 
 the worse of fasting and praying for their having been sometimes thus 
 abused, but much the worse of those wicked designs that have at any 
 time been carried on under the shelter of them.

 [2.] It must be done <I>under colour of justice</I> too, and with the 
 formalities of a legal process. Had she sent to them to hire some of 
 their banditti, some desperate ruffians, to assassinate him, to stab 
 him as he went along the streets in the night, the deed would have been 
 bad enough; but to destroy him by a course of law, to use that power 
 for the murdering of the innocent which ought to be their protection, 
 was such a <I>violent perversion of justice and judgment</I> as was 
 truly monstrous, yet such as we are directed <I>not to marvel at,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:8">Eccl. v. 8</A>.

 The crime they must lay to his charge was <I>blaspheming God and the
 king--</I> a complicated blasphemy. Surely she could not think to put a 
 blasphemous sense upon the answer he had given to Ahab, as if denying 
 him his vineyard were blaspheming the king, and giving the divine law 
 for the reason were blaspheming God.  No, she pretends not any ground 
 at all for the charge: though there was no colour of truth in it, the 
 witnesses must swear it, and Naboth must not be permitted to speak for 
 himself, or cross-examine the witnesses, but immediately, under 
 pretence of a universal detestation of the crime, they must <I>carry 
 him out and stone him.</I> His blaspheming God would be the forfeiture 
 of his life, but not of his estate, and therefore he is also charged 
 with treason, in <I>blaspheming the king,</I> for which his estate was 
 to be confiscated, that so Ahab might have his vineyard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Never were wicked orders more wickedly obeyed than these were by 
 the magistrates of Jezreel. They did not so much as dispute the command 
 nor make any objections against it, though so palpably unjust, but 
 punctually observed all the particulars of it, either because they 
 feared Jezebel's cruelty or because they hated Naboth's piety, or both: 
 They did <I>as it was written in the letters</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>),

 neither made any difficulty of it, nor met with any difficulty in it,
 but cleverly carried on the villany. They stoned Naboth to death

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 and, as it should seem, his sons with him, or after him; for, when God
 came to make inquisition for blood, we find this article in the account 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:26">2 Kings ix. 26</A>),

 <I>I have seen the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons.</I>
 Perhaps they were secretly murdered, that they might not claim their 
 father's estate nor complain of the wrong done him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let us take occasion from this sad story, 

 (1.) To stand amazed at the wickedness of the wicked, and the power of 
 Satan in the children of disobedience. What a holy indignation may we 
 be filled with to see <I>wickedness in the place of judgment!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16">Eccl. iii. 16</A>.

 (2.) To lament the hard case of oppressed innocency, and to mingle our 
 tears with <I>the tears of the oppressed that have no comforter,</I> 
 while <I>on the side of the oppressors there is power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:1">Eccl. iv. 1</A>.
 
 (3.) To commit the keeping of our lives and comforts to God, for
 innocency itself will not always be our security.  

 (4.) To rejoice in the belief of a judgment to come, in which such 
 wrong judgments as these will be called over. Now we see that <I>there 
 are just men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:14">Eccl. viii. 14</A>),
 
 but all will be set to rights in the great day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Naboth being taken off, Ahab takes possession of his vineyard. 

 1.  The elders of Jezreel sent notice to Jezebel very unconcernedly, 
 sent it to her as a piece of agreeable news, <I>Naboth is stoned and is 
 dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Here let us observe that, as obsequious as the elders of Jezreel were
 to Jezebel's orders which she sent from Samaria for the murder of 
 Naboth, so obsequious were the elders of Samaria afterwards to Jehu's 
 orders which he sent from Jezreel for the murder of Ahab's seventy 
 sons, only that was not done by course of law,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:6,7">2 Kings x. 6, 7</A>.
 
 Those tyrants that by their wicked orders debauch the consciences of
 their inferior magistrates may perhaps find at last the wheel return 
 upon them, and that those who will not stick to do one cruel thing for 
 them will be as ready to do another cruel thing against them. 

 2.  Jezebel, jocund enough that her plot succeeded so well, brings 
 notice to Ahab that <I>Naboth is not alive, but dead;</I> therefore, 
 says she, <I>Arise, take possession of his vineyard,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 He might have taken possession by one of his officers, but so pleased
 is he with this accession to his estate that he will make a journey to 
 Jezreel himself to enter upon it; and it should seem he went in state 
 too, as if he had obtained some mighty victory, for Jehu remembers long 
 after that he and Bidkar attended him at this time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:25">2 Kings ix. 25</A>.

 If Naboth's sons were all put to death, Ahab thought himself entitled
 to the estate, <I>ob defectum sanguinis</I>--<I>in default of heirs</I> 
 (as our law expresses it); if not, yet, Naboth dying as a criminal, he 
 claimed it <I>ob delictum criminis</I>--<I>as forfeited by his 
 crime.</I> Or, if neither would make him a good title, the absolute 
 power of Jezebel would give it to him, and who would dare to oppose her 
 will? Might often prevails against right, and wonderful is the divine 
 patience that suffers it to do so. God is certainly <I>of purer eyes 
 than to behold iniquity,</I> and yet for a time <I>keeps silence when 
 the wicked devours the man that is more righteous than he,</I>

 &nbsp; 18 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which <I>is</I> in
 Samaria: behold, <I>he is</I> in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is
 gone down to possess it.
 &nbsp; 19 And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak
 unto him, saying, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, In the place where dogs
 licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
 &nbsp; 20 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?
 And he answered, I have found <I>thee:</I> because thou hast sold
 thyself to work evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 21 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy
 posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against
 the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
 &nbsp; 22 And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son
 of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the
 provocation wherewith thou hast provoked <I>me</I> to anger, and made
 Israel to sin.
 &nbsp; 23 And of Jezebel also spake the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, The dogs shall
 eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
 &nbsp; 24 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and
 him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
 &nbsp; 25 But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to
 work wickedness in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, whom Jezebel his wife
 stirred up.
 &nbsp; 26 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to
 all <I>things</I> as did the Amorites, whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> cast out before
 the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 27 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he
 rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted,
 and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
 &nbsp; 28 And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came to Elijah the Tishbite,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 29 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he
 humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his
 days: <I>but</I> in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his
 house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The very bad character that is given of Ahab 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>),

 which comes in here to justify God in the heavy sentence passed upon
 him, and to show that though it was passed upon occasion of his sin in 
 the matter of Naboth (which David's sin in the matter of Uriah did too 
 much resemble), yet God would not have punished him so severely if he 
 had not been guilty of many other sins, especially idolatry; whereas 
 David, except in that one matter, <I>did that which was right.</I> But, 
 as to Ahab, there was <I>none like him,</I> so ingenious and 
 industrious in sin, and that made a trade of it. He <I>sold himself to 
 work wickedness,</I> that is, he made himself a perfect slave to his 
 lusts, and was as much at their beck and command as ever any servant 
 was at his master's. He was wholly given up to sin, and, upon condition 
 he might have the pleasures of it, he would take the wages of it, which 
 is death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:23">Rom. vi. 23</A>.

 Blessed Paul complained that he was <I>sold under sin</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:14">Rom. vii. 14</A>),

 as a poor captive against his will; but Ahab was voluntary: he <I>sold
 himself to sin;</I> of choice, and as his own act and deed, he 
 submitted to the dominion of sin. It was no excuse of his crimes that 
 <I>Jezebel his wife stirred him up</I> to do wickedly, and made him, in 
 many respects, worse than otherwise he would have been. To what a pitch 
 of impiety did he arrive who had such tinder of corruption in his heart 
 and such a temper in his bosom to strike fire into it! In many things 
 he did ill, but he did <I>most abominably in following idols,</I> like 
 the Canaanites; his immoralities were very provoking to God, but his 
 idolatries were especially so. Israel's case was sad when a prince of 
 such a character as this reigned over them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The message with which Elijah was sent to him, when he went to take 
 possession of Naboth's vineyard, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:17-19"><I>v.</I> 17-19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Hitherto God kept silence, did not intercept Jezebel's letters, nor 
 stay the process of the elders of Jezreel; but now Ahab is reproved and 
 his <I>sin set in order before his eyes.</I> 

 (1.) The person sent is Elijah. A prophet of lower rank was sent with 
 messages of kindness to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:13"><I>ch.</I> xx. 13</A>.

 But the father of the prophets is sent to try him, and condemn him, for
 his murder. 

 (2.) The place is Naboth's vineyard and the time just when he is taking 
 possession of it; then, and there, must his doom be read him. By taking 
 possession, he avowed all that was done, and made himself guilty <I>ex 
 post facto</I>--<I>as an accessary after the fact.</I> There he was 
 taken in the commission of the errors, and therefore the conviction 
 would come upon him with so much the more force. "What hast thou to do 
 in this vineyard? What good canst thou expect from it when it is 
 <I>purchased with blood</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:12">Hab. ii. 12</A>)

 and thou hast <I>caused the owner thereof to lose his life?</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:39">Job xxxi. 39</A>.

 Now that he is pleasing himself with his ill-gotten wealth, and giving
 direction for the turning of this vineyard into a flower-garden, his
 <I>meat in his bowels is turned. He shall not feel quietness. When he
 is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:14,20,23">Job xx. 14, 20, 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let us see what passed between him and the prophet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Ahab vented his wrath against Elijah, fell into a passion at the 
 sight of him, and, instead of humbling himself before the prophet, as 
 he ought to have done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:12">2 Chron. xxxvi. 12</A>),

 was ready to fly in his face. <I>Hast thou found me, O my enemy?</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 This shows,

 [1.] That he hated him. The last time we found them together they 
 parted very good friends,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:46"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 46</A>.

 Then Ahab had countenanced the reformation, and therefore then all was
 well between him and the prophet; but now he had relapsed, and was 
 worse than ever. His conscience told him he had made God his enemy, and 
 therefore he could not expect Elijah should be his friend. Note, That 
 man's condition is very miserable that has made the word of God his 
 enemy, and his condition is very desperate that reckons the ministers 
 of that word his enemies because they <I>tell him the truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:16">Gal. iv. 16</A>.

 Ahab, having sold himself to sin, was resolved to stand to his bargain,
 and could not endure him that would have helped him to recover himself,

 [2.] That he feared him: <I>Hast thou found me?</I> intimating that he 
 shunned him all he could, and it was now a terror to him to see him. 
 The sight of him was like that of the handwriting upon the wall to 
 Belshazzar; it made his <I>countenance change, the joints of his loins 
 were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</I> Never was 
 poor debtor or criminal so confounded at the sight of the officer that 
 came to arrest him. Men may thank themselves if they make God and his 
 word a terror to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Elijah denounced God's wrath against Ahab: <I>I have found 
 thee</I> (says he, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 <I>because thou hast sold thyself to work evil.</I> Note, Those that
 give up themselves to sin will certainly be found out, sooner or later, 
 to their unspeakable horror and amazement.  Ahab is now set to the bar, 
 as Naboth was, and trembles more than he did.

 [1.] Elijah finds the indictment against him, and convicts him upon the 
 notorious evidence of the fact 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?</I> He was thus charged
 with the murder of Naboth, and it would not serve him to say the law 
 killed him (perverted justice is the highest injustice), nor that, if 
 he was unjustly prosecuted, it was not his doing--he knew nothing of 
 it; for it was to please him that it was done, and he had shown himself 
 pleased with it, and so had made himself guilty of all that was done in 
 the unjust prosecution of Naboth. He killed, for he took possession. If 
 he takes the garden, he takes the guilt with it. <I>Terra transit cum 
 onere--The land with the incumbrance.</I>

 [2.] He passes judgment upon him. He told him from God that his family 
 should be ruined and rooted out 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:21"><I>v.</I>  21</A>)

 and all his posterity cut off,--that his house should be made like the
 houses of his wicked predecessors, Jeroboam and Baasha

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 particularly that those who died in the city should be meat for dogs
 and those who died in the field meat for birds

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 which had been foretold of Jeroboam's house

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:11"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 11</A>),
 
 and of Baasha's
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:4"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 4</A>),--

 that Jezebel, particularly, should be devoured by dogs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 which was fulfilled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:36">2 Kings ix. 36</A>),--

 and, as for Ahab himself, that the dogs should <I>lick his blood</I> in
 the very same place where they licked Naboth's 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>--

 "<I>Thy blood, even thine,</I> though it be royal blood, though it
 swell thy veins with pride and boil in thy heart with anger, shall ere 
 long be an entertainment for the dogs"), which was fulfilled,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:38"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 38</A>.

 This intimates that he should die a violent death, should come to his
 grave with blood, and that disgrace should attend him, the foresight of 
 which must needs be a great mortification to such a proud man. 
 Punishments after death are here most insisted on, which, though such 
 as affected the body only, were perhaps designed as figures of the 
 soul's misery after death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Ahab's humiliation under the sentence passed upon him, and the 
 favourable message sent him thereupon. 

 1. Ahab was a kind of penitent.  The message Elijah delivered to him in 
 God's name put him into a fright for the present, so that he <I>rent 
 his clothes</I> and <I>put on sackcloth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 He was still a proud hardened sinner, and yet thus reduced. Note, God
 can make the stoutest heart to tremble and the proudest to humble 
 itself. His word is quick and powerful, and is, when the pleases to 
 make it so, like a <I>fire and a hammer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:29">Jer. xxiii. 29</A>.

 It made Felix tremble. Ahab put on the garb and guise of a penitent,
 and yet his heart was unhumbled and unchanged. After this, we find, he 
 hated a faithful prophet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:8"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 8</A>.

 Note, It is no new thing to find the show and profession of repentance
 where yet the truth and substance of it are wanting. Ahab's repentance 
 was only what might be seen of men: <I>Seest thou</I> (says God to 
 Elijah) <I>how Ahab humbles himself;</I> it was external only, the 
 garments rent, but not the heart. A hypocrite may go very far in the 
 outward performance of holy duties and yet come short. 

 2. He obtained hereby a reprieve, which I may call a kind of pardon. 
 Though it was but an outside repentance (lamenting the judgment only, 
 and not the sin), though he did not leave his idols, nor restore the 
 vineyard to Naboth's heirs, yet, because he did hereby give some glory 
 to God, God took notice of it, and bade Elijah take notice of it: 
 <I>Seest thou how Ahab humbles himself?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 In consideration of this the threatened ruin of his house, which had
 not been fixed to any time, should be <I>adjourned to his son's 
 days.</I> The sentence should not be revoked, but the execution 
 suspended. Now,

 (1.) This discovers the great goodness of God, and his readiness to 
 show mercy, which here <I>rejoices against judgment.</I> Favour was 
 shown to this wicked man that God might magnify his goodness (says 
 bishop Sanderson) even to the hazard of his other divine perfections; 
 as if (says he) God would be thought unholy, or untrue, or unjust 
 (though he be none of these), or any thing, rather than unmerciful. 
 
 (2.) This teaches us to take notice of that which is good even in those 
 who are not so good as they should be: let it be commended as far as it 
 goes. 

 (3.) This gives a reason why wicked people sometimes prosper long; God 
 is rewarding their external services with external mercies.  

 (4.) This encourages all those that truly repent and unfeignedly 
 believe the holy gospel. If a pretending partial penitent shall go to 
 his house reprieved, doubtless a sincere penitent shall <I>go to his 
 house justified.</I></P>
