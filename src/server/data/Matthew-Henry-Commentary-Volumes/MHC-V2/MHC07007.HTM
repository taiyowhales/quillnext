 This chapter presents us with Gideon in the field, commanding the army 
 of Israel, and routing the army of the Midianites, for which great 
 exploit we found in the former chapter how he was prepared by his 
 converse with God and his conquest of Baal. We are here told, 

 I. What direction God gave to Gideon for the modelling of his army, by
 which it was reduced to 300 men,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:1,8">ver. 1, 8</A>.

 II. What encouragement God gave to Gideon to attack the enemy, by
 sending him secretly into their camp to hear a Midianite tell his dream, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:9-15">ver. 9-15</A>.

 III. How he formed his attack upon the enemy's camp with his 300 men,
 not to fight them, but to frighten them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:16-20">ver. 16-20</A>.

 IV. The success of this attack; it put them to flight, and gave them a
 total rout, the disbanded forces, and their other neighbours, then 
 coming in to his assistance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:21-25">ver. 21-25</A>.

 It is a story that shines very brightly in the book of the wars of the
 Lord.</P>

 1 Then Jerubbaal, who <I>is</I> Gideon, and all the people that
 <I>were</I> with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of
 Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side
 of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
 &nbsp; 2 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Gideon, The people that <I>are</I> with
 thee <I>are</I> too many for me to give the Midianites into their
 hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own
 hand hath saved me.
 &nbsp; 3 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people,
 saying, Whosoever <I>is</I> fearful and afraid, let him return and
 depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people
 twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
 &nbsp; 4 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Gideon, The people <I>are</I> yet <I>too</I>
 many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for
 thee there: and it shall be, <I>that</I> of whom I say unto thee, This
 shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of
 whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same
 shall not go.
 &nbsp; 5 So he brought down the people unto the water: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his
 tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise
 every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.
 &nbsp; 6 And the number of them that lapped, <I>putting</I> their hand to
 their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the
 people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.
 &nbsp; 7 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that
 lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine
 hand: and let all the <I>other</I> people go every man unto his place.
 &nbsp; 8 So the people took victuals in their hand, and their
 trumpets: and he sent all <I>the rest of</I> Israel every man unto his
 tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of
 Midian was beneath him in the valley.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Gideon applies himself with all possible care and industry to do the 
 part of a good general, in leading on the hosts of Israel against the 
 Midianites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>He rose up early,</I> as one whose heart was upon his business, and 
 who was afraid of losing time. Now that he is sure God is with him he 
 is impatient of delay. He pitched near a famous well, that his army 
 might not be distressed for want of water, and gained the higher 
 ground, which possibly might be some advantage to him, for the 
 Midianites <I>were beneath him in the valley.</I> Note, Faith in God's 
 promises must not slacken, but rather quicken, our endeavours. When we 
 are sure God goes before us, then we must bestir ourselves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:24">2 Sam. v. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God provides that the praise of the intended victory may be 
 reserved wholly to himself, by appointing 300 men only to be employed 
 in this service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The army consisted of 32,000 men, a small army in comparison with 
 what the Midianites had now brought into the field; Gideon was ready to 
 think them too few, but God comes to him, and tells him they are <I>too 
 many,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Not but that those did well who offered themselves willingly to this 
 expedition, but God saw fit not to make use of all that came. We often 
 find God bringing great things to pass by a few hands, but this was the 
 only time that he purposely made them fewer.  Had Deborah lately blamed 
 those who <I>came not to the help of the Lord,</I> and yet in the next 
 great action must those be turned off that do come? Yes;

 (1.) God would hereby show that when he employed suitable instruments 
 in his service he did not need them, but could do his work without 
 them, so that he was not indebted to them for their service, but they 
 to him for employing them. 

 (2.) He would hereby put those to shame for their cowardice who had 
 tamely submitted to the Midianites, and durst not make head against 
 them, because of the disproportion of their numbers. They now saw that, 
 if they had but made sure of the favour of God, one of them might have 
 chased a thousand.  

 (3.) He would hereby silence and exclude boasting.  This is the reason 
 here given by him who knows the pride that is in men's hearts: <I>Lest 
 Israel vaunt themselves against me.</I> Justly were those denied the 
 honour of the success. <I>My own hand hath saved me</I> is a word that 
 must never come out of the mouth of such as shall be saved. <I>He that 
 glories must glory in the Lord,</I> and all flesh must be silent before 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Two ways God took to lessen their numbers:--

 (1.) He ordered all that would own themselves timorous and 
 faint-hearted to be dismissed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They were now encamped on a mountain close to the enemy, called 
 <I>Mount Gilead,</I> from Gilead, the common ancestor of these families 
 of Manasseh, which were seated on this side Jordan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:30">Num. xxvi. 30</A>),

 and thence they might see perhaps the vast numbers of the enemy; those 
 therefore who were disheartened at the sight were left to their 
 liberty, to go back if they pleased. There was a law for making such a 
 proclamation as this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:8">Deut. xx. 8</A>.

 But Gideon perhaps thought that concerned only those wars which were
 undertaken for the enlarging of their coast, not, as this, for their 
 necessary defence against an invader; therefore Gideon would not have 
 proclaimed this if God, who knew how his forces would hereby be 
 diminished, had not commanded him. Cowards would be as likely as any,
 after the victory, to take the honour of it from God, and therefore God 
 would not do them the honour to employ them in it. One would have 
 thought there would be scarcely one Israelite to be found that against 
 such an enemy as the Midianites, and under such a leader as Gideon, 
 would own himself fearful; yet above two parts of three took advantage 
 of this proclamation, and filed off, when they saw the strength of the 
 enemy and their own weakness, not considering the assurances of the 
 divine presence which their general had received of the Lord, and, it 
 is likely, delivered unto them. Some think the oppression they had been 
 under so long had broken their spirits, others, more probably, that 
 consciousness of their own guilt had deprived them of their courage. 
 Sin stared them in the face, and therefore they durst not look death in 
 the face. Note, Fearful faint-hearted people are not fit to be employed 
 for God; and, among those that are enlisted under the banner of Christ, 
 there are more such than we think there are. 

 (2.) He directed the cashiering of all that remained except 300 men, 
 and he did it by a sign: <I>The people are yet too many</I> for me to 
 make use off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 See how much God's thoughts and ways are above ours. Gideon himself, it 
 is likely, thought they were too few, though they were as many as Barak 
 encountered Sisera with

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:14"><I>ch.</I> iv. 14</A>);

 and, had he not forced his way through the discouragement by dint of
 faith, he himself would have started back from so hazardous an 
 enterprise, and have made the best of his own way back. But God saith, 
 they are <I>too many,</I> and, when diminished to a third part, they 
 are yet <I>too many,</I> which may help us to understand those 
 providences which sometimes seem to weaken the church and its 
 interests: its friends are too many, too mighty, too wise, for God to 
 work deliverance by; God is taking a course to lessen them, that he may 
 be <I>exalted in his own strength.</I> Gideon is ordered to bring his 
 soldiers to the watering, probably to the well of Harod 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 and the stream that ran from it; he, or some appointed by him, must 
 observe how they drank. We must suppose they were all thirsty, and were 
 inclined to drink; it is likely he told them they must prepare to enter 
 upon action immediately, and therefore must refresh themselves 
 accordingly, not expecting, after this, to drink any thing else but the 
 blood of their enemies. Now some, and no doubt the most, would kneel 
 down on their knees to drink, and put their mouths to the water as 
 horses do, and so they might get their full draught. Others, it may be, 
 would not make such a formal business of it, but as a dog laps with his 
 tongue, a lap and away, so they would hastily take up a little water in 
 their hands, and cool their mouths with that, and be gone. Three 
 hundred and no more there were of this latter sort, that drank in 
 haste, and by those God tells Gideon he would rout the Midianites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 By the former distinction none were retained but hearty men, that were 
 resolved to do their utmost for retrieving the liberties of Israel; but 
 by this further distinction it was provided that none should be made 
 use of but, 

 [1.] Men that were hardy, that could endure long fatigue, without 
 complaining of thirst or weariness, that had not in them any dregs 
 either of sloth or luxury. 

 [2.] Men that were hasty, that thought it long till they were engaged 
 with the enemy, preferring the service of God and their country before 
 their necessary refreshment; such as these God chooses to employ, that 
 are not only well affected, but zealously affected in a good thing. And 
 also because these were the smaller number, and therefore the least 
 likely to effect what they were designed for, God would by them save 
 Israel. It was a great trial to the faith and courage of Gideon, when 
 God bade him let all the rest of the people but these 300 <I>go every 
 man to his place,</I> that is, go where they pleased out of his call, 
 and from under his command; yet we may suppose those that were hearty 
 in the cause, though now set aside, did not go so far out of hearing 
 but that they were ready to follow the blow, when the 300 had broken 
 the ice, though this does not appear.  Thus strangely was Gideon's army 
 purged, and modelled, and reduced, instead of being recruited, as one 
 would think in so great an action it both needed and deserved to be. 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Let us see how this little despicable regiment, on which the stress 
 of the action must lie, was accoutred and fitted out. Had these 300 
 been double-manned with servants and attendants, and double-armed with 
 swords and spears, we should have thought them the more likely to bring 
 something to pass. But, instead of making them more serviceable by 
 their equipment, they are made less so. For, 

 (1.) Every soldier turns butler: They <I>took victuals in their 
 hands</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 left their bag and baggage behind, and every man burdened himself with 
 his own provision, which was a trial of their faith, whether they could 
 trust God when they had no more provisions with them than they could 
 carry, and a trial of their diligence, whether they would carry as much 
 as they had occasion for. This was indeed living from hand to mouth. 
 
 (2.) Every soldier turns trumpeter.  The regiments that were cashiered 
 left their trumpets behind them for the use of these 300 men, who were 
 furnished with these instead of weapons of war, as if they had been 
 going rather to a game than to a battle.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And it came to pass the same night, that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto
 him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it
 into thine hand.
 &nbsp; 10 But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant
 down to the host:
 &nbsp; 11 And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine
 hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down
 with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that
 <I>were</I> in the host.
 &nbsp; 12 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children
 of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for
 multitude; and their camels <I>were</I> without number, as the sand by
 the sea side for multitude.
 &nbsp; 13 And when Gideon was come, behold, <I>there was</I> a man that
 told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a
 dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of
 Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and
 overturned it, that the tent lay along.
 &nbsp; 14 And his fellow answered and said, This <I>is</I> nothing else
 save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: <I>for</I>
 into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.
 &nbsp; 15 And it was <I>so,</I> when Gideon heard the telling of the dream,
 and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned
 into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 delivered into your hand the host of Midian.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Gideon's army being diminished as we have found it was, he must either 
 fight by faith or not at all; God therefore here provides recruits for 
 his faith, instead of recruits for his forces.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He furnishes him with a good foundation to build his faith upon. 
 Nothing but a word from God will be a footing for faith. He has this as 
 full and express as he can desire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 1. A word of command to warrant the action, which otherwise seemed rash 
 and indiscreet, and unbecoming a wise general: <I>Arise, get thee 
 down</I> with this handful of men <I>unto the host.</I> 

 2. A word of promise to assure him of the success, which otherwise
 seemed very improbable: <I>I have delivered it into thy hand;</I> it is 
 all thy own. This <I>word of the Lord</I> came to him the same night, 
 when he was (we may suppose) greatly agitated and full of care how he 
 should come off; <I>in the multitude of his thoughts within him these 
 comforts did delight his soul.</I> Divine consolations are given in to 
 believers not only strongly but seasonably.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He furnishes him with a good prop to support his faith with. 

 1. He orders him to be his own spy, and now in the dead of the night to
 go down privately into the host of Midian, and see what intelligence he 
 could gain: "<I>If thou fear to go down</I> to fight, go first only 
 with thy own servant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 and <I>hear what they say</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 and it is intimated to him that he should hear that which would greatly 
 strengthen his faith. God knows the infirmities of his people, and what 
 great encouragement they may sometimes take from a small matter; and 
 therefore, knowing beforehand what would occur to Gideon, in that very 
 part of the camp to which he would go down, he orders him to go down 
 and hearken to what they said, that he might the more firmly believe 
 what God said. He must take with him <I>Phurah his servant,</I> one 
 that he could confide in, probably one of the ten that had helped him 
 to break down the altar of Baal. He must take him and no one else with 
 him, must take him with him to be a witness of what he should hear the 
 Midianites say, that out of the mouth of these two witnesses, when the 
 matter came to be reported to Israel, the word might be established. He 
 must take his servant with him, because two are better than one and a 
 little help is better than none. 

 2. Being so, he orders him the sight of something that was
 discouraging. It was enough to frighten him to discern, perhaps by 
 moon-light, the vast numbers of the enemy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 the men like grasshoppers for multitude, and they proved no better than 
 grasshoppers for strength and courage; the camels one could not count, 
 any more than the sand. But, 

 3. He causes him to hear that which was to him a very good omen; and
 when he had heard it he went back again immediately, supposing he now 
 had what he was sent thither for. He overheard two soldiers of the 
 enemy, that were comrades, talking; probably they were in bed together, 
 waking in the night.

 (1.) One of them tells his dream, and as our dreams generally are, and 
 therefore not worth telling again, it is a very foolish one. He dreamed 
 that he saw a barley-cake come rolling down the hill into the camp of 
 the Midianites, and "methought," says he (for so we speak in telling 
 our dreams), "this rolling cake struck one of our tents" (perhaps one 
 of the chief of their tents) "and with such violence that" (would you 
 think it?) "it overturned the tent, forced down the stakes, and broke 
 the cords at one blow, so that the tent lay along and buried its 
 inhabitants," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 <I>In multitudes of dreams there are divers vanities,</I> says Solomon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:7">Eccl. v. 7</A>.

 One would wonder what odd incoherent things are often put together by a
 ludicrous fancy in our dreams.

 (2.) The other, it may be between sleeping and waking, undertakes to 
 interpret this dream, and the interpretation is very far-fetched: 
 <I>This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:14"><I>v.</I>  14</A>.

 Our expositors now can tell us how apt the resemblance was, that 
 Gideon, who had threshed corn for his family, and made cakes for his 
 friend

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:11-19"><I>ch.</I> vi. 11-19</A>),

 was fitly represented by a cake,--that he and his army were as
 inconsiderable as a cake made of a little flour, as contemptible as a 
 barley-cake, hastily got together as a cake suddenly baked upon the 
 coals, and as unlikely to conquer this great army as a cake to 
 overthrow a tent. But, after all, do <I>not interpretations belong to 
 God?</I> He put it into the head of the one to dream and into the mouth 
 of the other to give the sense of it; if Gideon had heard the dream 
 only, and he and his servant had been left to interpret it themselves, 
 it had so little significancy in it that it would have done him little 
 service; but, having the interpretation from the mouth of an enemy, it 
 not only appeared to come from God, who has all men's hearts and 
 tongues in his hand, but it was likewise an evidence that the enemy was 
 quite dispirited, and that the name of Gideon had become so formidable 
 to them that it disturbed their sleep. The victory would easily be won 
 which was already so tamely yielded: <I>Into his hand hath God 
 delivered Midian.</I> Those were not likely to fight who saw God 
 fighting against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Gideon, observing the finger of God pointing him to this 
 very place, at this very time, to hear this dream and the 
 interpretation of it, was exceedingly encouraged by it against the 
 melancholy apprehensions he had upon the reducing of his army. He was 
 very well pleased to hear himself compared to a barley-cake, when it 
 proved to effect such great things. Being hereby animated, we are told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 1. How he gave God the glory of it; he worshipped immediately, bowed 
 his head, or, it may be, lifted up his eyes and hands, and in a short 
 ejaculation thanked God for the victory he was now sure of, and for 
 this encouragement to expect it. Wherever we are, we may speak to God, 
 and worship him, and find a way open heavenward. God must have the 
 praise of that which is encouraging to our faith, and his providence 
 must be acknowledged in those events which, though minute and seemingly 
 accidental, prove serviceable to us. 

 2. How he gave his friends a share in the encouragements he had
 received: <I>Arise,</I> prepare to march presently; <I>the Lord has 
 delivered Midian into your hand.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 And he divided the three hundred men <I>into</I> three companies,
 and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers,
 and lamps within the pitchers.
 &nbsp; 17 And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and,
 behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be
 <I>that,</I> as I do, so shall ye do.
 &nbsp; 18 When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that <I>are</I> with me,
 then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and
 say, <I>The sword</I> of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and of Gideon.
 &nbsp; 19 So Gideon, and the hundred men that <I>were</I> with him, came
 unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle
 watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the
 trumpets, and brake the pitchers that <I>were</I> in their hands.
 &nbsp; 20 And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the
 pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the
 trumpets in their right hands to blow <I>withal:</I> and they cried,
 The sword of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and of Gideon.
 &nbsp; 21 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp:
 and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.
 &nbsp; 22 And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> set
 every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the
 host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath, <I>and</I> to the
 border of Abel-meholah, unto Tabbath.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The alarm which Gideon gave to the hosts of Midian in the dead time 
 of the night; for it was intended that those who had so long been a 
 terror to Israel, and had so often frightened them, should themselves 
 be routed and ruined purely by terror.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The attack here made was, in many circumstances, like that which 
 Abraham made upon the army that had taken Lot captive. The number of 
 men was much the same: Abraham had 318, Gideon 300; they both divided 
 their forces, both made their attack by night, and were both victorious 
 under great disadvantages 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:14,15">Gen. xiv. 14, 15</A>);

 and Gideon is not only a son of Abraham (so were the Midianites by
 Keturah) but an heir of his faith. Gideon, 

 (1.) Divided his army, small as it was, into three battalions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 
 one of which he himself commanded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 because great armies (and such a one he would make a show of) were
 usually divided into the right wing, and left wing, and the body of the 
 army.  

 (2.) He ordered them all to do as he did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He told them now, it is very likely, what they must do, else the thing 
 was so strange that they would scarcely have done it of a sudden, but 
 he would, by doing it first, give notice to them when to do it, as 
 officers exercise their soldiers with the word of command or by beat of 
 drum: <I>Look on me, and do likewise.</I> Such is the word of command 
 which our Lord Jesus, the captain of our salvation, gives his soldiers; 
 for he has <I>left us an example,</I> with a charge to follow it: <I>As 
 I do, so shall you do.</I>

 (3.) He made his descent in the night, when they were secure
 and least expected it, which would put them into great consternation, 
 and when the smallness of his army would not be discovered. In the 
 night all frights are most frightful, especially in the dead of the 
 night, as this was, a little after midnight, when the middle watch 
 began, and the alarm would wake them out of their sleep.  We read of 
 <I>terror by night</I> as very terrible 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:5">Ps. xci. 5</A>),

 and <I>fear in the night,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:8">Cant. iii. 8</A>.

 (4.) That which Gideon aimed at was to frighten this huge host, to give 
 them not only a fatal rout, but a very shameful one. He accoutred his 
 army with every man a trumpet in his right hand, and an earthen 
 pitcher, with a torch in it, in his left, and he himself thought it no 
 disparagement to him to march before them thus armed. He would make but 
 a jest of conquering this army, and goes out against them rather as 
 against a company of children than against a host of soldiers. <I>The 
 virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee,</I> and <I>laughed 
 thee to scorn,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:22">Isa. xxxvii. 22</A>.

 The fewness of his men favoured his design; for, being so few, they
 marched to the camp with the greater secresy and expedition, so that 
 they were not discovered till they were close by the camp; and he 
 contrived to give the alarm when they had just mounted the guards

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 that the sentinels, being then wakeful, might the sooner disperse the 
 alarm through the camp, which was the best service they could do him. 
 Three ways Gideon contrived to strike a terror upon this army, and so 
 put them into confusion. 

 [1.] With a great noise. Every man must blow his trumpet in the most 
 terrible manner he could and clatter an earthen pitcher to pieces at 
 the same time; probably each dashed his pitcher to his next man's, and 
 so they were broken both together, which would not only make a great 
 crash, but was a figure of what would be the effects of the fright, 
 even the Midianites' killing one another. 

 [2.] With a great blaze. The lighted torches were hid in the pitchers, 
 like <I>a candle under a bushel,</I> until they came to the camp, and 
 then, being taken out all together of a sudden, would make a glaring 
 show, and run through the camp like a flash of lightning. Perhaps with 
 these they set some of the tents on the outside of the camp on fire, 
 which would very much increase the confusion. 

 [3.] With a great shout.  Every man must cry, <I>For the Lord, and for 
 Gideon,</I> so some think it should be read in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>,

 for there the sword is not in the original, but it is in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>,

 <I>The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon.</I> It should seem, he 
 borrowed the word from the Midianite's dream

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 it is <I>the sword of Gideon.</I> Finding his name was a terror to 
 them, he thus improves it against them, but prefixes the name of 
 Jehovah, as the figure without which his own was but an insignificant 
 cypher. This would put life into his own men, who might well take 
 courage when they had such a God as Jehovah, and such a man as Gideon, 
 both to <I>fight for,</I> and to <I>fight for them;</I> well might 
 those follow who had such leaders. It would likewise put their enemies 
 into a fright, who had of old heard of Jehovah's great name, and of 
 late of Gideon's. The sword of the Lord is all in all to the success of 
 the sword of Gideon, yet the sword of Gideon must be employed. Men the 
 instruments, and God the principal agent, must both be considered in 
 their places, but men, the greatest and best, always in subserviency 
 and subordination to God.  This army was to be defeated purely by 
 terrors, and these are especially the <I>sword of the Lord.</I> These 
 soldiers, if they had swords by their sides, that was all, they had 
 none in their hands, but they gained the victory by shouting "The 
 sword." So the church's enemies are routed by <I>a sword out of the 
 mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:21">Rev. xix. 21</A>.

 2.  These soldiers, if they had swords by their sides, that was all, 
 they had none in their hands, but they gained the victory by shouting 
 "The sword." So the church's enemies are routed by <I>a sword out of 
 the mouth,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This method here taken of defeating the Midianites may be alluded 
 to, 

 (1.) As typifying the destruction of the devil's kingdom in the world 
 by the preaching of the everlasting gospel, the sounding of that 
 trumpet, and the holding forth of that light out of earthen vessels, 
 for such the ministers of the gospel are, in whom the treasure of that 
 light is deposited,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:6">2 Cor. iv. 6, 7</A>.

 Thus God chose the <I>foolish things of the world to confound the
 wise,</I> a barley-cake to overthrow the tents of Midian, that the 
 <I>excellency of the power might be of God only;</I> the gospel is a 
 sword, not in the hand, but in the mouth, the sword <I>of the Lord and 
 of Gideon,</I> of God and Jesus Christ, him that sits on the throne and 
 the Lamb. 

 (2.) As representing the terrors of the great day. So the excellent 
 bishop Hall applies it; if these pitchers, trumpets, and firebrands, 
 did so daunt and dismay the proud troops of Midian and Amalek, who 
 shall be able to stand before the last terror, when the trumpet of the 
 archangel shall sound, the elements shall be on a flame, the heavens 
 pass away with a great noise, and the Lord himself shall descend with a 
 shout!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The wonderful success of this alarm. The Midianites were shouted 
 out of their lives, as the walls of Jericho were shouted down, that 
 Gideon might see what he lately despaired of ever seeing, the 
 <I>wonders that their fathers told them of.</I> Gideon's soldiers 
 observed their orders, and <I>stood every man in his place round about 
 the camp</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 sounding his trumpet to excite them to fight one another, and holding 
 out his torch to light them to their ruin. They did not rush into the 
 host of Midian, as greedy either of blood or spoil, but patiently stood 
 still to <I>see the salvation of the Lord,</I> a salvation purely of 
 his own working. Observe how the design took effect.

 1. They feared the Israelites. <I>All the host</I> immediately took
 the alarm; it flew like lightning through all their lines, and <I>they 
 ran, and cried, and fled,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 There was something natural in this fright. We may suppose they had not 
 had intelligence of the great diminution of Gideon's army, but rather 
 concluded that since their last advices it had been growing greater and 
 greater; and therefore they had reason to suspect, knowing how odious 
 and grievous they had made themselves and what bold steps had been 
 taken towards the throwing off of their yoke, that it was a very great 
 army which was to be ushered in with all those trumpeters and 
 torch-bearers. But there was more of a supernatural power impressing 
 this terror upon them. God himself gave it the setting on, to show how 
 that promise should have been fulfilled if they had not forfeited it, 
 <I>One of you shall chase a thousand.</I> See the power of imagination, 
 and how much it may become a terror at some times, as at other times it 
 is a pleasure. 

 2. They fell foul upon one another: <I>The Lord set every man's sword
 against his fellow,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 In this confusion, observing the trumpeters and torch-bearers to stand 
 still without their camp, they concluded the body of the army had 
 already entered and was in the midst of them, and therefore every one 
 ran at the next he met, though a friend, supposing him an enemy, and 
 one such mistake as this would occasion many, for then he that slew him 
 would certainly be taken for an enemy, and would be dispatched 
 immediately. It is our interest to preserve such a command of our own 
 spirits as never to <I>be afraid with any amazement,</I> for we cannot 
 conceive what mischiefs we thereby plunge ourselves into. See also how 
 God often makes the enemies of his church instruments to destroy one 
 another; it is a pity the church's friends should ever be thus 
 infatuated. 

 3. They fled for their lives. Perhaps when day-light came they were
 sensible of their mistake in fighting with one another, and concluded 
 that by this fatal error they had so weakened themselves that now it 
 was impossible to make any head against Israel, and therefore made the 
 best of their way towards their own country, though, for aught that 
 appears, the 300 men kept their ground. <I>The wicked flee when none 
 pursueth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:1">Prov. xxviii. 1</A>.

 <I>Terrors make him afraid on every side, and drive him to his 
 feet,</I>

 the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim
 gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Beth-barah

 Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.

 We have here the prosecution of this glorious victory.

 1. Gideon's soldiers that had been dismissed, and perhaps had begun to
 disperse themselves, upon notice of the enemies' flight got together 
 again, and vigorously pursued those whom they had not courage to face. 
 The men of Israel out of Naphtali and Asher who did this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)

 were not such as now came from those distant countries, but the same 
 that had enlisted themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:35"><I>ch.</I> vi. 35</A>),

 but had been cashiered. Those who were fearful and afraid to fight 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 now took heart, when the worst was over, and were ready enough to 
 divide the spoil, though backward to make the onset. Those also that 
 might not fight though they had a mind to it, and were disbanded by 
 order from God, did not as those,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:10,13">2 Chron. xxv. 10, 13</A>,

 <I>return in great anger,</I> but waited for an opportunity of doing
 service in pursuing the victory, though they were denied the honour of 
 helping to force the lines. 

 2. The Ephraimites, upon a summons from Gideon, came in unanimously,
 and secured the passes over Jordan, by the several fords, to cut off 
 the enemies' retreat into their own country, that they might be 
 entirely destroyed, to prevent the like mischief to Israel another 
 time. Now that they had begun to fall, it was easy to say, Down with 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:13">Esth. vi. 13</A>.
 
 They <I>took the waters</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 that is, posted themselves along the river side, so that the 
 Midianites, who fled from those who pursued them, fell into the hands 
 of those that waited to intercept them. Here were <I>fear, and the pit, 
 and the snare,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:17">Isa. xxiv. 17</A>.

 3. Two of the chief commanders of the host of Midian were taken and
 slain by the Ephraimites on this side Jordan,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Their names perhaps signified their nature, <I>Oreb</I> signifies a 
 <I>raven,</I> and <I>Zeeb</I> a <I>wolf</I> (<I>corvus</I> and 
 <I>lupus</I>). These in their flight had taken shelter, one <I>in a 
 rock</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:21,Re+6:15">Isa. ii. 21; Rev. vi. 15</A>),

 the other by a <I>wine-press,</I> as Gideon for fear of them had lately 
 hid his corn by a wine-press,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:11"><I>ch.</I> vi. 11</A>.

 But the places of their shelter were made the places of their
 slaughter, and the memory of it was preserved to posterity in the names 
 of the places, to their perpetual infamy: <I>Here fell the princes of 
 Midian.</I></P>
