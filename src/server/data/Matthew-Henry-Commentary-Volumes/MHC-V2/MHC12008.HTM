 The passages of story recorded in this chapter oblige us to look back. 
 
 I. We read before of a Shunammite woman that was a kind benefactor to 
 Elisha; now here we are told how she fared the better for it, 
 afterwards, in the advice Elisha gave her, and the favour the king 
 showed her for his sake, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. We read before of the designation of Hazael to be king of Syria

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:15">1 Kings xix. 15</A>),

 and here we have an account of his elevation to that throne and the way
 he forced for himself to it, by killing his master, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:7-15">ver. 7-15</A>.

 III. We read before of Jehoram's reigning over Judah in the room of his
 father Jehoshaphat

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:50">1 Kings xxii. 50</A>),

 now here we have a short and sad history of his short and wicked reign

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:16-24">ver. 16-24</A>), 

 and the beginning of the history of the reign of his son Ahaziah,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored
 to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and
 sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath called
 for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.
 &nbsp; 2 And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of
 God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land
 of the Philistines seven years.
 &nbsp; 3 And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman
 returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth
 to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.
 &nbsp; 4 And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of
 God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that
 Elisha hath done.
 &nbsp; 5 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had
 restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son
 he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for
 her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this <I>is</I> the woman,
 and this <I>is</I> her son, whom Elisha restored to life.
 &nbsp; 6 And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king
 appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that
 <I>was</I> hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that
 she left the land, even until now.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The wickedness of Israel punished with a long famine, one of God's 
 sore judgments often threatened in the law. <I>Canaan,</I> that 
 fruitful land, <I>was turned into barrenness,</I> for the <I>iniquity 
 of those that dwelt therein.</I> The famine in Samaria was soon 
 relieved by the raising of that siege, but neither that judgment nor 
 that mercy had a due influence upon them, and therefore <I>the Lord 
 called for another famine;</I> for when he judgeth he will overcome. If 
 less judgments do not prevail to bring men to repentance, he will send 
 greater and longer; they are at his beck, and will come when he calls 
 for them. He does, by his ministers, call for reformation and 
 obedience, and, if those calls be not regarded, we may expect he will 
 call for some plague or other, for he will be heard. This famine 
 continued seven years, as long again as that in Elijah's time; for if 
 men will walk contrary to him, he will heat the furnace yet hotter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The kindness of the good Shunammite to the prophet rewarded by the 
 care that was taken of her in that famine; she was not indeed fed by 
 miracle, as the widow of Sarepta was, but, 

 1. She had notice given her of this famine before it came, that she 
 might provide accordingly, and was directed to remove to some other 
 country; any where but in Israel she would find plenty. It was a great 
 advantage to Egypt in Joseph's time that they had notice of the famine 
 before it came, so it was to this Shunammite; others would be forced to 
 remove at last, after they had long borne the grievances of the famine, 
 and had wasted their substance, and could not settle elsewhere upon 
 such good terms as she might that went early, before the crowd, and 
 took her stock with her unbroken. It is our happiness to foresee an 
 evil, and our wisdom, when we foresee an evil, and our wisdom, when we 
 foresee it, to hide ourselves. 

 2. Providence gave her a comfortable settlement in <I>the land of the
 Philistines,</I> who, though subdued by David, yet were not wholly 
 rooted out. It seems the famine was peculiar to the land of Israel, and 
 other countries that joined close to them had plenty at the same time, 
 which plainly showed the immediate hand of God in it (as in the plagues 
 of Egypt, when they distinguished between the Israelites and the 
 Egyptians) and that the sins of Israel, against whom this judgment was 
 directly levelled, were more provoking to God than the sins of their 
 neighbours, because of their profession of relation to God. <I>You only 
 have I known, therefore will I punish you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:2">Amos iii. 2</A>.

 Other countries had rain when they had none, were free from locusts and
 caterpillars when they were eaten up with them; for some think this was 
 the famine spoken of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:3,4">Joel i. 3, 4</A>.

 It is strange that when there was plenty in the neighbouring countries
 there were not those that made it their business to import corn into 
 the land of Israel, which might have prevented the inhabitants from 
 removing; but, as they were befooled with their idolatries, so they 
 were infatuated even in the matters of their civil interest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Her petition to the king at her return, favoured by the 
 seasonableness of her application to him. 

 1. When the famine was over she <I>returned out of the land of the 
 Philistines;</I> that was no proper place for an Israelite to dwell any 
 longer than there was a necessity for so doing, for there she could not
 keep her new moons and her sabbaths as she used to do in her own 
 country, among the schools of the prophets,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:23"><I>ch.</I> iv. 23</A>.

 2. At her return she found herself kept out of the possession of her
 own estate, it being either confiscated to the exchequer, seized by the 
 lord, or usurped in her absence by some of the neighbours; or perhaps 
 the person she had entrusted with the management of it proved false, 
 and would neither resign it to her nor come to an account with her for 
 the profits: so hard is it to find a person that one can put a 
 confidence in <I>in a time of trouble,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:19,Mic+7:5">Prov. xxv. 19; Mic. vii. 5</A>.

 3.  She made her application to the king himself for redress; for, it 
 seems (be it observed to his praise), he was easy of access, and did 
 himself take cognizance of the complaint of his injured subjects. Time 
 was when she dwelt so securely among her own people that she had no 
 occasion to be <I>spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the 
 host</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+4:13"><I>ch.</I> iv. 13</A>);

 but now her own familiar friends, in whom she trusted, proved so unjust
 and unkind that she was glad to appeal to the king against them. Such 
 uncertainty there is in the creature that that may fail us which we 
 most depend upon and that befriend us which we think we shall never 
 need. 

 4. She found the king talking with Gehazi about Elisha's miracles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 It was his shame that he needed now to be informed concerning them,
 when he might have acquainted himself with them as they were done from 
 Elisha himself, if he had not been willing to shut his eyes against the 
 convincing evidence of his mission; yet it was his praise that he was 
 now better disposed, and would rather talk with a leper that was 
 capable of giving a good account of them than continue ignorant of 
 them. The law did not forbid all conversation with lepers, but only 
 dwelling with them. There being then no priests in Israel, perhaps the 
 king, or some one appointed by him, had the inspection of lepers, and 
 passed the judgment upon them, which might bring him acquainted with 
 Gehazi. 

 5. This happy coincidence befriended both Gehazi's narrative and her 
 petition. Providence is to be acknowledged in ordering the 
 circumstances of events, for sometimes those that are minute in 
 themselves prove of great consequence, as this did, for,

 (1.) It made the king ready to believe Gehazi's narrative when it was 
 thus confirmed by the persons most nearly concerned: "<I>This is the 
 woman, and this her son;</I> let them speak for themselves," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Thus did God even force him to believe what he might have had some 
 colour to question if he had only had Gehazi's word for it, because he 
 was branded for a liar, witness his leprosy.

 (2.) It made him ready to grant her request; for who would not be ready 
 to favour one whom heaven had thus favoured, and to support a life 
 which was given once and again by miracle? In consideration of this the 
 king gave orders that her land should be restored to her and all the 
 profits that were made of it in her absence. If it was to himself that 
 the land and profits had escheated, it was generous and kind to make so 
 full a restitution; he would not (as Pharaoh did in Joseph's time) 
 enrich the crown by the calamities of his subjects. If it was by some 
 other person that her property was invaded, it was an act of justice in 
 the king, and part of the duty of his place, to give her redress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:3,4,Pr+31:9">Ps. lxxxii. 3, 4; Prov. xxxi. 9</A>.

 It is not enough for those in authority that they do no wrong
 themselves, but they must support the right of those that are 
 wronged.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria
 was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come
 hither.
 &nbsp; 8 And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand,
 and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by him,
 saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
 &nbsp; 9 So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even
 of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came
 and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria
 hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
 &nbsp; 10 And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest
 certainly recover: howbeit the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath showed me that he shall
 surely die.
 &nbsp; 11 And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was
 ashamed: and the man of God wept.
 &nbsp; 12 And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered,
 Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of
 Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young
 men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children,
 and rip up their women with child.
 &nbsp; 13 And Hazael said, But what, <I>is</I> thy servant a dog, that he
 should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 showed me that thou <I>shalt be</I> king over Syria.
 &nbsp; 14 So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said
 to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me
 <I>that</I> thou shouldest surely recover.
 &nbsp; 15 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick
 cloth, and dipped <I>it</I> in water, and spread <I>it</I> on his face, so
 that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. We may enquire what brought Elisha to Damascus, the chief city of 
 Syria. Was he sent to any but the <I>lost sheep of the house of 
 Israel?</I> It seems he was. Perhaps he went to pay a visit to Naaman 
 his convert, and to confirm him in his choice of the true religion, 
 which was the more needful now because, it should seem, he was not out 
 of his place (for Hazael is supposed to be captain of that host); 
 either he resigned it or was turned out of it, because he would not 
 bow, or not bow heartily, in the house of Rimmon. Some think he went to 
 Damascus upon account of the famine, or rather he went thither in 
 obedience to the orders God gave Elijah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:15">1 Kings xix. 15</A>,

 "<I>Go to Damascus to anoint Hazael,</I> thou, or thy successor."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We may observe that Ben-hadad, a great king, rich and mighty, lay 
 sick. No honour, wealth, or power, will secure men from the common 
 diseases and disasters of human life; palaces and thrones lie as open 
 to the arrests of sickness and death as the meanest cottage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We may wonder that the king of Syria, in his sickness, should make 
 Elisha his oracle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Notice was soon brought him that <I>the man of God</I> (for by that 
 title he was well known in Syria since he cured Naaman) had come to 
 Damascus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 "Never in better time," says Ben-hadad. "<I>Go, and enquire of the Lord
 by him.</I>" In his health he <I>bowed in the house of Rimmon,</I> but 
 now that he is sick he distrusts his idol, and sends to enquire of the 
 God of Israel. Affliction brings those to God who in their prosperity
 had made light of him; sometimes sickness opens men's eyes and
 rectifies their mistakes. This is the more observable,

 (1.) Because it was not long since a king of Israel had, in his
 sickness, sent to enquire of the god of Ekron

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:2"><I>ch.</I> i. 2</A>),

 as if there had been no God in Israel. Note, God sometimes fetches to
 himself that honour from strangers which is denied him and alienated 
 from him by his own professing people. 

 (2.) Because it was not long since this Ben-hadad had sent a great 
 force to treat Elisha as an enemy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:14"><I>ch.</I> vi. 14</A>),

 yet now he courts him as a prophet. Note, Among other instances of the
 change of men's minds by sickness and affliction, this is one, that it 
 often gives them other thoughts of God's ministers, and teaches them to 
 value the counsels and prayers of those whom they had hated and 
 despised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To put an honour upon the prophet, 

 (1.) He sends <I>to</I> him, and does not send <I>for</I> him, as if, 
 with the centurion, he thought himself not worthy that the man of God 
 should come under his roof. 

 (2.) He sends to him by Hazael, his prime-minister of state, and not by 
 a common messenger. It is no disparagement to the greatest of men to 
 attend the prophets of the Lord. Hazael must go and meet him at a place 
 where he had appointed a meeting with his friends. 

 (3.) He sends him a noble present, <I>of every good thing of
 Damascus,</I> as much as loaded forty camels 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 testifying hereby his affection to the prophet, bidding him welcome to
 Damascus, and providing for his sustenance while he sojourned there.  
 It is probable that Elisha accepted it (why should he not?), though he 
 refused Naaman's.

 (4.) He orders Hazael to call him <I>his son Ben-hadad,</I> conforming 
 to the language of Israel, who called the prophets <I>fathers.</I> 

 (5.) He puts an honour upon him as one acquainted with the secrets of 
 heaven, when he enquires of him, <I>Shall I recover?</I> It is natural 
 to us to desire to know things to come in time, while things to come in 
 eternity are little thought of or enquired after.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. What passed between Hazael and Elisha is especially remarkable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Elisha answered his enquiry concerning the king, that he might 
 recover, the disease was not mortal, but that he should die another way 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 not a natural but a violent death. There are many ways out of the
 world, and sometimes, while men think to avoid one, they fall by 
 another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He looked Hazael in the face with an unusual concern, till he made 
 Hazael blush and himself weep, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The man of God could outface the man of war. It was not in Hazael's
 countenance that Elisha read what he would do, but God did, at this 
 time, reveal it to him, and it fetched tears from his eyes. The more 
 foresight men have the more grief they are liable to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. When Hazael asked him why he wept he told him what a great deal of 
 mischief he foresaw he would do to the Israel of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 what desolations he would make of their strong-holds, and barbarous
 destruction of their men, women, and children. The sins of Israel 
 provoked God to give them up into the hands of their cruel enemies, yet 
 Elisha wept to think that ever Israelites should be thus abused; for, 
 though he foretold, he did not desire the woeful day. See what havock 
 war makes, what havock sin makes, and how the nature of man is changed 
 by the fall, and stripped even of humanity itself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Hazael was greatly surprised at this prediction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):
 
 <I>What,</I> says he, <I>Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this
 great thing?</I> This great thing he looks upon to be, 

 (1.) An act of great power, not to be done but by a crowned head. "It 
 must be some mighty potentate that can think to prevail thus against 
 Israel, and therefore not I." Many are raised to that dominion which 
 they never thought of and it often proves <I>to their own hurt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:9">Eccl. viii. 9</A>.

 (2.) An act of great barbarity, which could not be done but by one lost 
 to all honour and virtue: "Therefore," says he, "it is what I shall 
 never find in my heart to be guilty of: <I>Is thy servant a dog,</I> to 
 rend, and tear, and devour? Unless I were a dog, I could not do it." 
 See here,

 [1.] What a bad opinion he had of the sin; he looked upon it to be 
 great wickedness, fitter for a brute, for a beast of prey, to do than a 
 man. Note, It is possible for a wicked man, under the convictions and 
 restraints of natural conscience, to express great abhorrence of a sin, 
 and yet afterwards to be well reconciled to it.  

 [2.] What a good opinion he had of himself, how much better than he 
 deserved; he thought it impossible he should do such barbarous things 
 as the prophet foresaw. Note, We are apt to think ourselves 
 sufficiently armed against those sins which yet we are afterwards 
 overcome by, as Peter,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:35">Matt. xxvi. 35</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. In answer to this Elisha only told him <I>he should be king over 
 Syria;</I> then he would have power to do it, and then he would find in 
 his heart to do it. <I>Honours change men's tempers and manners,</I> 
 and seldom for the better: "Thou knowest not what thou wilt do when 
 thou comest to be king, but I tell thee this thou wilt do." Those that 
 are little and low in the world cannot imagine how strong the 
 temptations of power and prosperity are, and, if ever they arrive at 
 them, they will find how deceitful their hearts were and how much worse 
 than they suspected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. What mischief Hazael did to his master hereupon. If he took any 
 occasion to do it from what Elisha had said the fault was in him, not 
 in the word. 

 1. He basely cheated his master, and belied the prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>He told me thou shouldst certainly recover.</I> This was abominably
 false; he told him he should die

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 but he unfairly and unfaithfully concealed that, either because he was
 loth to put the king out of humour with bad news or because hereby he 
 might the more effectually carry on that bloody design which he 
 conceived when he was told he should be his successor. The devil ruins 
 men by telling them they shall certainly recover and do well, so 
 rocking them asleep in security, than which nothing is more fatal. This 
 was an injury to the king, who lost the benefit of this warning to 
 prepare for death, and an injury to Elisha, who would be counted a 
 false prophet.

 2. He barbarously murdered his master, and so made good the prophet's
 word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 He dipped a thick cloth in cold water, and spread it upon his face,
 under pretence of cooling and refreshing him, but so that it stopped 
 his breath, and stifled him presently, he being weak (and not able to 
 help himself) or perhaps asleep: such a bubble is the life of the 
 greatest of men, and so much exposed are princes to violence.  Hazael, 
 who was Ben-hadad's confidant, was his murderer, and some think, was 
 not suspected, nor did the truth ever come out but by the pen of this 
 inspired historian. We found this haughty monarch

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:1-43">1 Kings xx.</A>)

 <I>the terror of the mighty in the land of the living,</I> but he
 <I>goes down slain to the pit</I> with <I>his iniquity upon his 
 bones,</I>

 &nbsp; 17 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and
 he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 18 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the
 house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did
 evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 19 Yet the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> would not destroy Judah for David his servant's
 sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, <I>and</I> to his
 children.
 &nbsp; 20 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and
 made a king over themselves.
 &nbsp; 21 So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him:
 and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him
 about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into
 their tents.
 &nbsp; 22 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this
 day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
 &nbsp; 23 And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did,
 <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
 of Judah?
 &nbsp; 24 And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
 fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his
 stead.

 We have here a brief account of the life and reign of Jehoram (or 
 Joram), one of the worst of the kings of Judah, but the son and 
 successor of Jehoshaphat, one of the best. Note, 

 1. Parents cannot give grace to their children. Many that have 
 themselves been godly have had the grief and shame of seeing those that 
 came forth out of their bowels wicked and vile. Let not the families 
 that are thus afflicted think it strange. 

 2. If the children of good parents prove wicked, commonly they are
 worse than others. The unclean spirit brings in seven others more 
 wicked than himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:26">Luke xi. 26</A>.

 3. A nation is sometimes justly punished with the miseries of a bad
 reign for not improving the blessings and advantages of a good one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Concerning this Jehoram observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The general idea here given of his wickedness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>He did as the house of Ahab,</I> and worse he could not do. His
 character is taken from the bad example he followed, for men are 
 according to the company they converse with and the copies they write 
 after. No mistake is more fatal to young people than a mistake in the 
 choice of those whom they would recommend themselves to and take their 
 measures from, and whose good opinion they value themselves by. Jehoram 
 chose the house of Ahab for his pattern rather than his father's house, 
 and this choice was his ruin. We have a particular account of his 
 wickedness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+21:1-30">2 Chron. xxi.</A>),

 murder, idolatry, persecution, everything that was bad.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The occasions of his wickedness. His father was a very good man, 
 and no doubt took care to have him taught the good knowledge of the 
 Lord, but, 

 1. It is certain he did ill to marry him to the daughter of Ahab; no 
 good could come of an alliance with an idolatrous family, but all 
 mischief with such a daughter of such a mother as Athaliah the daughter 
 of Jezebel. The degeneracy of the old world took rise from the unequal 
 yoking of professors with profane. Those that are ill-matched are 
 already half-ruined. 

 2. I doubt he did not do well to make him king in his own life-time. It
 is said here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 that he <I>began to reign, Jehoshaphat being then king;</I> hereby he
 gratified his pride (than which nothing is more pernicious to young 
 people), indulged him in his ambition, in hopes to reform him by 
 humouring him, and so brought a curse upon his family, as Eli did, 
 <I>whose sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not.</I> 
 Jehoshaphat had made this wicked son of his viceroy once when he went
 with Ahab to Ramoth-Gilead, from which Jehoshaphat's seventeenth year

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:51">1 Kings xxii. 51</A>)
 
 is made Jehoram's second
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:17">2 Kings i. 17</A>),

 but afterwards, in his twenty-second year, he made him partner in his
 government, and thence Joram's eight years are to be dated, three years 
 before his father's death. It has been hurtful to many young men to 
 come too soon to their estates. Samuel got nothing by <I>making his 
 sons judges.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The rebukes of Providence which he was under for his wickedness. 

 1. The Edomites revolted, who had been under the government of the 
 kings of Judah ever since David's time, about 150 years, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 He attempted to reduce them, and gave them a defeat

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 but he could not improve the advantage he had got, so as to recover his
 dominion over them: <I>Yet Edom revolted</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 and the Edomites were, after this, bitter enemies to the Jews, as
 appears by the prophecy of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:1-21">Obadiah</A>

 and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:7">Ps. cxxxvii. 7</A>.

 Now Isaac's prophecy was fulfilled, that this Esau the elder should
 serve Jacob the younger; yet, in process of time, he should <I>break 
 that yoke from off his neck,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:40">Gen. xxvii. 40</A>.

 2.  Libnah revolted. This was a city in Judah, in the heart of his
 country, a priests' city; the inhabitants of this city shook off his 
 government <I>because he had forsaken God,</I> and would have compelled 
 them to do so too,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+21:10,11">2 Chron. xxi. 10, 11</A>.

 In order that they might preserve their religion they set up for a free
 state. Perhaps other cities did the same. 

 3. His reign was short. God cut him off in the midst of his days, when 
 he was but forty years old, and had reigned but eight years. <I>Bloody 
 and deceitful men shall not live out half their days.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The gracious care of Providence for the keeping up of the kingdom 
 of Judah, and the house of David, notwithstanding the apostasies and 
 calamities of Jehoram's reign 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Yet the Lord would not destroy Judah.</I> He could easily have done
 it; he might justly have done it; it would have been no loss to him to 
 have done it; yet he would not do it, for David's sake, not for the 
 sake of any merit of his which could challenge this favour to his 
 family as a debt, but for the sake of a promise made to him that he 
 should always have a lamp (that is, a succession of kings from one 
 generation to another, by which his name should be kept bright and 
 illustrious, as a lamp is kept burning by a constant fresh supply of 
 oil), that his family should never be extinct till it terminated in the 
 Messiah, that Son of David on whom was to be <I>hung all the glory of 
 his Father's house</I> and in whose everlasting kingdom that promise to 
 David is fulfilled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:17">Ps. cxxxii. 17</A>),
 
 <I>I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The conclusion of this impious and inglorious reign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.
 
 Nothing peculiar is here said of him; but we are told
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+21:19,20">2 Chron. xxi. 19, 20</A>)

 that he <I>died of sore diseases</I> and <I>died without being
 desired.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>25 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel
 did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.
 &nbsp; 26 Two and twenty years old <I>was</I> Ahaziah when he began to
 reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's
 name <I>was</I> Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
 &nbsp; 27 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil
 in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, as <I>did</I> the house of Ahab: for he
 <I>was</I> the son in law of the house of Ahab.
 &nbsp; 28 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against
 Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded
 Joram.
 &nbsp; 29 And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the
 wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought
 against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king
 of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel,
 because he was sick.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As among common persons there are some that we call <I>little men,</I> 
 who make no figure, are little regarded, as less valued, so among kings 
 there are some whom, in comparison with others, we may call <I>little 
 kings.</I> This Ahaziah was one of these; he looks mean in the history, 
 and in God's account vile, because wicked. It is too plain an evidence 
 of the affinity between Jehoshaphat and Ahab that they had the same 
 names in their families at the same time, in which, we may suppose, 
 they designed to compliment one another. Ahab had two sons, Ahaziah and 
 Jehoram, who reigned successively; Jehoshaphat had a son and grandson 
 names Jehoshaphat had a son and grandson names Jehoram and Ahaziah, 
 who, in like manner, reigned successively. Names indeed do not make
 natures, but it was a bad omen to Jehoshaphat's family to borrow names 
 from Ahab's; or, if he lent the names to that wretched family, he could 
 not communicate with them the devotion of their significations, 
 <I>Ahaziah--Taking hold of the Lord,</I> and <I>Jehoram--The Lord
 exalted.</I> Ahaziah king of Israel had reigned but two years, Ahaziah 
 king of Judah reigned but one. We are here told that his relation to 
 Ahab's family was the occasion, 

 1. Of his wickedness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 <I>He walked in the way of the house of Ahab,</I> that idolatrous
 bloody house; for his mother was Ahab's daughter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 so that he sucked in wickedness with his milk.  <I>Partus sequitur
 ventrem--The child may be expected to resemble the mother.</I> When men 
 choose wives for themselves they must remember they are choosing 
 mothers for their children, and are concerned to choose accordingly.

 2. Of his fall.  Joram, his mother's brother, courted him to join with
 him for the recovery of Ramoth-Gilead, an attempt fatal to Ahab; so it 
 was to Joram his son, for in that expedition he was wounded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),
 
 and returned to Jezreel to be cured, leaving his army there in
 possession of the place.  Ahaziah likewise returned, but went to 
 Jezreel to see how Jehoram did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Providence so ordered it, that he who had been debauched by the house
 of Ahab might be cut off with them, when the measure of their iniquity 
 was full, as we shall find in the next chapter. Those who partake with 
 sinners in their sins must expect to partake with them in their 
 plagues.</P>
