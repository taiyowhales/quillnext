 In this chapter we have, 

 I. That extraordinary event, the translation of Elijah. In the close of 
 the foregoing chapter we had a wicked king leaving the world in 
 disgrace, here we have a holy prophet leaving it in honour; the 
 departure of the former was his greatest misery, of the latter his 
 greatest bliss: men are as their end is. Here is,

 1. Elijah taking leave of his friends, the sons of the prophets, and
 especially Elisha, who kept close to him, and walked with him through 
 Jordan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:1-10">ver.  1-10</A>.

 2. Elijah taken into heaven by the ministry of angels

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:11">ver. 11</A>),

 and Elisha's lamentation of the loss this earth has of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:12">ver. 12</A>.
 
 II.  The manifestation of Elisha, as a prophet in his room.

 1. By the dividing of Jordan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.

 2. By the respect which the sons of the prophets paid him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:15-18">ver. 15-18</A>.

 3. By the healing of the unwholesome waters of Jericho, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:19-22">ver. 19-22</A>.

 4.  By the destruction of the children of Bethel that mocked him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:23-25">ver. 23-25</A>.

 This revolution in prophecy makes a greater figure than the revolution
 of a kingdom.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass, when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> would take up Elijah into
 heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
 &nbsp; 2 And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath sent me to Beth-el. And Elisha said <I>unto him, As</I> the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth, and <I>as</I> thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So
 they went down to Beth-el.
 &nbsp; 3 And the sons of the prophets that <I>were</I> at Beth-el came forth
 to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will
 take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I
 know <I>it;</I> hold ye your peace.
 &nbsp; 4 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee;
 for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, <I>As</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 liveth, and <I>as</I> thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they
 came to Jericho.
 &nbsp; 5 And the sons of the prophets that <I>were</I> at Jericho came to
 Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will take
 away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I
 know <I>it;</I> hold ye your peace.
 &nbsp; 6 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, <I>As</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth,
 and <I>as</I> thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two
 went on.
 &nbsp; 7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to
 view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.
 &nbsp; 8 And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped <I>it</I> together, and
 smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so
 that they two went over on dry ground.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Elijah's times, and the events concerning him, are as little dated as 
 those of any great man in scripture; we are not told of his age, nor in 
 what year of Ahab's reign he first appeared, nor in what year of 
 Joram's he disappeared, and therefore cannot conjecture how long he 
 flourished; it is supposed about twenty years in all. Here we are 
 told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That God had determined to take him up into heaven by a whirlwind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He would do it, and it is probable let him know of his purpose some 
 time before, that he would shortly take him from the world, not by 
 death, but translate him body and soul to heaven, as Enoch was, only 
 causing him to undergo such a change as would be necessary to the 
 qualifying of him to be an inhabitant in that world of spirits, and 
 such as those shall undergo who will be found alive at Christ's coming.  
 It is not for us to say why God would put such a peculiar honour upon 
 Elijah above any other of the prophets; he was a man <I>subject to like 
 passions as we are,</I> knew sin, and yet never tasted death. Wherefore 
 is he thus dignified, thus distinguished, as a man whom the Kings of 
 kings did delight to honour? We may suppose that herein, 

 1. God looked back upon his past services, which were eminent and 
 extraordinary, and intended a recompence for those and an encouragement 
 to the sons of the prophets to tread in the steps of his zeal and 
 faithfulness, and, whatever it cost them, to witness against the 
 corruptions of the age they lived in. 

 2. He looked down upon the present dark and degenerate state of the
 church, and would thus give a very sensible proof of another life after 
 this, and draw the hearts of the faithful few upward towards himself, 
 and that other life. 

 3. He looked forward to the evangelical dispensation, and, in the
 translation of Elijah, gave a type and figure of the ascension of 
 Christ and the <I>opening of the kingdom of heaven to all 
 believers.</I> Elijah had, by faith and prayer, conversed much with 
 heaven, and now he is taken thither, to assure us that if we have our 
 conversation in heaven, while we are here on earth, we shall be there 
 shortly, the soul shall (and that is the man) be happy there, there for 
 ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That Elisha had determined, as long as he continued on earth to 
 cleave to him, and not to leave him. Elijah seemed desirous to shake 
 him off, would have had him stay behind at Gilgal, at Bethel, at 
 Jericho, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:2,4,6"><I>v.</I> 2, 4, 6</A>.

 Some think out of humility; he knew what glory God designed for him,
 but would not seem to glory in it, nor desired it should be seen of men 
 (God's favourites covet not to have it proclaimed before them that they 
 are so, as the favourites of earthly princes do), or rather it was to 
 try him, and make his constant adherence to him the more commendable, 
 like Naomi's persuading Ruth to go back. In vain does Elijah entreat 
 him to tarry here and tarry there; he resolves to tarry nowhere behind 
 his master, till he goes to heaven, and leaves him behind on this 
 earth. "Whatever comes of it, <I>I will not leave thee;</I>" and why 
 so? Not only because he loved him, but,

 1. Because he desired to be edified by his holy heavenly converse as 
 long as he staid on earth; it had always been profitable, but, we may 
 suppose, was now more so than ever. We should do all the spiritual good 
 we can one to another, and get all we can one by another, while we are 
 together, because we are to be <I>together but a little while.</I> 

 2.  Because he desired to be satisfied concerning his departure, and to
 see him when he was taken up, that his faith might be confirmed and his 
 acquaintance with the invisible world increased. He had long followed 
 Elijah, and he would not leave him now when he hoped for the parting 
 blessing. Let not those that follow Christ come short by tiring at 
 last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That Elijah, before his departure, visited the schools of the 
 prophets and took leave of them. It seems that there were such schools 
 in many of the cities of Israel, probably even in Samaria itself. Here 
 we find <I>sons of the prophets,</I> and considerable numbers of them, 
 even at Bethel, where one of the calves was set up, and at Jericho, 
 which was lately built in defiance of a divine curse. At Jerusalem, and 
 in the kingdom of Judah, they had priests and Levites, and the 
 temple-service, the want of which, in the kingdom of Israel, God 
 graciously made up by those colleges, where men were trained up and 
 employed in the exercises of religion and devotion, and whither good 
 people resorted to solemnize the appointed feasts with praying and 
 hearing, when they had not conveniences for sacrifice or incense, and 
 thus religion was kept up in a time of general apostasy. Much of God 
 was among these prophets, and <I>more were the children of the 
 desolate</I> than the <I>children of the married wife.</I> None of all 
 the high priests were comparable to those two great men Elijah and 
 Elisha, who, for aught we know, never attended in the temple at 
 Jerusalem. These seminaries of religion and virtue, which Elijah, it is 
 probable, had been instrumental to found, he now visits, before his 
 departure, to instruct, encourage, and bless them. Note, Those that are 
 going to heaven themselves ought to be concerned for those they leave 
 behind them on earth, and to leave with them their experiences, 
 testimonies, counsels, and prayers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:15">2 Pet. i. 15</A>.

 When Christ said, with triumph, <I>Now I am no more in the world,</I>
 he added, with tenderness, <I>But these are. Father, keep them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That the sons of the prophets had intelligence (either from Elijah 
 himself, or by the spirit of prophecy in some of their own society), or 
 suspected by the solemnity of Elijah's farewell, that he was now 
 shortly to be removed; and, 

 1. They told Elisha of it, both at Bethel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)
 
 and at Jericho
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 <I>Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master from thy head
 to day?</I> This they said, not as upbraiding him with his loss, or 
 expecting that when his master was gone he would be upon the level with 
 them, but to show how full they were of the thoughts of this matter and 
 big with expectation of the event, and to admonish Elisha to prepare 
 for the loss. Know we not that our nearest relations, and dearest 
 friends, must shortly be taken from us? <I>The Lord will</I> take them; 
 we lose them not till he calls for them whose they are, and who 
 <I>taketh away and none can hinder him.</I> He takes away superiors 
 from our head, inferiors from our feet, equals from our arms; let us 
 therefore carefully do the duty of every relation, that we may reflect 
 upon it with comfort when it comes to be dissolved. Elisha knew it too 
 well, and <I>sorrow had filled his heart</I> upon this account (as the 
 disciples in a like case,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:6">John xvi. 6</A>),

 and therefore he did not need to be told of it, did not care for
 hearing of it, and would not be interrupted in his contemplations on 
 this great concern, or in the least diverted from his attendance upon 
 his master. <I>I know it; hold you your peace.</I> He speaks not this 
 peevishly, or in contempt of the sons of the prophets, but as one that 
 was himself and would have them composed and sedate, and with an awful 
 silence expecting the event: <I>I know it; be silent,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:13">Zech. ii. 13</A>.

 2. They went themselves to be witnesses of it at a distance, though
 they might not closely attend 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Fifty of them stood to view afar off,</I> intending to satisfy their
 curiosity, but God so ordered it that they might be eye-witnesses of 
 the honour heaven did to that prophet, who was <I>despised and rejected 
 of men.</I> God's works are well worthy our notice; when a <I>door is 
 opened in heaven</I> the call is, <I>Come up hither, come and 
 see.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That the miraculous dividing of the river Jordan was the preface to 
 Elijah's translation into the heavenly Canaan, as it had been to the 
 entrance of Israel into the earthly Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He must go on to the other side Jordan to be translated, because it was 
 his native country, and that he might be near the place where Moses 
 died, and that thus honour might be put on that part of the country 
 which was most despised. he and Elisha might have gone over Jordan by a 
 ferry, as other passengers did, but God would magnify Elijah in his 
 exit, as he did Joshua in his entrance, by the dividing of this river,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:7">Josh. iii. 7</A>.

 As Moses with his rod divided the sea, so Elijah with his mantle
 divided Jordan, both being the <I>insignia--the badges</I> of their 
 office. These waters of old yielded to the ark, now to the prophet's
 mantle, which, to those that wanted the ark was an equivalent token of 
 God's presence. When God will take up his faithful ones to heaven death 
 is the Jordan which, immediately before their translation, they must 
 pass through, and they find a way through it, as safe and comfortable 
 way; the death of Christ has divided those waters, that the ransomed of 
 the Lord may pass over. <I>O death! where is thy sting,</I> thy hurt, 
 thy terror?</P>

 <A NAME="2Ki2_9"> </A>
 <A NAME="2Ki2_10"> </A>
 <A NAME="2Ki2_11"> </A>
 <A NAME="2Ki2_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah
 said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken
 away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double
 portion of thy spirit be upon me.
 &nbsp; 10 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: <I>nevertheless,</I>
 if thou see me <I>when I am</I> taken from thee, it shall be so unto
 thee; but if not, it shall not be <I>so.</I>
 &nbsp; 11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked,
 that, behold, <I>there appeared</I> a chariot of fire, and horses of
 fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a
 whirlwind into heaven.
 &nbsp; 12 And Elisha saw <I>it,</I> and he cried, My father, my father, the
 chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no
 more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two
 pieces.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Elijah makes his will, and leaves Elisha his heir, now anointing him 
 to be prophet in his room, more than when he <I>cast his mantle upon 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:19">1 Kings xix. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Elijah, being greatly pleased with the constancy of Elisha's 
 affection and attendance, bade him ask what he should do for him, what 
 blessing he should leave him at parting; he does not say (as bishop 
 Hall observes), "<I>Ask of me when I am gone,</I> in heaven I shall be 
 better able to befriend thee," but, "Ask before I go." Our friends on 
 earth may be spoken to, and can give us an answer, but we know not that 
 we can have access to any friend in heaven but Christ, and God in him. 
 <I>Abraham is ignorant of us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Elisha, having this fair opportunity to enrich himself with the best 
 riches, prays for a <I>double portion of his spirit.</I> He asks not 
 for wealth, nor honour, nor exemption from trouble, but to be qualified 
 for the service of God and his generation, he asks, 

 (1.) For the Spirit, not that the gifts and graces of the Spirit were 
 in Elijah's power to give, therefore he says not, "Give me the Spirit" 
 (he knew very well it was God's gift), but "<I>Let it be upon me,</I> 
 intercede with God for this for me." Christ bade his disciples ask what 
 they would, not one, but all, and promised to send the Spirit, with 
 much more authority and assurance than Elijah could. 

 (2.) For <I>his</I> spirit, because he was to be a prophet in his room, 
 to carry on his work, to father the sons of the prophets and face their 
 enemies, because he had the same perverse generation to deal with that 
 he had, so that, if he have not his spirit, he has not <I>strength 
 according to the day.</I> 

 (3.) For a <I>double portion of his spirit;</I> he does not mean double 
 to what Elijah had, but double to what the rest of the prophets had, 
 from whom so much would not be expected as from Elisha, who had been 
 brought up under Elijah. It is a holy ambition to <I>covet earnestly 
 the best gifts,</I> and those which will render us most serviceable to 
 God and our brethren. Note, We all ought, both ministers and people, to 
 set before us the example of our predecessors, to labour after their 
 spirit, and to be earnest with God for that grace which carried them 
 through their work and enabled them to finish well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Elijah promised him that which he asked, but under two provisos, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 (1.) Provided he put a due value upon it and esteem it highly: this he 
 teaches him to do by calling it <I>a hard thing,</I> not too hard for 
 God to do, but too great for him to expect. Those are best prepared for 
 spiritual blessings that are most sensible of their worth and their own 
 unworthiness to receive them. 

 (2.) Provided he kept close to his master, even to the last, and was 
 observant of him: <I>If thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall 
 be</I> so, otherwise not. A diligent attendance upon his master's 
 instructions, and a careful observance of his example, particularly now 
 in his last scene, were the condition and would be a proper means of 
 obtaining much of his spirit.  Taking strict notice of the manner of 
 his ascension would likewise be of great use to him. The comforts of 
 departing saints, and their experiences, will mightily help both to 
 gild our comforts and to steel our resolutions. Or, perhaps, this was 
 intended only as a sign: "If God favour thee so far as to give thee a 
 sight of me when I ascend, take that for a token that he will do this 
 for thee, and depend upon it." Christ's disciples saw him ascend, and 
 were thereupon assured that they should, in a little time, be filled 
 with his Spirit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:8">Acts i. 8</A>.

 Elisha, we may suppose, hereupon prayed earnestly, <I>Lord, show me
 this token for good.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Elijah is carried up to heaven in a fiery chariot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Like Enoch, he was translated, <I>that he should not see death;</I> and
 was (as Mr. Cowley expresses it) <I>the second man that leaped the 
 ditch where all the rest of mankind fell, and went not downward to the 
 sky.</I> Many curious questions might be asked about this matter, which 
 could not be answered. Let it suffice that we are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What his Lord, when he came, found him doing. He was talking with 
 Elisha, instructing and encouraging him, directing him in his work, and 
 quickening him to it, for the good of those whom he left behind. He was 
 not meditating nor praying, as one wholly taken up with the world he 
 was going to, but engaged in edifying discourse, as one concerned about 
 the kingdom of God among men. We mistake if we think our preparation 
 for heaven is carried on only by contemplation and the acts of 
 devotion. Usefulness to others will pass as well in our account as any 
 thing. Thinking of divine things is good, but talking of them (if it 
 come from the heart) is better, because for edification, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:4">1 Cor. xiv. 4</A>.
 
 Christ ascended as he was blessing his disciples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What convoy his Lord sent for him--<I>a chariot of fire and horses of
 fire,</I> which appeared either descending upon them from the clouds or 
 (as bishop Patrick thinks) running towards them upon the ground: in 
 this form the angels appeared. The souls of all the faithful are 
 carried by an invisible guard of angels into the bosom of Abraham; but, 
 Elijah being to carry his body with him, this heavenly guard was 
 visible, not in a human shape, as usual, though they might so have 
 borne him up in their arms, or carried him as on eagles' wings, but 
 that would have been to carry him like a child, like a lamp 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11,31">Isa. xl. 11, 31</A>);

 they appear in the form of a chariot and horses, that he may ride in
 state, may ride in triumph, like a prince, like a conqueror, yea, 
 <I>more than a conqueror.</I> The angels are called in scripture 
 <I>cherubim</I> and <I>seraphim,</I> and their appearance here, though 
 it may seem below their dignity, answers to both those names; for

 (1.) <I>Seraphim</I> signifies <I>fiery,</I> and God is said to make 
 them <I>a flame of fire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:4">Ps. civ. 4</A>.

 (2.) <I>Cherubim</I> (as many think) signifies <I>chariots,</I> and
 they are called <I>the chariots of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:17">Ps. lxviii. 17</A>),

 and he is said to <I>ride upon a cherub</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:10">Ps. xviii. 10</A>),

 to which perhaps there is an allusion in Ezekiel's vision of four
 living creatures, and wheels, like horses and chariots; in Zechariah's 
 vision, they are so represented,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:8,6:1,Re+6:2">Zech. i. 8; vi. 1.
 Compare Rev. vi. 2</A>,

 &c. See the readiness of the angels to do the
 will go God, even in the meanest services, for the good of those that 
 shall be heirs of salvation. Elijah must remove to the world of angels, 
 and therefore, to show how desirous they were of his company, some of 
 them would come to fetch him. The chariot and horses appeared like 
 fire, not for burning, but brightness, not to torture or consume him, 
 but to render his ascension conspicuous and illustrious in the eyes of 
 those that stood afar off to view it. Elijah had burned with holy zeal 
 for God and his honour, and now with a heavenly fire he was refined and 
 translated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How he was separated from Elisha. This chariot parted them both 
 asunder. Note, The dearest friends must part. Elisha had protested he 
 would not leave him, yet now is left behind by him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Whither he was carried. He <I>went up by a whirlwind into 
 heaven.</I> The fire tends upward; the whirlwind helped to carry him 
 through the atmosphere, out of the reach of the magnetic virtue of this 
 earth, and then how swiftly he ascended through the pure ether to the 
 world of holy and blessed spirits we cannot conceive.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Elijah had once, in a passion, wished he might die; yet God was so 
 gracious to him as not only not to take him at his word then, but to 
 honour him with this singular privilege, that he should never see 
 death; and by this instance, and that of Enoch, 

 (1.) God showed how men should have left the world if they had not 
 sinned, not by death, but by a translation. 

 (2.) He gave a glimpse of that life and immortality which are brought 
 to light by the gospel, of the glory reserved for the bodies of the 
 saints, and the <I>opening of the kingdom of heaven to all 
 believers,</I> as then to Elijah. It was also a figure of Christ's 
 ascension.</P>

 III. Elisha pathetically laments the loss of that great prophet, but 
 attends him with an encomium, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 1. He saw it; thus he received the sign by which he was assured of the 
 grant of his request for a double portion of Elijah's spirit. He looked 
 stedfastly towards heaven, whence he was to expect that gift, as the 
 disciples did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:10">Acts i. 10</A>.

 He saw it awhile, but the vision was presently out of his sight; and
 <I>he saw him no more.</I>

 2. He rent his own clothes, in token of the sense he had of his own and
 the public loss. Though Elijah had gone triumphantly to heaven, yet 
 this world could ill spare him, and therefore his removal ought to be 
 much regretted by the survivors. Surely their hearts are hard whose 
 eyes are dry when God, by taking away faithful useful men, calls for 
 weeping and mourning. Though Elijah's departure made way for Elisha's 
 eminency, especially since he was now sure of a double portion of his 
 spirit, yet he lamented the loss of him, for he loved him, and could 
 have served him for ever. 

 3. He gave him a very honourable character, as the reason why he thus
 lamented the loss of him. 

 (1.) He himself had lost the guide of his youth: <I>My father, my 
 father.</I> He saw his own condition like that of a fatherless child 
 thrown upon the world, and lamented it accordingly. Christ, when he 
 left his disciples, did not leave them orphans

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:15">John xiv. 15</A>),

 but Elijah must. 

 (2.) The public had lost its best guard; he was <I>the chariot of 
 Israel, and the horsemen thereof.</I> He would have brought them all to 
 heaven, as in this chariot, if it had not been their own fault; they 
 used not chariots and horses in their wars, but Elijah was to them, by 
 his counsels, reproofs, and prayers, better than the strongest force of 
 chariot and horse, and kept off the judgments of God. His departure was 
 like the routing of an army, an irreparable loss. "Better have lost all 
 our men of war than this man of God."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and
 went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;
 &nbsp; 14 And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and
 smote the waters, and said, Where <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Elijah?
 and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and
 thither: and Elisha went over.
 &nbsp; 15 And when the sons of the prophets which <I>were</I> to view at
 Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on
 Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the
 ground before him.
 &nbsp; 16 And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy
 servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek
 thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath taken
 him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And
 he said, Ye shall not send.
 &nbsp; 17 And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send.
 They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but
 found him not.
 &nbsp; 18 And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at
 Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of what followed immediately after the 
 translation of Elijah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The tokens of God's presence with Elisha, and the marks of his 
 elevation into Elijah's room, to be, as he had been, a father to the 
 sons of the prophets, and the chariots and horsemen of Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was possessed of Elijah's mantle, the badge of his office, which, 
 we may suppose, he put on and wore for his master's sake, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 When Elijah went to heaven, though he did not let fall his body as
 others do, he let fall his mantle instead of it; for he was unclothed, 
 that he might be clothed upon with immortality: he was going to a world 
 where he needed not the mantle to adorn him, nor to shelter him from 
 the weather, nor to wrap his face in, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:13">1 Kings xix. 13</A>.

 He left his mantle as a legacy to Elisha, and, though in itself it was
 of small value, yet as it was a token of the descent of the Spirit upon 
 him, it was more than if he had bequeathed to him thousands of gold and 
 silver. Elisha took it up, not as a sacred relic to be worshipped, but 
 as a significant garment to be worn, and a recompence to him for his 
 own garments which he had rent. he loved this cloak ever since it was 
 first cast over him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:19">1 Kings xix. 19</A>.

 He that then so cheerfully obeyed the summons of it, and became
 Elijah's servant, is now dignified with it, and becomes his successor. 
 There are remains of great and good men, which, like this mantle, ought 
 to be gathered up and preserved by the survivors, their sayings, their 
 writings, their examples, that, as their works follow them in the 
 reward of them, they may stay behind in the benefit of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was possessed of Elijah's power to divide Jordan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Having parted with his father, he returns to his sons in the schools of
 the prophets. Jordan was between him and them; it had been divided to 
 make way for Elijah to his glory; he will try whether it will divide to 
 make way for him to his business, and by that he will know that God is 
 with him, and that he has the double portion of Elijah's spirit. 
 Elijah's last miracle shall be Elisha's first; thus he begins where 
 Elijah left off and there is no vacancy. In dividing the waters,

 (1.) He made use of Elijah's mantle, as Elijah himself had done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 to signify that he designed to keep to his master's methods and would
 not introduce any thing new, as those affect to do that think 
 themselves wiser than their predecessors. 

 (2.) He applied to Elijah's God: <I>Where is the Lord God of 
 Elijah?</I> He does not ask, "Where is Elijah?" as poring upon the loss 
 of him, as if he could not be easy now that he was gone,--or as 
 doubting of his happy state, as if, like the sons of the prophets here, 
 he knew not what had become of him,--or as curiously enquiring 
 concerning him, and the particular of that state he was removed to (no, 
 that is a hidden life, it does not yet appear what we shall be),--nor 
 as expecting help from him; no, Elijah is happy, but is neither 
 omniscient nor omnipotent; but he asks, <I>Where is the Lord God of 
 Elijah?</I> Now that Elijah was taken to heaven God had abundantly 
 proved himself the God of Elijah; if he had not prepared for him that 
 city, and done better for him there than ever he did for him in this 
 world, he <I>would have been ashamed to be called his God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:16">Heb. xi. 16</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:31,32">Matt. xxvii. 31, 32</A>.

 Now that Elijah was taken to heaven Elisha enquired, 

 [1.] After God.  When our creature-comforts are removed, we have a God 
 to go to, that lives for ever. 

 [2.] After <I>The God of Elijah,</I> the God that Elijah served, and 
 honoured, and pleaded for, and adhered to when all Israel had deserted 
 him. This honour is done to those who cleave to God in times of general 
 apostasy, that God will be, in a peculiar manner, their God. "The God 
 that owned, and protected, and provided for Elijah, and many ways 
 honoured him, especially now at last, where is he? Lord, am not I 
 promised Elijah's spirit? Make good that promise." The words which next 
 follow in the original, <I>Aph-his--even he,</I> which we join to the 
 following clause, <I>when he also had smitten the waters,</I> some make 
 an answer to this question, <I>Where is Elijah's God? Etiam ille adhuc 
 superest--"He is in being still,</I> and nigh at hand. We have lost 
 Elijah, but we have not lost Elijah's God. He <I>has not forsaken the 
 earth;</I> it is even he that is still with me." Note, <I>First,</I> It 
 is the duty and interest of the saints on earth to enquire after God, 
 and apply to him as the Lord God of the saints that have gone before to 
 heaven, <I>the God of our fathers. Secondly,</I> It is very comfortable 
 to those who enquire of him; it is <I>even he</I> that <I>is in his 
 holy temple</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:4">Ps. xi. 4</A>)

 and <I>nigh to all who call upon him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:18">Ps. cxlv. 18</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> Those that walk in the spirit and steps of their godly
 faithful predecessors shall certainly experience the same grace that 
 they experienced; Elijah's God will be Elisha's too. The Lord God of 
 the holy prophets is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever; and what 
 will it avail us to have the mantles of those that are gone, their 
 places, their books, if we have not their spirit, their God?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He was possessed of Elijah's interest in the sons of the prophets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Some of the fellows of the college at Jericho, who had placed
 themselves conveniently near Jordan, to see what passed, were surprised 
 to see Jordan divided before Elisha in his return, and took that as a 
 convincing evidence that <I>the spirit of Elijah did rest upon him,</I> 
 and that therefore they ought to pay the same respect and deference to 
 him that they had paid to Elijah. Accordingly they went to meet him, to 
 congratulate him on his safe passage through fire and water, and the 
 honour God had put upon him; and they <I>bowed themselves to the ground 
 before him.</I> They were trained up in the schools; Elisha was taken 
 from the plough; yet when they perceived that God was with him, and 
 that this was <I>the man whom he delighted to honour,</I> they readily 
 submitted to him as their head and father, as the people to Joshua when 
 Moses was dead,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:17">Josh. i. 17</A>.

 Those that appear to have God's Spirit and presence with them ought to
 have our esteem and best affections, notwithstanding the meanness of 
 their extraction and education. This ready submission of the sons of 
 the prophets, no doubt, was a great encouragement to Elisha, and helped 
 to clear his call.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The needless search which the sons of the prophets made for Elijah. 

 1. They suggested that possibly he was dropped, either alive or dead, 
 upon some mountain, or in some valley; and it would be a satisfaction 
 to them if they sent some strong men, whom they had at command, in 
 quest of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Some of them perhaps started this as a demurrer to the choice of
 Elisha: "Let us first be sure that Elijah has quite gone.  Can we think 
 Elijah thus neglected by heaven, that chosen vessel thus cast away as a 
 vessel in which was no pleasure?"

 2. Elisha consented not to their motion till they overcame him with
 importunity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 They urged him till he was ashamed to oppose it any further lest he
 should be thought wanting in his respect to his old master or loth to 
 resign the mantle again. Wise men may yield to that, for the sake of 
 peace and the good opinion of others, which yet their judgment is 
 against as needless and fruitless.

 3. The issue made them as much ashamed of their proposal as they, by
 their importunity, had made Elisha ashamed of his opposing it. Their 
 messengers, after they had tired themselves with fruitless search, 
 returned with a <I>non est inventus--he is not to be found,</I> and 
 gave Elisha an opportunity of upbraiding his friends with their folly: 
 <I>Did I not say unto you, Go not?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 This would make them the more willing to acquiesce in his judgment
 another time. Traversing hills and valleys will never bring us to 
 Elijah, but the imitation of his holy faith and zeal will, in due 
 time.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19 And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray
 thee, the situation of this city <I>is</I> pleasant, as my lord seeth:
 but the water <I>is</I> naught, and the ground barren.
 &nbsp; 20 And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And
 they brought <I>it</I> to him.
 &nbsp; 21 And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast
 the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I have healed
 these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or
 barren <I>land.</I>
 &nbsp; 22 So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the
 saying of Elisha which he spake.
 &nbsp; 23 And he went up from thence unto Beth-el: and as he was going
 up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city,
 and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up,
 thou bald head.
 &nbsp; 24 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in
 the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. And there came forth two she bears out of
 the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.
 &nbsp; 25 And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Elisha had, in this respect, a double portion of Elijah's spirit, that 
 he wrought more miracles than Elijah. Some reckon them in number just 
 double. Two are recorded in these verses--a miracle of mercy to Jericho
 and a miracle of judgment to Bethel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:1">Ps. ci. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a blessing upon the waters of Jericho, which was effectual 
 to heal them. Jericho was built in disobedience to a command, in 
 defiance to a threatening, and at the expense of the lives of all the 
 builder's children; yet, when it was built, it was not ordered to be 
 demolished again, nor were God's prophets or people forbidden to dwell 
 in it, but even within those walls that were built by iniquity we find 
 a nursery of piety. Fools, they say, build houses for wise men to dwell 
 in. Here the wealth of the sinner provided a habitation for the just. 
 We find Christ at Jericho, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:1">Luke xix. 1</A>.

 Hither Elisha came, to confirm the souls of the disciples with a more
 particular account of Elijah's translation than their spies, who saw at 
 a distance, could give them. Here he staid while the fifty men were
 searching for him. And, 

 1. The men of Jericho represented to him their grievance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 God's faithful prophets love to be employed; it is wisdom to make use
 of them during the little while that their light is with us. They had 
 not applied to Elijah concerning the matter, perhaps because he was not 
 so easy of access as Elisha was; but now, we may hope, by the influence 
 of the divinity-school in their city, they were reformed. The situation 
 was pleasant and afforded a good prospect; but they had neither 
 wholesome water to drink nor fruitful soil to yield them food, and what 
 pleasure could they take in their prospect? Water is a common mercy, 
 which we should estimate by the greatness of the calamity which the 
 want or unwholesomeness of it would be. Some think that it was not all 
 the ground about Jericho that was barren and had bad water, but some 
 one part only, and <I>that</I> where the sons of the prophets had their 
 lodgings, who are here called <I>the men of the city.</I>

 2. He soon redressed their grievance. Prophets should endeavour to make
 every place they come to, some way or other, the better for them, 
 endeavouring to sweeten bitter spirits, and to make barren souls 
 fruitful, by the due application of the word of God.  Elisha will heal 
 their waters; but, 

 (1.) They must furnish him with salt in a new cruse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 If salt had been proper to season the water, yet what could so small a
 quantity do towards it and what the better for being in a new cruse? 
 But thus those that would be helped must be employed and have their 
 faith and obedience tried. God's works of grace are wrought, not by any 
 operations of ours, but in observance of his institutions.

 (2.) He cast the salt <I>into the spring of the waters,</I> and so 
 healed the streams and the ground they watered. Thus the way to reform 
 men's lives is to renew their hearts; let those be seasoned with the 
 salt of grace; for <I>out of them are the issues of life. Make the tree 
 good and the fruit will be good.</I> Purify the heart and that will 
 cleanse the hands. 

 (3.) He did not pretend to do this by his own power, but in God's name: 
 <I>Thus saith the Lord, I have healed these waters.</I> He is but the 
 instrument, the channel through which God is pleased to convey this 
 healing virtue. By doing them this kindness with a <I>Thus saith the 
 Lord,</I> they would be made the more willing hereafter, to receive 
 from him a reproof, admonition, or command, with the same preface. If, 
 in God's name, he can help them, in God's name let him teach and rule 
 them. <I>Thus saith the Lord,</I> out of Elisha's mouth, must, ever 
 after, be of mighty force with them. 

 (4.) The cure was lasting, and not for the present only: <I>The waters
 were healed unto this day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:22"><I>v.</I>  22</A>.

 What God does <I>shall be for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:14">Eccl. iii. 14</A>.

 When he, by his Spirit, <I>heals a soul,</I> there shall be <I>no more
 death nor barrenness;</I> the property is altered: what was useless and 
 offensive becomes grateful and serviceable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a curse upon the children of Bethel, which was effectual to 
 destroy them; for it was not a curse causeless. At Bethel there was 
 another school of prophets. Thither Elisha went next, in this his 
 primary visitation, and the scholars there no doubt welcomed him with 
 all possible respect, but the townsmen were abusive to him. One of 
 Jeroboam's calves was at Bethel; this they were proud of, and fond of, 
 and hated those that reproved them. The law did not empower them to 
 suppress this pious academy, but we may suppose it was their usual 
 practice to jeer the prophets as they went along the streets, to call 
 them by some nickname or other, that they might expose them to 
 contempt, prejudice their youth against them, and, if possible, drive 
 them out of their town. Had the abuse done to Elisha been the first 
 offence of that kind, it is probable that it would not have been so 
 severely punished. But <I>mocking the messengers of the Lord,</I> and 
 <I>misusing the prophets,</I> was one of the <I>crying sins of 
 Israel,</I> as we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:16">2 Chron. xxxvi. 16</A>.

 Now here we have, 

 1. An instance of that sin. The little <I>children of Bethel,</I> the 
 boys and girls that were playing in the streets (notice, it is likely, 
 having come to the town of his approach), went out to meet him, not 
 with their hosannas, as they ought to have done, but with their scoffs; 
 they gathered about him and mocked him, as if he had been a fool, or 
 one fit to make sport with. Among other things that they used to jeer 
 the prophets with, they had this particular taunt for him, <I>Go up, 
 thou bald head, go up, thou bald head.</I> It is a wicked thing to 
 reproach persons for their natural infirmities or deformities; it is 
 adding affliction to the afflicted; and, if they are as God made them, 
 the reproach reflects upon him. But this was such a thing as scarcely 
 deserved to be called a blemish, and would never have been turned to 
 his reproach if they had had any thing else to reproach him with. It 
 was his character as a prophet that they designed to abuse. The honour 
 God had crowned him with should have been sufficient to cover his bald 
 head and protect him from their scoffs. They bade him <I>go up,</I> 
 perhaps reflecting on the assumption of Elijah: "Thy master," they say, 
 "has gone up; why dost not thou go up after him?  Where is the fiery 
 chariot? When shall we be rid of thee too?" These children said as they 
 were taught; they had learned of their idolatrous parents to call foul 
 names and give bad language, especially to prophets. These young cocks, 
 as we say, crowed after the old ones.  Perhaps their parents did at 
 this time send them out and set them on, that, if possible, they might 
 keep the prophet out of their town. 

 2. A specimen of that ruin which came down upon Israel at last, for
 misusing God's prophets, and of which this was intended to give them 
 fair warning. Elisha heard their taunts, a good while, with patience; 
 but at length the fire of holy zeal for God was kindled in his breast 
 by the continued provocation, and he <I>turned and looked upon 
 them,</I> to try if a grave and severe look would put them out of 
 countenance and oblige them to retire, to see if he could discern in 
 their faces any marks of ingenuousness; but they <I>were not ashamed, 
 neither could they blush;</I> and therefore he <I>cursed them in the 
 name of the Lord,</I> both imprecated and denounced the following 
 judgment, not in personal revenge for the indignity done to himself, 
 but as the mouth of divine justice to punish the dishonour done to God. 
 His summons was immediately obeyed. Two she-bears (bears perhaps robbed
 of their whelps) came out of an adjacent wood, and presently killed 
 forty-two children, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 Now in this,

 (1.) The prophet must be justified, for he did it by divine impulse. 
 Had the curse come from any bad principle God would not have said 
 <I>Amen</I> to it. We may think it would have been better to have 
 called for two rods for the correction of these children than two bears 
 for the destruction of them. But Elisha knew, by the Spirit, the bad 
 character of these children. He knew what a generation of vipers those 
 were, and what mischievous enemies they would be to God's prophets if 
 they should live to be men, who began so early to be abusive to them.  
 He intended hereby to punish the parents and to make them afraid of 
 God's judgments. 

 (2.) God must be glorified as a righteous God, that hates sin, and will 
 reckon for it, even in little children. Let the wicked wretched brood 
 make our flesh tremble for fear of God. Let little children be afraid 
 of speaking wicked words, for God notices what they say. Let them not
 mock any for their defects in mind or body, but pity them rather; 
 especially let them know that it is at their peril if they jeer God's 
 people or ministers, and scoff at any for well-doing. Let parents, that 
 would have comfort in their children, train them up well, and do their 
 utmost betimes to drive out the foolishness that is bound up in their 
 hearts; for, as bishop Hall says, "In vain do we look for good from 
 those children whose education we have neglected; and in vain do we 
 grieve for those miscarriages which our care might have prevented." 
 Elisha comes to Bethel and fears not the revenges of the bereaved 
 parents; God, who bade him do what he did, he knew would bear him out. 
 Thence he goes to Mount Carmel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+2:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 where it is probable there was a religious house fit for retirement and
 contemplation.  Thence he returned to Samaria, where, being a public 
 place, this father of the prophets might be most serviceable. Bishop 
 Hall observes here, "That he can never be a profitable seer who is 
 either always or never alone."</P>
