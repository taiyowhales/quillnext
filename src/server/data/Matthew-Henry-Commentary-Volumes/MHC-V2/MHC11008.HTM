 The building and furniture of the temple were very glorious, but the
 dedication of it exceeds in glory as much as prayer and praise, the 
 work of saints, exceed the casting of metal and the graving of stones, 
 the work of the craftsman. The temple was designed for the keeping up 
 of the correspondence between God and his people; and here we have an 
 account of the solemnity of their first meeting there. 

 I. The representatives of all Israel were called together

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 to keep a feast to the honour of God, for fourteen days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:65">ver. 65</A>.

 II. The priests brought the ark into the most holy place, and fixed it
 there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:3-9">ver. 3-9</A>.

 III. God took possession of it by a cloud, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 IV. Solomon, with thankful acknowledgments to God, informed the people
 touching the occasion of their meeting, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:12-21">ver. 12-21</A>.

 V. In a long prayer he recommended to God's gracious acceptance all the
 prayers that should be made in or towards this place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:22-53">ver. 22-53</A>.

 VI. He dismissed the assembly with a blessing and an exhortation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:54-61">ver. 54-61</A>.

 VII. He offered abundance of sacrifices, on which he and his people
 feasted, and so parted, with great satisfaction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:62-66">ver. 62-66</A>.

 These were Israel's golden days, days of the Son of man in type.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the
 heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
 Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up
 the ark of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> out of the city of David,
 which <I>is</I> Zion.
 &nbsp; 2 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king
 Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which <I>is</I> the seventh
 month.
 &nbsp; 3 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up
 the ark.
 &nbsp; 4 And they brought up the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the tabernacle
 of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that <I>were</I> in the
 tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.
 &nbsp; 5 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that
 were assembled unto him, <I>were</I> with him before the ark,
 sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered
 for multitude.
 &nbsp; 6 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most
 holy <I>place, even</I> under the wings of the cherubims.
 &nbsp; 7 For the cherubims spread forth <I>their</I> two wings over the
 place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the
 staves thereof above.
 &nbsp; 8 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves
 were seen out in the holy <I>place</I> before the oracle, and they
 were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.
 &nbsp; 9 <I>There was</I> nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone,
 which Moses put there at Horeb, when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> made <I>a covenant</I>
 with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of
 Egypt.
 &nbsp; 10 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
 holy <I>place,</I> that the cloud filled the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 &nbsp; 11 So that the priests could not stand to minister because of
 the cloud: for the glory of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had filled the house of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The temple, though richly beautified, yet while it was without the ark 
 was like a body without a soul, or a candlestick without a candle, or 
 (to speak more properly) a house without an inhabitant. All the cost 
 and pains bestowed on this stately structure are lost if God do not 
 accept them; and, unless he please to own it as the place where he will 
 record his name, it is after all but a ruinous heap. When therefore 
 <I>all the work</I> is ended 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+7:51"><I>ch.</I> vii. 51</A>),

 the <I>one thing needful</I> is yet behind, and that is the bringing in
 of the ark. This therefore is the end which must crown the work, and 
 which here we have an account of the doing of with great solemnity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Solomon presides in this service, as David did in the bringing up of 
 the ark to Jerusalem; and neither of them thought it below him to 
 follow the ark nor to lead the people in their attendance on it. 
 Solomon glories in the title of the <I>preacher</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:1">Eccl. i. 1</A>),

 and the <I>master of assemblies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:11">Eccl. xii. 11</A>.

 This great assembly he summons

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and he is the centre of it, for to him they all assembled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 <I>at the feast in the seventh month,</I> namely, the feast of
 tabernacles, which was appointed on the fifteenth day of that month, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:34">Lev. xxiii. 34</A>.

 David, like a very <I>good</I> man, brings the ark to a
 <I>convenient</I> place, near him; Solomon, like a very <I>great</I> 
 man, brings it to a <I>magnificent</I> place. As every man has received 
 the gift, so let him minister; and let children proceed in God's 
 service where their parents left off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. All Israel attend the service, their judges and the chief of their 
 tribes and families, all their officers, civil and military, and (as 
 they speak in the north) the heads of their clans. A convention of 
 these might well be called <I>an assembly of all Israel.</I> These came 
 together, on this occasion, 

 1. To do honour to Solomon, and to return him the thanks of the nation
 for all the good offices he had done in kindness to them. 

 2. To do honour to the ark, to pay respect to it, and testify their
 universal joy and satisfaction in its settlement. The advancement of 
 the ark in external splendour, though it has often proved too strong a 
 temptation to its hypocritical followers, yet, because it may prove an 
 advantage to its true interests, is to be rejoiced in (with trembling) 
 by all that wish well to it. Public mercies call for public 
 acknowledgments.  Those that appeared before the Lord did not appear 
 empty, for they all sacrificed sheep and oxen innumerable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The people in Solomon's time were very rich, very easy, and very
 cheerful, and therefore it was fit that, on this occasion, they should 
 consecrate not only their cheerfulness, but a part of their wealth, to 
 God and his honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The priests do their part of the service. In the wilderness, the 
 Levites were to carry the ark, because then there were not priests 
 enough to do it; but here (it being the last time that the ark was to 
 be carried) the priests themselves did it, as they were ordered to do 
 when it surrounded Jericho. We are here told, 

 1. What was in the ark, nothing but the two tables of stone

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 a treasure far exceeding all the dedicated things both of David and
 Solomon. The pot of manna and Aaron's rod were <I>by</I> the ark, but 
 not <I>in</I> it. 

 2. What was brought up with the ark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The tabernacle of the congregation.</I> It is probable that both
 that which Moses set up in the wilderness, which was in Gibeon, and 
 that which David pitched in Zion, were brought to the temple, to which 
 they did, as it were, surrender all their holiness, merging it in that 
 of the temple, which must henceforward be the place where God must be 
 sought unto. Thus will all the church's holy things on earth, that are 
 so much its joy and glory, be swallowed up in the perfection of 
 holiness above. 

 3. Where it was fixed in its place, the place appointed for its rest
 after all its wanderings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>In the oracle of the house,</I> whence they expected God to speak to
 them, even in the most holy place, which was made so by the presence of 
 the ark, <I>under the wings of the</I> great <I>cherubim</I> which 
 Solomon set up

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:27"><I>ch.</I> vi. 27</A>),

 signifying the special protection of angels, under which God's
 ordinances and the assemblies of his people are taken. The staves of 
 the ark were drawn out, so as to be seen from under the wings of the 
 cherubim, to direct the high priest to the mercy-seat, over the ark, 
 when he went in, once a year, to sprinkle the blood there; so that 
 still they continued of some use, though there was no longer occasion 
 for them to carry it by.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. God graciously owns what is done and testifies his acceptance of
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 The priests might come into the most holy place till God manifested his
 glory there; but, thenceforward, none might, at their peril, approach 
 the ark, except the high priest, on the day of atonement. Therefore it 
 was not till the priests had come out of the oracle that the 
 <I>Shechinah</I> took possession of it, in a cloud, which filled not 
 only the most holy place, but the temple, so that the priests who burnt 
 incense at the golden altar could not bear it. By this visible 
 emanation of the divine glory,

 1. God put an honour upon the ark, and owned it as a token of his
 presence. The glory of it had been long diminished and eclipsed by its 
 frequent removes, the meanness of its lodging, and its being exposed 
 too much to common view; but God will now show that it is as dear to 
 him as ever, and he will have it looked upon with as much veneration as 
 it was when Moses first brought it into his tabernacle. 

 2. He testified his acceptance of the building and furnishing of the
 temple as good service done to his name and his kingdom among men. 

 3.  He struck an awe upon this great assembly; and, by what they saw,
 confirmed their belief of what they read in the books of Moses 
 concerning the glory of God's appearance to their fathers, that hereby 
 they might be kept close to the service of the God of Israel and 
 fortified against temptations to idolatry. 

 4. He showed himself ready to hear the prayer Solomon was now about to
 make; and not only so, but took up his residence in this house, that 
 all his praying people might there be encouraged to make their 
 applications to him. But the glory of God appeared in a cloud, a dark 
 cloud, to signify,

 (1.) The darkness of that dispensation in comparison with the light of 
 the gospel, by which, <I>with open face, we behold, as in a glass, the 
 glory of the Lord.</I> 

 (2.) The darkness of our present state in comparison with the vision of 
 God, which will be the happiness of heaven, where the divine glory is 
 unveiled. Now we can only say what he is not, but then we shall see him 
 as he is.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 Then spake Solomon, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said that he would dwell in the
 thick darkness.
 &nbsp; 13 I have surely built thee a house to dwell in, a settled
 place for thee to abide in for ever.
 &nbsp; 14 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the
 congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel
 stood;)
 &nbsp; 15 And he said, Blessed <I>be</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, which
 spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand
 fulfilled <I>it,</I> saying,
 &nbsp; 16 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of
 Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build
 a house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be
 over my people Israel.
 &nbsp; 17 And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house
 for the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel.
 &nbsp; 18 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto David my father, Whereas it was in
 thine heart to build a house unto my name, thou didst well that
 it was in thine heart.
 &nbsp; 19 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son
 that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house
 unto my name.
 &nbsp; 20 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath performed his word that he spake, and I am
 risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of
 Israel, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> promised, and have built a house for the
 name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel.
 &nbsp; 21 And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein <I>is</I> the
 covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which he made with our fathers, when he
 brought them out of the land of Egypt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Solomon encourages the priests, who came out of the temple from 
 their ministration, much astonished at the dark cloud that overshadowed 
 them. The disciples of Christ <I>feared when they entered into the 
 cloud,</I> though it was a <I>bright cloud</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:34">Luke ix. 34</A>),

 so did the priests when they found themselves wrapped in a thick cloud.
 To silence their fears, 

 1. He reminds them of that which they could not but know, that this was
 a token of God's presence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>The Lord said he would dwell in the thick darkness.</I> It is so far
 from being a token of his displeasure that it is an indication of his 
 favour; for he had said, <I>I will appear in a cloud,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:2">Lev. xvi. 2</A>.

 Note, Nothing is more effectual to reconcile us to dark dispensations
 than to consider what God hath said, and to compare his word and works 
 together; as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:3">Lev. x. 3</A>,

 <I>This is that which the Lord hath said.</I> God is light

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:5">1 John i. 5</A>),

 and he dwells in light 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:16">1 Tim. vi. 16</A>),

 but he dwells with men <I>in the thick darkness,</I> makes that his
 pavilion, because they could not bear the dazzling brightness of his 
 glory. <I>Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself.</I> Thus our holy 
 faith is exercised and our holy fear is increased. Where God dwells in 
 light faith is swallowed up in vision and fear in love. 

 2. He himself bids it welcome, as worthy of all acceptation; and since
 God, by this cloud, came down to take possession, he does, in a few 
 words, solemnly give him possession

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>Surely I come,</I>" says God. "<I>Amen," </I> says Solomon,
 "<I>Even so, come, Lord,.</I> The house is thy own, entirely thy own, 
 <I>I have surely built it for thee,</I> and furnished it for thee; it 
 is for ever thy own, <I>a settled place for thee to abide in for 
 ever;</I> it shall never be alienated nor converted to any other use; 
 the ark shall never be removed from it, never unsettled again." It is 
 Solomon's joy that God has taken possession; and it is his desire that 
 he would keep possession. Let not the priests therefore dread that in 
 which Solomon so much triumphs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He instructs the people, and gives them a plain account concerning 
 this house, which they now saw God take possession of. He spoke briefly 
 to the priests, to satisfy them (a word to the wise), but <I>turned his 
 face about</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 from them <I>to the congregation</I> that stood in the outer court, and
 addressed himself to them largely.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He blessed them. When they saw the dark cloud enter the temple they 
 blessed themselves, being astonished at it and afraid lest the thick 
 darkness should be utter darkness to them. The amazing sight, such as 
 they had never seen in their days, we may suppose, drove every man to 
 his prayers, and the vainest minds were made serious by it. Solomon 
 therefore set in with their prayers, and blessed them all, as one 
 having authority (for <I>the less is blessed of the better</I>); in
 God's name, he spoke peace to them, and a blessing, like that with 
 which the angel blessed Gideon when he was in a fright, upon a similar 
 occasion. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:22,23">Judg. vi. 22, 23</A>,

 <I>Peace be unto thee. Fear not; thou shalt not die.</I> Solomon
 <I>blessed them,</I> that is, he pacified them, and freed them from the 
 consternation they were in. To receive this blessing, they all stood 
 up, in token of reverence and readiness to hear and accept it. It is a 
 proper posture to be in when the blessing is pronounced.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He informed them concerning this house which he had built and was 
 now dedicating.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He began his account with a thankful acknowledgment of the good 
 hand of his God upon him hitherto: <I>Blessed be the Lord God of 
 Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 What we have the pleasure of God must have the praise of. He thus
 engaged the congregation to lift up their hearts in thanksgivings to 
 God, which would help to still the tumult of spirit which, probably, 
 they were in. "Come," says he, "let God's awful appearances not drive 
 us from him, but draw us to him; <I>let us bless the Lord God of 
 Israel.</I>" Thus Job, under a dark scene, <I>blessed the name of the 
 Lord.</I> Solomon here blessed God,

 [1.] For his promise which he <I>spoke with his mouth to David.</I> 

 [2.] For the performance, that he had now <I>fulfilled it with his
 hand.</I> We have then the best sense of God's mercies, and most 
 grateful both to ourselves and to our God, when we run up those streams 
 to the fountain of the covenant, and compare what God does with what he 
 has said.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Solomon is now making a solemn surrender or dedication of this 
 house unto God, delivering it to God by his own act and deed. Grants 
 and conveyances commonly begin with recitals of what has been before 
 done, leading to what is now done: accordingly, here is a recital of 
 the special causes and considerations moving Solomon to build this 
 house. 

 [1.] He recites the want of such a place. It was necessary that this 
 should be premised; for, according to the dispensation they were under, 
 there must be but one place in which they must expect God to record his 
 name. If, therefore, there were any other chosen, this would be a 
 usurpation. But he shows, from what God himself had said, that there 
 was no other 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>I chose no city to build a house in for my name;</I> therefore there
 is occasion for the building of this.

 [2.] He recites David's purpose to build such a place. God chose the 
 person first that should rule his people (<I>I chose David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)
 
 and then put it into <I>his heart to build a house</I> for God's name,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:17"><I>v.</I>  17</A>.
 
 It was not a project of his own, for the magnifying of himself;
 but his good father, of blessed memory, laid the first design of it, 
 though he lived not to lay the first stone. 

 [3.] He recites God's promise concerning himself. God approved his 
 father's purpose 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Thou didst well, that it was in thy heart.</I> Note, Sincere
 intentions to do good shall be graciously approved and accepted of God, 
 though Providence prevent our putting them in execution. <I>The desire 
 of a man is his kindness.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:12">2 Cor. viii. 12</A>.

 God accepted David's good will, yet would not permit him to do the good
 work, but reserved the honour of it for his son

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 <I>He shall build the house to my name;</I> so that what he had done
 was not of his own head, nor for his own glory, but the work itself was 
 according to his father's design and his doing it was according to 
 God's designation. 

 [4.] He recites what he himself had done, and with what intention: <I>I 
 have built a house,</I> not for my own name, but <I>for the name of the 
 Lord God of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 and <I>set there a place for the ark,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Thus all the right, title, interest, claim, and demand, whatsoever,
 which he or his had or might have in or to this house, or any of its 
 appurtenances, he resigns, surrenders, and gives up, to God for ever.  
 It is for his name, and his ark. In this, says he, <I>the Lord hath 
 performed his word that he spoke.</I> Note, Whatever good we do, we 
 must look upon it as the performance of God's promise to us, rather 
 than the performance of our promises to him. The more we do for God the 
 more we are indebted to him; for our sufficiency is of him, and not of 
 ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 And Solomon stood before the altar of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the
 presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his
 hands toward heaven:
 &nbsp; 23 And he said, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, <I>there is</I> no God like
 thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant
 and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their
 heart:
 &nbsp; 24 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou
 promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast
 fulfilled <I>it</I> with thine hand, as <I>it is</I> this day.
 &nbsp; 25 Therefore now, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, keep with thy servant
 David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not
 fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so
 that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before
 me as thou hast walked before me.
 &nbsp; 26 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be
 verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.
 &nbsp; 27 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven
 and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this
 house that I have builded?
 &nbsp; 28 Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to
 his supplication, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God, to hearken unto the cry and to
 the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:
 &nbsp; 29 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day,
 <I>even</I> toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be
 there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant
 shall make toward this place.
 &nbsp; 30 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of
 thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and
 hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest,
 forgive.
 &nbsp; 31 If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be
 laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before
 thine altar in this house:
 &nbsp; 32 Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants,
 condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and
 justifying the righteous, to give him according to his
 righteousness.
 &nbsp; 33 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy,
 because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to
 thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto
 thee in this house:
 &nbsp; 34 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people
 Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto
 their fathers.
 &nbsp; 35 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
 have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and
 confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest
 them:
 &nbsp; 36 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy
 servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good
 way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which
 thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
 &nbsp; 37 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,
 blasting, mildew, locust, <I>or</I> if there be caterpillar; if their
 enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever
 plague, whatsoever sickness <I>there be;</I>
 &nbsp; 38 What prayer and supplication soever be <I>made</I> by any man,
 <I>or</I> by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the
 plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this
 house:
 &nbsp; 39 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive,
 and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart
 thou knowest; (for thou, <I>even</I> thou only, knowest the hearts of
 all the children of men;)
 &nbsp; 40 That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the
 land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
 &nbsp; 41 Moreover concerning a stranger, that <I>is</I> not of thy people
 Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;
 &nbsp; 42 (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong
 hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray
 toward this house;
 &nbsp; 43 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to
 all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the
 earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as <I>do</I> thy people Israel;
 and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is
 called by thy name.
 &nbsp; 44 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy,
 whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 toward the city which thou hast chosen, and <I>toward</I> the house
 that I have built for thy name:
 &nbsp; 45 Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their
 supplication, and maintain their cause.
 &nbsp; 46 If they sin against thee, (for <I>there is</I> no man that
 sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to
 the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of
 the enemy, far or near;
 &nbsp; 47 <I>Yet</I> if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither
 they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication
 unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying,
 We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed
 wickedness;
 &nbsp; 48 And <I>so</I> return unto thee with all their heart, and with all
 their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away
 captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest
 unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the
 house which I have built for thy name:
 &nbsp; 49 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven
 thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,
 &nbsp; 50 And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and
 all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against
 thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them
 captive, that they may have compassion on them:
 &nbsp; 51 For they <I>be</I> thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou
 broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of
 iron:
 &nbsp; 52 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy
 servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to
 hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.
 &nbsp; 53 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of
 the earth, <I>to be</I> thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand
 of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of
 Egypt, O Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon having made a general surrender of this house to God, which God 
 had signified his acceptance of by taking possession, next follows 
 Solomon's prayer, in which he makes a more particular declaration of 
 the uses of that surrender, with all humility and reverence, desiring 
 that God would agree thereto. In short, it is his request that this 
 temple may be deemed and taken, not only for a house of sacrifice (no 
 mention is made of that in all this prayer, that was taken for 
 granted), but a <I>house of prayer for all people;</I> and herein it 
 was a type of the gospel church; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:7">Isa. lvi. 7</A>,
 
 compared with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:13">Matt. xxi. 13</A>.

 Therefore Solomon opened this house, not only with an extraordinary
 sacrifice, but with an extraordinary prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The person that prayed this prayer was great. Solomon did not 
 appoint one of the priests to do it, nor one of the prophets, but did 
 it himself, <I>in the presence of all the congregation of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 1. It was well that he was able to do it, a sign that he had made a
 good improvement of the pious education which his parents gave him. 
 With all his learning, it seems, he learnt to pray well, and knew how 
 to express himself to God in a suitable manner, <I>pro re nata--on the 
 spur of the occasion,</I> without a prescribed form. In the crowd of 
 his philosophical transactions, his proverbs, and songs, he did not 
 forget his devotions. He was a gainer by prayer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:11-14"><I>ch.</I> iii. 11</A>,

 &c.), and, we may suppose, gave himself much to it, so that he
 excelled, as we find here, in praying gifts. 

 2. It was well that he was willing to do it, and not shy of performing
 divine service before so great a congregation. He was far from thinking 
 it any disparagement to him to be his own chaplain and the mouth of the 
 assembly to God; and shall any think themselves too great to do this 
 office for their own families? Solomon, in all his other glory, even on 
 his ivory throne, looked not so great as he did now. Great men should 
 thus support the reputation of religious exercises and so honour God 
 with their greatness. Solomon was herein a type of Christ, the great 
 intercessor for all over whom he rules.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The posture in which he prayed was very reverent, and expressive of 
 humility, seriousness, and fervency in prayer. He <I>stood before the 
 altar of the Lord,</I> intimating that he expected the success of his 
 prayer in virtue of that sacrifice which should be offered up in the 
 fulness of time, typified by the sacrifices offered at that altar. But 
 when he addressed himself to prayer, 

 1. He <I>kneeled down,</I> as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>,

 where he is said to <I>rise from his knees;</I> compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+6:13">2 Chron. vi. 13</A>.

 Kneeling is the most proper posture for prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:14">Eph. iii. 14</A>.

 The greatest of men must not think it below them to <I>kneel before the
 Lord their Maker.</I> Mr. Herbert says, "Kneeling never spoiled silk 
 stocking."

 2. <I>He spread forth his hands towards heaven,</I> and (as it should
 seem by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>)

 continued so to the end of the prayer, hereby expressing his desire
 towards, and expectations from, God, as a <I>Father in heaven.</I> He 
 spread forth his hands, as it were to offer up the prayer from an open 
 enlarged heart and to present it to heaven, and also to receive thence, 
 with both arms, the mercy which he prayed for. Such outward expressions 
 of the fixedness and fervour of devotion ought not to be despised or 
 ridiculed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The prayer itself was very long, and perhaps much longer than is 
 here recorded. At the throne of grace we have liberty of speech, and 
 should use our liberty. It is not making long prayers, but making them 
 for a pretence, that Christ condemns. In this excellent prayer Solomon 
 does, as we should in every prayer,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Give glory to God. This he begins with, as the most proper act of 
 adoration. He addresses himself to God as the <I>Lord God of 
 Israel,</I> a God in covenant with them And, 

 (1.) He gives him the praise of what he is, in general, the best of 
 beings in himself ("<I>There is no God like thee,</I> none of the 
 powers in heaven or earth to be compared with thee"), and the best of
 masters to his people: "<I>Who keepest covenant and mercy with thy 
 servants;</I> not only as good as thy word in keeping covenant, but 
 better than thy word in keeping mercy, doing that for them of which 
 thou hast not given them an express promise, provided they <I>walk 
 before thee with all their heart,</I> are zealous for thee, with an eye 
 to thee." 

 (2.) He gives him thanks for what he had done, in particular, for his 
 family 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast kept with thy servant David,</I> as with thy other
 servants, <I>that which thou promisedst him.</I>" The promise was a 
 great favour to him, his support and joy, and now performance is the 
 crown of it: <I>Thou hast fulfilled it, as it is this day.</I> Fresh 
 experiences of the truth of God's promises call for enlarged 
 praises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He sues for grace and favour from God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That God would perform to him and his the mercy which he had 
 promised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 Observe how this comes in. He thankfully acknowledges the performance
 of the promise in part; hitherto God had been faithful to his word: 
 "<I>Thou hast kept with thy servant David that which thou promisedst 
 him,</I> so far that his son fills his throne and has built the 
 intended temple; <I>therefore now keep with thy servant David that 
 which thou hast</I> further <I>promised him,</I> and which yet remains 
 to be fulfilled in its season." Note, The experiences we have had of 
 God's performing his promises should encourage us to depend upon them 
 and plead them with God: and those who expect further mercies must be 
 thankful for former mercies. Hitherto God has helped,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:10">2 Cor. i. 10</A>.

 Solomon repeats the promise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>There shall not fail thee a man to sit on the throne,</I> not
 omitting the condition, <I>so that thy children take heed to their 
 way;</I> for we cannot expect God's performance of the promise but upon 
 our performance of the condition.  And then he humbly begs this entail

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>Now, O God of Israel!  let thy word be verified.</I> God's promises
 (as we have often observed) must be both the guide of our desires and 
 the ground of our hopes and expectations in prayer. David had prayed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:25">2 Sam. vii. 25</A>):

 <I>Lord, do as thou hast said.</I> Note, Children should learn of their
 godly parents how to pray, and plead in prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That God would have respect to this temple which he had now taken 
 possession of, and that his eyes might be <I>continually open towards 
 it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 that he would graciously own it, and so put an honour upon it. To this
 purpose,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He premises, <I>First,</I> A humble admiration of God's gracious 
 condescension 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 "<I>But will God indeed dwell on the earth?</I> Can we imagine that a
 Being infinitely high, and holy, and happy, will stoop so low as to let 
 it be said of him that he <I>dwells upon the earth</I> and blesses the 
 worms of the earth with his presence--the earth, that is corrupt, and 
 overspread with sin--cursed, and reserved to fire? <I>Lord, how is it?" 
 Secondly,</I> A humble acknowledgment of the incapacity of the house he 
 had built, though very capacious, to contain God: "<I>The heaven of 
 heavens cannot contain thee,</I> for no place can include him who is 
 present in all places; even this house is too little, too mean to be 
 the residence of him that is infinite in being and glory." Note, When 
 we have done the most we can for God we must acknowledge the infinite 
 distance and disproportion between us and him, between our services and 
 his perfections.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] This premised, he prays in general, <I>First,</I> That God would 
 graciously hear and answer the prayer he was now praying, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 It was a humble prayer (<I>the prayer of thy servant</I>), an earnest
 prayer (such a prayer as is a <I>cry</I>), a prayer made in faith 
 (<I>before thee,</I> as the Lord, and my God): "Lord, <I>hearken to it, 
 have respect to it,</I> not as the prayer of Israel's king (no man's 
 dignity in the world, or titles of honour, will recommend him to God), 
 but as the prayer of thy servant." <I>Secondly,</I> That God would in 
 like manner hear and answer all the prayers that should, at any time 
 hereafter, be made in or towards this house which he had now built, and 
 of which God had said, <I>My name shall be there</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 his own prayers (<I>Hearken to the prayers which thy servant shall
 make</I>), and the prayers of all Israel, and of every particular
 Israelite

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 "<I>Hear it in heaven, that</I> is indeed <I>thy dwelling-place,</I> of
 which this is but a figure; and, <I>when thou hearest, forgive</I> the 
 sin that separates between them and God, even the <I>iniquity of their 
 holy things.</I>" <I>a.</I> He supposes that God's people will ever be 
 a prayer people; he resolves to adhere to that duty himself. <I>b.</I> 
 He directs them to have an eye, in their prayers, to that place where 
 God was pleased to manifest his glory as he did not any where else on 
 earth. None but priests might come into that place; but, when they 
 worshipped in the courts of the temple, it must be with an eye towards 
 it, not as the object of their worship (that were idolatry), but as an 
 instituted medium of their worship, helping the weakness of their 
 faith, and typifying the mediation of Jesus Christ, who is the true 
 temple, to whom we must have an eye in every thing wherein we have to 
 do with God. Those that were at a distance looked towards Jerusalem, 
 for the sake of the temple, even when it was in ruins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:10">Dan. vi. 10</A>.
 
 <I>c.</I> He begs that God will <I>hear the prayers,</I> and <I>forgive
 the sins,</I> of all that look this way in their prayers. Not as if he 
 thought all the devout prayers offered up to God by those who had no 
 knowledge of this house, or regard to it, were therefore rejected; but 
 he desired that the sensible tokens of the divine presence with which 
 this house was blessed might always give sensible encouragement and 
 comfort to believing petitioners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] More particularly, he here puts divers cases in which he supposed 
 application would be made to God by prayer in or towards this house of 
 prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> If God were appealed to by an oath for the determining of 
 any controverted right between man and man, and the oath were taken 
 before this altar, he prayed that God would, in some way or other, 
 discover the truth, and judge between the contending parties, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.

 He prayed that, in difficult matters, this throne of grace might be a
 throne of judgment, from which God would right the injured that 
 believingly appealed to it, and punish the injurious that 
 presumptuously appealed to it. It was usual to swear by the temple and 
 altar

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:16,18">Matt. xxiii. 16, 18</A>),

 which corruption perhaps took its rise from this supposition of an oath
 taken, not <I>by</I> the temple or altar, but <I>at</I> or <I>near</I> 
 them, for the greater solemnity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> If the people of Israel were groaning under any 
 national calamity, or any particular Israelite under any personal 
 calamity, he desired that the prayers they should make in or towards 
 this house might be heard and answered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>a.</I> In case of public judgments, war 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),
 
 want of rain
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),
 
 famine, or pestilence
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 and he ends with an <I>et cetera</I>--any plague or sickness; for no
 calamity befals other people which may not befal God's Israel. Now he 
 supposes,

 (<I>a.</I>) That the cause of the judgment would be sin, and nothing 
 else. "If they be <I>smitten before the enemy,</I> if there be no rain, 
 it is <I>because they have sinned against thee.</I>" It is sin that 
 makes all the mischief. 

 (<I>b.</I>) That the consequence of the judgment would be that they 
 would cry to God, and make supplication to him in or towards that 
 house. Those that slighted him before would solicit him then.  <I>Lord, 
 in trouble have they visited thee. In their afflictions they will seek 
 me early</I> and earnestly. 

 (<I>c.</I>) That the condition of the removal of the judgment was 
 something more than barely praying for it.  He could not, he would not, 
 ask that their prayer might be answered unless they did also <I>turn 
 from their sin</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>)
 
 and <I>turn again to God</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 that is, unless they did truly repent and reform. On no other terms may
 we look for salvation in this world or the other. But, if they did thus 
 qualify themselves for mercy, he prays,

 [<I>a.</I>] That God would hear from heaven, his holy temple above, to 
 which they must look, through <I>this</I> temple. 

 [<I>b.</I>] That he would forgive their sin; for then only are 
 judgments removed in mercy when sin is pardoned. 

 [<I>c.</I>] That he would <I>teach them the good way wherein they 
 should walk,</I> by his Spirit, with his word and prophets; and thus 
 they might be both profited by their trouble (for <I>blessed is the man 
 whom God chastens and teaches</I>), and prepared for deliverance, which 
 then comes in love when it finds us brought back to the good way of God 
 and duty.  

 [<I>d.</I>] That he would then remove the judgment, and redress the 
 grievance, whatever it might be--not only accept the prayer, but give 
 in the mercy prayed for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>b.</I> In case of personal afflictions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:38-40"><I>v.</I> 38-40</A>.

 "If any man of Israel has an errand to thee, here let him find thee,
 here let him find favour with thee." He does not mention particulars, 
 so numerous, so various, are the grievances of the children of men.

 (<I>a.</I>) He supposes that the complainants themselves would very 
 sensibly feel their own burden, and would open that case to God which 
 otherwise they kept to themselves and did not make any man acquainted 
 with: They <I>shall know every man the plague of his own heart,</I> 
 what it is that pains him, and (as we say) where the shoe pinches, and 
 shall spread their hands, that is, spread their case, as Hezekiah 
 spread the letter, in prayer, towards this house; whether the trouble 
 be of body or mind, they shall represent it before God. Inward burdens 
 seem especially meant. Sin is the plague of our own heart; our 
 indwelling corruptions are our spiritual diseases. Every Israelite 
 indeed endeavours to know these, that he may mortify them and watch 
 against the risings of them. These he complains of. This is the burden 
 he groans under: <I>O wretched man that I am!</I> These drive him to 
 his knees, drive him to the sanctuary. Lamenting these, <I>he spreads 
 forth his hands</I> in prayer. 

 (<I>b.</I>) He refers all cases of this kind, that should be brought 
 hither, to God.

 [<I>a.</I>] To his omniscience: "<I>Thou, even thou only, knowest the 
 hearts of all the children of men,</I> not only the plagues of their 
 hearts, their several wants and burdens" (these he knows, but he will 
 know them from us), "but the desire and intent of the heart, the 
 sincerity or hypocrisy of it. Thou knowest which prayer comes from the 
 heart, and which from the lips only." The hearts of kings are not 
 unsearchable to God. 

 [<I>b.</I>] To his justice: <I>Give to every man according to his 
 ways;</I> and he will not fail to do so, by the rules of grace, not the 
 law, for then we should all be undone. 

 [<I>c.</I>] To his mercy: <I>Hear, and forgive, and do</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>),
 
 <I>that they may fear thee all their days,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 This use we should make of the mercy of God to us in hearing our
 prayers and forgiving our sins, we should thereby he engaged to fear 
 him while we live. <I>Fear the Lord and his goodness. There is 
 forgiveness with him, that he may be feared.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>c.</I> The case of the stranger that is not an Israelite is next mentioned,
 a proselyte that comes to the temple to pray to the God of Israel, 
 being convinced of the folly and wickedness of worshipping the gods of 
 his country. 

 (<I>a.</I>) He supposed that there would be many such 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:41,42"><I>v.</I> 41, 42</A>),

 that the fame of God's great works which he had wrought for Israel, by 
 which he proved himself to be above all gods, nay, to be God alone, 
 would reach to distant countries: "Those that live remote <I>shall hear 
 of thy strong hand, and thy stretched-out arm;</I> and this will bring 
 all thinking considerate people to pray towards this house, that they 
 may obtain the favour of a God that is able to do them a real 
 kindness." 

 (<I>b.</I>) He begged that God would accept and answer the proselyte's 
 prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 <I>Do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for.</I> Thus
 early, thus ancient, were the indications of favour towards the 
 <I>sinners of the Gentiles:</I> as there was then <I>one law for the 
 native and for the stranger</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+12:49">Exod. xii. 49</A>),

 so there was one gospel for both. 

 (<I>c.</I>) Herein he aimed at the glory of God and the propagating of 
 the knowledge of him: "O let the stranger, in a special manner, speed 
 well in his addresses, that he may carry away with him to his own 
 country a good report of the God of Israel, <I>that all people may know 
 thee and fear thee</I> (and, if they know thee aright, they will fear 
 thee) <I>as do thy people Israel.</I>" So far was Solomon from 
 monopolizing the knowledge and service of God, and wishing to have them 
 confined to Israel only (which was the envious desire of the Jews in 
 the days of Christ and his apostles), that he prayed that <I>all people 
 might fear God as Israel did.</I> Would to God that all the children of 
 men might receive the adoption, and be made God's children! 
 <I>Father,</I> thus <I>glorify thy name.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>d.</I> The case of an army going forth to battle is next recommended by
 Solomon to the divine favour. It is supposed that the army is encamped 
 at a distance, somewhere a great way off, sent by divine order 
 <I>against the enemy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 "When they are ready to engage, and consider the perils and doubtful
 issues of battle, and put up a prayer to God for protection and 
 success, with their eye <I>towards this city and temple,</I> then 
 <I>hear their prayer,</I> encourage their hearts, strengthen their 
 hands, cover their heads, and so maintain their cause and give them 
 victory." Soldiers in the field must not think it enough that those who 
 tarry at home pray for them, but must pray for themselves, and they are 
 here encouraged to hope fore a gracious answer. Praying should always 
 go along with fighting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>e.</I> The case of poor captives is the last that is here mentioned 
 as a proper object of divine compassion. 

 (<I>a.</I>) He supposes that Israel will sin. He knew them, and 
 himself, and the nature of man, too well to think this a foreign 
 supposition; <I>for there is no man that sinneth not,</I> that does not 
 enough to justify God in the severest rebukes of his providence, no man 
 but what is in danger of falling into gross sin, and will if God leave 
 him to himself. 

 (<I>b.</I>) He supposes, what may well be expected, that, if Israel 
 revolt from God, God will be <I>angry with them,</I> and <I>deliver 
 them into the hand of their enemies,</I> to be carried captive into a 
 strange country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.

 (<I>c.</I>) He then supposes that they will bethink themselves, will 
 consider their ways (for afflictions put men upon consideration), and, 
 when once they are brought to consider, they will repent and pray, will 
 confess their sins, and humble themselves, saying, <I>We have sinned 
 and have done perversely</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>),

 and <I>in the land of their enemies will return to God,</I> whom they
 had forsaken in their own land.

 (<I>d.</I>) He supposes that in their prayers they will look towards 
 their own land, the holy land, Jerusalem, the holy city, and the 
 temple, the holy house, and directs them so to do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>),

 for his sake who gave them that land, chose that city, and to whose
 honour that house was built.

 (<I>e.</I>) He prays that then God would <I>hear their prayers, forgive 
 their sins, plead their cause,</I> and incline their enemies to <I>have 
 compassion on them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:49,50"><I>v.</I> 49, 50</A>.

 God has all hearts in his hand, and can, when he pleases, turn the
 strongest stream the contrary way, and make those to pity his people 
 who have been their most cruel persecutors. See this prayer answered,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:46">Ps. cvi. 46</A>.

 He <I>made them to be pitied of those that carried them captive,</I>
 which, if it did not release them, yet eased their captivity.

 (<I>f.</I>) He pleads their relation to God, and his interest in them: 
 "They are thy people, whom thou hast taken into thy covenant and under 
 thy care and conduct, thy inheritance, from which, more than from any 
 other nation, thy rent and tribute of glory issue and arise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),
 
 <I>separated from among all people</I> to be so and by distinguishing
 favours appropriated to thee," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:53"><I>v.</I> 53</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> After all these particulars, he concludes with this 
 general request, that God would hearken to all his praying people <I>in 
 all that they call unto him for,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>.

 No place now, under the gospel, can be imagined to add any
 acceptableness to the prayers made in or towards it, as the temple then 
 did. That was a shadow: the substance is Christ; whatever we ask in his 
 name, it shall be given us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>54 And it was <I>so,</I> that when Solomon had made an end of
 praying all this prayer and supplication unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, he arose
 from before the altar of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, from kneeling on his knees
 with his hands spread up to heaven.
 &nbsp; 55 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel
 with a loud voice, saying,
 &nbsp; 56 Blessed <I>be</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that hath given rest unto his people
 Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed
 one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand
 of Moses his servant.
 &nbsp; 57 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let
 him not leave us, nor forsake us:
 &nbsp; 58 That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his
 ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his
 judgments, which he commanded our fathers.
 &nbsp; 59 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication
 before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, be nigh unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God day and night,
 that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his
 people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:
 &nbsp; 60 That all the people of the earth may know that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I>
 God, <I>and that there is</I> none else.
 &nbsp; 61 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God,
 to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this
 day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon, after his sermon in Ecclesiastes, gives us the conclusion of 
 the whole matter; so he does here, after this long prayer; it is called 
 his <I>blessing the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>.

 He pronounced it standing, that he might be the better heard, and
 because he blessed as one having authority. Never were words more fitly 
 spoken, nor more pertinently.  Never was congregation dismissed with 
 that which was more likely to affect them and abide with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He gives God the glory of the great and kind things he had done for 
 Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:56"><I>v.</I> 56</A>.
 
 He stood up to <I>bless the congregation</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>),

 but began with blessing God; for we must in <I>every thing give
 thanks.</I> Do we expect God should do well for us and ours? let us
 take all occasion to speak well of him and his. He blesses God who has
 given, he does not say wealth, and honour, and power, and victory, to
 Israel, but <I>rest,</I> as if that were a blessing more valuable than
 any of those. Let not those who have rest under-value that blessing,
 though they want some others. He compares the blessings God had
 bestowed upon them with the promises he had given them, that God might
 have the honour of his faithfulness and the truth of that word of his
 which he has <I>magnified above all his name.</I>

 1. He refers to the <I>promises given by the hand of Moses,</I> as he
 did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:15,24"><I>v.</I> 15, 24</A>)

 to those which were made to David. There were promises given by Moses,
 as well as precepts. It was long ere God gave Israel the promised rest, 
 but they had it at last, after many trials. The day will come when 
 God's spiritual Israel will <I>rest from all their labours.</I> 

 2. He does, as it were, write a receipt in full on the back of these
 bonds: <I>There has not failed one word of all his good promises.</I> 
 This discharge he gives in the name of all Israel, to the everlasting 
 honour of the divine faithfulness, and the everlasting encouragement of 
 all those that build upon the divine promises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He blesses himself and the congregation, expressing his earnest 
 desire and hope of these four things:--

 1. The presence of God with them, which is all in all to the happiness
 of a church and nation and of every particular person. This great 
 congregation was now shortly to be scattered, and it was not likely 
 that they would ever be all together again in this world. Solomon 
 therefore dismisses them with this blessing: "<I>The Lord be present 
 with us,</I> and that will be comfort enough when we are absent from 
 each other. <I>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our 
 fathers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:57"><I>v.</I> 57</A>);

 <I>let him not leave us,</I> let him be to us to day, and to ours for
 ever, what he was to those that went before us." 

 2. The power of his grace upon them: "<I>Let him be with us,</I> and
 continue with us, not that he may enlarge our coasts and increase our 
 wealth, but <I>that he may incline our hearts to himself, to walk in 
 all his ways and to keep his commandments,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>.

 Spiritual blessings are the best blessings, with which we should covet
 earnestly to be blessed. Our hearts are naturally averse to our duty, 
 and apt to decline from God; it is his grace that inclines them, grace 
 that must be obtained by prayer.

 3. An answer to the prayer he had now made: "<I>Let these my words be
 nigh unto the Lord our God day and night,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>.

 Let a gracious return be made to every prayer that shall be made here,
 and that will be a continual answer to this prayer." What Solomon asks 
 here for his prayer is still granted in the intercession of Christ, of 
 which his supplication was a type; that powerful prevailing 
 intercession <I>is before the Lord our God day and night,</I> for our 
 great Advocate attends continually to this very thing, and we may 
 depend upon him to maintain our cause (against the adversary that 
 accuses us <I>day</I> and <I>night,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:10">Rev. xii. 10</A>)

 <I>and the</I> common <I>cause of his people Israel, at all times,</I>
 upon all occasions, as the matter shall require, so as to speak for us 
 <I>the word of the day in its day,</I> as the original here reads it, 
 from which we shall receive grace sufficient, suitable, and seasonable, 
 <I>in every time of need.</I> 

 4. The glorifying of God in the enlargement of his kingdom among men.
 Let Israel be thus blessed, thus favoured; not that all people may 
 become tributaries to us (Solomon sees his kingdom as great as he 
 desires), but <I>that all people may know that the Lord is God,</I> and 
 he only, and may come and worship him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>.

 With this Solomon's prayers, like <I>the prayers of his father David,
 the son of Jesse, are ended</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:19,20">Ps. lxxii. 19, 20</A>):

 <I>Let the whole earth be filled with his glory.</I> We cannot close
 our prayers with a better summary than this, <I>Father, glorify thy 
 name.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He solemnly charges his people to continue and persevere in their 
 duty to God. Having spoken to God for them, he here speaks from God to 
 them, and those only would fare the better for his prayers that were 
 made better by his preaching. His admonition, at parting, is, "<I>Let 
 your heart be perfect with the Lord our God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:61"><I>v.</I> 61</A>.

 Let your obedience be universal, without dividing--upright, without
 dissembling--constant, without declining;" this is evangelical 
 perfection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>62 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice
 before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 63 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
 offered unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an
 hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the
 children of Israel dedicated the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 64 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court
 that <I>was</I> before the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for there he offered
 burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace
 offerings: because the brasen altar that <I>was</I> before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 <I>was</I> too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat
 offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.
 &nbsp; 65 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with
 him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto
 the river of Egypt, before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God, seven days and seven
 days, <I>even</I> fourteen days.
 &nbsp; 66 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed
 the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for
 all the goodness that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had done for David his servant,
 and for Israel his people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We read before that Judah and Israel were eating and drinking, and very 
 cheerful under their own vines and fig-trees; here we have them so in 
 God's courts. Now they found Solomon's words true concerning Wisdom's 
 ways, that they are ways of pleasantness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They had abundant joy and satisfaction while they attended at God's 
 house, for there, 

 1. Solomon offered a great sacrifice, 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep,
 enough to have drained the country of cattle if it had not been a very 
 fruitful land. The heathen thought themselves very generous when they 
 offered sacrifices by <I>hundreds (hecatombs</I> they called them), but 
 Solomon out-did them: he offered them by <I>thousands.</I> When Moses 
 dedicated his altar, the peace-offerings were twenty-four <I>bullocks, 
 and of rams, goats, and lambs,</I> 180

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:88">Num. vii. 88</A>);

 then the people were poor, but now that they had increased in wealth
 more was expected from them. Where God sows plentifully he must reap 
 accordingly. All these sacrifices could not be offered in one day, but 
 in the several days of the feast. Thirty oxen a day served Solomon's 
 table, but thousands shall go to God's altar. Few are thus minded, to 
 spend more on their souls than on their bodies. The flesh of the 
 peace-offerings, which belonged to the offerer, it is likely, Solomon 
 treated the people with. Christ fed those who attended him. The brazen 
 altar was not large enough to receive all these sacrifices, so that, to 
 serve the present occasion, they were forced to offer many of them 
 <I>in the middle of the court,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:64"><I>v.</I> 64</A>),

 some think on altars, altars of earth or stone, erected for the purpose
 and taken down when the solemnity was over, others think on the bare 
 ground. Those that will be generous in serving God need not stint 
 themselves for want of room and occasion to be so. 

 2. He kept a feast, the feast of tabernacles, as it should seem, after
 the feast of dedication, and both together lasted fourteen days

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:65"><I>v.</I> 65</A>),

 yet they said not, <I>Behold, what a weariness is this!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They carried this joy and satisfaction with them to their own 
 houses. When they were dismissed they blessed the king 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:66"><I>v.</I> 66</A>),
 
 applauded him, admired him, and returned him the thanks of the
 congregation, and then <I>went to their tents joyful and glad of 
 heart,</I> all easy and pleased. God's goodness was the matter of their
 joy, so it should be of ours at all times. They rejoiced in God's 
 blessing both on the royal family and on the kingdom; thus should we go 
 home rejoicing from holy ordinances, and go on our way rejoicing for 
 God's goodness to our Lord Jesus (of whom David his servant was a type, 
 in the advancement and establishment of his throne, pursuant to the 
 covenant of redemption), and to all believers, his spiritual Israel, in 
 their sanctification and consolation, pursuant to the covenant of 
 grace. If we rejoice not herein always it is our own fault.</P>
