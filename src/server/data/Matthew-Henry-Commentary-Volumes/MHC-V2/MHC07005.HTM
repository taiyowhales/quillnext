 This chapter contains the triumphal song which was composed and sung 
 upon occasion of that glorious victory which Israel obtained over the 
 forces of Jabin king of Canaan and the happy consequences of that 
 victory. Probably it was usual then to publish poems upon such 
 occasions, as now; but this only is preserved of all the poems of that 
 age of the judges, because dictated by Deborah a prophetess, designed 
 for a psalm of praise then, and a pattern of praise to after-ages, and 
 it gives a great deal of light to the history of these times. 

 I. It begins with praise to God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 II. The substance of this song transmits the memory of this great
 achievement.

 1. Comparing God's appearances for them on this occasion with his
 appearances to them on Mount Sinai,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 2. Magnifying their deliverance from the consideration of the
 calamitous condition they had been in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>.

 3. Calling those to join in praise that shared in the benefits of the
 success, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>.

 4. Reflecting honour upon those tribes that were forward and active
 in that war, and disgrace on those that declined the service, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:14-19,23">ver. 14-19, 23</A>.

 5. Taking notice how God himself fought for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:20-22">ver. 20-22</A>.

 6. Celebrating particularly the honour of Jael, that slew Sisera, on
 which head the song is very large, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:24-30">ver. 24-30</A>.

 It concludes with a prayer to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:31">ver. 31</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Praise ye the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for the avenging of Israel, when the
 people willingly offered themselves.
 &nbsp; 3 Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, <I>even</I> I, will
 sing unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; I will sing <I>praise</I> to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 4 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out
 of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens
 dropped, the clouds also dropped water.
 &nbsp; 5 The mountains melted from before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>even</I> that Sinai
 from before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The former chapter let us know what great things God had done for 
 Israel; in this we have the thankful returns they made to God, that all 
 ages of the church might learn that work of heaven to praise God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God is praised by a song, which is,

 1. A very natural expression of rejoicing. <I>Is any merry? Let him
 sing;</I> and holy joy is the very soul and root of praise and 
 thanksgiving. God is pleased to reckon himself glorified by our joy in 
 him, and in his wondrous works. His servants' joy is his delight, and 
 their sons are melody to him.

 2. A very proper expedient for spreading the knowledge and
 perpetuating the remembrance of great events. Neighbours would learn
 this song one of another and children of their parents; and by that 
 means those who had not books, or could not read, yet would be made 
 acquainted with these works of God; and <I>one generation</I> would 
 thus <I>praise God's works to another,</I> and <I>declare his mighty 
 acts,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:4">Ps. cxlv. 4</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Deborah herself penned this song, as appears by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>:

 <I>Till I Deborah arose.</I> And the first words should be rendered,
 <I>Then she sang, even Deborah.</I>

 1. She used her gifts as a prophetess in composing the song, and the
 strain throughout is very fine and lofty, the images are lively, the 
 expressions elegant, and an admirable mixture there is in it of 
 sweetness and majesty. No poetry is comparable to the sacred poetry. 
 And,

 2. We may supposed she used her power as a princess, in obliging the
 conquering army of Israel to learn and sing this son. She expects not 
 that they should, by their poems, celebrate her praises and magnify 
 here, but requires that in this poem they should join with her in 
 celebrating God's praises and magnifying him. She had been the first 
 wheel in the action, and now is so in the thanksgiving.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It was sung on that day, not the very day that the fight was, but 
 on that occasion, and soon after, as soon as a thanksgiving day could 
 conveniently be appointed. When we have received mercy from God, we 
 ought to be speedy in our returns of praise, while the impressions of 
 the mercy are fresh. It is rent to be paid at the day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She begins with a general Hallelujah: <I>Praise</I> (or 
 <I>bless,</I> for that is the word) <I>you the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The design of the song is to give glory to God; this therefore is put
 first, to explain and direct all that follows, like the first petition 
 of the Lord's prayer, <I>Hallowed be thy name.</I> Two things God is 
 here praised for:--

 (1.) The vengeance he took on Israel's enemies, for the avenging of 
 Israel upon their proud and cruel oppressors, recompensing into their 
 bosoms all the injuries they had done to his people. <I>The Lord is 
 known</I> as a righteous God, and the God to whom vengeance belongs 
 <I>by the judgments which he executeth.</I> 

 (2.) The grace he gave to Israel's friends, <I>when the people 
 willingly offered themselves</I> to serve in this war. God is to have 
 the glory of all the good offices that are at any time done us; and the 
 more willingly they are done the more is to be observed of that grace 
 which gives both to will and to do. For these two things she resolves 
 to leave this song upon record, to the honour of the everlasting God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>I, even I, will sing unto the Lord,</I> Jehovah, that God of
 incontestable sovereignty and irresistible power, even to <I>the Lord 
 God of Israel,</I> who governs all for the good of the church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She calls to the great ones of the world, that sit at the upper end 
 of its table, to attend to her song, and take notice of the subject of 
 it: <I>Hear, O you kings! give ear, O you princes!</I> 

 (1.) She would have them know that as great and as high as they were 
 there was one above them with whom it is folly to contend, and to whom 
 it was their interest to submit, that horses and chariots are vain 
 things for safety. 

 (2.) She would have them to join with her in praising the God of 
 Israel, and no longer to praise their counterfeit deities, as 
 Belshazzar did. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:4">Dan. v. 4</A>,

 <I>He praised the gods of gold and silver.</I> She bespeaks them as the
 psalmist

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:10,11">Ps. ii. 10, 11</A>),

 <I>Be wise now therefore, O you kings! serve the Lord with fear.</I>

 (3.) She would have them take warning by Sisera's fate, and not dare to 
 offer any injury to the people of God, whose cause, sooner or later, 
 God will plead with jealousy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. She looks back upon God's former appearances, and compares this with 
 them, the more to magnify the glorious author of this great salvation. 
 What God is doing should bring to our mind what he has done; for he is 
 the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Lord, when thou wentest our of Seir.</I> This may be understood
 either,

 (1.) Of the appearances of God's power and justice against the enemies 
 of Israel to subdue and conquer them; and so

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:3,4">Hab. iii. 3, 4</A>,

 &c., is parallel to it,
 where the destruction of the church's enemies is thus described. When 
 God had led his people Israel from the country of Edom he brought down 
 under their feet Sihon and Og, striking them and their armies with such 
 terror and amazement that they seemed apprehensive heaven and earth 
 were coming together. Their hearts melted, as if all the world had been 
 melting round about them. Or it notes the glorious displays of the 
 divine majesty; and the surprising effects of the divine power, enough 
 to make the earth tremble, the heavens drop like snow before the sun, 
 and the mountains to melt. Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:7">Ps. xviii. 7</A>.

 God's counsels are so far from being hindered by any creature that,
 when the time of their accomplishment comes, that which seemed to stand 
 in their way will not only yield before them, but be made to serve 
 them. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:1,2">Isa. lxiv. 1, 2</A>.
 
 Or,

 (2.) It is meant of the appearances of God's glory and majesty to 
 Israel, when he gave them his law at Mount Sinai. It was then literally 
 true, <I>the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped,</I> &c. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:2,Ps+68:7,8">Deut. xxxiii. 2; Ps. lxviii. 7, 8</A>.

 Let all the kings and princes know that this is the God whom Deborah
 praises, and not such mean and impotent deities as they paid their 
 homage to. The Chaldee paraphrase applies it to the giving of the law, 
 but has a strange descant on those words, <I>the mountains melted. 
 Tabor, Hermon, and Carmel, contended among themselves: one said, Let 
 the divine majesty dwell upon me; the other said, Let it dwell upon me; 
 but God made it to dwell upon Mount Sinai, the meanest and least of all 
 the mountains.</I> I suppose it means the least valuable, because 
 barren and rocky.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael,
 the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through
 byways.
 &nbsp; 7 <I>The inhabitants of</I> the villages ceased, they ceased in
 Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 8 They chose new gods; then <I>was</I> war in the gates: was there a
 shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?
 &nbsp; 9 My heart <I>is</I> toward the governors of Israel, that offered
 themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 10 Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment,
 and walk by the way.
 &nbsp; 11 <I>They that are delivered</I> from the noise of archers in the
 places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous
 acts of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>even</I> the righteous acts <I>toward the
 inhabitants</I> of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> go down to the gates.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Deborah describes the distressed state of Israel under the tyranny 
 of Jabin, that the greatness of their trouble might make their 
 salvation appear the more illustrious and the more gracious 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 <I>From the days of Shamgar,</I> who did some thing towards the
 deliverance of Israel from the Philistines, to the days of Jael, the 
 present day, in which Jael has so signalized herself, the country has 
 been in a manner desolate.

 1. No trade. For want of soldiers to protect men of business in their
 business from the incursions of the enemy, and for want of magistrates 
 to restrain and punish thieves and robbers among them (men of broken 
 fortunes and desperate spirits, that, having no employment, took to rob 
 on the highroad), all commerce ceased, and the highways were 
 unoccupied; no caravans of merchants, as formerly.

 2. No travelling. Whereas in times when there was some order and
 government the travellers might be safe in the open roads, and the 
 robbers were forced to lurk in the by-ways, no, on the contrary, the 
 robbers insulted on the open roads without check, and the honest 
 travellers were obliged to sculk and walk through by-ways, in continual 
 frights.

 3. No tillage. The fields must needs be laid waste and unoccupied
 when the inhabitants of the villages, the country farmers, ceased from 
 their employment, quitted their houses which were continually alarmed 
 and plundered by the banditti, and were obliged to take shelter for 
 themselves and their families in walled and fenced cities.

 4. No administration of justice. There was war in the gates where
 their courts were kept, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 So that it was not till this salvation was wrought that <I>the people
 of the Lord</I> durst <I>go down to the gates,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The continual incursions of the enemy deprived the magistrates of the
 dignity, and the people of the benefit, of their government.

 5. No peace to him that went out nor to him that came in. The gates
 through which they passed and repassed were infested by the enemy; nay, 
 the places of drawing water were alarmed by the archers--a mighty 
 achievement to terrify the drawers of water.

 6. Neither arms nor spirit to help themselves with, not a <I>shield
 nor spear seen among forty thousand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:8">v. 8</A>.

 Either they were disarmed by their oppressors, or they themselves
 neglected the art of war; so that, though they had spears and shields, 
 they were not to be seen, but were thrown by and suffered to rust, they 
 having neither skill nor will to use them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. She shows in one word what it was that brought all this misery upon 
 them: <I>They chose new gods,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It was their idolatry that provoked God to give them up thus into the
 hands of their enemies. The Lord their God was one Lord, but this would 
 not content them: they must have more, many more, still more. Their God 
 was the Ancient of days, still the same, and therefore they grew weary 
 of him, and must have new gods, which they were as fond of as children 
 of new clothes, names newly invented, heroes newly canonized. Their 
 fathers, when put to their choice, chose the Lord for their God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:21">Josh. xxiv. 21</A>),

 but they would not abide by that choice, they must have gods of their
 own choosing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. She takes notice of God's great goodness to Israel in raising up 
 such as should redress these grievances. Herself first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Till that I Deborah arose,</I> to restrain and punish those who
 disturbed the public peace, and protect men in their business, and then 
 the face of things was changed for the better quickly; those beasts of 
 prey retired upon the breaking forth of this joyful light, and <I>man 
 went forth again to his work and labour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:22,23">Ps. civ. 22, 23</A>.

 Thus she became a mother in Israel, a nursing mother, such was the
 affection she bore to her people, and such the care and pains she took 
 for the public welfare. Under her there were other governors of Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 who, like her, had done their part as governors to reform the people,
 and then, like her, offered themselves willingly to serve in the war, 
 not insisting upon the exemption which their dignity and office 
 entitled them to, when the had so fair an opportunity of appearing in 
 their country's cause; and no doubt the example of the governors 
 influenced the people in like manner <I>willingly to offer 
 themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Of these governors she says, <I>My heart is towards them,</I> that is,
 "I truly love and honour them; they have won my heart for ever; I shall 
 never forget them." Note, Those are worthy of double honour that recede 
 voluntarily from the demands of their honour to serve God and his 
 church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. She calls upon those who had a particular share in the advantages
 of this great salvation to offer up particular thanks to God for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 Let every man speak as he found of the goodness of God in this happy
 change of the posture of public affairs.

 1. <I>You that ride on white asses,</I> that is, the nobility and
 gentry. Horses were little used in that county; they had, it is 
 probable, a much better breed of asses than we have; but persons of 
 quality, it seems, were distinguished by the colour of the asses they 
 rode on; the white being more rare were therefore more valued. Notice 
 is taken of Abdon's sons and grandsons riding on ass-colts, as 
 indicating them to be men of distinction,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+12:14"><I>ch.</I> xii. 14</A>.

 Let such as are by this salvation restored, not only to their liberty
 as other Israelites, but to their dignity, speak God's praises.

 2. Let those that <I>sit in judgment</I> be sensible of it, and
 thankful for it as a very great mercy, that they may sit safely there, 
 that the sword of justice is not struck out of their hand by the sword 
 of war. 

 3. Let those that <I>walk by the way,</I> and meet with none there to
 make them afraid, speak to themselves in pious meditations, and to 
 their fellow-travellers in religious discourses, of the goodness of God 
 in ridding the roads of those banditti that had so long infested them.

 4. Let those that draw in peace, and have not their wells taken from
 them, or stopped up, nor are in danger of being caught by the enemy 
 when they go forth to draw, there, where they find themselves so much 
 more safe and easy than they have been, <I>there let them rehearse the 
 acts of the Lord,</I> not Deborah's acts, nor Barak's, but the Lord's, 
 taking notice of his hand making peace in their borders, and creating a 
 defence upon all the glory. This <I>is the Lord's doing.</I> Observe in 
 these acts of his,

 (1.) Justice executed on his daring enemies. They are the righteous 
 acts of the Lord. See him pleading a righteous cause, and sitting in 
 the throne judging aright, and give him glory as the Judge of all the 
 earth. 

 (2.) Kindness shown to his trembling people, <I>the inhabitants of the 
 villages,</I> who lay most open to the enemy, had suffered most, and 
 were most in danger,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+38:11">Ezek. xxxviii. 11</A>.

 It is the glory of God to protect those that are most exposed, and to
 help the weakest. Let us all take notice of the share we in particular
 have in the public peace and tranquility, the inhabitants of the 
 villages especially, and give God the praise of it.</P>

 &nbsp; 13 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the
 nobles among the people: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> made me have dominion over the
 mighty.
 &nbsp; 14 Out of Ephraim <I>was there</I> a root of them against Amalek;
 after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down
 governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the
 writer.
 &nbsp; 15 And the princes of Issachar <I>were</I> with Deborah; even
 Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley.
 For the divisions of Reuben <I>there were</I> great thoughts of heart.
 &nbsp; 16 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings
 of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben <I>there were</I> great
 searchings of heart.
 &nbsp; 17 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?
 Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.
 &nbsp; 18 Zebulun and Naphtali <I>were</I> a people <I>that</I> jeoparded their
 lives unto the death in the high places of the field.
 &nbsp; 19 The kings came <I>and</I> fought, then fought the kings of Canaan
 in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.
 &nbsp; 20 They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought
 against Sisera.
 &nbsp; 21 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the
 river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.
 &nbsp; 22 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the
 pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.
 &nbsp; 23 Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, curse ye
 bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the
 help of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to the help of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> against the mighty.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Deborah stirs up herself and Barak to celebrate this victory in the 
 most solemn manner, to the glory of God and the honour of Israel, for 
 the encouragement of their friends and the greater confusion of their 
 enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 1. Deborah, as a prophetess, must do it by a song, to compose and sing
 which she excites herself: <I>Awake, awake,</I> and again, <I>awake, 
 awake,</I> which intimates the sense she had of the excellency and 
 difficulty of the work; it needed and well deserved the utmost 
 liveliness and vigour of soul in the performance of it; all the powers 
 and faculties of the soul in their closest intensity and application 
 ought to be employed in it. Thus too she expresses the sense she had of 
 her own infirmity, and aptness to flag and remit in her zeal in this 
 work. Note, Praising God is work that we should awake to, and awake 
 ourselves to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:2">Ps. cviii. 2</A>.

 2. Barak, as a general, must do it by a triumph: <I>Lead thy captivity
 captive.</I> Though the army of Sisera was cut off in the field, and no 
 quarter given, yet we may suppose in the prosecution of the victory, 
 when the war was carried into the enemy's country, many not found in 
 arms were seized and made prisoners of war. These she would have led in 
 chains after Barak, when he made his public entry into his own city, to 
 grace his triumphs; not as if it should be any pleasure to him to 
 trample upon his fellow-creatures, but thus he must give glory to God, 
 and serve that great purpose of his government which is to <I>look upon 
 those that are proud and to abase them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. She gives good reason for this praise and triumph, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 This glorious victory had made the remnant of Israel, and Deborah in
 particular, look very great, a circumstance which they owed entirely to 
 God.

 1. The Israelites had become few and inconsiderable, and yet to them
 God gave dominion over nobles. Many of them were cut off by the enemy, 
 many died of grief, and perhaps some had removed their families and 
 effects into foreign parts; yet those few that remained, by divine 
 assistance, with one brave and generous effort, not only shook off the 
 yoke of oppression from their own neck, but got power over their 
 oppressors. As long as any of God's Israel remain (and a remnant God 
 will have in the worst of times) there is hope, be it ever so small a 
 remnant, for God can make him that remains, though it should be but one 
 single person, triumph over the most proud and potent.

 2. Deborah was herself of the weaker sex, and the sex that from the
 fall had been sentenced to subjection, and yet the Lord that is himself 
 higher than the highest authorized her to rule over the mighty men of 
 Israel, who willingly submitted to her direction, and enabled her to 
 triumph over the mighty men of Canaan, who fell before the army she 
 commanded; so wonderfully did he <I>advance the low estate of his 
 handmaid.</I> "The Lord made me, a woman, to have dominion over mighty 
 men." A despised stone is made <I>head of the corner. This is</I> 
 indeed the <I>Lord's doing, and marvellous in our eyes.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. She makes particular remarks on the several parties concerned in 
 this great action, taking notice who fought against them, who fought 
 for them, and who stood neuter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who fought against them. The power of the enemy must be taken notice 
 of, that the victory may appear the more glorious. Jabin and Sisera had 
 been mentioned in the history, but here it appears further, 

 (1.) That Amalek was in league with Jabin, and sent him in assistance, 
 or endeavoured to do it. Ephraim is here said to act against Amalek 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 probably intercepting and cutting off some forces of the Amalekites
 that were upon their march to join Sisera. Amalek had helped Moab to 
 oppress Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+3:13"><I>ch.</I> iii. 13</A>)

 and now had helped Jabin; they were inveterate enemies to God's
 people--their hand had always <I>been against the throne of the Lord</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:16">Exod. xvii. 16</A>);

 and therefore they were the more dangerous. 

 (2.) That others of the kings of Canaan, who had somewhat recovered 
 themselves since their defeat by Joshua, joined with Jabin, and 
 strengthened his army with their forces, having the same implacable 
 enmity to Israel that he had, and those kingdoms, when they were in 
 their strength, having been subject to that of Hazor,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:10">Josh. xi. 10</A>.

 These kings <I>came and fought,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Israel had no king; their enemies had many, whose power and influence,
 especially acting in confederacy, made them very formidable; and yet 
 Israel, having the Lord for their King, was too hard for them all. It 
 is said of these kings that <I>they took no gain of money,</I> they 
 were not mercenary troops hired into the service of Jabin (such often 
 fail in an extremity), but they were volunteers and hearty in the cause 
 against Israel: they <I>desired not the riches of silver,</I> so the 
 Chaldee, but only the satisfaction of helping to ruin Israel. Acting 
 upon this principle, they were the more formidable, and would be the 
 more cruel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Who fought for them. The several tribes that assisted in this great 
 exploit are here spoken of with honour; for, though God is chiefly to 
 be glorified, instruments must have their due praise, for the 
 encouragement of others: but, after all, it was heaven that turned the 
 scale.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Ephraim and Benjamin, those tribes among whom Deborah herself 
 lived, bestirred themselves, and did bravely, by her influence upon 
 them; for her palm-tree was in the tribe of Ephraim, and very near to 
 that of Benjamin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Out of Ephraim was there a root,</I> and life in the root, against
 Amalek. There was in Ephraim a mountain called <I>the mount of 
 Amalek,</I> mentioned,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+12:15"><I>ch.</I> xii. 15</A>,

 which, some think, is here meant, and some read it, <I>there was a root
 in Amalek,</I> that is, in that mountain, a strong resolution in the 
 minds of that people to make head against the oppressors, which was the 
 root of the matter. Herein Benjamin had set them a good example among 
 his people. "Ephraim moved <I>after thee, Benjamin;</I>" though 
 Benjamin was the junior tribe, and much inferior, especially at this 
 time, to Ephraim, both in number and wealth, yet when they led Ephraim 
 followed in appearing for the common cause. If we be not so bold as to 
 lead, yet we must not be so proud and sullen as not to follow even our 
 inferiors in a good work. Ephraim was a at a distance from the place of 
 action, and therefore could not send forth many of its boughs to the 
 service; but Deborah, who was one of them, knew there was a root of 
 them, that they were hearty well-wishers to the cause. Dr. Lightfoot 
 gives quite another sense of this. Joshua, of Ephraim, had been a root 
 of such victories against Amalek 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:8-16">Exod. xvii.</A>),

 and Ehud of Benjamin lately against Amalek and Moab.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The ice being broken by Ephraim and Benjamin, Machir (the 
 half-tribe of Manasseh beyond Jordan) and Zebulun sent in men that were 
 very serviceable to this great design. When an army is to be raised, 
 especially under such disadvantages as Barak now experienced from the 
 long disuse of arms and the dispiritedness of the people, it is of 
 great consequence to be furnished, 

 [1.] With men of courage for officers, and such the family of Machir 
 furnished them with, for thence came down <I>governors.</I> The 
 children of Machir were particularly famous for their valour in Moses' 
 time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:39">Num. xxxii. 39</A>),

 and it seems it continued in their family, the more because they were
 seated in the frontiers.

 [2.] With men of learning and ingenuity for secretaries of war, and 
 with such they were supplied out of Zebulun: thence came men <I>that 
 handle the pen of the writer,</I> clerks that issued out orders, wrote 
 circular letters, drew commissions, mustered their men, and kept their 
 accounts. Thus must every man, <I>according as he has received the 
 gift, minister the same,</I> for the public good

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:10">1 Pet. iv. 10</A>);

 the eyes see, and the ears hear, for the whole body. I know it is
 generally understood of the forwardness even of the scholars of this 
 tribe, who studied the law and expounded it, to take up arms in this 
 cause, though they were better skilled in books than in the art of war.
 So Sir Richard Blackmore paraphrases it:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scribes of Zebulun and learned men,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To wield the sword, laid down the pen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Issachar did good service too; though he <I>saw that rest was 
 good,</I> and therefore <I>bowed his shoulder to bear,</I> which is the 
 character of that tribe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:15">Gen. xlix. 15</A>),

 yet they disdained to bear the yoke of Jabin's tribute, and now
 preferred the generous toils of war to a servile rest. Though it should 
 seem there were not many common soldiers enlisted out of that tribe, 
 yet <I>the princes of Issachar were with Deborah and Barak</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 probably, as a great council of war to advise upon emergencies. And, it
 should seem, these princes of Issachar did in person accompany Barak 
 into the field of battle. Did he go on foot? They footed it with him, 
 not consulting their honour or ease. Did he go into the valley, the 
 place of most danger? They exposed themselves with him, and were still 
 at his right hand to advise him: for the men of Issachar were men that 
 <I>had understanding of the times,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:32">1 Chron. xii. 32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Zebulun and Naphtali were the most bold and active of all the 
 tribes, not only out of a particular affection to Barak their 
 countryman, but because, they lying nearest to Jabin, the yoke of 
 oppression lay heavier on their necks than on those of any other tribe. 
 Better die in honour than live in bondage; and therefore, in a pious 
 zeal for God and their country, they <I>jeoparded their lives unto the 
 death in the high places of the field,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 With what heroic bravery did they charge and push on even upon the
 chariots of iron, despising danger, and setting death itself at 
 defiance in so good a cause!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) The stars from heaven appeared, or acted at least, on Israel's 
 side 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>The stars in their courses,</I> according to the order and direction
 of him who is the great Lord of their hosts, <I>fought against 
 Sisera,</I> by their malignant influences, or by causing the storms of 
 hail and thunder which contributed so much to the rout of Sisera's 
 army. The Chaldee reads it, <I>from heaven, from the place where the 
 stars go forth, war was waged against Sisera,</I> that is, the power of 
 the God of heaven was engaged against him, making use of the 
 ministration of the angels of heaven. Some way or other, the heavenly 
 bodies (not arrested, as when the sun stood still at Joshua's word, but 
 going on in their courses) fought against Sisera. Those whom God is an 
 enemy to the whole creation is at war with. Perhaps the flashes of 
 lightning by which the stars fought was that which frightened the 
 horses, so as that they pranced till their very hoofs were broken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 and probably overturned the chariots of iron which they drew or turned
 them back upon their owners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) The river of Kishon fought against their enemies. It swept away 
 multitudes of those that hoped to make their escape through it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 Ordinarily, it was but a shallow river, and, being in their own
 country, we may suppose they well knew its fords and safest passages, 
 and yet now, probably by the great rain that fell, it was so swollen, 
 and the stream so deep and strong, that those who attempted to pass it 
 were drowned, being feeble and faint, and unable to make their way 
 through it. And then were the horse-hoofs broken by means of the 
 <I>plungings.</I> So it is in the margin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 The river of Kishon is called <I>that ancient river</I> because
 described or celebrated by ancient historians or poets, or rather 
 because it was designed of old, in the counsel of God, to serve his 
 purposes against Sisera at this time, and did so, as if it had been 
 made on purpose; thus <I>the water of the old pool</I> God is said to 
 have fashioned long ago for that use to which it was put,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:11">Isa. xxii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) Deborah's own soul fought against them; she speaks of it with a 
 holy exultation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>O, my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.</I> She did it by
 exciting others to do it, and assisting them, which she did with all 
 her heart. Also by her prayers; as Moses conquered Amalek by lifting up 
 his hand, so Deborah vanquished Sisera by lifting up her heart. And 
 when the soul is employed in holy exercises, and heart-work is made of 
 them, through the grace of God the strength of our spiritual enemies 
 will be trodden down and will fall before us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. In this great engagement she observes who stood <I>neuter,</I> and 
 did not side with Israel as might have been expected. It is strange to 
 find how many, even of those who were called Israelites, basely 
 deserted this glorious cause and declined to appear. No mention is made 
 of Judah nor Simeon among the tribes concerned, because they, lying so 
 very remote from the scene of action, had not an opportunity to appear, 
 and therefore it was not expected from them; but for those that lay 
 near, and yet would not venture, indelible marks of disgrace are here 
 put upon them, as they deserved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Reuben basely declined the service, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 Justly had he long ago been deprived of the privileges of the
 birth-right, and still does his dying father's doom stick by him: 
 <I>unstable as water, he shall not excel.</I> Two things hindered them 
 from engaging:--

 [1.] Their divisions. This jarring string she twice strikes upon to 
 their shame: <I>For the divisions of Reuben</I> (or in these divisions) 
 <I>there were great thoughts,</I> impressions, and searchings <I>of 
 heart.</I> Not only for their division from Canaan by the river Jordan, 
 which needed not to have hindered them had they been hearty in the 
 cause, for Gilead abode beyond Jordan, and yet from Machir of Gilead 
 came down governors; but it means either that they were divided among 
 themselves, could not agree who should go or who should lead, each 
 striving to gain the posts of honour and shun those of danger, some 
 unhappy contests in their tribe kept them from uniting together, and 
 with their brethren, for the common good, or that they were divided in 
 their opinion of this war from the rest of the tribes, thought the 
 attempt either not justifiable or not practicable, and therefore blamed 
 those that engaged in it and did themselves decline it. This occasioned 
 great searchings of heart among the rest, especially when the had 
 reason to suspect that, whatever Reuben pretended, his sitting still 
 now proceeded from a cooling of his affections to his brethren and an 
 alienation of mind from them, which occasioned them many sad thoughts. 
 It grieves us to see our mother's children angry with us for doing our 
 duty and looking strange upon us when we most need their friendship and 
 assistance. 

 [2.] Their business in the world: <I>Reuben abode among the 
 sheepfolds,</I> a warmer and safer place than the camp, pretending they 
 could not conveniently leave the sheep they tended; he loved to <I>hear 
 the bleatings of the flocks,</I> or, as some read it, the 
 <I>whistlings</I> of the flocks, the music which the shepherds made 
 with their oaten reeds or pipes, and the pastorals which they sung; 
 these Reuben preferred before the martial drum and trumpet. Thus many 
 are kept from doing their duty by the fear of trouble, the love of 
 ease, and an inordinate affection to their worldly business and 
 advantage. Narrow selfish spirits care not what becomes of the 
 interests of God's church, so they can but get, keep, and save money.
 <I>All seek their own,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:21">Phil. ii. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Dan and Asher did the same, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 These two lay on the sea-coast, and,

 [1.] Dan pretended he could not leave his ships but they would be 
 exposed, and therefore <I>I pray thee have me excused.</I> Those of 
 that tribe perhaps pleaded that their sea-trade disfitted them for 
 land-service and diverted them from it; but Zebulun also was a haven 
 for ships, a sea-faring tribe, and yet was forward and active in this 
 expedition. There is no excuse we make to shift off duty but what some 
 or other have broken through and set aside, whose courage and 
 resolution will rise up against us and shame us. 

 [2.] Asher pretended he must stay at home to repair the breaches which 
 the sea had in some places made upon his land, and to fortify his works 
 against the encroachments of it, or he abode in his creeks, or small 
 havens, where his trading vessels lay to attend them. A little thing 
 will serve those for a pretence to stay at home who have no mind to 
 engage in the most necessary services because there are difficulty and 
 danger in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) But above all Meroz is condemned, and a curse pronounced upon the 
 inhabitants of it, <I>Because they came not to the help of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Probably this was some city that lay near the scene of action, and
 therefore the inhabitants had a fair opportunity of showing their 
 obedience to God and their concern for Israel, and of doing a good 
 service to the common cause; but they basely declined it, for fear of 
 Jabin's iron chariots, being willing to sleep in a whole skin. The Lord 
 needed not their help; he made it to appear he could do his work 
 without them; but no thanks to them: for aught they knew the attempt 
 might have miscarried for want of their hand, and therefore they are 
 cursed for <I>not coming to the help of the Lord,</I> when it was in 
 effect proclaimed, <I>Who is on the Lord's side?</I> The cause between 
 God and the mighty (the principalities and powers of the kingdom of 
 darkness) will not admit of neutrality. God looks upon those as against 
 him that are not with him. This curse is pronounced by the <I>angel of 
 the Lord,</I> our Lord Jesus, the captain of the Lord's host (and 
 <I>those whom he curses are cursed indeed</I>), and further than we
 have warrant and authority from him we may not curse. He that will 
 richly reward all his good soldiers will certainly and severely punish 
 all cowards and deserters. This city of Meroz seems to have been at 
 this time a considerable place, since something great was expected from 
 it; but probably, after the angel of the Lord had pronounced this curse 
 upon it, it dwindled, and, like the fig-tree which Christ cursed, 
 withered away, so that we never read of it after this in scripture.</P>

 &nbsp; 26 She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the

 Deborah here concludes this triumphant song,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. With the praises of Jael, her sister-heroine, whose valiant act had 
 completed and crowned the victory. She had mentioned her before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)
 
 as one that would have served her country if it had been in her power;
 now she applauds her as one that did serve it admirably well when it 
 was in her power. Her poetry is finest and most florid here in the 
 latter end of the song. How honourably does she speak of Jael 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),
 
 who preferred her peace with the God of Israel before her peace with
 the king of Canaan, and though not a native of Israel (for aught that 
 appears) yet heartily espoused the cause of Israel in this critical 
 conjuncture, jeoparded her life as truly as if she had been in the high 
 places of the field, and bravely fought for those whom she saw God 
 fought for! <I>Blessed shall she be above women in the tent.</I> Note, 
 Those whose lot is cast in the tent, in a very low and narrow sphere of 
 activity, if they serve God in that according to their capacity, shall 
 in no wise lose their reward. Jael in the tent wins as rich a blessing 
 as Barak in the field. Nothing is more confounding, grievous, and 
 shameful, than disappointment, and Deborah here does most elegantly 
 describe two great disappointments, the shame of which was typical of 
 sinners' everlasting shame.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Sisera found a fatal enemy where he expected a firm and faithful 
 friend. 

 (1.) Jael showed him the kindness of a friend, and perhaps at that time 
 intended no other than kindness, until God, by an immediate impulse 
 upon her mind (which impulses then were to be regarded, and carried so 
 much of their own evidence with them that they might be relied upon, 
 but cannot now be pretended to), directed her to do otherwise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 He asked only for fair water to quench his thirst, but she, not only to
 show her housewifery and good housekeeping, but to express her respect 
 to him, <I>gave him milk</I> and <I>brought forth butter,</I> that is 
 (say some interpreters), milk which had the butter taken from it; we 
 call it butter-milk. No (say others), it was milk that had the butter 
 still in it; we call it cream. Whichsoever it was, it was probably the 
 best her house afforded; and, to set it off, she brought it <I>in a 
 lordly dish,</I> such as she called so, the finest she had, and better 
 than she ordinarily used at her own table. This confirmed Sisera's 
 opinion of her friendship, and made him sleep the faster and the more 
 secure. But, 

 (2.) She proved his mortal enemy, gave him his death's stroke: it is 
 curiously described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 [1.] How great does Jael look, <I>hammering Sisera,</I> as it is in the 
 margin, mauling that proud man who had been so long the terror of the 
 mighty, and sending him down slain to the pit with <I>his iniquities 
 upon his bones!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:27">Ezek. xxxii. 27</A>.

 She seems to have gone about it with no more terror nor concern than if
 she had been going to nail one of the boards or bars of her tent, so 
 confident was she of divine aid and protection. We read it she
 <I>smote off his head,</I> probably with his own sword, which, now that 
 his head was nailed through, she durst take from his side, but not 
 before, for fear of waking him. But because there was no occasion for 
 cutting off his head, nor was it mentioned in the history, many think 
 it should be read, <I>she struck through his head.</I> That head which 
 had been proudly lifted up against God and Israel, and in which had 
 been forged bloody designs for the destruction of God's people, Jael 
 finds a soft place in, and into that with a good will strikes her nail. 
 
 [2.] How mean does Sisera look, fallen at Jael's feet! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 At the feet of this female executioner he bowed, he fell; all his
 struggles for life availed not; she followed her blow until he fell 
 down dead.  There lies extended the deserted carcase of that proud man, 
 not on the bed of honour, not in the high places of the field, not 
 having any glorious wound to show from a glittering sword, or a bow of 
 steel, but in the corner of a tent, at the feet of a woman, with a 
 disgraceful wound by a sorry nail struck through his head. Thus is 
 shame the fate of proud men. And this is a very lively representation 
 of the ruin of those sinners whose prosperity slays them; it flatters 
 and caresses them with milk and butter in a lordly dish, as if it would 
 make them easy and happy, but it nails their heads and hearts too to 
 the ground in earthly-mindedness, and pierces them through with many 
 sorrows; its flatteries are fatal, and sink them at last into 
 destruction and perdition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:9,10">1 Tim. vi. 9, 10</A>.</P>

 2. Sisera's mother had the tidings brought her of her son's fall and 
 ruin when she was big with expectation of his glorious and triumphant 
 return, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:28-30"><I>v.</I> 28-30</A>,
 
 where we have,

 (1.) Her fond desire to see her son come back in triumph: <I>Why is his 
 chariot so long in coming?</I> She speaks this, not so much out of a 
 concern for his safety, or any jealousy of his having miscarried (she 
 had no fear of that, so confident was she of his success), but out of a 
 longing for his glory, which with a feminine weakness she was 
 passionately impatient to see, chiding the lingering chariot, and 
 expostulating concerning the delays of it, little thinking that her 
 unhappy son had been, before this, forced to quit that chariot which 
 they were so proud of, and which she thought came so slowly. <I>The 
 chariots of his glory had now become the shame of his house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:18">Isa. xxii. 18</A>.

 Let us take heed of indulging such desires as these towards any
 temporal good thing, particularly towards that which cherishes 
 vain-glory, for this was what she here doted on. Eagerness and 
 impatience in our desires do us a great deal of prejudice, and make it 
 intolerable to us to be crossed. But towards the second coming of Jesus 
 Christ, and the glories of that day, we should thus stand affected 
 (<I>Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly</I>), for here we cannot be
 disappointed.

 (2.) Her foolish hope and confidence that he would come at last in so
 much the greater pomp. Her wise ladies answered her, and thought they 
 gave a very good account of the delay; yea, she (<I>in her wisdom,</I> 
 says the Chaldee) tauntingly made answer to herself, "<I>Have they not 
 sped?</I> No doubt they have, and that which delays them is that they 
 are <I>dividing the prey,</I> which is so much that it is a work of 
 time to make a distribution of it." In the spoil they pleased 
 themselves with the thought of, observe,

 [1.] How impudently, and to the reproach and scandal of their sex, 
 these ladies boast of the multitude of damsels which the soldiers would 
 have the abusing of. 

 [2.] How childishly they pleased themselves with the hope of seeing 
 Sisera himself in a gaudy mantle of <I>divers colours;</I> how 
 charmingly would it look! <I>of divers colours of needle-work,</I> 
 plundered out of the wardrobe of some Israelitish lady; it is repeated 
 again, as that which pleased their fancy above any thing, <I>of divers 
 colours of needle-work on both sides,</I> and therefore very rich; such 
 pieces of embroidery they hoped Sisera would have to present his mother 
 and the ladies with. Thus apt are we to deceive ourselves with great 
 expectations and confident hopes of honour, and pleasure, and wealth in 
 this world, by which we prepare for ourselves the shame and grief of a 
 disappointment. And thus does God often bring ruin on his enemies when 
 they are most elevated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. She concludes all with a prayer to God,

 1. For the destruction of all his foes: "<I>So,</I> so shamefully, so
 miserably, <I>let all thy enemies perish, O Lord;</I> let all that hope 
 to triumph in Israel's ruin be thus disappointed and triumphed over. 
 <I>Do to them all as unto Sisera,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:9">Ps. lxxxiii. 9</A>.

 Though our enemies are to be prayed for, God's enemies, as such, are to
 be prayed against; and, when we see some of God's enemies remarkably 
 humbled and brought down, this is an encouragement to us to pray for 
 the downfall of all the rest. Deborah was a prophetess, and this prayer 
 was a prediction that in due time all God's enemies shall perish,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:9">Ps. xcii. 9</A>.

 None ever hardened his heart against God and prospered.

 2. For the exaltation and comfort of all his friends. "But let those
 that love him, and heartily wish well to his kingdom among men, be 
 <I>as the sun when he goeth forth in his strength;</I> let them shine 
 so bright, appear so glorious in the eye of the world, cast such benign 
 influences, be as much out of the reach of their enemies, who curse the 
 rising sun because it scorches them; let them <I>rejoice as a strong 
 man to run a race,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:5">Ps. xix. 5</A>.

 Let them, as burning and shining lights in their places, dispel the
 mists of darkness, and shine with more and more lustre and power 
 <I>unto the perfect day.</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:18">Prov. iv. 18</A>.

 Such shall be the honour, and such the joy, of all that love God in
 sincerity, and for ever they shall <I>shine as the sun in the firmament 
 of our Father.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The victory here celebrated with this song was of such happy 
 consequence to Israel that for the best part of one age they enjoyed 
 the peace which it opened the way to: <I>The land had rest forty
 years,</I> that is, so long it was from this victory to the raising up 
 of Gideon. And well would it have been if, when the churches and the 
 tribes had rest, they had been edified, <I>and had walked in the fear 
 of the Lord.</I></P>
