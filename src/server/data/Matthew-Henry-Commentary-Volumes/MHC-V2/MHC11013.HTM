 In the close of the foregoing chapter we left Jeroboam attending his 
 altar at Beth-el, and there we find him in the beginning of this, when 
 he received a testimony from God against his idolatry and apostasy. 
 This was sent to him by a prophet, a man of God that lived in Judah, 
 who is the principal subject of the story of this chapter, where we are 
 told, 
 
 I. What passed between him and the new king.

 1. The prophet threatened Jeroboam's altar

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 and gave him a sign 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:3">ver. 3</A>),

 which immediately came to pass, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:5">ver. 5</A>.

 2. The king threatened the prophet, and was himself made another sign,
 by the withering of his hand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:4">ver. 4</A>),

 and the restoring of it upon his submission and the prophet's
 intercession, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:6">ver. 6</A>.

 3. The prophet refused the kindness offered him thereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.

 II. What passed between him and the old prophet. 

 1. The old prophet fetched him back by a lie, and gave him
 entertainment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:11-19">ver. 11-19</A>.

 2.  He, for accepting it, in disobedience to the divine command, is
 threatened with death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:20-22">ver. 20-22</A>.

 And, 

 3. The threatening is executed, for he is slain by a lion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:23,24">ver. 23, 24</A>),

 and buried at Beth-el, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:25-32">ver. 25-32</A>.

 4. Jeroboam is hardened in his idolatry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:33,34">ver. 33, 34</A>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto Beth-el: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn
 incense.
 &nbsp; 2 And he cried against the altar in the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 said, O altar, altar, thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; Behold, a child shall
 be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee
 shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense
 upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.
 &nbsp; 3 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This <I>is</I> the sign
 which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and
 the ashes that <I>are</I> upon it shall be poured out.
 &nbsp; 4 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of
 the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Beth-el, that
 he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him.
 And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that
 he could not pull it in again to him.
 &nbsp; 5 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the
 altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by
 the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat
 now the face of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, and pray for me, that my hand
 may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as <I>it
 was</I> before.
 &nbsp; 7 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and
 refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.
 &nbsp; 8 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me
 half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat
 bread nor drink water in this place:
 &nbsp; 9 For so was it charged me by the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, Eat
 no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that
 thou camest.
 &nbsp; 10 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he
 came to Beth-el.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A messenger sent to Jeroboam, to signify to him God's displeasure 
 against his idolatry,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The army of Judah that aimed to ruin him was countermanded, and might
 not draw a sword against him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:24"><I>ch.</I> xii. 24</A>);

 but a prophet of Judah is, instead thereof, sent to reclaim him from
 his evil way, and is sent in time, while he is but dedicating his 
 altar, before his heart is hardened by the deceitfulness of his sin; 
 for God delights not in the death of sinners, but would rather they 
 would turn and live. How bold was the messenger that durst attack the
 king in his pride and interrupt the solemnity he was proud of! Those 
 that go on God's errand must not fear the face of man; they know who 
 will bear them out. How kind was he that sent him to warn Jeroboam of 
 the wrath of God <I>revealed from heaven</I> against his 
 <I>ungodliness</I> and <I>unrighteousness!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The message delivered in God's name, not whispered, but cried with 
 a loud voice, denoting both the prophet's courage, that he was neither 
 afraid nor ashamed to own it, and his earnestness, that he desired to 
 be heard and heeded by all that were present, who were not a few, on 
 this great occasion. It was directed, not to Jeroboam nor to the 
 people, but to the altar, the stones of which would sooner hear and 
 yield than those who were mad upon their idols and deaf to divine 
 calls. Yet, in threatening the altar, God threatened the founder and 
 worshippers, to whom it was as dear as their own souls, and who might 
 conclude, "If God's wrath fasten upon the lifeless guiltless altar, how 
 shall we escape?" That which was foretold concerning the altar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)
 
 was that, in process of time, a prince of the house of David, Josiah by
 name, should pollute this altar by sacrificing the idolatrous priests 
 themselves upon it, and burning the bones of dead men. Let Jeroboam 
 know and be sure, 

 1. That the altar he now consecrated should be desecrated. Idolatrous
 worship will not continue, but the word of the Lord will endure for 
 ever. 

 2. That the <I>priests of the high places</I> he now made should
 themselves be made sacrifices to the justice of God, and the first and 
 only sacrifices upon this altar that would be pleasing to him. If the 
 offering be such as is an abomination to God, it will follow, of 
 course, that the offerers must themselves fall under his wrath, which 
 will abide upon them, since it is not otherwise transmitted. 

 3. That this should be done by a branch <I>of the house of David.</I>
 That family which he and his kingdom had despised and treacherously 
 deserted should recover so much power as to demolish that altar which 
 he thought to establish; so that right and truth should at length 
 prevail, both in civil and sacred matters, notwithstanding the present 
 triumphs of those that were given to change the fear both <I>of God and 
 the king.</I> It was about 356 years ere this prediction was fulfilled, 
 yet it was spoken of as sure and nigh at hand, for a thousand years 
 with God are but as one day. Nothing more contingent and arbitrary than 
 the giving of names to persons, yet Josiah was here named above 300 
 years before he was born. Nothing future is hidden from God. There are 
 <I>names in the book</I> of the divine prescience

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:3">Phil. iv. 3</A>),
 
 names <I>written in heaven.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A sign is given for the confirming of the truth of this 
 prediction, that the altar should be shaken to pieces by an invisible 
 power and the ashes of the sacrifice scattered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 which came to pass immediately, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 This was,

 1. A proof that the prophet was sent of God, <I>who confirmed the word
 with this sign following,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:20">Mark xvi. 20</A>.

 2. A present indication of God's displeasure against these idolatrous
 sacrifices. How could the gift be acceptable when the altar that should 
 sanctify it was an abomination? 

 3. It was a reproach to the people, whose hearts were harder than these
 stones and rent not under the word of the Lord. 

 4. It was a specimen of what should be done to it in the accomplishment
 of this prophecy by Josiah; it was now rent, in token of its being then 
 ruined.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Jeroboam's hand withered, which he stretched out to seize or smite
 the man of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Instead of trembling at the message, as he might well have done, he
 assaulted him that brought it, in defiance of the wrath of which he was 
 warned and contempt of that grace which sent him the warning. <I>Rebuke 
 a sinner</I> and <I>he will hate thee,</I> and do thee a mischief if he 
 can; yet God's prophets must rather expose themselves than betray their 
 trust: he that employs them will protect them, and restrain the wrath 
 of man, as he did Jeroboam's here by withering his hand, so that he 
 could neither hurt the prophet nor draw it in to help himself. When his 
 hand was stretched out to burn incense to his calves it was not 
 withered; but, when it is stretched out against a prophet, he shall 
 have no use of it till he humble himself.  Of all the wickedness of the 
 wicked there is none more provoking to God than their malicious 
 attempts against his prophets, of whom he has said, <I>Touch them not, 
 do them no harm.</I> As this was a punishment of Jeroboam, and 
 answering to the sin, so it was the deliverance of the prophet. God has 
 many ways of disabling the enemies of his church from executing their 
 mischievous purposes. Jeroboam's inability to pull in his hand made him 
 a spectacle to all about him, that they might see and fear. If God, in 
 justice, harden the hearts of sinners, so that the hand they have 
 stretched out in sin they cannot pull in again by repentance, that is a 
 spiritual judgment, represented by this, and much more dreadful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The sudden healing of the hand that was suddenly dried up, upon his 
 submission, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 That word of God which should have touched his conscience humbled him
 not, but this which <I>touched his bone and his flesh</I> brings down 
 his proud spirit. He looks for help now,

 1. Not from his calves, but from God only, from his power and his
 favour. He wounded, and no hand but his can make whole. 

 2. Not by his own sacrifice or incense, but by the prayer and
 intercession of the prophet, whom he had just now threatened and aimed 
 to destroy. The time may come when those that hate the preaching would 
 be glad of the prayers of faithful ministers. "Pray to the Lord thy 
 God," says Jeroboam; "thou hast an interest in him; improve it for me." 
 But observe, He did not desire the prophet to pray that his sin might 
 be pardoned, and his heart changed, only that <I>his hand might be 
 restored;</I> thus Pharaoh would have Moses to pray that God would 
 <I>take away this death</I> only

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+10:17">Exod. x. 17</A>),

 not this <I>sin.</I> The prophet, as became a man of God, renders good
 for evil, upbraids not Jeroboam with his impotent malice, nor triumphs 
 in his submission, but immediately addresses himself to God for him. 
 Those only are entitled to the blessing Christ pronounced on the 
 persecuted that learn of him to pray for their persecutors,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:10,44">Matt. v. 10, 44</A>.

 When the prophet thus honoured God, by showing himself of a forgiving
 spirit, God put this further honour upon him, that at his word he 
 recalled the judgment and by another miracle healed the withered hand, 
 that by the goodness of God Jeroboam might be led to repentance, and, 
 if he were not broken by the judgment, yet might be melted by the 
 mercy. With both he seemed affected for the present, but the 
 impressions wore off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The prophet's refusal of Jeroboam's kind invitation, in which 
 observe, 
 
 1. That God forbade his messenger to eat or drink in Beth-el
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 to show his detestation of their execrable idolatry and apostasy from
 God, and to teach us not to have fellowship with the works of darkness, 
 lest we have infection from them or give encouragement to them. He must 
 not <I>turn back the same way,</I> but deliver his message, as it were, 
 <I>in transitu</I>--<I>as he passes along.</I> He shall not seem to be 
 sent on purpose (they were unworthy such a favour), but as if he only 
 called by the way, his spirit being stirred, like Paul's at Athens, as 
 he <I>passed and saw their devotions.</I> God would, by this command, 
 try his prophet, as he did Ezekiel, whether he would not be 
 <I>rebellious, like that rebellious house,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:8">Ezek. ii. 8</A>.

 2. That Jeroboam was so affected with the cure of his hand that though
 we read not of his thanksgivings to God for the mercy, or of his 
 sending an offering to the altar at Jerusalem in acknowledgment of it, 
 yet he was willing to express his gratitude to the prophet and pay him 
 for his prayers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Favours to the body will make even graceless men seem grateful to good
 ministers.

 3. That the prophet, though hungry and weary, and perhaps poor, in
 obedience to the divine command refused both the entertainment and the 
 reward proffered him. He might have supposed his acceptance of it would 
 give him an opportunity of discoursing further with the king, in order 
 to his effectual reformation, now that he was convinced; yet he will 
 not think himself wiser than God, but, like a faithful careful 
 messenger, hastens home when he has done his errand. Those have little 
 learned the lessons of self-denial that cannot forbear one forbidden 
 meal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and his sons came
 and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day
 in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they
 told also to their father.
 &nbsp; 12 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his
 sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from
 Judah.
 &nbsp; 13 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they
 saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon,
 &nbsp; 14 And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under
 an oak: and he said unto him, <I>Art</I> thou the man of God that
 camest from Judah? And he said, I <I>am.</I>
 &nbsp; 15 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
 &nbsp; 16 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with
 thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this
 place:
 &nbsp; 17 For it was said to me by the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Thou shalt
 eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the
 way that thou camest.
 &nbsp; 18 He said unto him, I <I>am</I> a prophet also as thou <I>art;</I> and
 an angel spake unto me by the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, Bring him
 back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink
 water. <I>But</I> he lied unto him.
 &nbsp; 19 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house,
 and drank water.
 &nbsp; 20 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto the prophet that brought him back:
 &nbsp; 21 And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah,
 saying, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the
 mouth of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and hast not kept the commandment which the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God commanded thee,
 &nbsp; 22 But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the
 place, of the which <I>the LORD</I> did say to thee, Eat no bread, and
 drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of
 thy fathers.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The man of God had honestly and resolutely refused the king's 
 invitation, though he promised him a reward; yet he was over-persuaded 
 by an old prophet to come back with him, and dine in Beth-el, contrary 
 to the command given him. Here we find how dearly his dinner cost him. 
 Observe with wonder,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The old prophet's wickedness. I cannot but call him a false prophet 
 and a bad man, it being much easier to believe that from one of such a 
 bad character should be extorted a confirmation of what the man of God 
 said (as we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>)

 than that a true prophet, and a good man, should tell such a deliberate
 lie as he did, and father it upon God.  <I>A good tree could never 
 bring forth such corrupt fruit.</I> Perhaps he was trained up among the 
 sons of the prophets, in one of Samuel's colleges not far off, whence 
 he retained the name of a prophet, but, growing worldly and profane, 
 the spirit of prophecy had departed from him. If he had been a good 
 prophet he would have reproved Jeroboam's idolatry, and not have 
 suffered his sons to attend his altars, as, it should seem, they did. 
 Now, 

 1. Whether he had any good design in fetching back the man of God is
 not certain. One may hope that he did it in compassion to him, 
 concluding he wanted refreshment, and out of a desire to be better 
 acquainted with him and more fully to understand his errand than he 
 could from the report of his sons; yet his sons having told him all 
 that passed, and particularly that the prophet was forbidden to eat or 
 drink there, which he had openly told Jeroboam, I suppose it was done 
 with a bad design, to draw him into a snare, and so to expose him; for 
 false prophets have ever been the worst enemies to the true prophets, 
 usually aiming to destroy them, but sometimes, as here, to debauch them 
 and draw them from their duty. Thus they <I>gave the Nazarites wine to 
 drink</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:12">Amos ii. 12</A>),

 that they might glory in their fall. But, 

 2. It is certain that he took a very bad method to bring him back. When
 the man of God had told him, "I may not, and therefore I will not, 
 return to eat bread with thee" (his resolutions concurring with the 
 divine command,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>),

 he wickedly pretended that he had an order from heaven to fetch him
 back. He imposed upon him by asserting his quondam character as a 
 prophet: <I>I am a prophet also as thou art;</I> he pretended he had a 
 vision of an angel that sent him on this errand. But it was all a lie; 
 it was a banter upon prophecy, and profane in the highest degree. When 
 this old prophet is spoken of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:18">2 Kings xxiii. 18</A>)

 he is called <I>the prophet that came out of Samaria,</I> whereas there
 was no such place as Samaria till long after,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:24"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 24</A>.
 
 Therefore I take it he is so called there, though he was of Beth-el,
 because he was like those who were afterwards <I>the prophets of 
 Samaria,</I> who <I>caused God's people Israel to err,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:13">Jer. xxiii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The good prophet's weakness, in suffering himself to be thus 
 imposed upon: <I>He went back with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He that had resolution enough to refuse the invitation of the king, who
 promised him a reward, could not resist the insinuations of one that 
 pretended to be a prophet. God's people are more in danger of being 
 drawn from their duty by the plausible pretences of divinity and 
 sanctity than by external inducements; we have therefore need to 
 <I>beware of false prophets,</I> and not <I>believe every 
 spirit.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The proceedings of divine justice hereupon; and here we may well 
 wonder that the wicked prophet, who told the lie and did the mischief, 
 went unpunished, while the holy man of God, that was drawn by him into 
 sin, was suddenly and severely punished for it. What shall we make of 
 this! The judgments of God are unfathomable. <I>The deceived and the 
 deceiver are his,</I> and he <I>giveth not account of any of his 
 matters.</I> Certainly there must be a judgment to come, when these 
 things will be called over again, and when those that sinned most and 
 suffered least, in this world, will receive according to their works. 
 
 1. The message delivered to the man of God was strange. His crime is
 recited, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 It was, in one word, disobedience to an express command. Judgment is
 given upon it: <I>Thy carcase shall not come to the sepulchre of thy 
 fathers,</I> that is, "Thou shalt never reach thy own house, but shalt 
 be a carcase quickly, nor shall thy dead body be brought to <I>the 
 place of thy fathers' sepulchres,</I> to be interred." 

 2. Yet it was more strange that the old prophet himself should be the
 messenger. Of this we can give no account but that God would have it 
 so, as he spoke to Balaam by his ass and read Saul his doom by the 
 devil in Samuel's likeness. We may think God designed hereby,

 (1.) To startle the lying prophet, and make him sensible of his sin. 
 The message could not but affect him the more when he himself had the 
 delivering of it, and had so strong an impression made upon his spirit 
 by it that he cried out, as one in an agony, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 He had reason to think, if he must die for his disobedience in a small
 matter who sinned by surprise, of how much sorer punishment he should 
 be thought worthy who had belied an angel of God and cheated a man of 
 God by a deliberate forgery. <I>If this were done to the green tree, 
 what shall be done to the dry?</I> Perhaps it had a good effect upon 
 him.  Those who preach God's wrath to others have hard hearts indeed if 
 they fear it not themselves.

 (2.) To put the greater mortification upon the prophet that was 
 deceived, and to show what those must expect who hearken to the great 
 deceiver. Those that yield to him as a tempter will be terrified by him 
 as a tormentor; whom he now fawns upon he will afterwards fly upon, and 
 whom he now draws into sin he will do what he can to drive to 
 despair.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he
 had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, <I>to wit,</I> for the
 prophet whom he had brought back.
 &nbsp; 24 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew
 him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by
 it, the lion also stood by the carcase.
 &nbsp; 25 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the
 way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told
 <I>it</I> in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
 &nbsp; 26 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way
 heard <I>thereof,</I> he said, It <I>is</I> the man of God, who was
 disobedient unto the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: therefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him,
 according to the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which he spake unto him.
 &nbsp; 27 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And
 they saddled <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 28 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the
 ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten
 the carcase, nor torn the ass.
 &nbsp; 29 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and
 laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet
 came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.
 &nbsp; 30 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned
 over him, <I>saying,</I> Alas, my brother!
 &nbsp; 31 And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake
 to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the
 sepulchre wherein the man of God <I>is</I> buried; lay my bones beside
 his bones:
 &nbsp; 32 For the saying which he cried by the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the
 high places which <I>are</I> in the cities of Samaria, shall surely
 come to pass.
 &nbsp; 33 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way,
 but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high
 places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became <I>one</I>
 of the priests of the high places.
 &nbsp; 34 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even
 to cut <I>it</I> off, and to destroy <I>it</I> from off the face of the
 earth.

 Here is, 

 I. The death of the deceived disobedient prophet. The old prophet that
 had deluded him, as if he would make him some amends for the wrong he 
 had done him or help to prevent the mischief threatened him, furnished 
 him with an ass to ride home on; but by the way a lion set upon him, 
 and killed him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 He did but return back to refresh himself when he was hungry, and
 behold he must die for it; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:43">1 Sam. xiv. 43</A>.

 But we must consider, 

 1. That his offence was great, and it would by no means justify him
 that he was drawn into it by a lie; he could not be so certain of the 
 countermand sent by another as he was of the command given to himself, 
 nor had he any ground to think that the command would be recalled, when 
 the reason of it remained in force, which was that he might testify his 
 detestation of the wickedness of that place. He had great reason to 
 suspect the honesty of this old prophet, who did not himself bear his 
 testimony, nor did God think fit to make use of him as a witness 
 against the idolatry of the city he lived in. However, he should have 
 taken time to beg direction from God, and not have complied so soon. 
 Did he think this old prophet's house safer to eat in than other houses 
 at Beth-el, when God had forbidden him to eat in any?  That was to 
 refine upon the command, and make himself wiser than God.  Did he think 
 to excuse himself that he was hungry? Had he never read that <I>man 
 lives not by bread alone?</I> 

 2.  That his death was for the glory of God; for by this it appeared,

 (1.) That nothing is more provoking to him than disobedience to an 
 express command, though in a small matter, which makes his proceedings 
 against our first parents, for eating the forbidden fruit, the easier 
 to be accounted for. 

 (2.) That God is displeased at the sins of his own people, and no man 
 shall be protected in disobedience by the sanctity of his profession, 
 the dignity of his office, his nearness to God, or any good services he 
 has done for him. Perhaps God by this intended, in a way of righteous 
 judgment, to harden Jeroboam's heart, since he was not reformed by the 
 withering of his hand; for he would be apt to make a bad use of it, and 
 to say that the prophet was well enough served for meddling with his 
 altar, he had better have staid at home; any, he would say that 
 Providence had punished him for his insolence, and the lion had done 
 that which his withered hand might not do. However, by this God 
 intended to warn all those whom he employs strictly to observe their 
 orders, at their peril.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The wonderful preservation of his dead body, which was a token of 
 God's mercy remembered in the midst of wrath. The lion that gently 
 strangled him, or tore him, did not devour his dead body, nor so much 
 as tear the ass, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:24-26"><I>v.</I> 24, 25, 26</A>.

 Nay, what was more, he did not set upon the travellers that passed by
 and saw it, nor upon the old prophet (who had reason enough to fear it) 
 when he came to take up the corpse. His commission was to kill the 
 prophet; hitherto he should go, but no further. Thus God showed that, 
 though he was angry with him, his anger was turned away, and the 
 punishment went <I>no further than death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The care which the old prophet took of his burial. When he heard 
 of this unusual accident, he concluded it was <I>the man of God, who 
 was disobedient</I> to his Master (and whose fault was that?), 
 <I>therefore the Lord has delivered him to the lion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 It would well have become him to ask why the lion was not sent against
 him and his house, rather than against the good man whom he had 
 cheated. He <I>took up the corpse,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 If there by any truth in the vulgar opinion, surely the corpse bled
 afresh when he touched it, for he was in effect the murderer, and it 
 was but a poor reparation for the injury to inter the dead body. 
 Perhaps when he cheated him into his ruin he intended to laugh at him; 
 yet now his conscience so far relents that he weeps over him, and, like 
 Joab at Abner's funeral, is compelled to be a mourner for him whom he 
 had been the death of. They said, <I>Alas! my brother,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 The case was indeed very lamentable that so good a man, a prophet so
 faithful, and so bold in God's cause, should, for one offence, die as a 
 criminal, while an old lying prophet lives at ease and an idolatrous 
 prince in pomp and power. <I>Thy way, O God! is in the sea, and thy 
 path in the great waters.</I> We cannot judge of men by their 
 sufferings, nor of sins by their present punishments; with some the 
 flesh is destroyed that the spirit may be saved, while with others the 
 flesh is pampered that the soul may ripen for hell.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The charge which the old prophet gave his sons concerning his own 
 burial, that they should be sure to bury him in the same grave where 
 the man of God was buried 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 "<I>Lay my bones beside his bones,</I> close by them, as near as may
 be, so that my dust may mingle with his." Though he was a lying 
 prophet, yet he desired to <I>die the death of a</I> true prophet. 
 "Gather not my soul with the sinners of Beth-el, but with the man of 
 God." The reason he gives is because <I>what he cried against the altar 
 of Beth-el,</I> that men's bones should be burnt upon it, <I>shall 
 surely come to pass,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 
 Thus,

 1. He ratifies the prediction, that <I>out of the mouth of two
 witnesses</I> (and one of them such a one as St. Paul quotes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:12">Titus i. 12</A>,

 <I>one of themselves, even a prophet of their own</I>) the <I>word
 might be established,</I> if possible to convince and reclaim Jeroboam.

 2. He does honour to the deceased prophet, as one whose <I>word</I>
 would not fall to the ground, though <I>he</I> did.  Ministers die, die 
 prematurely it may be; but the word of the Lord endures for ever, and 
 does not die with them. 

 3. He consults his own interest. It was foretold that men's bones
 should be burnt upon Jeroboam's altar: "Lay mine (says he) close to 
 his, and then they will not be disturbed;" and it was, accordingly, 
 their security, as we find,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:18">2 Kings xxiii. 18</A>.

 Sleeping and waking, living and dying, it is safe being in good
 company. No mention is made here of the inscription on the prophet's 
 tomb; but it is spoken of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:17">2 Kings xxiii. 17</A>,

 where Josiah asks, <I>What title is that?</I> and is told, <I>It is the
 sepulchre of the man of God that came from Judah, who proclaimed these 
 things which thou hast done;</I> so that the epitaph upon the prophet's 
 grave preserved the remembrance of his prophecy, and was a standing 
 testimony against the idolatries of Beth-el, which it would not have 
 been so remarkably if he had died and been buried elsewhere. The cities 
 of Israel are here called <I>cities of Samaria,</I> though that name 
 was not yet known; for, however the old prophet spoke, the inspired 
 historian wrote in the language of his own time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The obstinacy of Jeroboam in his idolatry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>He returned not from his evil way;</I> some hand was found that
 durst repair the altar God had rent, and then Jeroboam offered 
 sacrifice on it again, and the more boldly because the prophet who 
 disturbed him before was in his grave

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10">Rev. xi. 10</A>)

 and because the prophecy was for a great while to come. Various methods
 had been used to reclaim him, but neither threats nor signs, neither 
 judgments nor mercies, wrought upon him, so strangely was he wedded to 
 his calves. He did not reform, no, not his priesthood, but whoever 
 would, he filled his hand, and made him priest, though ever so 
 illiterate or immoral, and of what tribe soever; <I>and this became 
 sin,</I> that is, a snare first, and then a ruin, to Jeroboam's house, 
 to <I>cut if off,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Note, The diminution, disquiet, and desolation of families, are the
 fruit of sin; he promised himself that the calves would secure the 
 crown to his family, but it proved they lost it, and sunk his family.  
 Those betray themselves that think by any sin to support 
 themselves.</P>
