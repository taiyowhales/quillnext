 We have here a further account of the good reign of Jehoshaphat, 

 I. His return in peace to Jerusalem,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. The reproof given him for his league with Ahab, and his acting in
 conjunction with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 III. The great care he took thereupon to reform his kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:4">ver. 4</A>.
 
 IV.  The instructions he gave to his judges, both those in the country
 towns that kept the inferior courts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>),

 and those in Jerusalem that sat in the supreme judicature of the
 kingdom,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in
 peace to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 2  And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and
 said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and
 love them that hate the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>? therefore <I>is</I> wrath upon thee from
 before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 3  Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that
 thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast
 prepared thine heart to seek God.
 &nbsp; 4  And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again
 through the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought
 them back unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of their fathers.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The great favour God showed to Jehoshaphat,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In bringing him back in safety from his dangerous expedition with 
 Ahab, which had like to have cost him dearly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>He returned to his house in peace.</I> Notice is taken of this to
 intimate,

 (1.) That he fared better than he had expected. He had been in imminent
 peril, and yet came home in peace. Whenever we return in peace to our 
 houses we ought to acknowledge God's providence in preserving our going 
 out and our coming in. But, if we have been kept through more than 
 ordinary dangers, we are in a special manner bound to be thankful. 
 There was but a step perhaps between us and death, and yet we are 
 alive.

 (2.) That he fared better than he deserved. He was out of the way of
 his duty, had been out upon an expedition which he could not well 
 account for to God and his conscience, and yet he returned in peace; 
 for God is not extreme to mark what we do amiss, nor does he withdraw 
 his protection every time we forfeit it.

 (3.) That he fared better than Ahab king of Israel did, who was brought
 home slain. Though Jehoshaphat had said to Ahab, <I>I am as thou 
 art,</I> God distinguished him; for he knows and owns <I>the way of the 
 righteous,</I> but <I>the way of the ungodly shall perish.</I> 
 Distinguishing mercies are very obliging. Here were two kings in the
 field together, <I>one taken and the other left,</I> one brought home 
 in blood, the other in peace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In sending him a reproof for his affinity with Ahab. It is a great 
 mercy to be made sensible of our faults, and to be told in time wherein 
 we have erred, that we may repent and amend the error before it be too 
 late. The prophet by whom the reproof is sent is Jehu the son of 
 Hanani. The father was an eminent prophet in the last reign, as 
 appeared by Asa's putting him in the stocks for his plain dealing; yet 
 the son was not afraid to reprove another king. Paul would have his son 
 Timothy not only discouraged, but animated by his sufferings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:11,14">2 Tim. iii. 11, 14</A>.

 (1.) The prophet told him plainly that he had done very ill in joining
 with Ahab: "<I>Shouldst thou,</I> a godly man, <I>help the ungodly,</I> 
 give them a hand of fellowship, and lend them a hand of assistance?" 
 Or, "<I>Shouldst thou love those that hate the Lord;</I> wilt thou lay 
 those in thy bosom whom God beholds afar off?" It is the black 
 character of wicked people that they are <I>haters of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:30">Rom. i. 30</A>.

 Idolaters are so reputed in the second commandment; and therefore it is
 not for those that love God to take delight in them or contract an 
 intimacy with them. <I>Do I not hate those,</I> says David, <I>that 
 hate thee?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:11,21">Ps. cxxxix. 21, 11</A>.

 Those whom the grace of God has dignified ought not to debase
 themselves. Let God's people be of God's mind.

 (2.) That God was displeased with him for doing this: "<I>There is
 wrath upon thee from before the Lord,</I> and thou must, by repentance, 
 make thy peace with him, or it will be the worse for thee." He did so, 
 and God's anger was turned away. Yet his trouble, as recorded in the 
 next chapter, was a rebuke to him for meddling with strife that 
 belonged not to him. If he be so fond of war, he shall have enough of 
 it. And the great mischief which his seed after him fell into by the 
 house of Ahab was the just punishment of his affinity with that house.

 (3.) Yet he took notice of that which was praiseworthy, as it is proper
 for us to do when we give a reproof

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>There are good things found in thee;</I> and therefore, though God
 be displeased with thee, he does not, he will not, cast thee off." His 
 abolishing idolatry with a heart fixed for God and engaged to seek him 
 was a good thing, which God accepted and would have him go on with, 
 notwithstanding the displeasure he had now incurred.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The return of duty which Jehoshaphat made to God for this favour. 
 he took the reproof well, was not wroth with the seer as his father 
 was, but submitted. <I>Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a 
 kindness.</I> See what effect the reproof had upon him. 

 1. He <I>dwelt at Jerusalem</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 minded his own business at home, and would not expose himself by paying
 any more such visits to Ahab. <I>Rebuke a wise man, and he will be yet 
 wiser,</I> and will take warning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:8,9">Prov. ix. 8, 9</A>.

 2. To atone (as I may say) for the visit he had paid to Ahab, he made a
 pious profitable visitation of his own kingdom: He <I>went out through 
 the people</I> in his own person from Beersheba in the south to Mount 
 Ephraim in the north, and <I>brought them back to the Lord God of their 
 fathers,</I> that is, did all he could towards recovering them. 

 (1.) By what the prophet said he perceived that his former attempts for
 reformation were well pleasing to God, and therefore he revived them, 
 and did what was then left undone.  It is good when commendations thus 
 quicken us to our duty, and when the more we are praised for doing well 
 the more vigorous we are in well-doing.

 (2.) Perhaps he found that his late affinity with the idolatrous house
 of Ahab and kingdom of Israel had had a bad influence upon his own 
 kingdom. Many, we may suppose, were emboldened to revolt to idolatry 
 when they saw even their reforming king so intimate with idolaters; and 
 therefore he thought himself doubly obliged to do all he could to 
 restore them. If we truly repent of our sin, we shall do our utmost to 
 repair the damage we have any way done by it to religion or the souls 
 of others. We are particularly concerned to recover those that have 
 fallen into sin, or been hardened in it, by our example.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced
 cities of Judah, city by city,
 &nbsp; 6  And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge
 not for man, but for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, who <I>is</I> with you in the judgment.
 &nbsp; 7  Wherefore now let the fear of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> be upon you; take heed
 and do <I>it:</I> for <I>there is</I> no iniquity with the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God,
 nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.
 &nbsp; 8  Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and
 <I>of</I> the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for
 the judgment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and for controversies, when they
 returned to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 9  And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.
 &nbsp; 10  And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren
 that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law
 and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them
 that they trespass not against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and <I>so</I> wrath come upon
 you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.
 &nbsp; 11  And, behold, Amariah the chief priest <I>is</I> over you in all
 matters of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler
 of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the
 Levites <I>shall be</I> officers before you. Deal courageously, and
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall be with the good.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jehoshaphat, having done what he could to make his people good, is here 
 providing, if possible, to keep them so by the influence of a settled 
 magistracy. He had sent preachers among them, to instruct them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:7-9"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 7-9</A>),

 and that provision did well; but now he saw it further requisite to
 send judges among them, to see the laws put in execution, and to be a 
 terror to evil-doers. It is probable that there were judges up and down 
 the country before, but either they neglected their business or the 
 people slighted them, so that the end of the institution was not 
 answered; and therefore it was necessary it should be new-modelled, new 
 men employed, and a new charge given them. That is it which is here 
 done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He erected inferior courts of justice in the several cities of the 
 kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The judges of these courts were to keep the people in the worship of
 God, to punish the violations of the law, and to decide controversies 
 between man and man. Here is the charge he gave them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 in which we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The means he prescribes to them for the keeping of them closely to 
 their duty; and these are two:--

 (1.) Great caution and circumspection: <I>Take heed what you do,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 And again, "<I>Take heed and do it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Mind your business; take heed of making any mistakes; be afraid of
 misunderstanding any point of law, or the matter of fact." Judges, of 
 all men, have need to be cautious, because so much depends upon the 
 correctness of their judgment.

 (2.) Great piety and religion: "<I>Let the fear of God be upon you,</I>
 and that will be a restraint upon you to keep you from doing wrong

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:15,Ge+42:18">Neh. v. 15; Gen. xlii. 18</A>)

 and an engagement to you to be active in doing the duty of your place."
 Let destruction from God be a terror to them, as Job speaks

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:23">Job xxxi. 23</A>),
 
 and then they will be a terror to none but evil-doers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The motives he would have them consider, to engage them to 
 faithfulness. These are three, all taken from God:--

 (1.) That from him they had their commission; his ministers they were.
 The powers that be are ordained by him and for him: "<I>You judge not 
 for man, but for the Lord;</I> your business is to glorify him, and 
 serve the interests of his kingdom among men."

 (2.) That his eye was upon them: "He is <I>with you in the
 judgment,</I> to take notice what you do and call you to an account if 
 you do amiss."

 (3.) That he is the great example of justice to all magistrates:
 <I>There is no iniquity with him,</I> no bribery, nor respect of 
 persons. Magistrates are called gods, and therefore must endeavour to 
 resemble him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He erected a supreme court at Jerusalem, which was advised with, 
 and appealed to, in all the difficult causes that occurred in the 
 inferior courts, and which gave judgment upon demurrers (to speak in 
 the language of our own law), special verdicts, and writs of error. 
 This court sat in Jerusalem; for <I>there were set the thrones of 
 judgment:</I> there they would be under the inspection of the king 
 himself.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The causes cognizable in this court; and they were of two kinds, as 
 with us:--

 (1.) Pleas of the crown, called here <I>the judgment of the Lord,</I>
 because the law of God was the law of the realm. All criminals were 
 charged with the breach of some part of his law and were said to offend 
 against his peace, his crown and dignity.

 (2.) Common pleas, between party and party, called here
 <I>controversies</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)
 
 and <I>causes of their brethren</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 differences <I>between blood and blood</I> (this refers to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:8">Deut. xvii. 8</A>),

 between the blood of the person slain and the blood of the man-slayer.
 Since the revolt of the ten tribes all the cities of refuge, except 
 Hebron, belonged to the kingdom of Israel; and therefore, we may 
 suppose, the courts of the temple, or the horns of the altar, were 
 chiefly used as sanctuaries in that case, and hence the trial of 
 homicides was reserved for the court at Jerusalem. If the inferior 
 judges did not agree about the sense of any law or commandment, any 
 statute or judgment, this court must determine the controversy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The judges of this court were some of <I>the Levites and priests</I> 
 that were most learned in the law, eminent for wisdom, and of approved 
 integrity, and some of <I>the chief of the fathers of Israel, peers of 
 the realm,</I> as I may call them, or persons of age and experience, 
 that had been men of business, who would be the most competent judges 
 of matters of fact, as the priests and Levites were of the sense of the 
 law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The two chiefs, or presidents, of this court. Amariah, the high 
 priest, was to preside in ecclesiastical causes, to direct the court 
 and be the mouth of it, or perhaps to be last consulted in cases which 
 the judges themselves doubted of. Zebadiah, the prime-minister of that 
 state, was to preside in all civil causes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Thus there are diversities of gifts and operations, but all from the
 same Spirit, and for the good of the body. Some best understand <I>the 
 matters of the Lord,</I> others <I>the king's matters;</I> neither can 
 say to the other, <I>I have no need of thee,</I> for God's Israel has 
 need of both; and, as every one has received the gift, so let him 
 minister the same. Blessed be God both for magistrates and ministers, 
 scribes and statesmen, men of books and men of business.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The inferior officers of the court. "Some of <I>the Levites</I> 
 (such as had not abilities to qualify them for judges) <I>shall be 
 officers before you,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They were to bring causes into the court, and to see the sentence of
 the judges executed. And these hands and feet were as necessary in 
 their places as the eyes and heads (the judges) in theirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The charge which the king gave them. 

 (1.) They must see to it that they acted from a good principle; they
 must do all in the <I>fear of the Lord,</I> setting him always before 
 them, and then they would act faithfully, conscientiously, and <I>with 
 a perfect upright heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 (2.) They must make it their great and constant care to prevent sin,
 <I>to warn the people that they trespass not against the Lord,</I> 
 inspire them with a dread of sin, not only as hurtful to themselves and 
 the public peace, but as an offence to God, and that which would bring 
 wrath upon the people if they committed it and upon the magistrates if 
 they did not punish it. "<I>This do, and you shall not trespass;</I>" 
 this implies that those who have power in their hands contract the 
 guilt of sin themselves if they do not use their power for the 
 preventing and restraining of sin in others. "You trespass if you do 
 not keep them from trespassing."

 (3.) They must act with resolution.  "Deal courageously, and fear not
 the face of man; be bold and daring in the discharge of your duty, and, 
 whoever is against you, God will protect you: <I>The Lord shall be with 
 the good.</I>" Wherever he finds a good man, a good magistrate, he will 
 be found a good God.</P>
