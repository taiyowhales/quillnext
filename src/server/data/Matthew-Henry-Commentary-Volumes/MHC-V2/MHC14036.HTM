 We have here,

 I. A short but sad account of the utter ruin of Judah and Jerusalem
 within a few years after Josiah's death.

 1. The history of it in the unhappy reigns of Jehoahaz for three months

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>),

 Jehoiakim

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:5-8">ver. 5-8</A>)

 for eleven years, Jehoiach in three months

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>),

 and Zedekiah eleven years,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:11">ver. 11</A>.

 Additions were made to the national guilt, and advances towards the 
 national destruction, in each of those reigns. The destruction was, at 
 length, completed in the slaughter of multitudes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:17">ver.  17</A>),

 the plundering and burning of the temple and all the palaces, the 
 desolation of the city 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:18,19">ver. 18, 19</A>),

 and the captivity of the people that remained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:20">ver. 20</A>.

 2.  Some remarks upon it--that herein sin was punished, Zedekiah's 
 wickedness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:12,13">ver. 12, 13</A>),
 
 the idolatry the people were guilty of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:14">ver. 14</A>),
 
 and their abuse of God's prophets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>.

 The word of God was herein fulfilled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:21">ver. 21</A>.

 II.  The dawning of the day of their deliverance in Cyrus's
 proclamation,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah,
 and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 2  Jehoahaz <I>was</I> twenty and three years old when he began to
 reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 3  And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and
 condemned the land in a hundred talents of silver and a talent
 of gold.
 &nbsp; 4  And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over
 Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho
 took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
 &nbsp; 5  Jehoiakim <I>was</I> twenty and five years old when he began to
 reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did <I>that
 which was</I> evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God.
 &nbsp; 6  Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound
 him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.
 &nbsp; 7  Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.
 &nbsp; 8  Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations
 which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they <I>are</I>
 written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and
 Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
 &nbsp; 9  Jehoiachin <I>was</I> eight years old when he began to reign, and
 he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did
 <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 10  And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and
 brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and
 Jerusalem.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The destruction of Judah and Jerusalem is here coming on by degrees. 
 God so ordered it to show that he has no pleasure in the ruin of 
 sinners, but had rather they would turn and live, and therefore gives 
 them both time and inducement to repent and waits to be gracious. The 
 history of these reigns was more largely recorded in the last three 
 chapters of the second of <I>Kings.</I> 

 1. Jehoahaz was set up by the people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 but in one quarter of a year was deposed by Pharaoh-necho, and carried
 a prisoner to Egypt, and the land fined for setting him up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>.

 Of this young prince we hear no more. Had he trodden in the steps of
 his father's piety he might have reigned long and prospered; but we are 
 told in the <I>Kings</I> that <I>he did evil in the sight of the 
 Lord,</I> and therefore his triumphing was short and his joy but for a 
 moment.

 2. Jehoiakim was set up by the king of Egypt, an old enemy to their 
 land, gave what king he pleased to the kingdom and what name he pleased 
 to the king! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He made Eliakim king, and called him <I>Jehoiakim,</I> in token of his
 authority over him. <I>Jehoiakim did that which was evil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 nay, we read of the <I>abominations which he did</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 he was very wild and wicked. Idolatries generally go under the name of
 abominations. We hear no more of the king of Egypt, but the king of 
 Babylon came up against him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 seized him, and bound him with a design to carry him to Babylon; but,
 it seems, he either changed his mind, and suffered him to reign as his 
 vassal, or death released the prisoner before he was carried away. 
 However the best and most valuable vessels of the temple were now 
 carried away and made use of in Nebuchadnezzar's temple in Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 for, we may suppose, no temple in the world was so richly furnished as
 that of Jerusalem. The sin of Judah was that they had brought the idols 
 of the heathen into God's temple; and now their punishment was that the 
 vessels of the temple were carried away to the service of the gods of 
 the nations. If men will profane God's institutions by their sins, it 
 is just with God to suffer them to be profaned by their enemies. These 
 were the vessels which the false prophets flattered the people with 
 hopes of the return of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:16">Jer. xxvii. 16</A>.

 But Jeremiah told them that the rest should go after them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+27:21,22">Jer. xxvii. 21, 22</A>),

 and they did so. But, as the carrying away of these vessels to Babylon
 began the calamity of Jerusalem, so Belshazzar's daring profanation of 
 them there filled the measure of the iniquity of Babylon; for, when he 
 drank wine in them to the honour of his gods, the handwriting on the 
 wall presented him with his doom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:3-6">Dan. v. 3</A>,

 &c. In the reference to the book of the <I>Kings</I> concerning this
 Jehoiakim mention is made of <I>that which was found in him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 which seems to be meant of the treachery that was found in him towards
 the king of Babylon; but some of the Jewish writers understand it of 
 certain private marks or signatures found in his dead body, in honour 
 of his idol, such cuttings as God had forbidden, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:28">Lev. xix. 28</A>.

 3.  Jehoiachin, or Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, attempted to reign
 in his stead, and reigned long enough to show his evil inclination; 
 but, after three months and ten days, the king of Babylon sent and 
 fetched him away captive, with more of the goodly vessels of the 
 temple. He is here said to be eight years old, but in <I>Kings</I> he 
 is said to be eighteen when he began to reign, so that this seems to be 
 a mistake of the transcriber, unless we suppose that his father took 
 him at eight years old to join with him in the government, as some 
 think.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Zedekiah <I>was</I> one and twenty years old when he began to
 reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 12  And he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 his God, <I>and</I> humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet
 <I>speaking</I> from the mouth of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 13  And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had
 made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened
 his heart from turning unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel.
 &nbsp; 14  Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people,
 transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen;
 and polluted the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> which he had hallowed in
 Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 15  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of their fathers sent to them by his
 messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had
 compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:
 &nbsp; 16  But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his
 words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 arose against his people, till <I>there was</I> no remedy.
 &nbsp; 17  Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who
 slew their young men with the sword in the house of their
 sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old
 man, or him that stooped for age: he gave <I>them</I> all into his
 hand.
 &nbsp; 18  And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small,
 and the treasures of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the treasures of
 the king, and of his princes; all <I>these</I> he brought to Babylon.
 &nbsp; 19  And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of
 Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and
 destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.
 &nbsp; 20  And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to
 Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the
 reign of the kingdom of Persia:
 &nbsp; 21  To fulfil the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by the mouth of Jeremiah,
 until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: <I>for</I> as long as she lay
 desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the destruction of the kingdom of Judah and 
 the city of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. Abraham, God's friend, was 
 called out of that country, from Ur of the Chaldees, when God took him 
 into covenant and communion with himself; and now his degenerate seed 
 were carried into that country again, to signify that they had 
 forfeited all that kindness wherewith they had been regarded for the 
 father's sake, and the benefit of that covenant into which he was 
 called; all was now undone again. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sins that brought this desolation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Zedekiah, the king in whose days it came, brought it upon himself by 
 his own folly; for he conducted himself very ill both towards God and 
 towards the king of Babylon. 

 (1.) If he had but made God his friend, that would have prevented the
 ruin.  Jeremiah brought him messages from God, which, if he had given 
 due regard to them, might have secured a lengthening of his 
 tranquillity; but it is here charged upon him that he <I>humbled not 
 himself before Jeremiah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It was expected that this mighty prince, high as he was, should humble
 himself before a poor prophet, when <I>he spoke from the mouth of the 
 Lord,</I> should submit to his admonitions and be amended by them, to 
 his counsels and be ruled by them, should lay himself under the 
 commanding power of the word of God in his mouth; and, because he would 
 not thus make himself a servant to God, he was made a slave to his 
 enemies. God will find some way or other to humble those that will not 
 humble themselves. Jeremiah, as a prophet, was set <I>over the nations 
 and kingdoms</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:10">Jer. i. 10</A>),

 and, as mean a figure as he made, whoever would not humble themselves
 before him found that it was at their peril. 

 (2.) If he had but been true to his covenant with the king of Babylon,
 that would have prevented his ruin; but he <I>rebelled against him,</I> 
 though he had sworn to be his faithful tributary, and perfidiously 
 violated his engagements to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 It was this that provoked the king of Babylon to deal so severely with
 him as he did. All nations looked upon an oath as a sacred thing, and 
 on those that durst break through the obligations of it as the worst of 
 men, abandoned of God and to be abhorred by all mankind. If therefore 
 Zedekiah falsify his oath, <I>when, lo, he has given his hand,</I> he 
 <I>shall not escape,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:18">Ezek. xvii. 18</A>.

 Though Nebuchadnezzar was a heathen, an enemy, yet if, having sworn to
 him, he be false to him, he shall know <I>there is a God to whom 
 vengeance belongs.</I> The thing that ruined Zedekiah was not only that 
 he <I>turned not to the Lord God of Israel,</I> but that he 
 <I>stiffened his neck and hardened his heart from turning to him,</I> 
 that is, he as obstinately resolved not to return to him, would not lay 
 his neck under God's yoke nor his heart under the impressions of his 
 word, and so, in effect, he <I>would not be healed,</I> he <I>would not 
 live.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The great sin that brought this destruction was idolatry. The 
 priests and people went after <I>the abominations of the heathen,</I> 
 forsook the pure worship of God for the lewd and filthy rites of the 
 Pagan superstition, and so <I>polluted the house of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The priests, the chief of the priests, who should have opposed
 idolatry, were ring-leaders in it. That place is not far from ruin in 
 which religion is already ruined.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The great aggravation of their sin, and that which filled the 
 measure of it, was the abuse they gave to God's prophets, who were sent 
 to call them to repentance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 Here we have,

 (1.) God's tender compassion towards them in sending prophets to them.
 Because he was the <I>God of their fathers,</I> in covenant with them, 
 and whom they worshipped (though this degenerate race forsook him), 
 therefore he <I>sent to them by his messengers,</I> to convince them of 
 their sin and warn them of the ruin they would bring upon themselves by 
 it, <I>rising up betimes and sending,</I> which denotes not only that 
 he did it with the greatest care and concern imaginable, as men rise 
 betimes to set their servants to work when their heart is upon their 
 business, but that, upon their first deviation from God to idols, if 
 they took but one step that way, God immediately sent to them by his 
 messengers to reprove them for it. He gave them early timely notice 
 both of their duty and danger. Let this quicken us to seek God early, 
 that he rises betimes to send to us. The prophets that were sent rose 
 betimes to speak to them, were diligent and faithful in their office, 
 lost no time, slipped no opportunity of dealing with them; and 
 therefore God is said to rise betimes.  The more pains ministers take 
 in their work the more will the people have to answer for if it be all 
 in vain. The reason given why God by his prophets did thus strive with 
 them is because <I>he had compassion on his people and on his 
 dwelling-lace,</I> and would by these means have prevented their ruin.  
 Note, The methods God takes to reclaim sinners by his word, by 
 ministers, by conscience, by providences, are all instances of his 
 compassion towards them and his unwillingness <I>that any should 
 perish.</I>

 (2.) Their base and disingenuous carriage towards God
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>They mocked the messengers of God</I> (which was a high affront to
 him that sent them), <I>despised his word</I> in their mouths, and not 
 only so, but <I>misused the prophets,</I> treating them as their 
 enemies. The ill usage they gave Jeremiah who lived at this time, and 
 which we read much of in the book of his prophecy, is an instance of 
 this. This was an evidence of an implacable enmity to God, and an 
 invincible resolution to go on in their sins. This brought wrath upon 
 them without remedy, for it was sinning against the remedy. Nothing is 
 more provoking to God than abuses given to his faithful ministers; for 
 what is done against them he takes as done against himself. <I>Saul, 
 Saul, why persecutest thou me?</I> Persecution was the sin that brought 
 upon Jerusalem its final destruction by the Romans. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:34-37">Matt. xxiii. 34-37</A>.

 Those that mock at God's faithful ministers, and do all they can to
 render them despicable or odious, that vex and misuse them, to 
 discourage them and to keep others from hearkening to them, should be 
 reminded that a wrong done to an ambassador is construed as done to the 
 prince that sends him, and that the day is coming when they will find 
 it would have been better for them if they had been thrown <I>into the 
 sea</I> with a mill-stone about their necks; for hell is deeper and 
 more dreadful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The desolation itself, and some few of the particular so fit, which 
 we had more largely 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:1">2 Kings xxv. 1</A>.

 Multitudes were put to the sword, even <I>in the house of their
 sanctuary</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 whither they fled for refuge, hoping that the holiness of the place
 would be their protection. But how could they expect to find it so when 
 they themselves had polluted it with their abominations? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Those that cast off the dominion of their religion forfeit all the
 benefit and comfort of it. The Chaldeans not only paid no reverence to 
 the sanctuary, but showed no natural pity either to the tender sex or 
 to venerable age. They forsook God, who had compassion on them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and would have none of him; justly therefore are they given up into the
 hands of cruel men, for they <I>had no compassion on young man or 
 maiden.</I> 

 2. All the remaining vessels of the temple, great and small, and all
 the treasures, sacred and secular, the treasures of God's house and of 
 the king and his princes, were seized, and brought to Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 3. The temple was burnt, the walls of Jerusalem were demolished, the
 houses (called here the <I>palaces,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:3">Ps. xlviii. 3</A>,

 so stately, rich, and sumptuous were they) laid in ashes, and all the
 furniture, called here <I>the goodly vessels thereof,</I> destroyed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Let us see where what woeful havock sin makes, and, as we value the
 comfort and continuance of our estates, keep that worm from the root of 
 them.

 4.  The remainder of the people that escaped the sword were carried
 captives to Babylon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 impoverished, enslaved, insulted, and exposed to all the miseries, not
 only of a strange and barbarous land, but of an enemy's land, where 
 those that hated them bore rule over them. They were servants to those 
 monarchs, and no doubt were ruled with rigour so long as that monarchy 
 lasted. Now they sat down by the rivers of Babylon, with the streams of 
 which they mingled their tears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:1">Ps. cxxxvii. 1</A>.

 And though there, it should seem, they were cured of idolatry, yet, as
 appears by the prophet Ezekiel, they were not cured of mocking the 
 prophets.

 5. The land lay desolate while they were captives in Babylon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 That fruitful land, the glory of all lands, was now turned into a
 desert, not tilled, nor husbanded. The pastures were not clothed as 
 they used to be with flocks, nor the valleys with corn, but all lay 
 neglected. Now this may be considered,

 (1.) As the just punishment of their former abuse of it. They had
 served Baal with its fruits; <I>cursed</I> therefore <I>is the ground 
 for their sakes.</I> Now the land <I>enjoyed her sabbaths;</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),
 
 as God had threatened by Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:34">Lev. xxvi. 34</A>,

 and the reason there given
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>)

 is, "Because <I>it did not rest on your sabbaths;</I> you profaned the
 sabbath-day, did not observe the sabbatical year." They many a time 
 ploughed and sowed their land in the seventh year, when it should have 
 rested, and now it lay unploughed and unsown for ten times seven years.  
 Note, God will be no loser in his glory at last by the disobedience of 
 men: if the tribute be not paid, he will distrain and recover it, as he 
 speaks,

 If they would not let the land rest, God would make it rest whether
 they would or no. Some think they had neglected the observance of 
 seventy sabbatical years in all, and just so many, by way of reprisal, 
 the land now enjoyed; or, if those that had been neglected were fewer, 
 it was fit that the law should be satisfied with interest.  We find 
 that one of the quarrels God had with them at this time was for not 
 observing another law which related to the seventh year, and that was 
 the release of servants; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:14">Jer. xxxiv. 13</A>,

 &c.

 (2.) Yet we may consider it as giving some encouragement to their hopes
 that they should, in due time, return to it again. Had others come and 
 taken possession of it, they might have despaired of ever recovering 
 it; but, while it lay desolate, it did, as it were, lie waiting for 
 them again, and refuse to acknowledge any other owners.</P>

 These last two verses of this book have a double aspect. 

 1. They look back to the prophecy of Jeremiah, and show how that was
 accomplished,

 God had, by him, promised the restoring of the captives and the
 rebuilding of Jerusalem, at the end of seventy years; and that time to 
 favour Sion, that set time, came at last. After a long and dark night 
 the day-spring from on high visited them. God will be found true to 
 every word he has spoken. 

 2. They look forward to the history of Ezra, which begins with the
 repetition of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:22,23,Ezr+1:1-3">these last two verses</A>.

 They are there the introduction to a pleasant story; here they are the
 conclusion of a very melancholy one; and so we learn from them that, 
 though God's church be cast down, it is not cast off, though his people 
 be corrected, they are not abandoned, though thrown into the furnace, 
 yet not lost there, nor left there any longer than till the dross be 
 separated. Though God contend long, he will not contend always. The 
 Israel of God shall be fetched out of Babylon in due time, and even the 
 dry bones made to live. It may be long first; but the vision is for an 
 appointed time, and at the end it shall speak and not lie; therefore, 
 though it tarry, wait for it.</P>
