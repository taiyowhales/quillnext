 We have in this chapter, 

 I. A further account of Jehu's execution of his commission. He cut off,

 1. All Ahab's sons,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>.

 2. All Ahab's kindred, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:11-14,17">ver. 11-14, 17</A>.

 3. Ahab's idolatry: his zeal against this he took Jonadab to be witness
 to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>),

 summoned all the worshippers of Baal to attend

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:18-23">ver. 18-23</A>)

 and slew them all

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:24,25">ver. 24, 25</A>),

 and then abolished that idolatry,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:26-28">ver. 26-28</A>.

 II. A short account of the administration of his government. 

 1. The old idolatry of Israel, the worship of the calves, was retained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:29-31">ver. 29-31</A>.

 2. This brought God's judgments upon them by Hazael, with which his
 reign concludes,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters,
 and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders,
 and to them that brought up Ahab's <I>children,</I> saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your
 master's sons <I>are</I> with you, and <I>there are</I> with you chariots
 and horses, a fenced city also, and armour;
 &nbsp; 3 Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and
 set <I>him</I> on his father's throne, and fight for your master's
 house.
 &nbsp; 4 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings
 stood not before him: how then shall we stand?
 &nbsp; 5 And he that <I>was</I> over the house, and he that <I>was</I> over the
 city, the elders also, and the bringers up <I>of the children,</I>
 sent to Jehu, saying, We <I>are</I> thy servants, and will do all that
 thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou <I>that which
 is</I> good in thine eyes.
 &nbsp; 6 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye
 <I>be</I> mine, and <I>if</I> ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the
 heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by
 to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, <I>being</I> seventy
 persons, <I>were</I> with the great men of the city, which brought
 them up.
 &nbsp; 7 And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they
 took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their
 heads in baskets, and sent him <I>them</I> to Jezreel.
 &nbsp; 8 And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have
 brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in
 two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.
 &nbsp; 9 And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and
 stood, and said to all the people, Ye <I>be</I> righteous: behold, I
 conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all
 these?
 &nbsp; 10 Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the
 word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake concerning the house of
 Ahab: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath done <I>that</I> which he spake by his servant
 Elijah.
 &nbsp; 11 So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in
 Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his
 priests, until he left him none remaining.
 &nbsp; 12 And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. <I>And</I> as he
 <I>was</I> at the shearing house in the way,
 &nbsp; 13 Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and
 said, Who <I>are</I> ye? And they answered, We <I>are</I> the brethren of
 Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and
 the children of the queen.
 &nbsp; 14 And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and
 slew them at the pit of the shearing house, <I>even</I> two and forty
 men; neither left he any of them.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We left Jehu in quiet possession of Jezreel, triumphing over Joram and 
 Jezebel; and we must now attend his further motions. He knew the whole 
 house of Ahab must be cut off, and therefore proceeded in this bloody 
 work, and did not do it deceitfully, or by halves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:10">Jer. xlviii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He got the heads of all the sons of Ahab cut off by their own 
 guardians at Samaria. Seventy sons (or grandsons) Ahab had, Gideon's 
 number, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:30">Judg. viii. 30</A>.

 In such a number that bore his name his family was likely to be
 perpetuated, and yet it is extirpated all at once. Such a quiver full 
 of arrows could not protect his house from divine vengeance. Numerous 
 families, if vicious, must not expect to be long prosperous. These sons 
 of Ahab were now at Samaria, a strong city, perhaps brought thither 
 upon occasion of the war with Syria, as a place of safety, or upon 
 notice of Jehu's insurrection; with them were the rulers of Jezreel, 
 that is, the great officers of the court, who went to Samaria to secure 
 themselves or to consult what was to be done.  Those of them that were 
 yet under tuition had their tutors with them, who were entrusted with 
 their education in learning, agreeable to their birth and quality, but, 
 it is to be feared, brought them up in the idolatries of their father's 
 house and made them all worshippers of Baal. Jehu did not think fit to 
 bring his forces to Samaria to destroy them, but, that the hand of God 
 might appear the more remarkably in it, made their guardians their 
 murderers. 

 1. He sent a challenge to their friends to stand by them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.
 
 "You that are hearty well-wishers to the house of Ahab, and entirely in 
 its interests, now is your time to appear for it. Samaria is a strong 
 city; you are in possession of it; you have forces at command; you may 
 choose out the likeliest person of all the royal family to head you; 
 you know you are not tied to the eldest, unless he be <I>the best and 
 meetest of your master's sons.</I> If you have any spirit in you, show 
 it, and set one of them on his father's throne, and stand by him with 
 your lives and fortunes." Not that he desired they should do this, or 
 expected they would, but thus he upbraided them with their cowardice 
 and utter inability to contest with the divine counsels. "Do if you 
 dare, and see what will come of it." Those that have forsaken their 
 religion have often, with it, lost both their sense and their courage, 
 and deserve to be upbraided with it. 

 2. Hereby he gained from them a submission. They prudently reasoned
 with themselves: "<I>Behold, two kings stood not before him,</I> but 
 fell as sacrifices to his rage; <I>how then shall we stand?</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 Therefore they sent him a surrender of themselves: "<I>We are thy
 servants,</I> thy subjects, and <I>will do all that thou shalt bid 
 us,</I> right or wrong, and will set up nobody in competition with 
 thee." They saw it was to no purpose to contend with him, and therefore 
 it was their interest to submit to him.  With much more reason may we 
 thus argue ourselves into a subjection to the great God. Many kings and 
 great men have fallen before his wrath, for their wickedness; and how 
 then shall we stand? <I>Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we 
 stronger than he?</I> No, we must either bend or break. 

 3. This was improved so far as to make them the executioners of those 
 whom they had the tuition of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>If you be mine, bring me the heads of your master's sons by
 to-morrow at this time.</I> Though he knew it must be done, and was 
 loth to do it himself, one would think he could not expect they should 
 do it. Could they betray such a trust?  Could they be cruel to their 
 master's sons? It seems, so low did they stoop in their adoration to 
 the rising sun that they did it; they cut off the heads of those 
 seventy princes, and sent them in baskets a present to Jehu, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Learn hence not to trust in a friend nor to put confidence in a guide
 not governed by conscience. One can scarcely expect that he who has 
 been false to his God should ever be faithful to his prince. But 
 observe God's righteousness in their unrighteousness.  These elders of 
 Jezreel had been wickedly obsequious to Jezebel's order for the murder 
 of Naboth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:11">1 Kings xxi. 11</A>.

 She gloried, it is likely, in the power she had over them; and now the
 same base spirit makes them as pliable to Jehu and as ready to obey his 
 orders for the murder of Ahab's sons. Let none aim at arbitrary power, 
 lest they be found rolling a stone which, some time or other, will 
 return upon them. Princes that make their people slaves take the 
 readiest way to make them rebels; and by forcing men's consciences, as 
 Jezebel did, they lose their hold of them. When the separated heads 
 were presented to Jehu, he slyly upbraided those that were the 
 executioners of this vengeance. The heads were laid in two heaps at the 
 gate, the proper place of judgment. There he acquitted the people 
 before God and the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>,

 <I>You are righteous</I>), and, by what the rulers of Samaria had now
 done, comparatively acquitted himself: "I slew but one; they have slain 
 all these: I did it by conspiracy and with design; they have done this 
 merely in compliance and with an implicit obedience. Let not the people 
 of Samaria, nor any of the friends of the house of Ahab, ever reproach 
 me for what I have done, when their own elders, and the very guardians 
 of the orphans, have done this." It is common for those who have done 
 something base to attempt the mitigation of their own reproach by 
 drawing others in to do something worse. But,

 (2.) He resolves all into the righteous judgment of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>The Lord hath done that which he spoke by Elijah.</I> God is not the
 author of any man's sin, but even by that which men do from bad 
 principles God serves his own purposes and glorifies his own name; and 
 he is righteous in that wherein men are unrighteous. When the Assyrian 
 is made the <I>rod of God's anger,</I> and the instrument of his 
 justice, <I>he meaneth not so, neither does his heart think so,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:7">Isa. x. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He proceeded to destroy all that remained of the house of Ahab, not 
 only those that descended from him, but those that were in any relation 
 to him, all the officers of his household, ministers of state, and 
 those in command under him, called here his <I>great men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 all his kinsfolks and acquaintance, who had been partners with him in
 his wickedness, and his priests, or domestic chaplains, whom he 
 employed in his idolatrous services and who strengthened his hand that 
 he should not turn from his evil way. Having done this in Jezreel, he 
 did the same in Samaria 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>slew all that remained to Ahab in Samaria.</I> This was bloody work,
 and is not now, in any case, to be drawn into a precedent. Let the 
 guilty suffer, but not the guiltless for their sakes. Perhaps such 
 terrible destructions as these were intended as types of the final 
 destruction of all the ungodly. God has a sword, bathed in heaven, 
 which will come down upon the people of his curse, and <I>be filled 
 with blood.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:5,6">Isa. xxxiv. 5, 6</A>.

 Then <I>his eye will not spare, neither will he pity.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Providence bringing the brethren of Ahaziah in his way, as he was 
 going on with this execution, he slew them likewise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>.

 The brethren of Ahaziah were slain by the Arabians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+22:1">2 Chron. xxii. 1</A>),

 but these were the sons of his brethren, as it is there explained 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and they are said to be princes of Judah, and to minister to Ahaziah.
 Several things concurred to make them obnoxious to the vengeance Jehu 
 was now executing.

 1. They were branches of Ahab's house, being descended from Athaliah, 
 and therefore fell within his commission. 

 2.  They were tainted with the wickedness of the house of Ahab. 

 3. They were now going to make their court to the princes of the house 
 of Ahab, to <I>salute the children of the king and the queen,</I> Joram 
 and Jezebel, which showed that they were linked to them in affection as 
 well as in affinity.  These princes, forty-two in number, being 
 appointed as sheep for the sacrifice, were slain with solemnity, <I>at 
 the pit of the shearing-house. The Lord is known by these judgments 
 which he executeth.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the
 son of Rechab <I>coming</I> to meet him: and he saluted him, and said
 to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart <I>is</I> with thy heart?
 And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give <I>me</I> thine hand.
 And he gave <I>him</I> his hand; and he took him up to him into the
 chariot.
 &nbsp; 16 And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. So
 they made him ride in his chariot.
 &nbsp; 17 And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto
 Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the
 saying of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which he spake to Elijah.
 &nbsp; 18 And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto
 them, Ahab served Baal a little; <I>but</I> Jehu shall serve him much.
 &nbsp; 19 Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his
 servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a
 great sacrifice <I>to do</I> to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he
 shall not live. But Jehu did <I>it</I> in subtilty, to the intent that
 he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
 &nbsp; 20 And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they
 proclaimed <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 21 And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of
 Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And
 they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full
 from one end to another.
 &nbsp; 22 And he said unto him that <I>was</I> over the vestry, Bring forth
 vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them
 forth vestments.
 &nbsp; 23 And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the
 house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and
 look that there be here with you none of the servants of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, but the worshippers of Baal only.
 &nbsp; 24 And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt
 offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, <I>If</I>
 any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, <I>he
 that letteth him go,</I> his life <I>shall be</I> for the life of him.
 &nbsp; 25 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of
 offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to
 the captains, Go in, <I>and</I> slay them; let none come forth. And
 they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the
 captains cast <I>them</I> out, and went to the city of the house of
 Baal.
 &nbsp; 26 And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal,
 and burned them.
 &nbsp; 27 And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the
 house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.
 &nbsp; 28 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jehu, pushing on his work, is here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Courting the friendship of a good man, <I>Jehonadab the son of 
 Rechab,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 This Jehonadab, though mortified to the world and meddling little with
 the business of it (as appears by his charge to his posterity, which 
 they religiously observed 300 years after, not to drink wine nor dwell 
 in cities,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+35:6">Jer. xxxv. 6</A>,

 &c.), yet, upon this occasion, went to meet Jehu, that he might
 encourage him in the work to which God had called him. The countenance 
 of good men is a thing which great men, if they be wise, will value, 
 and value themselves by. David prayed, <I>Let those that fear thee turn 
 to me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:79">Ps. cxix. 79</A>.

 This Jehonadab, though no prophet, priest, or Levite, no prince or
 ruler, was, we may suppose, very eminent for prudence and piety, and 
 generally respected for that life of self-denial and devotion which he 
 lived: Jehu, though a soldier, knew him and honoured him. He did not 
 indeed think of sending for him, but when he met him (though it is 
 likely he drove now as furiously as ever) he stopped to speak to him; 
 and we are here told what passed between them.

 1. Jehu saluted him; he <I>blessed him</I> (so the word is), paid him 
 the respect and showed him the good-will that were due to so great an 
 example of serious godliness. 

 2.  Jehonadab assured him that he was sincerely in his interest and a
 hearty well-wisher to his cause. Jehu professed that <I>his heart was 
 right with him,</I> that he had a true affection for his person and a 
 veneration for the crown of his Nazariteship, and desired to know 
 whether he had the same affection for him and satisfaction in that 
 crown of royal dignity which God had put upon his head: <I>Is thy heart 
 right?</I> a question we should often put to ourselves. "I make a 
 plausible profession, have gained a reputation among men, but <I>is my 
 heart right?</I> Am I sincere and inward with God?" Jehonadab gave him 
 his word (<I>It is</I>), and gave him his hand as a pledge of his
 heart, <I>yielded to him</I> (so giving the hand is rendered,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:8">2 Chron. xxx. 8</A>),

 concurred and covenanted with him, and owned him in the work both of
 revenge and of reformation he was now about. 

 3. Jehu took him up into his chariot and took him along with him to 
 Samaria. He put some honour upon him, by taking him into the chariot 
 with him (Jehonadab was not accustomed to ride in a chariot, much less 
 with a king); but he received more honour from him, and from the 
 countenance he gave to his present work. All sober people would think 
 the better of Jehu when they saw Jehonadab in the chariot with him. 
 This was not the only time in which the piety of some has been made to 
 serve the policy of others, and designing men have strengthened 
 themselves by drawing good men into their interests. Jehonadab is a 
 stranger to the arts of fleshly wisdom, and has his <I>conversation in 
 simplicity and godly sincerity;</I> and therefore, if Jehu be a servant 
 of God and an enemy to Ball, he will be his faithful friend. "Come 
 then" (says Jehu), "come with me, <I>and see my zeal for the Lord;</I> 
 and then thou wilt see reason to espouse my cause." This is commonly 
 taken as not well said by Jehu, and as giving cause to suspect that his 
 heart was not right with God in what he did, and that the zeal he 
 pretended for the Lord was really zeal for himself and his own 
 advancement.  For,

 (1.) He boasted of it, and spoke as if God and man were mightily 
 indebted to him for it. 

 (2.) He desired it might be seen and taken notice of, like the 
 Pharisees, who did all to be seen of men. An upright heart approves 
 itself to God and covets no more than his acceptance. If we aim at the 
 applause of men, and make their praise our highest end, we are upon a 
 false bottom. Whether Jehu looked any further we cannot judge; however 
 Jehonadab went with him, and, it is likely, animated and assisted him 
 in the further execution of his commission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 destroying all Ahab's friends in Samaria. A man may hate cruelty and
 yet love justice, may be far from thirsting after blood and yet may 
 <I>wash his feet in the blood of the wicked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:10">Ps. lviii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Contriving the destruction of all the worshippers of Baal. The 
 service of Baal was the crying sin of the house of Ahab: that root of 
 this idolatry was plucked up, but multitudes yet remained that were 
 infected with it, and would be in danger of infecting others. The law 
 of God was express, that they were to be put to death; but they were so 
 numerous, and so dispersed throughout all parts of the kingdom, and 
 perhaps so alarmed with Jehu's beginnings, that it would be a hard 
 matter to find them all out and an endless task to prosecute and 
 execute them one by one. Jehu's project therefore is to cut them all 
 off together. 

 1. By a wile, by a fraud, he brought them together to the temple of 
 Baal. He pretended he would worship Baal more than ever Ahab had done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Perhaps he spoke this ironically, or to try the body of the people
 whether they would oppose such a resolution as this, and would resent 
 his threatening to increase his predecessor's exactions, and say, "If 
 it be so, we have no part in Jehu, nor inheritance in the son of 
 Nimshi." But it rather seems to have been spoken purposely to deceive 
 the worshippers of Baal, and then it cannot be justified. The truth of 
 God needs not any man's lie. He issued a proclamation, requiring the 
 attendance of all the worshippers of Baal to join with him in a 
 sacrifice to Baal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>),

 not only the prophets and priests, but all, throughout the kingdom, who
 worshipped Baal, who were not nearly so many as they had been in 
 Elijah's time. Jehu's friends, we may suppose, were aware of what he 
 designed, and were not offended at it; but the bigoted besotted 
 Baalites began to think themselves very happy, and that now they should 
 see golden days again. <I>Joram</I> had <I>put away the image of 
 Baal,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:2"><I>ch.</I> iii. 2</A>.

 If Jehu will restore it, they have what they would have, and come up to
 Samaria with joy from all parts to celebrate the solemnity; and they 
 are pleased to see the house of Baal crowded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 to see his priests in their vestments

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 and themselves perhaps with some badges or other to notify their
 relation to Baal, for there were vestments for all his worshippers.

 2. He took care that none of the servants of the Lord should be among
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 This they took as a provision to preserve the worship of Baal from
 being profaned by strangers; but it was a wonder that they did not, by 
 this, see themselves brought into a snare and discern a design upon 
 them. No marvel if those that suffer themselves to be deceived by Baal 
 (as all idolaters were by their idols), are deceived by Jehu to their 
 destruction.

 3. He gave order for the cutting of them all off, and Jehonadab joined 
 with him therein, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 When a strict search was made lest any of the servants of God should,
 either for company or curiosity, have got among them--lest any wheat 
 should be mixed with those tares, and when eighty men were set to stand 
 guard at all the avenues to Baal's temple, that none might escape

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 then the guards were sent in to put them all to the sword and to
 <I>mingle their blood with their sacrifices,</I> in a way of just 
 revenge, as they themselves had sometimes done, when, in their blind 
 devotion, they <I>cut themselves with knives and lancets till the blood 
 gushed out,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:28">1 Kings xviii. 28</A>.

 This was accordingly done, and the doing of it, though seemingly
 barbarous, was, considering the nature of their crime, really 
 righteous. <I>The Lord, whose name is jealous, is a jealous God.</I> 

 4. The idolaters being thus destroyed, the idolatry itself was utterly
 abolished. The buildings about the house of Baal (which were so many 
 and so stately that they are here called a <I>city</I>), where Baal's 
 priests and their families lived, were destroyed; all the little 
 images, statues, pictures, or shrines, which beautified Baal's temple, 
 with the great image of Baal himself, were brought out and burnt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>),

 and the temple of Baal was broken down, and made a dunghill, the common
 sink, or sewer, of the city, that the remembrance of it might be 
 blotted out or made infamous. Thus was the worship of Baal quite 
 destroyed, at least for the present, out of Israel, though it had once 
 prevailed so far that there were but 7000 of all the thousands of 
 Israel that had not bowed the knee to Baal, and those concealed. Thus 
 will God destroy all the gods of the heathen, and, sooner or later, 
 triumph over them all.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>29 Howbeit <I>from</I> the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
 made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, <I>to wit,</I>
 the golden calves that <I>were</I> in Beth-el, and that <I>were</I> in Dan.
 &nbsp; 30 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in
 executing <I>that which is</I> right in mine eyes, <I>and</I> hast done
 unto the house of Ahab according to all that <I>was</I> in mine heart,
 thy children of the fourth <I>generation</I> shall sit on the throne
 of Israel.
 &nbsp; 31 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of
 Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of
 Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.
 &nbsp; 32 In those days the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> began to cut Israel short: and Hazael
 smote them in all the coasts of Israel;
 &nbsp; 33 From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites,
 and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which <I>is</I> by
 the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.
 &nbsp; 34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and
 all his might, <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the
 chronicles of the kings of Israel?
 &nbsp; 35 And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in
 Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.
 &nbsp; 36 And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria <I>was</I>
 twenty and eight years.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is all the account of the reign of Jehu, though it continued 
 twenty-eight years. The progress of it answered not to the glory of its 
 beginning. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God's approbation of what Jehu had done. Many, it is probable, 
 censured him as treacherous and barbarous--called him a rebel, a
 usurper, a murderer, and prognosticated ill concerning him, that a 
 family thus raised would soon be ruined; but God said, <I>Well done</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),
 
 and then it signified little who said otherwise.

 1. God pronounced that to be right which he had done. It is justly 
 questionable whether he did it from a good principle and whether he did 
 not take some false steps in the doing of it; and yet (says God), 
 <I>Thou hast done well in executing that which is right in my eyes.</I> 
 The extirpating of idolaters and idolatry was a thing right in God's 
 eyes, for it is an iniquity he visits as surely and severely as any: it 
 was <I>according to all that was in his heart,</I> all he desired, all 
 he designed. Jehu went through with his work. 

 2. God promised him a reward, that his children of the fourth
 generation from him should <I>sit upon the throne of Israel.</I> This 
 was more than what took place in any of the dignities or royal families 
 of that kingdom; of the house of Ahab there were indeed four kings, 
 Omri, Ahab, Ahaziah, and Joram, but the last two were brothers, so that 
 it reached but to the third generation, and that whole family continued 
 but about forty-five years in all, whereas Jehu's continued in four, 
 besides himself, and in all about 120 years. Note, No services done for 
 God shall go unrewarded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jehu's carelessness in what he was further to do. By this it 
 appeared that his heart was not right with God, that he was partial in 
 his reformation. 

 1. He did not put away all the evil. He departed from the sins of Ahab, 
 but not from the sins of Jeroboam--discarded Baal, but adhered to the 
 calves. The worship of Baal was indeed the greater evil, and more 
 heinous in the sight of God, but the worship of the calves was a great 
 evil, and true conversion is not only from gross sin, but from all 
 sin--not only from false gods, but from false worships. The worship of 
 Baal weakened and diminished Israel, and made them beholden to the 
 Sidonians, and therefore he could easily part with that; but the 
 worship of the calves was a politic idolatry, was begun and kept up for 
 reasons of state, to prevent the return of the ten tribes to the house 
 of David, and therefore Jehu clave to that. True conversion is not only 
 from wasteful sins, but from gainful sins--not only from those sins 
 that are destructive to the secular interest, but from those that 
 support and befriend it, in forsaking which is the great trial whether 
 we can deny ourselves and trust God. 

 2. He put away evil, but he did not mind that which was good 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):
 
 <I>He took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel.</I> He
 abolished the worship of Baal, but did not keep up the worship of God, 
 nor walk in his law. He had shown great care and zeal for the rooting 
 out of a false religion; but in the true religion,

 (1.) He showed no care, took no heed, lived at large, was not at all 
 solicitous to please God and to do his duty, took no heed to the 
 scriptures, to the prophets, to his own conscience, but walked at all 
 adventures. Those that are heedless, it is to be feared, are graceless; 
 for, where there is a good principle in the heart, it will make men 
 cautious and circumspect, desirous to please God and jealous of doing 
 any thing to offend him. 

 (2.) He showed no zeal; what he did in religion he did not do with his 
 heart, with all his heart, but did it as if he did it not, without any 
 liveliness or concern. It seems, he was a man that had little religion 
 himself, and yet God made use of him as an instrument of reformation in 
 Israel. It is a pity but that those that do good to others should 
 always be good themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The judgment that came upon Israel in his reign. We have reason to 
 fear that when Jehu took no heed himself to walk in God's law the 
 people were generally as careless as he, both in their devotions and in 
 their conversations. There was a general decay of piety and increase of 
 profaneness; and therefore it is not strange that the next news we hear 
 is, <I>In those days the Lord began to cut Israel short,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 
 Their neighbours encroached upon them on every side; they were short in
 their duty to God, and therefore God cut them short in their extent, 
 wealth, and power. Hazael king of Syria was, above any other, vexatious 
 and mischievous to them, <I>smote them in all the coasts of Israel,</I> 
 particularly the countries on the other side Jordan, which lay next 
 him, and most exposed; on these he made continual inroads, and laid 
 them waste. Now the Reubenites and Gadites smarted for the choice which 
 their ancestors made of an inheritance on that side Jordan, which Moses 
 reproved them for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:1-42">Num. xxxii.</A>

 Now Hazael did what Elisha foresaw and foretold he would do. Yet, for
 doing it, God had a quarrel with him and with his kingdom, as we may 
 find,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:3,4">Amos i. 3, 4</A>.

 Because those of Damascus have <I>threshed Gilead with threshing
 instruments of iron,</I> therefore (says God) <I>I will send a fire 
 into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of 
 Benhadad.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Lastly, The conclusion of Jehu's reign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:34-36"><I>v.</I> 34-36</A>.

 Notice is taken, in general, of his might; but, because he took no heed
 to serve God, the memorials of his mighty enterprises and achievements 
 are justly buried in oblivion.</P>
