 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This excellent chapter is the same with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:1-29">2 Sam. vii.</A>

 It will be worth while to look back upon what was there said upon it.
 Two things in general we have in it:--

 I. God's gracious acceptance of David's purpose to build him a house,
 and the promise he made thereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:1-15">ver. 1-15</A>.

 II. David's gracious acceptance of God's good promise to build him a
 house, and the prayer he made thereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:16-27">ver. 16-27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David
 said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedars,
 but the ark of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>remaineth</I> under
 curtains.
 &nbsp; 2  Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that <I>is</I> in thine heart;
 for God <I>is</I> with thee.
 &nbsp; 3  And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came
 to Nathan, saying,
 &nbsp; 4  Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Thou shalt
 not build me a house to dwell in:
 &nbsp; 5  For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought
 up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and
 from <I>one</I> tabernacle <I>to another.</I>
 &nbsp; 6  Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to
 any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people,
 saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedars?
 &nbsp; 7  Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, <I>even</I>
 from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my
 people Israel:
 &nbsp; 8  And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and
 have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made
 thee a name like the name of the great men that <I>are</I> in the
 earth.
 &nbsp; 9  Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will
 plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be
 moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste
 them any more, as at the beginning,
 &nbsp; 10  And since the time that I commanded judges <I>to be</I> over my
 people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies.
 Furthermore I tell thee that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will build thee a house.
 &nbsp; 11  And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that
 thou must go <I>to be</I> with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy
 seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish
 his kingdom.
 &nbsp; 12  He shall build me a house, and I will stablish his throne
 for ever.
 &nbsp; 13  I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not
 take my mercy away from him, as I took <I>it</I> from <I>him</I> that was
 before thee:
 &nbsp; 14  But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for
 ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.
 &nbsp; 15  According to all these words, and according to all this
 vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How desirous and solicitous good people should be to serve the 
 interests of God's kingdom in the world, to the utmost of their 
 capacity. David could not be easy in a house of cedar while the ark was 
 lodged within curtains, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The concerns of the public should always be near our hearts. What
 pleasure can we take in our own prosperity if we see not the good of 
 Jerusalem? When David is advanced to wealth and power see what his 
 cares and projects are. Not, "What shall I do for my children to get 
 portions for them? What shall I do to fill my coffers and enlarge my 
 dominions?" But, "What shall I do for God, to serve and honour him?" 
 Those that are contriving where to bestow their fruits and their good 
 would do well to enquire what condition the ark is in, and whether some 
 may not be well bestowed upon it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How ready God's prophets should be to encourage every good purpose. 
 Nathan was no sooner aware of David's good design than he bade him 
 <I>go and do all that was within his heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 for he had no reason to doubt but that God was with him in it.
 Ministers should stir up the gifts and graces that are in others as 
 well as in themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How little God affects external pomp and splendour in his service. 
 His ark was content with a tabernacle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 and he never so much as mentioned the building of a house for it; no,
 not when he had fixed his people in great and goodly cities which they 
 builded not,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:10">Deut. vi. 10</A>.

 He commanded the judges to <I>feed his people,</I> but never bade them
 <I>build him a house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 We may well be content awhile with mean accommodations; God's ark was
 so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How graciously God accepts his people's good purposes, yea, though 
 he himself prevents the performance of them. David must not <I>build 
 this house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He must prepare for it, but not do it; as Moses must bring Israel
 within sight of Canaan, but must them leave it to Joshua to put them in 
 possession of it. It is the prerogative of Christ to be both the author 
 and finisher of his work. Yet David must not think that, because he was 
 not permitted to build the temple,

 1. His preferment was in vain; no, "<I>I took thee from the
 sheep-cote,</I> though not to be a builder of the temple, yet to be 
 <I>ruler over my people Israel;</I> that is honour enough for thee; 
 leave the other to one that shall come after thee," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Why should one man think to engross all the business and to bring every
 good work to perfection?  Let something be left for those that succeed. 
 God had given him victories, and made him a name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and, further, intended by him to establish his people Israel and secure
 them against their enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 That must be <I>his</I> work, who is a man of war and fit for it, and
 he must let the building of churches be left to one that was never cut 
 out for a soldier. Nor,

 2. Must he think that his good purpose was in vain, and that he should
 lose the reward of it; no, it being God's act to prevent the execution 
 of it, he shall be as fully recompensed as if he had done it; "<I>The 
 Lord will build thee a house,</I> and annex the crown of Israel to it," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 If there be a willing mind, it shall not only be accepted, but thus
 rewarded. Nor,

 3. Must he think that because <I>he</I> might not do this good work
 therefore it would never be done, and that it was in vain to think of 
 it; no, <I>I will raise up thy seed, and he shall build me a house,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 God's temple shall be built in the time appointed, though we may not
 have the honour of helping to build it or the satisfaction of seeing it 
 built. Nor, 

 4.  Must he confine his thoughts to the temporal prosperity of his
 family, but must entertain himself with the prospect of the kingdom of 
 the Messiah, who should descend from his loins, and whose throne should 
 be <I>established for evermore,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Solomon was not himself so settled in God's house as he should have
 been, nor was his family settled in the kingdom: "But there shall one 
 descend from thee whom I will settle in my house and in my kingdom," 
 which intimates that he should be both a high priest over the house of 
 God and should have the sole administration of the affairs of God's 
 kingdom among men, all power both in heaven and in earth, in the house 
 and in the kingdom, in the church and in the world. He shall be <I>a 
 priest upon his throne,</I> and <I>the counsel of peace shall be 
 between them both,</I> and <I>he shall build the temple of the 
 Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:12,13">Zech. vi. 12, 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  And David the king came and sat before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and said,
 Who <I>am</I> I, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God, and what <I>is</I> mine house, that thou hast
 brought me hitherto?
 &nbsp; 17  And <I>yet</I> this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for
 thou hast <I>also</I> spoken of thy servant's house for a great while
 to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of
 high degree, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God.
 &nbsp; 18  What can David <I>speak</I> more to thee for the honour of thy
 servant? for thou knowest thy servant.
 &nbsp; 19  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own
 heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all
 <I>these</I> great things.
 &nbsp; 20  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>there is</I> none like thee, neither <I>is there any</I>
 God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our
 ears.
 &nbsp; 21  And what one nation in the earth <I>is</I> like thy people
 Israel, whom God went to redeem <I>to be</I> his own people, to make
 thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations
 from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?
 &nbsp; 22  For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for
 ever; and thou, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, becamest their God.
 &nbsp; 23  Therefore now, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, let the thing that thou hast spoken
 concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established
 for ever, and do as thou hast said.
 &nbsp; 24  Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified
 for ever, saying, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts <I>is</I> the God of Israel,
 <I>even</I> a God to Israel: and <I>let</I> the house of David thy servant
 <I>be</I> established before thee.
 &nbsp; 25  For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt
 build him a house: therefore thy servant hath found <I>in his
 heart</I> to pray before thee.
 &nbsp; 26  And now, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness
 unto thy servant:
 &nbsp; 27  Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy
 servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest,
 O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and <I>it shall be</I> blessed for ever.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here David's solemn address to God, in answer to the gracious 
 message he had now received from him. By faith he receives the 
 promises, embraces them, and is persuaded of them, as the patriarchs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:13">Heb. xi. 13</A>.

 How humbly does he here abase himself, and acknowledge his own
 unworthiness! How highly does he advance the name of God and admire his 
 condescending grace and favour! With what devout affections does he 
 magnify the God of Israel and what a value has he for the Israel of 
 God! With what assurance does he build upon the promise, and with what 
 a lively faith does he put it in suit! What an example is this to us of 
 humble, believing, fervent prayer! The Lord enable us all thus to seek 
 him! These things were largely observed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:1-29">2 Sam. vii.</A>

 We shall therefore here observe only those few expressions in which the
 prayer, as we find it here, differs from the record of it there, and 
 has something added to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That which is there expressed by way of question (<I>Is this the 
 manner of men, O Lord God?</I>) is here an acknowledgment: "<I>Thou 
 hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree.</I> 
 Thou hast made me a great man, and then treated me accordingly." God, 
 by the covenant-relations into which he admits believers, the titles he 
 gives them, the favours he bestows on them, and the preparations he has 
 made for them, regards them according to the estate of men of high 
 degree, though they are mean and vile. Having himself distinguished 
 them, he treats them as persons of distinction, according to the 
 quality he has been pleased to put upon them. Some give these words 
 here another reading: "<I>Thou hast looked upon me in the form of a man 
 who art in the highest, the Lord God;</I> or, <I>Thou hast made me to 
 see according to the form of a man the majesty of the Lord God.</I>" 
 And so it points at the Messiah; for, as Abraham, so David, saw his day 
 and was glad, saw it by faith, saw it in <I>fashion as a man, the Word 
 made flesh,</I> and yet saw his <I>glory as</I> that <I>of the 
 only-begotten of the Father.</I> And this was that which God spoke 
 concerning his house for a great while to come, the foresight of which 
 affected him more than any thing. And let it not be thought strange 
 that David should speak so plainly of the two natures of Christ who in 
 spirit called him <I>Lord,</I> though he knew he was to be his 
 <I>Son</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>),

 and foresaw him <I>lower than the angels</I> for a little while, but
 afterwards <I>crowned with glory and honour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:6,7">Heb. ii. 6, 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. After the words <I>What can David say more unto thee,</I> it is 
 here added, <I>for the honour of they servant?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Note, The honour God puts upon his servants, by taking them into
 covenant and communion with himself, is so great that they need not, 
 they cannot, desire to be more highly honoured. Were they to sit down 
 and wish, they could not speak more for their own honour than the word 
 of God has spoken.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It is very observable that what in Samuel is said to be <I>for thy 
 word's sake</I> is here said to be <I>for thy servant's sake,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 Jesus Christ is both <I>the Word of God</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:13">Rev. xix. 13</A>)

 and <I>the servant of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1">Isa. xlii. 1</A>),

 and it is for his sake, upon the score of his meditation, that the
 promises are both made and made good to all believers; it is in him 
 that they are <I>yea and amen.</I> For his sake is all kindness done, 
 for his sake it is made known; to him we owe all this greatness and 
 from him we are to expect all these great things; they are <I>the 
 unsearchable riches of Christ,</I> which, if by faith we see in 
 themselves and see in the hand of the Lord Jesus, we cannot but magnify 
 as great things, the only true greatness, and speak honourably of 
 accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. In Samuel, the Lord of hosts is said to be the <I>God over 
 Israel;</I> here he is said to be <I>the God of Israel, even a God to 
 Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 His being the God <I>of</I> Israel bespeaks his having the name of
 <I>their God</I> and so calling himself; his being a God <I>to</I> 
 Israel bespeaks his answering to the name, his filling up the relation, 
 and doing all that to them which might be expected from him. There were 
 those that were called <I>gods</I> of such and such nations, gods of 
 Assyria and Egypt, gods of Hamad and Arpad; but they were no gods to 
 them, for they stood them in no stead at all, were mere ciphers, 
 nothing but a name. But <I>the God of Israel</I> is a <I>God to 
 Israel;</I> all his attributes and perfections redound to their real 
 benefit and advantage. <I>Happy therefore, thrice happy, is the people 
 whose God is Jehovah;</I> for he will be a God to them, a God 
 all-sufficient.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The closing words in Samuel are, <I>With thy blessing let the house 
 of thy servant be blessed forever.</I> That is the language of a holy 
 desire. But the closing words here are the language of a most holy 
 faith: <I>For thou blessest, O Lord! and it shall be blessed for 
 ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 1. He was encouraged to beg a blessing because God had intimated to him
 that he had blessings in store for him and his family: "<I>Thou 
 blessest, O Lord!</I> and therefore unto thee shall all flesh come for 
 a blessing; unto thee do I come for the blessing promised to me." 
 Promises are intended to direct and excite prayer. Has God said, <I>I 
 will bless?</I> Let our hearts answer, <I>Lord, bless me,</I> 

 2.  He was earnest for the blessing because he believed that those whom
 God blesses are truly and eternally blessed: <I>Thou blessest, and it 
 shall be blessed.</I> Men can but <I>beg</I> the blessing; it is God 
 that <I>commands</I> it. What he designs he effects; what he promises 
 he performs; saying and doing are not two things with him. Nay, <I>it 
 shall be blessed for ever.</I> His blessings shall not be revoked, 
 cannot be opposed, and the benefits conferred by them are such as will 
 survive time and days. David's prayer concludes as God's promise did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+17:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 with that which is <I>for ever.</I> God's word looks at things eternal,
 and so should our desires and hopes.</P>
