 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the regulation of the militia of the 
 kingdom. David was himself a man of war, and had done great things with 
 the sword; he had brought into the field great armies. Now here we are 
 told how he marshalled them when God had given him rest from all his 
 enemies. He did not keep them all together, for that would have been a 
 hardship on them and the country; yet he did not disband and disperse 
 them all, for then he would have left his kingdom naked, and his people 
 would have forgotten the arts of war, wherein they had been instructed. 
 He therefore contrived to keep up a constant force, and yet not a 
 standing army. The model is very prudent. 

 1. He kept up 24,000 constantly in arms, I suppose in a body, and
 disciplined, in one part or other of the kingdom, the freeholders 
 carrying their own arms and bearing their own charges while they were 
 up. This was a sufficient strength for the securing of the public peace 
 and safety. Those that are Israelites indeed must learn war; for we 
 have enemies to grapple with, whom we are concerned constantly to stand 
 upon our guard against.  

 2. He changed them every month; so that the whole number of the militia
 amounted to 288,000, perhaps about a fifth part of the able men of the 
 kingdom. By being thus distributed into twelve courses, they were all 
 instructed in, and accustomed to, military exercises; and yet none were 
 compelled to be in service, and at expenses, above one month in the 
 year (which they might very well afford), unless upon extraordinary 
 occasions, and then they might all be got together quickly. It is the 
 wisdom of governors, and much their praise, while they provide for the 
 public safety, to contrive how to make it effectual and yet easy, and 
 as little as possible burdensome to the people. 

 3. Every course had a commander in chief over it. Besides the subaltern
 officers that were rulers over thousands, and hundreds, and fifties, 
 there was one general officer to each course or legion.  All these 
 twelve great commanders are mentioned among David's worthies and 
 champions,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:8-39,1Ch+11:10-47">2 Sam. xxiii. and 1 Chron. xi.</A>

 They had first signalized themselves by their great actions and then 
 they were advanced to those great preferments. It is well with a 
 kingdom when honour thus attends merit. Benaiah is here called <I>a 
 chief priest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 But, <I>cohen</I> signifying both a <I>priest</I> and a <I>prince,</I>
 it might better be translated here <I>a chief ruler,</I> or (as in the 
 margin) <I>a principal officer.</I> Dodai had Mikloth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 either for his substitute when he was absent or infirm, or for his
 successor when he was dead. Benaiah had his son under him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Asahel had his son after him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and by this it seems that this plan of the militia was laid in the
 beginning of David's reign; for Asahel was killed by Abner while David 
 reigned in Hebron. When his wars were over he revived this method, and 
 left the military affairs in this posture, for the peaceable reign of 
 his son Solomon. When we think ourselves most safe, yet, while we are 
 here in the body, we must keep in a readiness for spiritual conflicts. 
 <I>Let not him that girdeth on the harness boast as he that puts it 
 off.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the
 Reubenites <I>was</I> Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the Simeonites,
 Shephatiah the son of Maachah:
 &nbsp; 17  Of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of the
 Aaronites, Zadok:
 &nbsp; 18  Of Judah, Elihu, <I>one</I> of the brethren of David: of
 Issachar, Omri the son of Michael:
 &nbsp; 19  Of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah: of Naphtali,
 Jerimoth the son of Azriel:
 &nbsp; 20  Of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah: of
 the half tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah:
 &nbsp; 21  Of the half <I>tribe</I> of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of
 Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner:
 &nbsp; 22  Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These <I>were</I> the princes
 of the tribes of Israel.
 &nbsp; 23  But David took not the number of them from twenty years old
 and under: because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had said he would increase Israel
 like to the stars of the heavens.
 &nbsp; 24  Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished
 not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was
 the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.
 &nbsp; 25  And over the king's treasures <I>was</I> Azmaveth the son of
 Adiel: and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and
 in the villages, and in the castles, <I>was</I> Jehonathan the son of
 Uzziah:
 &nbsp; 26  And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of
 the ground <I>was</I> Ezri the son of Chelub:
 &nbsp; 27  And over the vineyards <I>was</I> Shimei the Ramathite: over the
 increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars <I>was</I> Zabdi the
 Shiphmite:
 &nbsp; 28  And over the olive trees and the sycamore trees that <I>were</I>
 in the low plains <I>was</I> Baal-hanan the Gederite: and over the
 cellars of oil <I>was</I> Joash:
 &nbsp; 29  And over the herds that fed in Sharon <I>was</I> Shitrai the
 Sharonite: and over the herds <I>that were</I> in the valleys <I>was</I>
 Shaphat the son of Adlai:
 &nbsp; 30  Over the camels also <I>was</I> Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the
 asses <I>was</I> Jehdeiah the Meronothite:
 &nbsp; 31  And over the flocks <I>was</I> Jaziz the Hagerite. All these
 <I>were</I> the rulers of the substance which <I>was</I> king David's.
 &nbsp; 32  Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, a wise man,
 and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni <I>was</I> with the
 king's sons:
 &nbsp; 33  And Ahithophel <I>was</I> the king's counsellor: and Hushai the
 Archite <I>was</I> the king's companion:
 &nbsp; 34  And after Ahithophel <I>was</I> Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and
 Abiathar: and the general of the king's army <I>was</I> Joab.

 We have here an account,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the princes of the tribes. Something of the ancient order 
 instituted by Moses in the wilderness was still kept up, that every 
 tribe should have its prince or chief. It is probable that it was kept 
 up all along, either by election or by succession, in the same family; 
 and those are here named who were found in that office when this 
 account was taken. Elihu, or Eliab, who was prince of Judah, was the 
 eldest son of Jesse, and descended in a right line from Nahshon and 
 Salmon, the princes of this tribe in Moses's time. Whether these 
 princes were of the nature of lord-lieutenants that guided them in 
 their military affairs, or chief-justices that presided in their courts 
 of judgment, does not appear. Their power, we may suppose, was much 
 less now that all the tribes were united under one king than it had 
 been when, for the most part, they acted separately. Our religion 
 obliges us to be subject, not only to <I>the king as supreme, but unto 
 governors under him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:13,14">1 Pet. ii. 13, 14</A>),

 the princes that decree justice. Of Benjamin was Jaaziel the son of
 Abner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Though Abner was David's enemy, and opposed his coming to the throne,
 yet David would not oppose the preferment of his son, but perhaps 
 nominated him to this post of honour, which teaches us to render good 
 for evil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the numbering of the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.
 
 It is here said,

 1. That when David ordered the people to be numbered he forbade the
 numbering of those under twenty years old, thinking thereby to save the 
 reflection which what he did might otherwise cast upon the promise that 
 they should be innumerable; yet it was but a poor salvo, for it had 
 never been customary to number those under twenty, and the promise of 
 their numbers chiefly respected the effective men. 

 2. That the account which David took of the people, in the pride of his
 heart, turned to no good account; for it was never perfected, nor done 
 with exactness, nor was it ever recorded as an authentic account. Joab 
 was disgusted with it, and did it by halves; David was ashamed of it, 
 and willing it should be forgotten, because there fell wrath for it 
 against Israel. A good man cannot, in the reflection, please himself 
 with that which he knows God is displeased with, cannot make use of 
 that, nor take comfort in that, which is obtained by sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Of the officers of the court. 

 1. The <I>rulers of the</I> king's <I>substance</I> (as they are
 called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 such as had the oversight and charge of the king's tillage, his
 vineyards, his olive-yards, his herds, his camels, his asses, his 
 flocks. Here are no officers for state, none for sport, no master of 
 the wardrobe, no master of the ceremonies, no master of the horse, no 
 master of the hounds, but all for service, agreeable to the simplicity 
 and plainness of those times.  David was a great soldier, a great 
 scholar, and a great prince, and yet a great husband of his estate, 
 kept a great deal of ground in his own hand, and stocked it, not for 
 pleasure, but for profit; for the king himself is <I>served of the 
 field,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:9">Eccles. v. 9</A>.

 Those magistrates that would have their subjects industrious must
 themselves be examples of industry and application to business. We 
 find, however, that afterwards the poor of the land were thought good 
 enough to be vine-dressers and husbandmen,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:12">2 Kings xxv. 12</A>.

 Now David put his great men to preside in these employments. 

 2. The attendants on the king's person. They were such as were eminent
 for wisdom, being designed for conversation. His uncle, who was a wise 
 man and a scribe, not only well skilled in politics, but well read in 
 the scriptures, was his counsellor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Another, who no doubt excelled in learning and prudence, was tutor to
 his children.  Ahithophel, a very cunning man, was his counsellor: but 
 Hushai, an honest man, was his companion and confidant. It does not 
 appear that he had many counsellors; but those he had were men of great 
 abilities.  Much of the wisdom of princes is seen in the choice of 
 their ministry.  But David, though he had all these trusty and 
 well-beloved cousins and counsellors about him, preferred his Bible 
 before them all. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:24">Ps. cxix. 24</A>,

 <I>Thy testimonies are my delight and my counsellors.</I></P>
