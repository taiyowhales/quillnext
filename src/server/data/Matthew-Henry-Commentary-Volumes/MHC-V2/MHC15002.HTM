 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now these <I>are</I> the children of the province that went up out
 of the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom
 Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon,
 and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city;
 &nbsp; 2  Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah,
 Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe here, 

 1. That an account was kept in writing of the families that came up out 
 of captivity, and the numbers of each family.  This was done for their 
 honour, as part of their recompence for their faith and courage, their 
 confidence in God and their affection to their own land, and to stir up 
 others to follow their good example. Those that honour God he will thus 
 honour. The names of all those Israelites indeed that accept the offer 
 of deliverance by Christ shall be found, to their honour, in a more 
 sacred record than this, even in <I>the Lamb's book of life.</I> The 
 account that was kept of the families that came up from the captivity 
 was intended also for the benefit of posterity, that they might know 
 from whom they descended and to whom they were allied. 

 2. That they are called <I>children of the province.</I> Judah, which 
 had been an illustrious kingdom, to which other kingdoms had been made 
 provinces, subject to it and dependent on it, was now itself made a 
 province, to receive laws and commissions from the king of Persia and 
 to be accountable to him. See how sin diminishes and debases a nation, 
 which righteousness would exalt. But by thus being made servants (as 
 the patriarchs by being sojourners in a country which was theirs by 
 promise) they were reminded of the <I>better country, that is, the 
 heavenly</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:16">Heb. xi. 16</A>),

 a <I>kingdom which cannot be moved,</I> or changed into a province. 

 3.  That they are said to come <I>every one to his city,</I> that is,
 the city appointed them, in which appointment an eye, no doubt, was had 
 to their former settlement by Joshua; and to that, as near as might be, 
 they returned: for it does not appear that any others, at least any 
 that were able to oppose them, had possessed them in their absence. 

 4.  That the leaders are first mentioned,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Zerubbabel and Jeshua were their Moses and Aaron, the former their
 chief prince, the latter their chief priest.  Nehemiah and Mordecai are 
 mentioned here; some think not the same with the famous men we 
 afterwards meet with of those names: probably they were the same, but 
 afterwards returned to court for the service of their country. 

 5. Some of these several families are named from the persons that were 
 their ancestors, others from the places in which they had formerly 
 resided; as with us many surnames are the proper names of persons, 
 others of places. 

 6. Some little difference there is between the numbers of some of the 
 families here and in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:5-73">Neh. vii.</A>,

 where this catalogue is repeated, which might arise from this, that
 some who had given in their names at first to come afterwards drew 
 back--said, <I>I go, Sir, but went not,</I> which would lessen the 
 number of the families they belonged to; others that declined, at 
 first, <I>afterwards repented and went,</I> and so increased the 
 number.

 7.  Here are two families that are called <I>the children of Elam</I>
 (one

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>,
 
 another

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 and, which is strange, the number of both is the same, 1254. 

 8. The children of Adonikam, which signifies <I>a high lord,</I> were
 666, just the <I>number of the beast</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:18">Rev. xiii. 18</A>),
 
 which is there said to be <I>the number of a man,</I> which, Mr. Hugh
 Broughton thinks, has reference to this man. 

 9. The children of Bethlehem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)

 were but 123, though it was David's city; for Bethlehem was <I>little 
 among the thousands of Judah,</I> yet there must the Messiah arise,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:2">Mic. v. 2</A>.

 10. Anathoth had been a famous place in the tribe of Benjamin and yet
 here it numbered but 128

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 which is to be imputed to the divine curse which the men of Anathoth
 brought upon themselves by persecuting Jeremiah, who was of their city.  
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+11:21,23">Jer. xi. 21, 23</A>,

 <I>There shall be no remnant of them, for I will bring evil upon the
 men of Anathoth.</I> And see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:30">Isa. x. 30</A>,

 <I>O poor Anathoth!</I> Nothing brings ruin on a people sooner than
 persecution.</P>

 of Giddel,
 &nbsp; 57  The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the
 children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Ami.
 &nbsp; 58  All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants,
 <I>were</I> three hundred ninety and two.
 &nbsp; 59  And these <I>were</I> they which went up from Telmelah, Telharsa,
 Cherub, Addan, <I>and</I> Immer: but they could not show their
 father's house, and their seed, whether they <I>were</I> of Israel:
 &nbsp; 60  The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the
 children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.
 &nbsp; 61  And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah,
 the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which took a wife
 of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after
 their name:
 &nbsp; 62  These sought their register <I>among</I> those that were reckoned
 by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as
 polluted, put from the priesthood.
 &nbsp; 63  And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat
 of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim
 and with Thummim.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is an account, 

 I. Of the priests that returned, and they were a considerable number, 
 about a tenth part of the whole company: for the whole were above 
 42,000 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:64"><I>v.</I> 64</A>),

 and four families of priests made up above 4200 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:36-39"><I>v.</I>  36-39</A>);

 thus was the tenth God's part--a blessed decimation. Three of the 
 fathers of the priests here named were heads of courses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+24:7,8,14">1 Chron. xxiv. 7, 8, 14</A>.

 The fourth was Pashur, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 If these were of the posterity of that Pashur that abused Jeremiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:1">Jer. xx. 1</A>),

 it is strange that so bad a man should have so good a seed, and so
 numerous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the Levites. I cannot but wonder at the small number of them, 
 for, taking in both the singers and the porters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:40-42"><I>v.</I> 40-42</A>),

 they did not make 350. Time was when the Levites were more forward to 
 their duty than the priests

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:34">2 Chron. xxix. 34</A>),

 but they were not so now. If one place, one family, has the reputation
 for pious zeal now, another may have it another time. <I>The wind blows 
 where it listeth,</I> and shifts its points.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Of the Nethinim, who, it is supposed, were the Gibeonites, 
 <I>given</I> (so their name signifies) by Joshua first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:27">Josh. ix. 27</A>),

 and again by David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+8:20">Ezra viii. 20</A>),

 when Saul had expelled them, to be employed by the Levites in the work
 of God's house as hewers of wood and drawers of water; and, with them, 
 of the children of Solomon's servants, whom he gave for the like use 
 (whether they were Jews or Gentiles does not appear) and who were here 
 taken notice of among the retainers of the temple and numbered with the 
 Nethinim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:55,58"><I>v.</I> 55, 58</A>.

 Note, It is an honour to belong to God's house, though in the meanest
 office there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Of some that were looked upon as Israelites by birth, and others as 
 priests, and yet could not make out a clear title to the honour. 

 1.  There were some that could not prove themselves Israelites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:59,60"><I>v.</I> 59, 60</A>),
 
 a considerable number, who presumed they were of the seed of Jacob, but 
 could not produce their pedigrees, and yet would go up to Jerusalem, 
 having an affection to the house and people of God. These shamed those 
 who were true-born Israelites, and yet were not called Israelites 
 indeed, <I>who came out of the waters of Judah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:1">Isa. xlviii. 1</A>),

 but had lost the relish of those waters. 

 2. There were others that could not prove themselves priests, and yet
 were supposed to be of the seed of Aaron. What is not preserved in 
 black and white will, in all likelihood, be forgotten in a little time. 
 Now we are here told,

 (1.) How they lost their evidence. One of their ancestors married a
 daughter of Barzillai, that great man whom we read of in David's time; 
 he gloried in an alliance to that honourable family, and, preferring 
 that before the dignity of his priesthood, would have his children 
 called after Barzillai's family, and their pedigree preserved in the 
 registers of that house, not of the house of Aaron, and so they lost 
 it. In Babylon there was nothing to be got by the priesthood, and 
 therefore they cared not for being akin to it. Those who think their 
 ministry, or their relation to ministers, a diminution or disparagement 
 to them, forget who it was that said, <I>I magnify my office.</I>

 (2.) What they lost with it. It could not be taken for granted that
 they were priests when they could not produce their proofs, but they 
 were, <I>as polluted, put from the priesthood.</I> Now that the priests 
 had recovered their rights, and had the altar to live upon again, they
 would gladly be looked upon as priests. But they had sold their
 birthright for the honour of being gentlemen, and therefore were justly
 degraded, and forbidden to <I>eat of the most holy things.</I> Note,
 Christ will be ashamed of those that are ashamed of him and his
 service. It was the tirshatha, or governor, that put them under this
 sequestration, which some understand of Zerubbabel the present
 governor, others of Nehemiah (who is so called,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:9,10:1">Neh. viii. 9, x. 1</A>,

 and who gave this order when he came some years after); but the
 prohibition was not absolute, it was only a suspension, till there 
 should be a high priest <I>with Urim and Thummin,</I> by whom they 
 might know God's mind in this matter. This, it seems, was expected and 
 desired, but it does not appear that ever they were blessed with it 
 under the second temple.  They had the canon of the Old Testament 
 complete, which was better than Urim; and, by the want of that oracle, 
 they were taught to expect the Messiah the great Oracle, which the Urim 
 and Thummim was but a type of.  Nor does it appear that the second 
 temple had the ark in it, either the old one or a new one. Those 
 shadows by degrees vanished, as the substance approached; and God, by 
 the prophet, intimates to his people that they should sustain no damage 
 by the want of the ark, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:16,17">Jer. iii. 16, 17</A>.

 <I>In those days,</I> when <I>they shall call Jerusalem the throne of
 the Lord,</I> and <I>all the nations shall be gathered</I> to it, they 
 shall <I>say no more, The ark of the covenant of the Lord, neither 
 shall it come to mind,</I> for they shall do very well without it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>64  The whole congregation together <I>was</I> forty and two thousand
 three hundred <I>and</I> threescore,
 &nbsp; 65  Beside their servants and their maids, of whom <I>there were</I>
 seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and <I>there were</I>
 among them two hundred singing men and singing women.
 &nbsp; 66  Their horses <I>were</I> seven hundred thirty and six; their
 mules, two hundred forty and five;
 &nbsp; 67  Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; <I>their</I> asses,
 six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
 &nbsp; 68  And <I>some</I> of the chief of the fathers, when they came to
 the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> which <I>is</I> at Jerusalem, offered freely for
 the house of God to set it up in his place:
 &nbsp; 69  They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work
 threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand
 pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.
 &nbsp; 70  So the priests, and the Levites, and <I>some</I> of the people,
 and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in
 their cities, and all Israel in their cities.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The sum total of the company that returned out of Babylon.  The 
 particular sums before mentioned amount not quite to 30,000 (29,818),
 so that there were above 12,000 that come out into any of those 
 accounts, who, it is probable, were of the rest of the tribes of 
 Israel, besides Judah and Benjamin, that could not tell of what 
 particular family or city they were, but that they were Israelites, and 
 of what tribe. Now, 

 1. This was more than double the number that were carried captive into 
 Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, so that, as in Egypt, the time of their 
 affliction was the time of their increase. 

 2. These were but few to begin a nation with, and yet, by virtue of the
 old promise made to their fathers, they multiplied so as before their 
 last destruction by the Romans, about 500 years after, to be a very 
 numerous people. When God says, "Increase and multiply," <I>a little 
 one shall become a thousand.</I></P>

 II. Their retinue. They were themselves little better than servants, 
 and therefore no wonder that their servants were comparatively but few 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:65"><I>v.</I> 65</A>)

 and their beasts of burden about as many, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:66,67"><I>v.</I> 66, 67</A>.

 It was not with them now as in days past. But notice is taken of 200
 <I>singing-men and women</I> whom they had among them, who, we will 
 suppose, were intended (as those

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+35:25">2 Chron. xxxv. 25</A>)

 to excite <I>their mourning,</I> for it was foretold that they should,
 upon this occasion, <I>go weeping</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:4">Jer. l. 4</A>),

 with ditties of lamentation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Their oblations. It is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:68,69"><I>v.</I> 68, 69</A>),

 1. That they <I>came to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem;</I> and yet 
 that house, that holy and beautiful house, was now in ruins, a heap of 
 rubbish. But, like their father Abraham, when the altar was gone they 
 came with devotion to <I>the place of the altar</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:4">Gen. xiii. 4</A>);

 and it is the character of the genuine sons of Zion that they favour
 even <I>the dust thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:14">Ps. cii. 14</A>.

 2. That they offered freely towards the <I>setting of it up in its
 place.</I> That, it seems, was the first house they talked of setting 
 up; and though they came off a journey, and were beginning the world 
 (two chargeable things), yet they offered, and offered freely, towards 
 the building of the temple. Let none complain of the necessary expenses 
 of their religion, but believe that when they come to balance the 
 account they will find that it clears the cost. Their offering was 
 nothing in comparison with the offerings of the princes in David's 
 time; then they offered by talents

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:7">1 Chron. xxix. 7</A>),

 now by drams, yet these drams, being after their ability, were as
 acceptable to God as those talents, like the widow's two mites. The 
 61,000 drams of gold amount, by Cumberland's calculation, to so many 
 pounds of our money and so many groats. Every maneh, or pound of 
 silver, he reckons to be sixty shekels (that is, thirty ounces), which 
 we may reckon 7<I>l.</I> 10<I>s.</I> of our money, so that this 5000 
 pounds of silver will be above 37,000<I>l.</I> of our money. It seems, 
 God had blessed them with an increase of their wealth, as well as of 
 their numbers, in Babylon; and, as God had prospered them, they gave 
 cheerfully to the service of his house. 

 3. That they <I>dwelt in their cities,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:70"><I>v.</I> 70</A>.

 Though their cities were out of repair, yet, because they were their
 cities, such as God had assigned them, they were content to dwell in 
 them, and were thankful for liberty and property, though they had 
 little of pomp, plenty, or power. Their poverty was a bad cause, but 
 their unity and unanimity were a good effect of it. Here was room 
 enough for them all and all their substance, so that there was no 
 strife among them, but perfect harmony, a blessed presage of their 
 settlement, as their discords in the latter times of that state were of 
 their ruin.</P>
