 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The date of the events of this chapter is uncertain. I incline to think 
 that they happened as they are here placed, after Absalom's and Sheba's 
 rebellion, and towards the latter end of David's reign. That the 
 battles with the Philistines, mentioned here, were long after the
 Philistines were subdued, appears by comparing

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+18:1,20:4">1 Chron. xviii. 1 with xx. 4</A>.

 The numbering of the people was just before the fixing of the place of
 the temple (as appears 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:1">1 Chron. xxii. 1</A>),

 and that was towards the close of David's life; and, it should seem,
 the people were numbered just after the three years' famine for the 
 Gibeonites, for that which is threatened as "three" years' famine 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:12">1 Chron. xxi. 12</A>)
 
 is called "seven" years

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:12,13">2 Sam. xxiv. 12, 13</A>),

 three more, with the year current, added to those three. We have here,
 
 I. The Gibeonites avenged,

 1. By a famine in the land, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:1">ver. 1</A>.

 2. By the putting of seven of Saul's posterity to death

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:2-9">ver. 2-9</A>), 

 care, however, being taken of their dead bodies, and of the bones of
 Saul,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then there was a famine in the days of David three years,
 year after year; and David enquired of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 answered, <I>It is</I> for Saul, and for <I>his</I> bloody house, because
 he slew the Gibeonites.
 &nbsp; 2 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now
 the Gibeonites <I>were</I> not of the children of Israel, but of the
 remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn
 unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the
 children of Israel and Judah.)
 &nbsp; 3 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for
 you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless
 the inheritance of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>?
 &nbsp; 4 And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor
 gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill
 any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, <I>that</I> will I
 do for you.
 &nbsp; 5 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and
 that devised against us <I>that</I> we should be destroyed from
 remaining in any of the coasts of Israel,
 &nbsp; 6 Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will
 hang them up unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in Gibeah of Saul, <I>whom</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> did
 choose. And the king said, I will give <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 7 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son
 of Saul, because of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s oath that <I>was</I> between them,
 between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.
 &nbsp; 8 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of
 Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the
 five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for
 Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:
 &nbsp; 9 And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and
 they hanged them in the hill before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and they fell <I>all</I>
 seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in
 the first <I>days,</I> in the beginning of barley harvest.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here 

 I. Were are told of the injury which Saul had, long before this, done 
 to the Gibeonites, which we had no account of in the history of his 
 reign, nor should we have heard of it here but that it came now to be 
 reckoned for. The Gibeonites were of the remnant of the Amorites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 who by a stratagem had made peace with Israel, and had the public faith
 pledged to them by Joshua for their safety. We had the story

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:1-27">Josh. ix.</A>,

 where it was agreed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)

 that they should have their lives secured, but be deprived of their
 lands and liberties, that they and theirs should be tenants in 
 villanage to Israel. It does not appear that they had broken their part 
 of the covenant, either by denying their service or attempting to 
 recover their lands or liberties; nor was this pretended; but Saul, 
 under colour of zeal for the honour of Israel, that it might not be 
 said that they had any of the natives among them, aimed to root them 
 out, and, in order to that, slew many of them. Thus he would seem wiser 
 than his predecessors the judges, and more zealous for the public 
 interest; and perhaps he designed it for an instance of his royal 
 prerogative and the power which as king he assumed to rescind the 
 former acts of government and to disannul the most solemn leagues. It 
 may be, he designed, by this severity towards the Gibeonites, to atone 
 for his clemency towards the Amalekites. Some conjecture that he sought 
 to cut off the Gibeonites at the same time when he put away the witches

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+28:3">1 Sam. xxviii. 3</A>),

 or perhaps many of them were remarkably pious, and he sought to destroy
 them when he slew the priests their masters. That which made this an 
 exceedingly sinful sin was that he not only shed innocent blood, but 
 therein violated the solemn oath by which the nation was bound to 
 protect them. See what brought ruin on Saul's house: it was a bloody 
 house.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We find the nation of Israel chastised with a sore famine, long 
 after, for this sin of Saul. Observe, 

 1. Even in the land of Israel, that fruitful land, and in the reign of 
 David, that glorious reign, there was a famine, not extreme (for then 
 notice would sooner have been taken of it and enquiry made into the 
 cause of it), but great drought, and scarcity of provisions, the 
 consequence of it, for three years together. If corn miss one year, 
 commonly the next makes up the deficiency; but, if it miss three years 
 successively, it will be a sore judgment; and the man of wisdom will by 
 it hear God's voice crying to the country to repent of the abuse of 
 plenty. 

 2. David enquired of God concerning it. Though he was himself a
 prophet, he must consult the oracle, and know God's mind in his own 
 appointed way. Note, When we are under God's judgments we ought to 
 enquire into the grounds of the controversy. <I>Lord, show me wherefore 
 thou contendest with me.</I> It is strange that David did not sooner 
 consult the oracle, not till the third year; but perhaps, till then, he 
 apprehended it not to be an extraordinary judgment for some particular 
 sin. Even good men are often slack and remiss in doing their duty. We 
 continue in ignorance, and under mistake, because we delay to enquire.

 3. God was ready in his answer, though David was slow in his enquiries:
 <I>It is for Saul.</I> Note, God's judgments often look a great way 
 back, which obliges us to do so when we are under his rebukes. It is 
 not for us to object against the people's smarting for the sin of their 
 king (perhaps they were aiding and abetting), nor against this 
 generation's suffering for the sin of the last God often <I>visiteth 
 the sins of the fathers upon the children, and his judgments are a 
 great deep.</I> He gives not account of any of his matters. Time does 
 not wear out the guilt of sin; nor can we build hopes of impunity upon 
 the delay of judgments. There is no statute of limitation to be pleaded 
 against God's demands. <I>Nullum tempus occurrit Deo</I>--<I>God may 
 punish when he pleases.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We have vengeance taken upon the house of Saul for the turning 
 away of God's wrath from the land, which, at present, smarted for his 
 sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. David, probably by divine direction, referred it to the Gibeonites
 themselves to prescribe what satisfaction should be given them for the 
 wrong that had been done them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They had many years remained silent, had not appealed to David, nor
 given the kingdom any disturbance with their complaints or demands; and 
 now, at length, God speaks for them (<I>I heard not, for thou wilt 
 hear,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:14,15">Ps. xxxviii. 14, 15</A>);

 and they are recompensed for their patience with this honour, that they
 are made judges in their own case, and have a blank given them to write 
 their demands on: <I>What you shall say, that will I do</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that atonement may be made, and that <I>you may bless the inheritance
 of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It is sad for any family or nation to have the prayers of oppressed
 innocency against them, and therefore the expense of a just restitution 
 is well bestowed for the retrieving of <I>the blessing of those that 
 were ready to perish,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:13">Job xxix. 13</A>.

 "My servant Job, whom you have wronged, shall pray for you," says God,
 "and then I will be reconciled to you, and not till then." Those 
 understand not themselves that value not the prayers of the poor and 
 despised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They desired that seven of Saul's posterity might be put to death, 
 and David granted their demand. 

 (1.) They required no <I>silver, nor gold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Note, Money is no satisfaction for blood, see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+35:31-33">Num. xxxv. 31-33</A>.

 It is the ancient law that blood calls for blood

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:6">Gen. ix. 6</A>);

 and those over-value money and under-value life, that sell the blood of
 their relations for corruptible things, <I>such as silver and gold.</I> 
 The Gibeonites had now a fair opportunity to get a discharge from their 
 servitude, in compensation for the wrong done them, according to the 
 equity of that law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:26">Exod. xxi. 26</A>),

 <I>If a man strike out his servant's eye, he shall let him go free for
 his eye's sake.</I> But they did not insist on this; though the 
 covenant was broken on the other side, it should not be broken on 
 theirs. They were <I>Nethinim,</I> given to God and his people Israel, 
 and they would not seem weary of the service.

 (2.) They required no lives but of Saul's family. He had done them the 
 wrong, and therefore his children must pay for it. We sue the heirs for 
 the parents' debts. Men may not extend this principle so far as life,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:16">Deut. xxiv. 16</A>.

 <I>The children</I> in an ordinary course of law, <I>shall never be put
 to death for the parents.</I> But this case of the Gibeonites was 
 altogether extraordinary. God had made himself an immediate party to 
 the cause and no doubt put it into the heart of the Gibeonites to make 
 this demand, for he owned what was done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and his judgments are not subject to the rules which men's judgments
 must be subject to. Let parents take heed of sin, especially the sin of 
 cruelty and oppression, for their poor children's sake, who may be 
 smarting for it by the just hand of God when they themselves are in 
 their graves. Guilt and a curse are a bad entail upon a family. It 
 should seem, Saul's posterity trod in his steps, for it is called a 
 <I>bloody house;</I> it was the spirit of the family, and therefore 
 they are justly reckoned with for his sin, as well as for their own.

 (3.) They would not impose it upon David to do this execution: <I>Thou 
 shalt not for us kill any man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 but we will do it ourselves, <I>we will hang them up unto the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 that if there were any hardship in it, they might bear the blame, and
 not David or his house. By our old law, if a murderer had judgment 
 given against him upon an appeal, the relations that appealed had the 
 executing of him.

 (4.) They did not require this out of malice against Saul or his family
 (had they been revengeful, they would have moved it themselves long 
 before), but out of love to the people of Israel, whom they saw plagued 
 for the injury done to them: "<I>We will hang them up unto the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 to satisfy his justice, not to gratify any revenge of our own--for the
 good of the public, not for our own reputation."

 (5.) The nomination of the persons they left to David, who took care to 
 secure Mephibosheth for Jonathan's sake, that, while he was avenging 
 the breach of one oath, he might not himself break another 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 but he delivered up two of Saul's sons whom he had by a concubine, and
 five of his grandsons, whom his daughter Merab bore to Adriel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:19">1 Sam. xviii. 19</A>),

 but his daughter Michal brought up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Now Saul's treachery was punished, in giving Merab to Adriel, when he
 had promised her to David, with a design to provoke him. "It is a 
 dangerous matter," says bishop Hall upon this, "to offer injury to any 
 of God's faithful ones; if their meekness have easily remitted it, 
 their God will not pass it over without a severe retribution, though it 
 may be long first."

 (6.) The place, time, and manner, of their execution, all added to the
 solemnity of their being sacrificed to divine justice. 

 [1.] They were hanged up, as anathemas, under a peculiar mark of God's 
 displeasure; for the law had said, <I>He that is hanged is accursed of 
 God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:23,Ga+3:13">Deut. xxi. 23; Gal. iii. 13</A>.

 Christ being made a curse for us, and dying to satisfy for our sins and
 to turn away the wrath of God, became obedient to this ignominious 
 death. 

 [2.] They were hanged up in Gibeah of Saul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 to show that it was for his sin that they died. They were hanged, as it
 were, before their own door, to expiate the guilt of the house of Saul; 
 and thus God accomplished the ruin of that family, for the blood of the 
 priests, and their families, which, doubtless, now came in remembrance 
 before God, and inquisition was made for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:12">Ps. ix. 12</A>.

 Yet the blood of the <I>Gibeonites</I> only is mentioned, because that
 was shed in violation of a sacred oath, which, though sworn long 
 before, though obtained by a wile, and the promise made to Canaanites, 
 yet is thus severely reckoned for. The despising of the oath, and 
 breaking of the covenant, will be recompensed on the head of those who 
 thus profane God's sacred name,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:18,19">Ezek. xvii. 18, 19</A>.

 And thus God would show that with him rich and poor meet together. Even
 royal blood must go to atone for the blood of the Gibeonites, who were 
 but the vassals for the congregation. 

 [3.] They were put to death <I>in the days of harvest</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>at the beginning of harvest</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 to show that they were thus sacrificed for the turning sway of that
 wrath of God which had withheld from them their harvest-mercies for 
 some years past, and to obtain his favour in the present harvest. Thus 
 there is no way of appeasing God's anger but by mortifying and 
 crucifying our lusts and corruptions. In vain do we expect mercy from 
 God, unless we do justice upon our sins. Those executions must not be
 complained of as cruel which have become necessary to the public 
 welfare. Better that seven of Saul's bloody house be hanged than that 
 all Israel be famished.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread
 it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until
 water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the
 birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the
 field by night.
 &nbsp; 11 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
 concubine of Saul, had done.
 &nbsp; 12 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of
 Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, which had stolen
 them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had
 hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:
 &nbsp; 13 And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the
 bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them
 that were hanged.
 &nbsp; 14 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in
 the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his
 father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after
 that God was intreated for the land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. Saul's sons not only hanged, but hanged in chains, their dead bodies 
 left hanging, and exposed, till the judgment ceased, which their death 
 was to turn away, by the sending of rain upon the land. They died as 
 sacrifices, and thus they were, in a manner, offered up, not consumed 
 all at once by fire, but gradually by the air. They died as anathemas, 
 and by this ignominious usage they were represented as execrable, 
 because iniquity was laid upon them. When our blessed Saviour was made 
 sin for us he was made a curse for us. But how shall we reconcile this 
 with the law which expressly required that those who were hanged should 
 be buried on the same day?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:23">Deut. xxi. 23</A>.

 One of the Jewish rabbin wishes this passage of story expunged, <I>that
 the name of God might be sanctified,</I> which, he thinks, is 
 dishonoured by his acceptance of that which was a violation of his law: 
 but this was an extraordinary case, and did not fall within that law; 
 nay, the very reason for that law is a reason for this exception. He
 that is thus left hanged is accursed; therefore ordinary malefactors 
 must not be so abused; but therefore these must, because they were 
 sacrificed, not to the justice of the nation, but for the crime of the 
 nation (no less a crime than the violation of the public faith) and for 
 the deliverance of the nation from no less a judgment than a general 
 famine. Being thus made as the <I>off-scouring of all things,</I> they 
 were made a <I>spectacle to the world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:9,13">1 Cor. iv. 9, 13</A>),

 God appointing, or at least allowing it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their dead bodies watched by Rizpah, the mother of two of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It was a great affliction to her, now in her old age, to see her two
 sons, who, we may suppose, had been a comfort to her, and were likely 
 to be the support of her declining years, cut off in this dreadful 
 manner. None know what sorrows they are reserved for. She may not see 
 them decently interred, but they shall be decently attended. She
 attempts not to violate the sentence passed upon them, that they should 
 hang there till God sent rain; she neither steals nor forces away their 
 dead bodies, though the divine law might have been cited to bear her 
 out; but she patiently submits, pitches a tent of sackcloth near the 
 gibbets, where, with her servants and friends, she protects the dead 
 bodies from birds and beasts of prey. Thus,

 1. She indulged her grief, as mourners are too apt to do, to no good 
 purpose. When sorrow, in such cases, is in danger of growing excessive, 
 we should rather study how to divert and pacify it than how to humour 
 and gratify it. Why should we thus harden ourselves in sorrow? 

 2. She testified her love. Thus she let the world know that her sons
 died, not for any sin of their own, not as stubborn and rebellious 
 sons, <I>whose eye had despised to obey their mother;</I> if that had 
 been the case, she would have suffered the <I>ravens of the valley to 
 pick it out and the young eagles to eat it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:17">Prov. xxx. 17</A>.

 But they died for their father's sin and therefore her mind could not
 be alienated from them by their hard fate. Though there is not remedy, 
 but they must die, yet they shall die pitied and lamented.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The solemn interment of their dead bodies, with the bones of Saul 
 and Jonathan, in the burying-place of their family. David was so far 
 from being displeased at what Rizpah had done that he was himself 
 stirred up by it to do honour to the house of Saul, and to these 
 branches of it among the rest; thus it appeared that it was not out of 
 any personal disgust to the family that he delivered them up, and that 
 he had not desired the woeful day, but that he was obliged to do it for 
 the public good. 

 1. He now bethought himself of removing the bodies of Saul and
 Jonathan from the place where the men of Jabesh-Gilead had decently, 
 but privately and obscurely, interred them, <I>under a tree,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:12,13">1 Sam. xxxi. 12, 13</A>.

 Though the shield of Saul was vilely cast away, as if he had not been
 anointed with oil, yet let not royal dust be lost in the graves of the 
 common people. Humanity obliges us to respect human bodies, especially 
 of the great and good, in consideration both of what they have been and 
 what they are to be. 

 2. With them he buried the bodies <I>of those that were hanged;</I>
 for, when God's anger was turned away, they were no longer to be looked 
 upon as a curse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 When <I>water dropped upon them out of heaven</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 that is, when God sent rain to water the earth (which perhaps was not
 many days after they were hung up), then they were taken down, for then 
 it appeared <I>that God was entreated for the land.</I> When justice is 
 done on earth vengeance from heaven ceases. Through Christ, who was
 hanged on a tree and so made a curse for us, to expiate our guilt 
 (though he was himself guiltless), God is pacified, and is entreated 
 for us: and it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:29">Acts xiii. 29</A>)

 that <I>when they had fulfilled all that was written of him,</I> in
 token of the completeness of the sacrifice and of God's acceptance of 
 it, <I>they took him down from the tree and laid him in a 
 sepulchre.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and
 David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against
 the Philistines: and David waxed faint.
 &nbsp; 16 And Ishbi-benob, which <I>was</I> of the sons of the giant, the
 weight of whose spear <I>weighed</I> three hundred <I>shekels</I> of brass
 in weight, he being girded with a new <I>sword,</I> thought to have
 slain David.
 &nbsp; 17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the
 Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him,
 saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou
 quench not the light of Israel.
 &nbsp; 18 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a
 battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite
 slew Saph, which <I>was</I> of the sons of the giant.
 &nbsp; 19 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines,
 where Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew <I>the
 brother of</I> Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear <I>was</I>
 like a weaver's beam.
 &nbsp; 20 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of
 <I>great</I> stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every
 foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to
 the giant.
 &nbsp; 21 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea the
 brother of David slew him.
 &nbsp; 22 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the
 hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the story of some conflicts with the Philistines, which 
 happened, as it should seem, in the latter end of David's reign. Though 
 he had so subdued them that they could not bring any great numbers into 
 the field, yet as long as they had any giants among them to be their 
 champions, they would never be quiet, but took all occasions to disturb 
 the peace of Israel, to challenge them, or make incursions upon 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David himself was engaged with one of the giants. The Philistines 
 began the war yet again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The enemies of God's Israel are restless in their attempts against
 them. David, though old, desired not a writ of ease from the public 
 service, but he <I>went down</I> in person to fight <I>against the 
 Philistines (Senescit, non segnescit</I>--<I>He grows old, but not 
 indolent</I>), a sign that he fought not for his own glory (at this age
 he was loaded with glory, and needed no more), but for the good of his 
 kingdom. But in this engagement we find him,

 1. In distress and danger. He thought he could bear the fatigues of war 
 as well as he had done formerly; his will was good, and he hoped he 
 could do as at other times. But he found himself deceived; age had cut 
 his hair, and, after a little toil, he <I>waxed faint.</I> His body 
 could not keep pace with his mind. The champion of the Philistines was 
 soon aware of his advantage, perceived that David's strength failed 
 him, and, being himself strong and well-armed, <I>he thought to slay 
 David;</I> but God was not in his thoughts, and therefore in that very 
 day they all perished. The enemies of God's people are often very 
 strong, very subtle, and very sure of success, like Isbi-benob, but 
 there is no strength, nor counsel, nor confidence against the Lord. 

 2. Wonderfully rescued by Abishai, who came seasonably in to his
 relief, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Herein we must own Abishai's courage and fidelity to his prince (to
 save whose life he bravely ventured his own), but much more the good 
 providence of God, which brought him in to David's succour in the 
 moment of his extremity. Such a cause and such a champion, though 
 distressed, shall not be deserted. When <I>Abishai succoured him,</I> 
 gave him a cordial, it may be, to relieve his fainting spirits, or 
 appeared as his second, <I>he</I> (namely, David, so I understand it) 
 <I>smote the Philistine and killed him;</I> for it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 that David had himself a hand in slaying the giants. David fainted, but
 he did not flee; though his strength failed him, he bravely kept his 
 ground, and then God sent him this help in the time of need, which, 
 though brought him by his junior and inferior, he thankfully accepted, 
 and, with a little recruiting, gained his point, and came off a 
 conqueror. Christ, in his agonies, was strengthened by an angel. In 
 spiritual conflicts, even strong saints sometimes wax faint; then Satan 
 attacks them furiously; but those that stand their ground and resist 
 him shall be relieved, and made more than conquerors.

 3. David's servants hereupon resolved that he should never expose
 himself thus any more. They had easily persuaded him not to fight
 against Absalom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:3"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 3</A>),

 but against the Philistines he would go, till, having had this narrow
 escape, it was resolved in council, and confirmed with an oath, that 
 <I>the light of Israel</I> (its guide and glory, so David was) should 
 never be put again into such hazard of being blown out. The lives of 
 those who are as valuable to their country as David was ought to be 
 preserved with a double care, both by themselves and others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The rest of the giants fell by the hand of David's servants. 

 1. Saph was slain by Sibbechai, one of David's worthies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:18,1Ch+11:29"><I>v.</I> 18; 1 Chron. xi. 29</A>.

 2. Another, who was brother to Goliath, was slain by Elhanan, who is
 mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:24"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 24</A>.

 3. Another, who was of very unusual bulk, who had more fingers and toes
 than other people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 and such an unparalleled insolence that, though he had seen the fall of
 other giants, yet he defied Israel, was slain by <I>Jonathan the son of 
 Shimea.</I> Shimea had one son named <I>Jonadab</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+13:3">2 Sam. xiii. 3</A>),

 whom I should have taken for the same with this Jonathan, but that the
 former was noted for subtlety, the latter for bravery. These giants 
 were probably the remains of the sons of Anak, who, though long feared, 
 fell at last. Now observe, 

 (1.) It is folly for the strong man to <I>glory in his strength.</I> 
 David's servants were no bigger nor stronger than other men; yet thus, 
 by divine assistance, they mastered one giant after another. God 
 chooses by the weak things to confound the mighty. 

 (2.) It is common for those to go down slain to the pit who have been 
 <I>the terror of the mighty in the land of the living,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:27">Ezek. xxxii. 27</A>.

 (3.) The most powerful enemies are often reserved for the last
 conflict. David began his glory with the conquest of one giant, and 
 here concludes it with the conquest of four. Death is a Christian's 
 last enemy, and a son of Anak; but, through him that triumphed for us, 
 we hope to be more than conquerors at last, even over that enemy.</P>
