 Things went so very well with Israel, in the chapter before, under 
 Samuel's administration, that, methinks, it is a pity to find him so 
 quickly, as we do in this chapter, old, and going off, and things 
 working towards a revolution. But so it is; Israel's good days seldom 
 continue long. We have here, 
 
 I. Samuel decaying,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. His sons degenerating,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 III. Israel discontented with the present government and anxious to see
 a change. For 

 1. They petition Samuel to set a king over them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 2. Samuel brings the matter to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:6">ver. 6</A>.

 3. God directs him what answer to give them, by way of reproof 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>),

 and by way of remonstrance, setting forth the consequences of a change
 of the government, and how uneasy they would soon be under it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:9-18">ver. 9-18</A>.

 4.  They insist upon their petition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:19,20">ver. 19, 20</A>.

 5. Samuel promises them, from God, that they shall shortly be gratified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:21,22">ver. 21, 22</A>.

 Thus hard is it for people to know when they are well off.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his
 sons judges over Israel.
 &nbsp; 2 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his
 second, Abiah: <I>they were</I> judges in Beer-sheba.
 &nbsp; 3 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after
 lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two sad things we find here, but not strange things:--

 1. A good and useful man growing old and unfit for service

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Samuel was old,</I> and could not judge Israel, as he had done. He
 is not reckoned to be past sixty years of age now, perhaps not so much; 
 but he was a man betimes, was full of thoughts and cared when he was a 
 child, which perhaps hastened the infirmities of age upon him. The 
 fruits that are the first ripe keep the worst. He had spent his 
 strength and spirits in the fatigue of public business, and now, if he 
 think to shake himself as at other times, he finds he is mistaken: old 
 age has cut his hair.  Those that are in the prime of their time ought 
 to be busy in doing the work of life: for, as they go into years, they 
 will find themselves less disposed to it and less able for it. 

 2. The children of a good man turning aside, and not treading in his
 steps.  Samuel had given his sons so good an education, and they had 
 given him such good hopes of their doing well, and gained such a 
 reputation in Israel, that he made them judges, assistants to him 
 awhile, and afterwards deputies under him at Beer-sheba, which lay
 remote from Ramah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Probably the southern countries petitioned for their residence there,
 that they might not be necessitated to travel far with their causes. We
 have reason to think that Samuel gave them their commissions, not
 because they were his sons (he had no ambition to entail the government
 upon his family, any more than Gideon had), but because, for aught that
 yet appeared, they were men very fit for the trust; and none so proper
 to ease the aged judge, and take some of the burden off him, as
 (<I>c&aelig;teris paribus</I>--<I>other things being equal</I>) his own
 sons, who no doubt were respected for their good father's sake, and, 
 having such an advantage at setting out, might soon have been great if 
 they had but been good. But, alas! <I>his sons walked not in his 
 ways</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 
 and, when their character was the reverse of his, their relation to so
 good a man, which otherwise would have been their honour, was really 
 their disgrace. <I>Degeneranti genus opprobrium--A good extraction is a
 reproach to him that degenerates from it.</I> Note, Those that have the 
 most grace themselves cannot give grace to their children. It has often 
 been the grief of good men to see their posterity, instead of treading 
 in their steps, trampling upon them, and, as Job speaks, <I>marring 
 their path.</I> Nay, many that have begun well, promised fair, and set 
 out in the right path, so that their parents and friends have had great 
 hopes of them, yet afterwards have turned aside to by-paths, and been 
 the grief of those of whom they should have been the joy. When Samuel's 
 sons were made judges, and settled at a distance form him, then they 
 discovered themselves. Thus, 

 (1.) Many that have been well educated, and have conducted themselves
 well while they were under their parents' eye, when they have gone 
 abroad into the world and set up for themselves have proved bad. Let 
 none therefore be secure either of themselves or theirs, but depend on 
 divine grace.

 (2.) Many that have done well in a state of meanness and subjection
 have been spoiled by preferment and power. Honours change men's minds, 
 and too often for the worse. It does not appear that Samuel's sons were 
 so profane and vicious as Eli's sons; but, whatever they were in other 
 respects, they were corrupt judges, they <I>turned aside after 
 lucre,</I> after <I>the mammon of unrighteousness,</I> so the Chaldee 
 reads it. Note, <I>The love of money is the root of all evil.</I> It is 
 pernicious in any, but especially in judges. Samuel had taken no bribes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:3"><I>ch.</I> xii. 3</A>),

 but his sons had, though, no doubt, he warned them against it when he
 made them judges; and then they perverted judgment. In determining 
 controversies, they had an eye to the bribe, not to the law, and 
 enquired who bid highest, not who had right on his side. It is sad with 
 a people when the public justice that should do them right, being 
 perverted, does them the greatest wrong.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together,
 and came to Samuel unto Ramah,
 &nbsp; 5 And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk
 not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the
 nations.
 &nbsp; 6 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a
 king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 7 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the
 people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected
 thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over
 them.
 &nbsp; 8 According to all the works which they have done since the day
 that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith
 they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also
 unto thee.
 &nbsp; 9 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest
 solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that
 shall reign over them.
 &nbsp; 10 And Samuel told all the words of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto the people
 that asked of him a king.
 &nbsp; 11 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall
 reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint <I>them</I> for
 himself, for his chariots, and <I>to be</I> his horsemen; and <I>some</I>
 shall run before his chariots.
 &nbsp; 12 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and
 captains over fifties; and <I>will set them</I> to ear his ground, and
 to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and
 instruments of his chariots.
 &nbsp; 13 And he will take your daughters <I>to be</I> confectionaries, and
 <I>to be</I> cooks, and <I>to be</I> bakers.
 &nbsp; 14 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
 oliveyards, <I>even</I> the best <I>of them,</I> and give <I>them</I> to his
 servants.
 &nbsp; 15 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your
 vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.
 &nbsp; 16 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants,
 and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put <I>them</I> to
 his work.
 &nbsp; 17 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his
 servants.
 &nbsp; 18 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which
 ye shall have chosen you; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will not hear you in that
 day.
 &nbsp; 19 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel;
 and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;
 &nbsp; 20 That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king
 may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.
 &nbsp; 21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he
 rehearsed them in the ears of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 22 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and
 make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye
 every man unto his city.
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the starting of a matter perfectly new and surprising, which was the setting up of kingly government in Israel. Perhaps the thing had been often talked of among them by those that were given to change and affected that which looked great.

 But we do not find that it was ever till now publicly proposed and 
 debated. Abimelech was little better than a titular king, though he is 
 said to reign over Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:22">Judges ix. 22</A>),

 and perhaps his fall had for a great while rendered the title of king
 odious in Israel, as that of Tarquinius did among the Romans; but, if 
 it had, by this time the odium was worn off, and some bold steps are 
 here taken towards so great a revolution as that amounted to. Here 
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The address of the elders to Samuel in this matter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>):

 They <I>gathered themselves together,</I> by common consent; and not in
 a riotous tumultuous manner, but with the respect due to his character, 
 they came to him to his house as Ramah with their address, which 
 contained,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A remonstrance of their grievances: in short, <I>Thou art old, and 
 thy sons walk not in thy ways.</I> Many a fairer occasion that people 
 had had to ask a king, when they were oppressed by their neighbours or 
 embroiled at home for want of <I>a king in Israel,</I> but a small 
 thing will serve factious spirits for a colour to desire a change. 

 (1.) It was true that Samuel was old; but if that made him less able to
 ride the circuit, and sit long on the bench, yet it made him the more 
 wise and experienced, and, upon that account, the fitter to rule. If he 
 was old, had he not grown old in their service? And it was very unkind, 
 ungrateful, nay, and unjust, to cast him off when he was old, who had 
 spent his days in doing them good. God had saved his youth from being 
 despicable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:20"><I>ch.</I> iii. 20</A>),

 yet they make his old age so, which should have been counted worthy of
 double honour. If old people be upbraided with their infirmities, and 
 laid aside for them, let them not think it strange; Samuel himself was 
 so. 

 (2.) It was true that his sons did not walk in his ways; the more was
 his grief, but they could not say it was his fault: he had not, like 
 Eli, indulged them in their badness, but was ready to receive 
 complaints against them. And, if that had been the thing desired, we 
 may well suppose, upon the making out of the charge of bribery against 
 them he would have superseded their commissions and punished them. But 
 this would not content the elders of Israel; they had another project 
 in their head.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A petition for the redress of these grievances, by setting a king 
 over them: <I>Make us a king to judge us like all the nations.</I> Thus 
 far it was well, that they did not rise up in rebellion against Samuel 
 and set up a king for themselves, <I>vi et armis--by force;</I> but they
 applied to Samuel, God's prophet, and humbly begged of him to do it. 
 But it appears by what follows that it was an evil proposal and ill 
 made, and was displeasing to God. God designed them a king, a man after 
 his own heart, when Samuel was dead; but they would anticipate God's 
 counsel, and would have one now that Samuel was old. They had a prophet 
 to judge them, that had immediate correspondence with heaven, and 
 therein they were great and happy above any nation, none having God 
 <I>so nigh unto them</I> as they had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:7">Deut. iv. 7</A>.

 But this would not serve; they must have a king to judge them with
 external pomp and power, like <I>all the nations.</I> A poor prophet in 
 a mantle, though conversant in the visions of the Almighty, looked mean 
 in the eyes of those who judged by outward appearance; but a king in a 
 purple robe, with his guards and officers of state, would look great: 
 and such a one they must have. They knew it was in vain to court Samuel 
 to take upon him the title and dignity of a king, but he must appoint 
 them one. They do not say, "Give us a king that is wise and good, and 
 will judge better than thy sons do," but, "Give us a king," any body 
 that will but make a figure. Thus foolishly did they forsake their own 
 mercies, and, under pretence of advancing the dignity of their nation 
 to that of their neighbours, did really thrust themselves down from 
 their own excellency, and profane their crown by <I>casting it to the 
 ground.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Samuel's resentment of this address, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Let us see how he took it.

 1. It cut him to the heart. Probably it was a surprise to him, and he
 had not any intimation before of their design, which made it the more 
 grievous. The thing displeased Samuel; not when they upbraided him with 
 his own infirmities and his children's irregularities (he could 
 patiently bear what reflected on himself and his own family), but it 
 <I>displeased him when they said, Give us a king to judge us,</I> 
 because that reflected upon God and his honour. 

 2. It drove him to his knees; he gave them no answer for the present,
 but took time to consider of what they proposed, and prayed unto the 
 Lord for direction what to do, spreading the case before him and 
 leaving it with him, and so making himself easy. Samuel was a man much 
 in prayer, and we are encouraged <I>in every thing to make our requests 
 known to God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:6">Phil. iv. 6</A>.

 When any thing disturbs us, it is our interest, as well as our duty, to
 show before God our trouble, and he gives us leave to be humbly free 
 with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The instruction God gave him concerning this matter. Those that in 
 straits seek to God shall find him nigh unto them, and ready to direct 
 them. He tells him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That which would be an allay to his displeasure. Samuel was much 
 disturbed at the proposal: it troubled him greatly to see his prophetic 
 office thus slighted, and all the good turns he had done to Israel thus 
 ungratefully returned; but God tells him he must not think it either 
 hard or strange. 

 (1.) He must not think it hard that they had put this slight upon him,
 for they had herein put a slight upon God himself: "<I>They have not 
 rejected thee</I> only, but <I>they have rejected me.</I> I share with 
 thee in the affront," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Note, If God interest himself in the indignities that are done us, and
 the contempts that are put upon us, we may well afford to bear them 
 patiently; nor need we think the worse of ourselves if <I>for his sake 
 we bear reproach</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:7">Ps. lxix. 7</A>),

 but rather rejoice and count it an honour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:24">Col. i. 24</A>.

 Samuel must not complain that they were weary of his government, though
 just and gentle, for really they were weary of God's government; this 
 was what they disliked: <I>They have rejected me, that I should not 
 reign over them.</I> God <I>reigns over the heathen</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:8">Ps. xlvii. 8</A>),

 over all the world, but the government of Israel had hitherto been, in
 a more peculiar manner than ever any government was, a Theocracy, a 
 divine government; their judges had their call and commission 
 immediately from God; the affairs of their nation were under his 
 peculiar direction. As the constitution, so the administration of their 
 government, was by <I>Thus saith the Lord;</I> this method they were 
 weary of, though it was their honour and safety, above any thing, so 
 long as they kept in with God. They were indeed so much the more 
 exposed to calamities if they provoked God to anger by sin, and found 
 they could not transgress at so cheap a rate as other nations could, 
 which perhaps was the true reason why they desired to stand upon the 
 same terms with God that other nations did.

 (2.) He must not think it strange, nor marvel at the matter, for they
 do as they always have done: <I>According to all the works which they 
 have done, since the day that I brought them out of Egypt, so do they 
 unto thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>;

 They had at first been so very respectful and obsequious to Samuel that
 he began to hope they were cured of their old stubborn disposition; but 
 now he found himself deceived in them, and must not be surprised at it.  
 They had always been rude to their governors, witness Moses and Aaron; 
 nay, <I>They have forsaken me and served other gods;</I> the greatness 
 of their crime, in affecting new gods, may make this crime of affecting 
 new governors seem little.  Samuel might expect they would deal 
 treacherously, for they were called <I>transgressors from the womb,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:8">Isa. xlviii. 8</A>.

 This had been <I>their manner from their youth up,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:21">Jer. xxii. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He tells him that which would be an answer to their demand. Samuel 
 would not have known what to say if God had not instructed him. Should 
 he oppose the motion, it would bespeak a greater fondness of power and 
 dominion than did become a prophet, and an indulgence of his sons. 
 Should he yield to the motion, it would look like the betraying of his 
 trust, and he would become accessory to all the bad consequences of a 
 change. Aaron sinned in gratifying the people when they said, <I>Make 
 us gods;</I> Samuel dares not therefore comply with them when they say, 
 <I>Make us a king,</I> but he gives them, with assurance, the answer 
 God sent them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He must tell them that <I>they shall have a king. Hearken to the 
 voice of the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>,
 
 and again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Not that God was pleased with their request, but, as sometimes he
 crosses us in love, so at other times he gratifies us in wrath; he did 
 so here. When they said, <I>Give us a king and princes he gave them a 
 king in his anger</I> (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+13:10,11">Hos. xiii. 10, 11</A>),

 as he gave them quails, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:5,Ps+78:29">Ps. cvi. 15; lxxviii. 29</A>.

 God bade Samuel humour them in this matter,

 [1.] That they might be beaten with their own rod, and might feel, to
 their cost, the difference between his government and the government of 
 a king; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:8">2 Chron. xii. 8</A>.

 It soon appeared how much worse their condition was, in all respects,
 under Saul, than it had been under Samuel. 

 [2.] To prevent something worse. If they were not gratified, they would
 either rise in rebellion against Samuel or universally revolt from 
 their religion and admit the gods of the nations, that they might have 
 kings like them.  Rather than so, let them have a king. 

 [3.] God knows how to bring glory to himself out of it, and to serve
 his own wise purposes even by their foolish counsels.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) But he must tell them, withal, that when they have a king they 
 will soon have enough of him, and will, when it is too late, repent of 
 their choice. This he must <I>protest solemnly to them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 that, if they would have a king to rule them, as the eastern kings
 ruled their subjects, they would find the yoke exceedingly heavy. They 
 looked only at the pomp or magnificence of a king, and thought that 
 would make their nation great and considerable among its neighbours, 
 and would strike a terror upon their enemies; but he must bid them 
 consider how they would like to bear the charges of that pomp, and how 
 they would endure that arbitrary power which the neighbouring kings 
 assumed. Note, Those that set their hearts inordinately upon any thing 
 in this world ought, for the moderating of their desires, to consider 
 the inconveniences as well as the conveniences that will attend it, and 
 to set the one over against the other in their thoughts. Those that 
 submit to the government of the world and the flesh are told plainly 
 what hard masters they are, and what a tyranny the dominion of sin is; 
 and yet they will exchange God's government for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Samuel's faithful delivery of God's mind to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He <I>told them all the words of the Lord,</I> how ill he resented it,
 that he construed it a rejecting of him, and compared it with their 
 serving other gods,--that he would grant their request if they insisted 
 on it, but withal had ordered him to represent to them the certain 
 consequences of their choice, that they would be such that if they had 
 any reason left them, and would allow themselves to consult their own 
 interest, they would withdraw their petition, and beg to continue as 
 they were. Accordingly he lays before them, very particularly, what 
 would be, not the right of a king in general, but <I>the manner of the 
 king that should reign over them,</I> according to the pattern of the 
 nations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Samuel does not speak (as bishop Patrick expounds it) of a just and
 honest right of a king to do these things, for his right is quite 
 otherwise described in that part of Moses's law which concerns the 
 king's duty, but such a right as the kings of the nations had then 
 acquired. <I>This shall be the manner of the king,</I> that is, "thus 
 he must support his dignity at the expense of that which is dearest to 
 you, and thus he will abuse his power, as those that have power are apt 
 to do; and, having the militia in his hand, you will be under a 
 necessity of submitting to him."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. If they will have such a king as the nations have, let them 
 consider, 

 (1.) That king must have a great retinue, abundance of servants to wait
 on him, grooms to look after his chariots and horses, gentlemen to ride 
 about with him, and footmen to run before his chariots. This is the 
 chief grandeur of princes, and the imaginary glory of great men, to 
 have a multitude of attendants. And whence must he have these? "Why, he 
 will take your sons, who are free-born, have a liberal education, and 
 whom you now have at your own disposal, and will <I>appoint them for 
 himself,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They must wait upon him, and be at his beck; those that used to work
 for their parents and themselves must work for him, <I>ear his ground, 
 and reap his harvest</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and count it their preferment too, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 This would be a great change.

 (2.) He must keep a great table; he will not be content to dine with
 his neighbours upon a sacrifice, as Samuel used to do

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:13"><I>ch.</I> ix. 13</A>);

 but he must have a variety of dainty dishes, forced meats, and
 sweet-meats, and delicate sauces; and who must prepare him these? "Why, 
 he will take your daughters, the most ingenious and handy of them, whom 
 you hoped to prefer to houses and tables of their own; and, whether you 
 be willing or no, they must be his confectioners, and cooks, and 
 bakers, and the like." 

 (3.) "He must needs have a standing army, for guards and garrisons; and
 your sons, instead of being elders of your cities, and living in quiet 
 and honour at home, must be captains over thousands and captains over 
 fifties, and must be disposed of at the pleasure of the sovereign."

 (4.) "You may expect that he will have great favourites, whom, having
 dignified and ennobled, he must enrich, and give them estates suitable 
 to their honour; and which way can he do that, but out of your 
 inheritances? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 <I>He will take your fields and vineyards,</I> which descended to you
 from your ancestors, and which you hoped to leave to your posterity 
 after you, <I>even the best of them;</I> and will not only take them to 
 himself (you could bear that better), but he will <I>give them to his 
 servants,</I> who will be your masters, and bear rule over that for 
 which you have laboured, How will you like that?"

 (5.) "He must have great revenues to maintain his grandeur and power
 with; and whence must he have them but from you? He will take the tenth 
 of the fruits of your ground

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and your cattle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 You think the tenths, the double tenths, which the law of God has
 appointed for the support of the church, grievous enough, and grudge 
 the payment of them; but, if you have a king, there must issue another 
 tenth out of your estates, which will be levied with more rigour, for 
 the support of the royal dignity. Consider the expense with the 
 magnificence, and whether it will quit cost."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. These would be their grievances, and, 

 (1.) They would have none but God to complain to. Once they complained
 to the prince himself, and were answered, according to the manner of 
 the king, Your <I>yoke is heavy, and I will add to it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:11">1 Kings xii. 11</A>.

 (2.) When they complained to God he <I>would not hear them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 Nor could they expect that he should, both because they had been deaf
 to his calls and admonitions, and this trouble, in particular, they had 
 brought upon themselves by rejecting him, and would not believe when he 
 told them what would come of it. Note, When we bring ourselves into 
 distress by our own irregular desires and projects we justly forfeit 
 the comfort of prayer and the benefit of divine aids, and, if God be 
 not better to us than we deserve, must have our relief in our own 
 hands, and then it is bad with us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The people's obstinacy in their demand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 One would think such a representation of the consequences as this was,
 coming from God himself, who can neither deceive by his word nor be 
 deceived in his knowledge, should have prevailed with them to waive 
 their request: but their hearts were upon it, right or wrong, good or 
 evil: "<I>We will have a king over us,</I> whatever God or Samuel say 
 to the contrary; we will have a king, whatever it cost us, and whatever 
 inconvenience we bring upon ourselves or our posterity by it." See 
 their folly.

 1. They were quite deaf to reason and blind to their own interest. They
 could not answer Samuel's arguments against it, nor deny the force of 
 them, and yet they grow more violent in their request, and more 
 insolent.  Before it was, "Pray, <I>make us a king;</I>" now it is, 
 "<I>Nay, but we will have a king;</I> yea, that we will, because we 
 will; nor will we bear to have any thing said against it." See the 
 absurdity of inordinate desires, and how they rob men of their reason. 
 
 2. They could not stay God's time. God had intimated to them in the law
 that, in due time, Israel should have a king

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:14,15">Deut. xvii. 14, 15</A>),

 and perhaps they had some intimation that the time was at hand; but
 they are all in haste: "We, in our day, will have this king over us." 
 Could they but have waited ten or twelve years longer they would have 
 had David, a king of God's giving in mercy, and all the calamities that 
 attended the setting up of Saul would have been prevented. Sudden 
 resolves and hasty desires make work for a long and leisurely 
 repentance. 

 3. That which they aimed at in desiring a king was not only, as before,
 that they might be like the nations, and levelled with the one above 
 whom God had so far advanced them, but that they might have one to 
 judge them, and to go out before them when they took the field, and to 
 fight their battles.  Foolish people and unwise! Could they ever desire 
 a battle better fought for them that the last was, by Samuel's prayer 
 and God's thunder?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:10"><I>ch.</I>  vii. 10</A>.

 Was victory hereby too sure to them? And were they fond of trying the
 chance of war at the same uncertainty that others did? So sick, it 
 seems, were they of their privileges: and what was the issue? Their 
 first king was slain in a battle, which none of their judges ever were; 
 so was Josiah, one of the last and best.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The dismissing of them with an intimation that very shortly they 
 should have what they asked. 

 1. <I>Samuel rehearsed all their words in the ears of the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Not but that God perfectly knew it, without Samuel's report; but thus
 he dealt faithfully between God and Israel, as a prophet, returning the 
 answer to him that sent him; and thus he waited on God for further 
 direction. God is fully acquainted with the state of the case we are in 
 care and doubt about, but he will know it from us.  His rehearsing it 
 <I>in the ears of the Lord</I> intimates that it was done in private; 
 for the people were not disposed to join with him in prayer to God for 
 direction in this matter; also it bespeaks a holy familiarity, to which 
 God graciously admits his people: they speak in the ears of the Lord, 
 as one friend whispers with another; their communion with God is 
 <I>meat they have to eat which the world knows not of,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:32">John iv. 32</A>.

 2. God gave direction that they should have a king, since they were so
 inordinately set upon it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:22"><I>v.</I>  22</A>):

 "<I>Make them a king,</I> and let them make their best of him, and
 thank themselves if that very pomp and power which they are so eager to 
 see their sovereign in be their plague and burden." <I>So he gave them 
 up to their own hearts' lusts.</I> Samuel told them this, but sent them 
 home for the present, <I>every man to his city;</I> for the designation 
 of the person must be left to God; they had now no more to do. When God 
 saw fit to notify the choice to Samuel they should hear further from 
 him; in the mean time let them keep the peace and expect the issue.</P>
