 This chapter is the history of the reign of Ahaz the son of Jotham; a 
 bad reign it was, and which helped to augment the fierce anger of the 
 Lord. We have here, 

 I. His great wickedness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. The trouble he brought himself into by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:5-8">ver. 5-8</A>.

 III. The reproof which God sent by a prophet to the army of Israel for
 trampling upon their brethren of Judah, and the obedient ear they gave
 to that reproof, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:9-15">ver.  9-15</A>.

 IV. The many calamities that followed to Ahaz and his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:16-21">ver. 16-21</A>.

 V. The continuance of his idolatry notwithstanding 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:22-25">ver. 22-25</A>),

 and so his story ends,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:26,27">ver. 26, 27</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Ahaz <I>was</I> twenty years old when he began to reign, and he
 reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not <I>that which
 was</I> right in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, like David his father:
 &nbsp; 2  For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made
 also molten images for Baalim.
 &nbsp; 3  Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom,
 and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the
 heathen whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had cast out before the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 4  He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and
 on the hills, and under every green tree.
 &nbsp; 5  Wherefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God delivered him into the hand of the
 king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great
 multitude of them captives, and brought <I>them</I> to Damascus. And
 he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who
 smote him with a great slaughter.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Never surely had a man greater opportunity of doing well than Ahaz had, 
 finding things in a good posture, the kingdom rich and strong and 
 religion established; and yet here we have him in these few verses, 

 1.  Wretchedly corrupted and debauched. He had had a good education
 given him and a good example set him: but parents cannot give grace to 
 their children. All the instructions he had were lost upon him: <I>He 
 did not that which was right in the sight of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 nay, he did a great deal that was wrong, a wrong to God, to his own
 soul, and to his people; he walked in the way of the revolted 
 Israelites and the devoted Canaanites, made molten images and 
 worshipped them, contrary to the second commandment; nay, he made them 
 for Baalim, contrary to the first commandment. He forsook the temple of
 the Lord and sacrificed and burnt incense on the hills, as if they 
 would place him nearer heaven, and under every green tree, as if they 
 would signify the protection and influence of heaven by their shade and 
 dropping. To complete his wickedness, as one perfectly divested of all 
 natural affection as well as religion and perfectly devoted to the 
 service and interest of the great enemy of mankind, he <I>burnt his 
 children in the fire to Moloch</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 not thinking it enough to dedicate them to that infernal fiend by
 causing them to pass through the fire. See what an absolute sway the 
 prince of the power of the air bears among the children of 
 disobedience. 

 2. Wretchedly spoiled and made a prey of.  When he forsook God, and at
 a vast expense put himself under the protection of false gods, God, who 
 of right was his God, delivered him into the hands of his enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 (1.) The Syrians insulted him and triumphed over him, beat him in the
 field and carried away a great many of his people into captivity.

 (2.) The king of Israel, though an idolater too, was made a scourge to
 him, and <I>smote him with a great slaughter.</I> The people suffered 
 by these judgments: their blood was shed, their country wasted, their 
 families ruined; for when they had a good king, though <I>they did 
 corruptly</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+27:2"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 2</A>),

 yet then his goodness sheltered them; but now that they had a bad one
 all the defence had departed from them and an inundation of judgments 
 broke in upon them. Those that knew not their happiness in the 
 foregoing reign were taught to value it by the miseries of this 
 reign.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and
 twenty thousand in one day, <I>which were</I> all valiant men; because
 they had forsaken the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of their fathers.
 &nbsp; 7  And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's
 son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah <I>that
 was</I> next to the king.
 &nbsp; 8  And the children of Israel carried away captive of their
 brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and
 took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to
 Samaria.
 &nbsp; 9  But a prophet of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was there, whose name <I>was</I> Oded:
 and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said
 unto them, Behold, because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of your fathers was wroth
 with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have
 slain them in a rage <I>that</I> reacheth up unto heaven.
 &nbsp; 10  And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and
 Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: <I>but are there</I> not
 with you, even with you, sins against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God?
 &nbsp; 11  Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which
 ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> upon you.
 &nbsp; 12  Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim,
 Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth,
 and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai,
 stood up against them that came from the war,
 &nbsp; 13  And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives
 hither: for whereas we have offended against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>already,</I>
 ye intend to add <I>more</I> to our sins and to our trespass: for our
 trespass is great, and <I>there is</I> fierce wrath against Israel.
 &nbsp; 14  So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the
 princes and all the congregation.
 &nbsp; 15  And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took
 the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked
 among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat
 and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of
 them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm
 trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Treacherous Judah under the rebukes of God's providence, and they 
 are very severe. Never was such bloody work made among them since they 
 were a kingdom, and by Israelites too. Ahaz walked in the ways of the 
 kings of Israel, and the king of Israel was the instrument God made use 
 of for his punishment. It is just with God to make those our plagues 
 whom we make our patterns or make ourselves partners with in sin. A war 
 broke out between Judah and Israel, in which Judah was worsted. For, 

 1.  There was a great slaughter of men in the field of battle. Vast
 numbers (120,000 men, and valiant men too at other times) were slain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 and some of the first rank, the king's son for one. He had sacrificed
 some of this sons to Moloch; justly therefore is this sacrificed to the 
 divine vengeance. Here is another that was <I>next the king,</I> his 
 friend, the prime-minister of state, or perhaps next him in the battle, 
 so that the king himself had a narrow escape, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The kingdom of Israel was not strong at this time, and yet strong
 enough to bring this great destruction upon Judah. But certainly so 
 many men, great men, stout men, could not have been cut off in one day 
 if they had not been strangely dispirited both by the consciousness of 
 their own guilt and by the righteous hand of God upon them. Even 
 valiant men were numbered <I>as sheep for the slaughter,</I> and became 
 an easy prey to the enemy <I>because they had forsaken the Lord God of 
 their fathers,</I> and he had therefore forsaken them.

 2. There was a great captivity of <I>women and children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 When the army in the field was routed, the cities, and towns, and
 country villages, were all easily stripped, the inhabitants taken for 
 slaves, and their wealth for a prey.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Even victorious Israel under the rebuke of God's word for the bad 
 principle they had gone upon in making war with Judah and the bad use 
 they had made of their success, and the good effect of this rebuke. 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The message which God sent them by a prophet, who went out to meet 
 them, not to applaud their valour or congratulate them on their 
 victory, though they returned laden with spoils and triumphs, but in 
 God's name to tell them of their faults and warn them of the judgments 
 of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He told them how they came by this victory of which they were so 
 proud. It was not because God favoured them, or that they had merited 
 it at his hand, but <I>because he was wroth with Judah,</I> and made 
 them the rod of his indignation. <I>Not for your righteousness,</I> be 
 it known to you, but <I>for their wickedness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:5">Deut. ix. 5</A>)

 <I>they are broken off;</I> therefore <I>be not you high-minded, but
 fear lest God also spare not you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:20,21">Rom. xi. 20, 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He charged them with the abuse of the power God had given them 
 over their brethren. Those understand not what victory is who think it 
 gives them authority to do what they will, and that the longest sword 
 is the clearest claim to lives and estates (<I>Jusque datum 
 sceleri</I>--<I>might is right</I>); no, as it is impolitic not to use a
 victory, so it is impious to abuse it. The conquerors are here 
 reproved, 

 [1.] For the cruelty of the slaughter they had made in the field. They
 had indeed <I>shed the blood of war in war;</I> we suppose that to be 
 lawful, but it turned into sin to them, because they did it from a bad 
 principle of enmity to their brethren and after a bad manner, with a 
 barbarous fury, <I>a rage reaching up to heaven,</I> that is, that 
 cried to God for vengeance against such bloody men, that delighted in 
 military execution. Those that serve God's justice, if they do it with 
 rage and a spirit of revenge, make themselves obnoxious to it, and 
 forfeit the honour of acting for him; <I>for the wrath of man worketh 
 not the righteousness of God.</I> 

 [2.] For the imperious treatment they gave their prisoners. "<I>You now
 purpose to keep them under,</I> to use them or sell them as slaves, 
 though they are your brethren and free-born Israelites." God takes 
 notice of what men purpose, as well as of what they say and do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He reminded them of their own sins, by which they also were 
 obnoxious to the wrath of God: <I>Are there not with you, even with 
 you, sins against the Lord your God?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He appeals to their own consciences, and to the notorious evidence of
 the thing. "Though you are now made the instruments of correcting Judah 
 for sin, yet do not think that you are therefore innocent yourselves; 
 no, you also are guilty before God." This is intended as a check,

 [1.] To their triumph in their success. "You are sinners, and it ill
 becomes sinners to be proud; you have carried the day now, but be not 
 secure, the wheel may ere long return upon yourselves, for, if judgment 
 begin thus with those that have <I>the house of God</I> among them, 
 what shall be the end of such as worship the calves?" 

 [2.] To their severity towards their brethren. "You have now got them
 under, but you ought to show mercy to them, for you yourselves are 
 undone if you do not find mercy with God.  It ill becomes sinners to be 
 cruel. You have transgressions enough to answer for already, and need 
 not add this to the rest."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He commanded them to release the prisoners, and to send them home 
 again carefully 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 "for you having sinned, <I>the fierce wrath of God is upon you,</I> and
 there is no other way of escaping it than by showing mercy."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The resolution of the princes thereupon not to detain the prisoners. 
 They <I>stood up against those that came from the war,</I> though 
 flushed with victory, and told them plainly that they should not bring 
 their captives into Samaria, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 They had sin enough already to answer for, and would have nothing done
 to add to their trespass. In this they discovered an obedient regard to 
 the word of God by his prophet and a tender compassion towards their 
 brethren, which was wrought in them by the tender mercy of God; for he 
 regarded the affliction of this poor people, and hears their cry, and 
 <I>made them to be pitied of all those that carried them captive,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:44,46">Ps. cvi. 44, 46</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The compliance of the soldiers with the resolutions of the princes 
 in this matter, and the dismission of the captives thereupon. 

 (1.) The armed men, though being armed they might be force have
 maintained their title to what they got by the sword, acquiesced, and 
 left their captives and the spoil to the disposal of <I>the princes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 
 and herein they showed more truly heroic bravery than they did in
 taking them. It is a great honour for any man to yield to the authority 
 of reason and religion against his interest. 

 (2.) The princes very generously sent home the poor captives well
 accommodated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Those that hope to find mercy with God must learn hence with what
 tenderness to carry themselves towards those that lie at their mercy. 
 It is strange that these princes, who in this instance discovered such 
 a deference to the word of God, and such an influence upon the people, 
 had not so much grace as, in obedience to the calls of God by so many 
 prophets, to root idolatry out of their kingdom, which, soon after 
 this, was the ruin of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to
 help him.
 &nbsp; 17  For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and
 carried away captives.
 &nbsp; 18  The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low
 country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh,
 and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof,
 and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages
 thereof: and they dwelt there.
 &nbsp; 19  For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of
 Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 20  And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and
 distressed him, but strengthened him not.
 &nbsp; 21  For Ahaz took away a portion <I>out</I> of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and <I>out</I> of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave
 <I>it</I> unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.
 &nbsp; 22  And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more
 against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: this <I>is that</I> king Ahaz.
 &nbsp; 23  For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote
 him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help
 them, <I>therefore</I> will I sacrifice to them, that they may help
 me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
 &nbsp; 24  And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God,
 and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up
 the doors of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and he made him altars in
 every corner of Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 25  And in every several city of Judah he made high places to
 burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God
 of his fathers.
 &nbsp; 26  Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and
 last, behold, they <I>are</I> written in the book of the kings of
 Judah and Israel.
 &nbsp; 27  And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
 city, <I>even</I> in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the
 sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned
 in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The great distress which the kingdom of Ahaz was reduced to for his
 sin. In general,

 1. <I>The Lord brought Judah low,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 They had lately been very high in wealth and power; but God found means
 to bring them down, and make them as despicable as they had been 
 formidable. Those that will not humble themselves under the word of God 
 will justly be humbled by his judgments. Iniquity <I>brings men 
 low,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:43">Ps. cvi. 43</A>.

 2. Ahaz made Judah naked. As his sin debased them, so it exposed them.  
 It made them naked to their shame; for it exposed them to contempt, as 
 a man unclothed. It made them naked to their danger; for it exposed 
 them to assaults, as a man unarmed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:25">Exod. xxxii. 25</A>.

 Sin strips men. In particular, the Edomites, to be revenged for
 Amaziah's cruel treatment of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:12"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 12</A>),

 smote Judah, and carried off many captives, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The Philistines also insulted them, took and kept possession of several
 cities and villages that lay near them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 and so they were revenged for the incursions which Uzziah had made upon
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+26:6"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 6</A>.

 And, to show that it was purely the sin of Ahaz that brought the
 Philistines upon his country, in the very year that he died the prophet 
 Isaiah foretold the destruction of the Philistines by his son, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:28,29">Isa. xiv. 28, 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The addition which Ahaz made both to the national distress and the 
 national guilt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He added to the distress, by making court to strange kings, in hopes 
 they would relieve him. When the Edomites and Philistines were 
 vexatious to him, <I>he sent to the kings of Assyria to help him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 for he found his own kingdom weakened and made naked, and he could not
 put any confidence in God, and therefore was at a vast expense to get 
 an interest in the king of Assyria. He pillaged the house of God, and 
 the king's house, and squeezed the princes for money to hire these 
 foreign forces into his service, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Though he had conformed to the idolatry of the heathen nations, his
 neighbours, they did not value him for that, nor love him the better, 
 nor did his compliance, by which he lost God, gain them, nor could he 
 make any interest in them, but with his money. It is often found that 
 wicked men themselves have no real affection for those that revolt to 
 them, nor do they care to do them a kindness. A degenerate branch is 
 looked upon, on all sides, as <I>an abominable branch,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:19">Isa. xiv. 19</A>.
 
 But what did Ahaz get by the king of Assyria? Why, he <I>came to
 him,</I> but he <I>distressed him,</I> and <I>strengthened him not</I>

 <I>helped him not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 The forces of the Assyrian quartered upon his country, and so
 impoverished and weakened it; they grew insolent and imperious, and 
 created him a great deal of vexation, like a broken reed, which not 
 only fails, but pierces the hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He added to the guilt, by making court to strange gods, in hopes 
 they would relieve him. In his distress, instead of repenting of his 
 idolatry, which he had reason enough to see the folly of, <I>he 
 trespassed yet more</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 was more mad than ever upon his idols.  A brand of infamy is here set
 upon him for it: <I>This is that king Ahaz,</I> that wretched man, who 
 was the scandal of the house of David and the curse and plague of his 
 generation. Note, Those are wicked and vile indeed that are made worse 
 by their afflictions, instead of being made better by them, who <I>in 
 their distress trespass yet more,</I> have their corruptions 
 exasperated by that which should mollify them, and their hearts more 
 <I>fully set in them to do evil.</I> Let us see what his trespass was.

 (1.) He abused the house of God; for he <I>cut in pieces the
 vessels</I> of it, that the priests might not perform the service of 
 the temple, or not as it should be performed, for want of vessels; and, 
 at length, he <I>shut up the doors,</I> that the people might not 
 attend it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 This was worse than the worst of the kings before him had done.

 (2.) He confronted the altar of God, for he <I>made himself altars in
 every corner of Jerusalem;</I> so that, as the prophet speaks, they 
 were like <I>heaps in the furrows of the fields,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:11">Hos. xii. 11</A>.

 And in the cities of Judah, either by his power or by his purse,
 perhaps by both, he erected high places for the people to burn incense 
 to what idols they pleased, as if on purpose to <I>provoke the God of 
 his fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 (3.) He cast off God himself; for he <I>sacrificed to the gods of
 Damascus</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 not because he loved them, for he thought they smote him; but because
 he feared them, thinking that they helped his enemies, and that, if he 
 could bring them into his interest, they would help him. Foolish man!  
 It was his own God that smote him and strengthened the Syrians against 
 him, not the gods of Damascus; had he sacrificed to him, and to him 
 only, he would have helped him. But no marvel that men's affections and 
 devotions are misplaced when they mistake the author of their trouble 
 and their help. And what comes of it? The gods of Syria befriend Ahaz 
 no more than the kings of Assyria did; they were <I>the ruin of him and 
 of all Israel.</I> This sin provoked God to bring judgments upon them, 
 to cut him off in the midst of his days, when he was but thirty-six 
 years old; and it debauched the people so that the reformation of the 
 next reign could not prevail to cure them of their inclination to 
 idolatry, but they retained that root of bitterness till the captivity 
 in Babylon plucked it up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The chapter concludes with the conclusion of the reign of Ahaz, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 For aught that appears, he died impenitent, and therefore died
 inglorious; for he was not buried <I>in the sepulchres of the 
 kings.</I> Justly was he thought unworthy to be laid among them who was 
 so unlike them--to be buried with kings who had used his kingly power 
 for the destruction of the church and not for its protection or 
 edification.</P>
