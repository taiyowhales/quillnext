 The tenth day of the seventh month between the feast of trumpets 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:2"><I>ch.</I> viii. 2</A>)

 and the feast of tabernacles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:14">ver. 14</A>)

 was appointed to be the day of atonement; we have no reason to think
 but that it was religiously observed, though it is not mentioned. But
 here we have an account of an occasional fast that was kept a fortnight
 after that, with reference to the present posture of their affairs, and
 it was, as that, a day of humiliation. There is a time to weep as well
 as a time to laugh. We have here an account.

 I. How this fast was observed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. What were the heads of the prayer that was made to God on that
 occasion, wherein they made a thankful acknowledgment of God's mercies, 
 a penitent confession of sin, and a humble submission to the righteous 
 hand of God in the judgments that were brought upon them, concluding 
 with a solemn resolution of new obedience,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children
 of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and
 earth upon them.
 &nbsp; 2  And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all
 strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities
 of their fathers.
 &nbsp; 3  And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the
 law of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God <I>one</I> fourth part of the day; and
 <I>another</I> fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 their God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a general account of a public fast which the children of 
 Israel kept, probably by order from Nehemiah, by and with the advice 
 and consent of the chief of the fathers. It was a fast that men 
 appointed, but such <I>a fast as God had chosen;</I> for, 

 1. It was a day <I>to afflict the soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:5">Isa. lviii. 5</A>.

 Probably they assembled in the courts of the temple, and they there
 appeared in sackcloth and in the posture of mourners, with earth on 
 their heads,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 By these outward expressions of sorrow and humiliation they gave glory
 to God, took shame to themselves, and stirred up one another to 
 repentance.  They were restrained from <I>weeping,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:9"><I>ch.</I> viii. 9</A>,

 but now they were directed to weep. The joy of our holy feasts must
 give way to the sorrow of our solemn fasts when they come. Every thing 
 is beautiful in its season. 

 2. It was a day <I>to loose the bands of wickedness,</I> and that is 
 the fast that God has chosen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:6">Isa. lviii. 6</A>.

 Without this, spreading sackcloth and ashes under us is but a jest.
 The seed of Israel, because they were a holy seed, appropriated to God 
 and more excellent than their neighbours, <I>separated themselves from 
 all strangers</I> with whom they had mingled and joined in affinity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Ezra had separated them from their strange wives some years before, but
 they had relapsed into the same sin, and had either made marriages or 
 at least made friendships with them, and contracted such an intimacy as 
 was a snare to them. But now they separated themselves from the strange 
 children as well as from the strange wives. Those that intend by 
 prayers and covenants to join themselves to God must separate 
 themselves from sin and sinners; for <I>what communion hath light with 
 darkness?</I> 

 3. It was a day of communion with God. <I>They fasted to him, even to
 him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+7:5">Zech. vii. 5</A>);

 for, 

 (1.) They spoke to him in prayer, offered their pious and devout
 affections to him in the confession of sin and the adoration of him as 
 the Lord and their God. Fasting without prayer is a body without a 
 soul, a worthless carcase.

 (2.) They heard him speaking to them by his word; for they read in the
 book of the law, which is very proper on fasting days, that, in the 
 glass of the law, we may see our deformities and defilements, and know 
 what to acknowledge and what to amend. The word will direct and quicken 
 prayer, for by it the Spirit helps our praying infirmities. Observe how 
 the time was equally divided between these two. Three hours (for that 
 is the fourth part of a day) they spent in reading, expounding, and 
 applying the scriptures, and three hours in confessing sin and praying; 
 so that they staid together six hours, and spent all the time in the 
 solemn acts of religion, without saying, <I>Behold, what a weariness is 
 it!</I> The varying of the exercises made it the less tedious, and, as 
 the word they read would furnish them with matter for prayer, so prayer 
 would make the word the more profitable. Bishop Patrick thinks that 
 they spent the whole twelve hours of the day in devotion, that from six 
 o'clock in the morning till nine they read, and then from nine to 
 twelve they prayed, from twelve to three they read again, and from 
 three till six at night they prayed again. The word of a fast day is 
 good work, and therefore we should endeavour to make a day's work, a 
 good day's work, of it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and
 Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, <I>and</I> Chenani,
 and cried with a loud voice unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God.
 &nbsp; 5  Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah,
 Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, <I>and</I> Pethahiah, said, Stand up
 <I>and</I> bless the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God for ever and ever: and blessed be
 thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and
 praise.
 &nbsp; 6  Thou, <I>even</I> thou, <I>art</I> L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> alone; thou hast made heaven,
 the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all
 <I>things</I> that <I>are</I> therein, the seas, and all that <I>is</I> therein,
 and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth
 thee.
 &nbsp; 7  Thou <I>art</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> the God, who didst choose Abram, and
 broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him
 the name of Abraham;
 &nbsp; 8  And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a
 covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the
 Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites,
 and the Girgashites, to give <I>it, I say,</I> to his seed, and hast
 performed thy words; for thou <I>art</I> righteous:
 &nbsp; 9  And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and
 heardest their cry by the Red sea;
 &nbsp; 10  And showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his
 servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest
 that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a
 name, as <I>it is</I> this day.
 &nbsp; 11  And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went
 through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their
 persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the
 mighty waters.
 &nbsp; 12  Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar;
 and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the
 way wherein they should go.
 &nbsp; 13  Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with
 them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws,
 good statutes and commandments:
 &nbsp; 14  And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst
 them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy
 servant:
 &nbsp; 15  And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and
 broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst,
 and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land
 which thou hadst sworn to give them.
 &nbsp; 16  But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their
 necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,
 &nbsp; 17  And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders
 that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in
 their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage:
 but thou <I>art</I> a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow
 to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.
 &nbsp; 18  Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This
 <I>is</I> thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought
 great provocations;
 &nbsp; 19  Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the
 wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by
 day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by
 night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go.
 &nbsp; 20  Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and
 withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water
 for their thirst.
 &nbsp; 21  Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness,
 <I>so that</I> they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and
 their feet swelled not.
 &nbsp; 22  Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst
 divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon,
 and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of
 Bashan.
 &nbsp; 23  Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of
 heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou
 hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to
 possess <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 24  So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou
 subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the
 Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings,
 and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they
 would.
 &nbsp; 25  And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed
 houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and
 oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and
 were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy
 great goodness.
 &nbsp; 26  Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against
 thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets
 which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they
 wrought great provocations.
 &nbsp; 27  Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their
 enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when
 they cried unto thee, thou heardest <I>them</I> from heaven; and
 according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who
 saved them out of the hand of their enemies.
 &nbsp; 28  But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee:
 therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that
 they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and
 cried unto thee, thou heardest <I>them</I> from heaven; and many times
 didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;
 &nbsp; 29  And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them
 again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not
 unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which
 if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder,
 and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
 &nbsp; 30  Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst
 against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not
 give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people
 of the lands.
 &nbsp; 31  Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not
 utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou <I>art</I> a gracious
 and merciful God.
 &nbsp; 32  Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the
 terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the
 trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our
 kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets,
 and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the
 kings of Assyria unto this day.
 &nbsp; 33  Howbeit thou <I>art</I> just in all that is brought upon us; for
 thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:
 &nbsp; 34  Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our
 fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and
 thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.
 &nbsp; 35  For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy
 great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat
 land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from
 their wicked works.
 &nbsp; 36  Behold, we <I>are</I> servants this day, and <I>for</I> the land that
 thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the
 good thereof, behold, we <I>are</I> servants in it:
 &nbsp; 37  And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast
 set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our
 bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we <I>are</I> in
 great distress.
 &nbsp; 38  And because of all this we make a sure <I>covenant,</I> and write
 <I>it;</I> and our princes, Levites, <I>and</I> priests, seal <I>unto it.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account how the work of this fast-day was carried on. 
 
 1. The names of the ministers that were employed. They are twice named
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>),

 only with some variation of the names. Either they prayed successively,
 according to that rule which the apostle gives

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:31">1 Cor. xiv. 31</A>,

 <I>You may all prophesy one by one</I>), or, as some think, there were
 eight several congregations at some distance from each other, and each 
 had a Levite to preside in it. 

 2. The work itself in which they employed themselves.

 (1.) They prayed to God, cried to him with a loud voice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 for the pardon of the sins of Israel and God's favour to them. They
 cried aloud, not that God might the better hear them, as Baal's 
 worshippers, but that the people might, and to excite their fervency.

 (2.) They praised God; for the work of praise is not unseasonable on a
 fast-day; in all acts of devotion we must aim at this, to <I>give unto 
 God the glory due to his name.</I> The summary of their prayers we have 
 here upon record; whether drawn up before, as a directory to the 
 Levites what to enlarge on, or recollected after, as the heads of what 
 they had in prayer enlarged upon, is uncertain. Much more no doubt was 
 said than is here recorded, else confessing and worshipping God would 
 not have taken up a fourth part of the day, much less two-fourths.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this solemn address to God we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An awful adoration of God, as a perfect and glorious Being, and the 
 fountain of all beings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 The congregation is called upon to signify their concurrence herewith
 by standing up; and so the minister directs himself to God, <I>Blessed 
 be thy glorious name.</I> God is here adored,

 1. As the only living and true God: <I>Thou art Jehovah alone,</I>
 self-existent and independent; there is no God besides thee.  

 2. As the Creator of all things: <I>Thou hast made heaven, earth, and
 seas,</I> and all that is in them. The first article of our creed is 
 fitly made the first article of our praises. 

 3. As the great Protector of the whole creation: "Thou preservest in
 being all the creatures thou hast given being to." God's providence 
 extends itself to the highest beings, for they need it, and to the 
 meanest, for they are not slighted by it.  What God has made he will 
 preserve; what he does is done effectually, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:14">Eccl. iii. 14</A>.

 4. As the object of the creatures' praises: "<I>The host of heaven,</I>
 the world of holy angels, <I>worshippeth thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 But thy <I>name is exalted above all blessing and praise;</I> it needs
 not the praises of the creatures, nor is any addition made to its glory 
 by those praises." The best performances in the praising of God's name, 
 even those of the angels themselves, fall infinitely short of what it 
 deserves. It is not only exalted above our blessing, but above all 
 blessing. Put all the praises of heaven and earth together, and the 
 thousandth part is not said of what might and should be said of the 
 glory of God. <I>Our goodness extendeth not to him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A thankful acknowledgment of God's favours to Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Many of these are here reckoned up in order before him, and very 
 much to the purpose, for, 

 (1.) We must take all occasions to mention the loving kindness of the
 Lord, and <I>in every prayer give thanks.</I>

 (2.) When we are confessing our sins it is good to take notice of the
 mercies of God as the aggravations of our sins, that we may be the more 
 humbled and ashamed, and call ourselves by the scandalous name of 
 ungrateful.

 (3.) When we are seeking to God for mercy and relief in the time of
 distress it is an encouragement to our faith and hope to look back upon 
 our own and our fathers' experiences: "Lord, thou hast done well for us 
 formerly; shall it be all undone again? Art not thou the same God 
 still?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let us briefly observe the particular instances of God's goodness to 
 Israel here recounted. 

 (1.) The call of Abraham, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 God's favour to him was distinguishing: "Thou didst choose him." His
 grace in him was powerful to bring him out of Ur of the Chaldees, and, 
 in giving him the name of Abraham, he put honour upon him as his own 
 and assured him that he should be the <I>father of many nations. Look 
 unto Abraham your father</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:2">Isa. li. 2</A>)
 
 and see free grace glorified in him.

 (2.) The covenant God made with him to give the land of Canaan to him
 and his seed, a type of the better country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 And this covenant was sure, for God found Abraham's heart faithful
 before God, and found it so because he made it so (for faith is not of 
 ourselves, it is the gift of God), and therefore performed his words; 
 <I>for with the upright he will show himself upright,</I> and wherever 
 he finds a faithful heart he will be found a faithful God.

 (3.) The deliverance of Israel out of Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.

 It was seasonable to remember this now that they were interceding for
 the perfecting of their deliverance out of Babylon.  They were then 
 delivered, in compassion to their affliction, in answer to their cry, 
 and in resistance of the pride and insolence of their persecutors.  
 Wherein they dealt proudly, God showed himself <I>above them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:11">Exod. xviii. 11</A>),

 and so got himself <I>a name;</I> for he said, <I>I will get me honour
 upon Pharaoh.</I> Even to this day the name of God is glorified for 
 that wonderful work. It was done miraculously: signs and wonders were 
 shown for the effecting of it; their deliverance was the destruction of 
 their enemies; they were <I>thrown into the deeps,</I> as irrecoverably 
 <I>as a stone into the mighty waters.</I> 

 (4.) The conducting of them through the wilderness, by the pillar of
 cloud and fire, which showed them which way they should go, when they 
 should remove, and when and where they should rest, directed all their 
 stages and all their steps, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It was also a visible token of God's presence with them, to guide and
 guard them. They mention this again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 observing that though they had by their sins provoked God to withdraw
 from them, and leave them to wander and perish in the by-paths of the 
 wilderness, yet in his manifold mercy he continued to lead them, and 
 took not away the <I>pillar of cloud and fire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 When mercies, though forfeited, are continued, we are bound to be
 doubly thankful.

 (5.) The plentiful provision made for them in the wilderness, that they
 might not perish for hunger: Thou <I>gavest them bread from heaven,</I> 
 and <I>water out of the rock</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and, to hold up their hearts, a promise that they should go in and
 possess the land of Canaan. They had meat and drink, food convenient in 
 the way, and the good land at their journey's end; what would they 
 more? This also is repeated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>)

 as that which was continued, notwithstanding their provocations:
 <I>Forty years didst thou sustain them.</I> Never was people so long 
 nursed and so tenderly; they were wonderfully provided for, and, in so 
 long a time, <I>their clothes waxed not old,</I> and, though the way 
 was rough and tedious, <I>their feet swelled not;</I> for they were 
 <I>carried as upon eagles' wings.</I>

 (6.) The giving of the law upon Mount Sinai.  This was the greatest
 favour of all that was done them and the greatest honour that was put 
 upon them. The Lawgiver was very glorious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 "Thou didst not only send, but camest down thyself, and <I>didst speak
 with them,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:33">Deut. iv. 33</A>.

 The law given was very good. No nation under the sun had such <I>right
 judgments, true laws,</I> and <I>good statutes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:8">Deut. iv. 8</A>.

 The moral and judicial precepts were true and right, founded upon
 natural equity and the eternal reasons of good and evil; and even the 
 ceremonial institutions were good, tokens of God's goodness to them and 
 types of gospel grace. Particular notice is taken of the law of the 
 fourth commandment as a great favour to them: <I>Thou madest known unto 
 them thy holy sabbath,</I> which was a token of God's particular favour 
 to them, distinguishing them from the nations who had revolted from God 
 and quite lost that ancient part of revealed religion, and was likewise 
 a means of keeping up their communion with him. And, with <I>the 
 law</I> and <I>the sabbath,</I> he <I>gave his good Spirit to instruct 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Besides the law given on Mount Sinai, the five books of Moses, which he
 wrote <I>as he was moved by the Holy Ghost,</I> were constant 
 instructions to them, particularly the book of Deuteronomy, in which 
 God's Spirit by Moses instructed them fully. Bezaleel was filled 
 <I>with the Spirit of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:3">Exod. xxxi. 3</A>),

 so was Joshua 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:18">Num. xxvii. 18</A>),

 and Caleb had another spirit.

 (7.) The putting of them in possession of Canaan, that good land,
 <I>kingdoms and nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 They were made so numerous as to replenish it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)
 
 and so victorious as to be masters of it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 the natives were given into their hands, <I>that they might do with
 them as they would,</I> set their feet, if they pleased, on the necks 
 of their kings. Thus they gained a happy <I>settlement,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Look upon their cities, and you see them strong and well fortified.
 Look into their houses, and you find them fine and well furnished, 
 filled with all sorts of rich goods.  Take a view of the country, and 
 you will say that you never saw such a fat land, so well stored with 
 <I>vineyards and oliveyards.</I> All these they found made ready to 
 their hands; so they delighted themselves in the gifts of God's great 
 goodness. They could not wish to be more easy or happy than they were, 
 or might have been, in Canaan, had it not been their own fault.

 (8.) God's great readiness to pardon their sins, and work deliverance
 for them, when they had by their provocations brought his judgments 
 upon themselves.  When they were in the wilderness they found him <I>a 
 God ready to pardon</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 a <I>God of pardons</I> (so the margin reads it), who had proclaimed
 his name as a God <I>forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin,</I> 
 who has power to forgive sin, is willing to forgive, and glories in 
 forgiving. Though they forsook him, he did not forsake them, as justly 
 he might have done, but continued his care of them and favour to them. 
 Afterwards, when they were settled in Canaan and sold themselves by 
 their sins into the hands of their enemies, upon their submission and 
 humble request he <I>gave them saviours</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 the judges, by whom God wrought many a great deliverance for them when
 they were on the brink of ruin. This he did, not for any merit of 
 theirs, for their deserved nothing but ill, but according to his 
 mercies, his manifold mercies.

 (9.) The admonitions and fair warnings he gave them by his servants the
 prophets. When he delivered them from their troubles he <I>testified 
 against their sins</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>),

 that they might not misconstrue their deliverances as connivances at
 their wickedness. That which was designed in all the testimonies which 
 the prophets bore against them was to bring them again to God's law, to 
 lay their necks under its yoke, and walk by its rule. The end of our 
 ministry is to bring people to God by bringing them to his law, not to 
 bring them to ourselves by bringing them under any law of ours. This we 
 have again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>Thou testifiedst against them by thy Spirit in thy prophets.</I> The
 testimony of the prophets was the testimony of the Spirit in the 
 prophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ in them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:10,11">1 Pet. i. 10, 11</A>.

 They <I>spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,</I> and what they
 said is to be received accordingly. God gave them <I>his Spirit to 
 instruct them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 but, they not receiving that instruction, he did by his Spirit testify
 against them. If we will not suffer God's word to teach and rule us, it 
 will accuse and judge us.  God sends prophets, in compassion to his 
 people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:15">2 Chron. xxxvi. 15</A>),

 that he may not send judgments. 

 (10.) The lengthening out of his patience and the moderating of his
 rebukes: <I>Many years did he forbear them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 as loth to punish them, and waiting to see if they would repent; and,
 when he did punish them, he did not <I>utterly consume them nor forsake 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Had he forsaken them they would have been utterly consumed; but he did
 not stir up all his wrath, for he designed their reformation, not their 
 destruction.  Thus do they multiply, thus do they magnify, the 
 instances of God's goodness to Israel, and we should do in like manner, 
 that the goodness of God, duly considered by us, may lead us to 
 repentance, and overcome our badness.  The more thankful we are for 
 God's mercies the more humbled we shall be for our own sins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is a penitent confession of sin, their own sins, and the sins 
 of their fathers. The mention of these is interwoven with the memorials 
 of God's favours, that God's goodness, notwithstanding their 
 provocations, might appear the more illustrious, and their sins, 
 notwithstanding his favours, might appear the more heinous. Many 
 passages in this acknowledgment of sins and mercies are taken from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:5-26,Ne+9:4-38">Ezek. xx. 5-26</A>,

 as will appear by comparing those verses with these; for the word of
 God is of use to direct us in prayer, and by what he says to us we may 
 learn what to say to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They begin with the sins of Israel in the wilderness: <I>They, even 
 our fathers</I> (so it might better be read), <I>dealt proudly</I> 
 (though, considering what they were, and how lately they had come out 
 of slavery, they had no reason to be proud), <I>and hardened their 
 necks,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Pride is at the bottom of men's obstinacy and disobedience; they think
 it below them to bow their necks to God's yoke, and a piece of state to 
 set up their own will in opposition to the will of God himself.

 (1.) There were two things which they did not duly give heed to, else
 they would not have done as they did:--The word of God they heard, but 
 they did not hearken to God's commandments; and the works of God they 
 saw, but they were not mindful of his wonders: had they duly considered 
 them as miracles, they would have obeyed from a principle of faith and 
 holy fear; had they duly considered them as mercies, they would have 
 obeyed from a principle of gratitude and holy love. But, when men make 
 no right use either of God's ordinances or of his providences, what can 
 be expected from them?

 (2.) Two great sins are here specified; which they were guilty of in
 the wilderness--meditating a return, 

 [1.] To Egyptian slavery, which, for the sake of the garlick and 
 onions, they preferred before the glorious liberty of the Israel of God 
 attended with some difficulty and inconvenience. <I>In their rebellion 
 they appointed a captain to return to their bondage,</I> in distrust of 
 God's power and contempt of his holy promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 [2.] To Egyptian idolatry: <I>They made a molten calf,</I> and were so
 sottish as to say, <I>This is thy God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They next bewail the provocations of their fathers after they were 
 put in possession of Canaan. Though they were <I>delighted themselves 
 in God's great goodness,</I> yet that would not prevail to keep them 
 closely to him; for, <I>nevertheless, they were disobedient</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>)
 
 <I>and wrought great provocations.</I> For,

 (1.) They abused God's prophets, <I>slew them</I> because they
 <I>testified against them to turn them to God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 so returning the greatest injury for the greatest kindness.

 (2.) They abused his favours: <I>After they had rest,</I> they <I>did
 evil again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 They were not wrought upon either by their troubles or their
 deliverances out of trouble. Neither fear nor love would hold them to 
 their duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They at length come nearer to their own day, and lament the sins 
 which had brought those judgments upon them which they had long been 
 groaning under and were now but in part delivered from: <I>We have done 
 wickedly</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers,</I> have all
 been guilty, and we in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Two things they charge upon themselves and their fathers, as the cause
 of their troubles:--

 (1.) A contempt of the good law God had given them: They <I>sinned
 against thy judgments,</I> the dictates of divine wisdom, and the 
 demands of divine sovereignty. Though they were told how much it would 
 be for their own advantage to govern themselves by them, for, <I>if a 
 man do them, he shall live in them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 yet they would not do them, and so, in effect, said that they <I>would
 not live.</I> They <I>forsook their own mercies.</I> This abridgment of 
 the covenant, <I>Do this and live,</I> is taken from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:13">Ezek. xx. 13</A>,

 and is quoted,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:12">Gal. iii. 12</A>,

 to prove that <I>the law is not of faith;</I> it was not them as it is
 now, <I>Believe and live,</I> yet <I>they gave a withdrawing 
 shoulder,</I> so it is in the margin. They pretended to lay their 
 shoulders under the burden of God's law, and put their shoulders to the 
 work, but they proved withdrawing shoulders; they soon flew off, would 
 not keep to it, would not abide by it. When it came, as we say, to the 
 setting to, they shrunk back, and would not hear. They had a 
 backsliding heart; and, though God by his prophets called them to 
 return, they <I>would not give ear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 He <I>stretched out his hands, but no man regarded.</I>

 (2.) A contempt of the good land god had given them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 "Our kings have <I>not served thee in their kingdom,</I> have not used
 their power for the support of religion; our people have not served 
 thee in the use of the gifts of thy great goodness, and in that large 
 and fat land which thou not only gavest them by thy grant, but gavest 
 before them by the expulsion of the natives and the complete victories 
 they obtained over them." Those that would not serve God in their own 
 land were made to serve their enemies in a strange land, as was 
 threatened,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:47,48">Deut. xxviii. 47, 48</A>.

 It is a pity that a good land should have bad inhabitants, but so it
 was with Sodom.  Fatness and fulness often make men proud and 
 sensual.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is a humble representation of the judgments of God, which they 
 had been and were now under.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Former judgments are remembered as aggravations of their sins, that 
 they had not taken warning. In the days of the judges their <I>enemies 
 vexed them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 and, when they did evil again, God did again <I>leave them in the hand
 of their enemies,</I> who could not have touched them if God had not 
 given them up; but, when God left them, they got and kept dominion over 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their present calamitous state is laid before the Lord 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>):
 
 <I>We are servants this day.</I> Free-born Israelites are enslaved, and
 the land which they had long held by a much more honourable tenure than 
 grand sergeantry itself, even by immediate grant from the crown of 
 heaven to them as a peculiar people above all people on the earth, they 
 now held by as base a tenure as villenage itself, by, from, and under, 
 the kings of Persia, whose vassals they were. A sad change! But see 
 what work sin makes! They were bound to personal service: They have 
 <I>dominion over our bodies;</I> they held all they had precariously, 
 were tenants at will, and the land-tax that they paid was so great that 
 it amounted even to a rack-rent; so that all the rents, issues, and 
 profits, of their land did in effect accrue to the king, and it was as 
 much as they could do to get a bare subsistence for themselves and 
 their families out of it. This, they honestly own, was for their sins. 
 Poverty and slavery are the fruits of sin; it is sin that brings us 
 into all our distresses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is their address to God under these calamities. 

 1. By way of request, that their trouble might not <I>seem little,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 It is the only petition in all this prayer. The trouble was universal;
 it had come on their <I>kings, princes, priests, prophets, fathers, and 
 all their people;</I> they had all shared in the sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 and now all shared in the judgment. It was of long continuance: <I>From
 the time of the kings of Assyria,</I> who carried the ten tribes 
 captive, <I>unto this day.</I> "Lord, let it not all seem little and 
 not worthy to be regarded, or not needing to be relieved." They do not 
 prescribe to God what he shall do for them, but leave it to him, only 
 desiring he would please to take cognizance of it, remembering that 
 when he saw the affliction of his people in Egypt to be great he came 
 down to deliver them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:7,8">Exod. iii. 7, 8</A>.

 In this request they have an eye to God as one that is to be feared
 (for he is <I>the great, the mighty, and the terrible, God</I>), and as 
 one that is to be trusted, for he is <I>our God</I> in covenant, and a 
 God that <I>keeps covenant and mercy.</I> 

 2. By way of acknowledgment, notwithstanding, that really it was less
 than they deserved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 They own the justice of God in all their troubles, that he had done
 them no wrong. "We have done wickedly in breaking thy laws, and 
 therefore thou hast done right in bringing all these miseries upon us." 
 Note, It becomes us, when we are under the rebukes of divine 
 Providence, though ever so sharp and ever so long, to justify God and 
 to judge ourselves; for he will be <I>clear when he judgeth.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:4">Ps. li. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Here is the result and conclusion of this whole matter. After this 
 long remonstrance of their case was made they came at last to this 
 resolution, that they would return to God and to their duty, and oblige 
 themselves never to forsake God, but always to continue in their duty. 
 "Because of all this, we make a sure covenant with God; in 
 consideration of our frequent departures from God, we will now more 
 firmly than ever bind ourselves to him. Because we have smarted so much 
 for sin, we will now stedfastly resolve against it, that we may not any 
 more withdraw the shoulder." Observe, 

 1. This covenant was made with serious consideration. It is the result
 of a chain of suitable thoughts, and so is a reasonable service. 

 2.  With great solemnity. It was written, <I>in perpetuam rei
 memoriam--that it might remain a memorial for all ages;</I> it was 
 sealed and left upon record, that it might be a witness against them if 
 they dealt deceitfully. 

 3. With join consent: "<I>We make</I> it; we are all agreed in making
 it, and do it unanimously, that we may strengthen the hands one of 
 another." 

 4. With fixed resolution: "It is <I>a sure covenant,</I> without
 reserving a power of revocation. It is what we will live and die by, 
 and never go back from." A certain number of the princes, priests, and 
 Levites, were chosen as the representatives of the congregation, to 
 subscribe and seal it for and in the name of the rest.  Now was 
 fulfilled that promise concerning the Jews, that, when they returned 
 out of captivity, they should <I>join themselves to the Lord in a 
 perpetual covenant</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+50:5">Jer. l. 5</A>),

 and that in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:5">Isa. xliv. 5</A>,

 that they should <I>subscribe with their hand unto the Lord.</I> He
 that bears an honest mind will not startle at assurances; nor will 
 those that know the deceitfulness of their own hearts think them 
 needless.</P>
