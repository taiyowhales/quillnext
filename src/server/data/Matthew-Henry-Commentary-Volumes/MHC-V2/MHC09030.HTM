 When David was dismissed from the army of the Philistines he did not go
 over to the camp of Israel, but, being expelled by Saul, observed an
 exact neutrality, and silently retired to his own city Ziklag, leaving
 the armies ready to engage. Now here we are told, 

 I. What a melancholy posture he found the city in, all laid waste by
 the Amalekites, and what distress it occasioned him and his men,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. What course he took to recover what he had lost. He enquired of
 God, and took out a commission from him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>),

 pursued the enemy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>),

 gained intelligence from a straggler

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:11-15">ver. 11-15</A>),

 attacked and routed the plunderers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>),

 and recovered all that they had carried off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:18-20">ver.  18-20</A>.

 III. What method he observed in the distribution of the spoil,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to
 Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the
 south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;
 &nbsp; 2 And had taken the women captives, that <I>were</I> therein: they
 slew not any, either great or small, but carried <I>them</I> away, and
 went on their way.
 &nbsp; 3 So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, <I>it was</I>
 burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their
 daughters, were taken captives.
 &nbsp; 4 Then David and the people that <I>were</I> with him lifted up
 their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.
 &nbsp; 5 And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the
 Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
 &nbsp; 6 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of
 stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved,
 every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David
 encouraged himself in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. The descent which the Amalekites made upon Ziklag in David's
 absence, and the desolations they made there. They surprised the city 
 when it was left unguarded, plundered it, burnt it, and carried all the 
 women and children captives,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:1,2"><I>v.</I>  1, 2</A>.

 They intended, by this to revenge the like havoc that David had lately
 made of them and their country,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+27:8"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 8</A>.

 He that had made so many enemies ought not to have left his own
 concerns so naked and defenceless. Those that make bold with others 
 must expect that others will make as bold with them and provide 
 accordingly. Now observe in this, 

 1. The cruelty of Saul's pity (as it proved) in sparing the Amalekites;
 if he had utterly destroyed them, as he ought to have done, these would 
 not have been in being to do this mischief. 

 2. How David was corrected for being so forward to go with the
 Philistines against Israel. God showed him that he had better have 
 staid at home and looked after his own business.  When we go abroad in 
 the way of our duty we may comfortably hope that God will take care of 
 our families in our absence, but not otherwise.  

 3. How wonderfully God inclined the hearts of these Amalekites to carry
 the women and children away captives, and not to kill them. When David 
 invaded them he put all to the sword

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+27:9"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 9</A>),

 and no reason can be given why they did not retaliate upon this city,
 but that God restrained them; for he has all hearts in his hands, and 
 says to the fury of the most cruel men, <I>Hitherto thou shalt come, 
 and no further.</I> Whether they spared them to lead them in triumph, 
 or to sell them, or to use them for slaves, God's hand must be 
 acknowledged, who designed to make use of the Amalekites for the 
 correction, not for the destruction, of the house of David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The confusion and consternation that David and his men were in when 
 they found their houses in ashes and their wives and children gone into 
 captivity. Three days' march they had from the camp of the Philistines 
 to Ziklag, and now that they came thither weary, but hoping to find 
 rest in their houses and joy in their families, behold a black and 
 dismal scene was presented to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 which made them all weep (David himself not excepted), though they were
 men of war, <I>till they had no more power to weep,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The mention of David's wives, <I>Ahinoam and Abigail,</I> and their
 being carried captive, intimates that this circumstance went nearer his 
 heart than any thing else. Note, It is no disparagement to the boldest 
 and bravest spirits to lament the calamities of relations and friends.  
 Observe,

 1. This trouble came upon them when they were absent. It was the
 ancient policy of Amalek to take Israel at an advantage. 

 2. It met them at their return, and, for aught that appears, their own
 eyes gave them the first intelligence of it.  Note, When we go abroad 
 we cannot foresee what evil tidings may meet us when we come home 
 again. The going out may be very cheerful, and yet the coming in be 
 very doleful.  <I>Boast not thyself</I> therefore <I>of to-morrow,</I> 
 nor of to-night either, <I>for thou knowest not what a day,</I> or a 
 piece of a day, <I>may bring forth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:1">Prov. xxvii. 1</A>.

 If, when we come off a journey, we find our <I>tabernacles in
 peace,</I> and not laid waste as David here found his, let the Lord be 
 praised for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The mutiny and murmuring of David's men against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 <I>David was greatly distressed,</I> for, in the midst of all his
 losses, his own people spoke of stoning him, 

 1. Because they looked upon him as the occasion of their calamities, by
 the provocation he had given the Amalekites, and his indiscretion in 
 leaving Ziklag without a garrison in it. Thus apt are we, when we are 
 in trouble, to fly into a rage against those who are in any way the 
 occasion of our trouble, while we overlook the divine providence, and 
 have not that regard to the operations of God's hand in it which would 
 silence our passions, and make us patient. 

 2. Because now they began to despair of that preferment which they had
 promised themselves in following David. They hoped ere this to have 
 been all princes; and now to find themselves all beggars was such a 
 disappointment to them as made them grow outrageous, and threaten the 
 life of him on whom, under God, they had the greatest dependence. What 
 absurdities will not ungoverned passions plunge men into? This was a 
 sore trial to the man after God's own heart, and could not but go very 
 near him. Saul had driven him from his country, the Philistines had 
 driven him from their camp, the Amalekites had plundered his city, his 
 wives were taken prisoners, and now, to complete his woe, his own 
 familiar friends, in whom he trusted, whom he had sheltered, and who 
 did eat of his bread, instead of sympathizing with him and offering him 
 any relief, <I>lifted up the heel against him</I> and threatened to 
 stone him. Great faith must expect such severe exercises. But it is 
 observable that David was reduced to this extremity just before his 
 accession to the throne. At this very time, perhaps, the stroke was 
 struck which opened the door to his advancement. Things are sometimes 
 at the worst with the church and people of God just before they begin 
 to mend.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. David's pious dependence upon the divine providence and grace in 
 this distress: <I>But David encouraged himself in the Lord his God.</I> 
 His men fretted at their loss. <I>The soul of the people was 
 bitter,</I> so the word is. Their own discontent and impatience added 
 <I>wormwood and gall</I> to the affliction and misery, and made their 
 case doubly grievous. But 

 1. David bore it better, though he had more reason than any of them to
 lament it; they gave liberty to their passions, but he set his graces 
 on work, and by encouraging himself in God, while they dispirited each 
 other, he kept his spirit calm and sedate. Or, 

 2. There may be a reference to the threatening words his men gave out
 against him. They <I>spoke of stoning him;</I> but he, not offering to 
 avenge the affront, nor terrified by their menaces, <I>encouraged 
 himself in the Lord his God,</I> believed, and considered with 
 application to his present case, the power and providence of God, his 
 justice and goodness, the method he commonly takes of bringing low and 
 then raising up, his care of his people that serve him and trust in 
 him, and the particular promises he had made to him of bringing him 
 safely to the throne; with these considerations he supported himself, 
 not doubting but the present trouble would end well. Note, Those that 
 have taken the Lord for their God may take encouragement from their 
 relation to him in the worst of times. It is the duty and interest of 
 all good people, whatever happens, to encourage themselves in God as 
 their Lord and their God, assuring themselves that he can and will 
 bring light out of darkness, peace out of trouble, and good out of 
 evil, to all that love him and are <I>the called according to his 
 purpose,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:28">Rom. viii. 28</A>.

 It was David's practice, and he had the comfort of it, <I>What time I
 am afraid I will trust in thee.</I> When he was at his wits' end he was 
 not at his faith's end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I
 pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought
 thither the ephod to David.
 &nbsp; 8 And David enquired at the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, Shall I pursue after
 this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue:
 for thou shalt surely overtake <I>them,</I> and without fail recover
 <I>all.</I>
 &nbsp; 9 So David went, he and the six hundred men that <I>were</I> with
 him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left
 behind stayed.
 &nbsp; 10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred
 abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the
 brook Besor.
 &nbsp; 11 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
 David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him
 drink water;
 &nbsp; 12 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two
 clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again
 to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk <I>any</I> water, three
 days and three nights.
 &nbsp; 13 And David said unto him, To whom <I>belongest</I> thou? and
 whence <I>art</I> thou? And he said, I <I>am</I> a young man of Egypt,
 servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three
 days agone I fell sick.
 &nbsp; 14 We made an invasion <I>upon</I> the south of the Cherethites, and
 upon <I>the coast</I> which <I>belongeth</I> to Judah, and upon the south
 of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.
 &nbsp; 15 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this
 company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt
 neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and
 I will bring thee down to this company.
 &nbsp; 16 And when he had brought him down, behold, <I>they were</I> spread
 abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing,
 because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the
 land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.
 &nbsp; 17 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening
 of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four
 hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.
 &nbsp; 18 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried
 away: and David rescued his two wives.
 &nbsp; 19 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor
 great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any <I>thing</I>
 that they had taken to them: David recovered all.
 &nbsp; 20 And David took all the flocks and the herds, <I>which</I> they
 drave before those <I>other</I> cattle, and said, This <I>is</I> David's
 spoil.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon observes that <I>the righteous is delivered out of trouble</I> 
 and <I>the wicked cometh in his stead,</I> that <I>the just falleth 
 seven times a-day and riseth again;</I> so it was with David. Many were 
 his troubles, but <I>the Lord delivered him out of them all,</I> and 
 particularly out of this of which we have here an account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He enquired of the Lord both concerning his duty--<I>Shall I pursue
 after this troop?</I> and concerning the event--<I>Shall I overtake
 them?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It was a great advantage to David that he had the high priest with him
 and the breast-plate of judgment, which, as a public person, he might 
 consult in all his affairs,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:21">Num. xxvii. 21</A>.

 We cannot think that he left Abiathar and the ephod at Ziklag, for then
 he and it would have been carried away by the Amalekites, unless we may 
 suppose them hidden by a special providence, that they might be ready 
 for David to consult at his return. If we conclude that David had his 
 priest and ephod with him in the camp of the Philistines, it was 
 certainly a great neglect in him that he did not enquire of the Lord by 
 them concerning his engagement to Achish. Perhaps he was ashamed to own 
 his religion so far among the uncircumcised; but now he begins to 
 apprehend that this trouble is brought upon him to correct him for that 
 oversight, and therefore the first thing he does is to call for the 
 ephod. It is well if we get this good by our afflictions, to be 
 reminded by them of neglected duties, and particularly to be quickened 
 by them to enquire of the Lord. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:13">1 Chron. xv. 13</A>.

 David had no room to doubt but that his war against these Amalekites
 was just, and he had an inclination strong enough to set upon them when 
 it was for the recovery of that which was dearest to him in this world; 
 and yet he would not go about it without asking counsel of God, thereby 
 owning his dependence upon God and submission to him. If we thus, in 
 all our ways, acknowledge God, we may expect that he will direct our 
 steps, as he did David's here, answering him above what he asked, with 
 an assurance that he should recover all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He went himself in person, and took with him all the force he had, 
 in pursuit of the Amalekites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 See how quickly, how easily, how effectually the mutiny among the
 soldiers was quelled by his patience and faith. When they <I>spoke of 
 stoning him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 if he had spoken of hanging them, or had ordered that the ringleaders
 of the faction should immediately have their heads struck off, though 
 it would have been just, yet it might have been of pernicious 
 consequence to his interest in this critical juncture; and, while he 
 and his men were contending, the Amalekites would have clearly carried 
 off their spoil.  But when he, as a deaf man, heard not, smothered his 
 resentments, and <I>encouraged himself in the Lord his God,</I> the 
 tumult of the people was stilled by his gentleness and the power of God 
 on their hearts; and, being thus mildly treated, they are now as ready 
 to follow his foot as they were but a little before to fly in his face. 
 Meekness is the security of any government. All his men were willing to 
 go along with him in pursuit of the Amalekites, and he needed them all; 
 but he was forced to drop a third part of them by the way; 200 out of 
 600 were so fatigued with their long march, and so sunk under the load 
 of their grief, that they could not pass the brook Besor, but staid 
 behind there. This was, 

 1. A great trial of David's faith, whether he could go on, in a
 dependence upon the word of God, when so many of his men failed him. 
 When we are disappointed and discouraged in our expectations from 
 second causes, then to go on with cheerfulness, confiding in the divine 
 power, this is giving glory to God, by believing against hope, in hope. 
 
 2. A great instance of David's tenderness to his men, that he would by
 no means urge them beyond their strength, though the case itself was so 
 very urgent. The Son of David thus considers the frame of his 
 followers, who are not all alike strong and vigorous in their spiritual 
 pursuits and conflicts; but, where we are weak, there he is kind; nay, 
 more there he is strong,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:9,10">2 Cor. xii. 9, 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Providence threw one in their way that gave them intelligence of 
 the enemy's motions, and guided theirs; a poor Egyptian lad, scarcely 
 alive, is made instrumental of a great deal of good to David. <I>God 
 chooses the foolish things of the world,</I> with them <I>to confound 
 the wise.</I> Observe, 

 1. His master's cruelty to him. He had got out of him all the service
 he could, and when the lad fell sick, probably being over-toiled with 
 his work, he barbarously left him to perish in the field, when he was 
 in no such haste but he might have put him into some of the carriages, 
 and brought him home, or, at least, have left him wherewithal to 
 support himself. That master has the spirit of an Amalekite, not of an 
 Israelite, that can thus use a servant worse than one would use a 
 beast. <I>The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</I> This 
 Amalekite thought he should now have servants enough of the 
 Israelite-captives, and therefore cared not what became of his Egyptian 
 slave, but could willingly let him die in a ditch for want of 
 necessaries, while he himself was <I>eating and drinking,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Justly did Providence make this poor servant, that was thus basely
 abused, instrumental towards the destruction of a whole army of 
 Amalekites and his master among the rest; for God hears the cry of 
 oppressed servants. 

 2. David's compassion to him. Though he had reason to think he was one
 of those that had helped to destroy Ziklag, yet, finding him in 
 distress, he generously relieved him, not only with <I>bread and 
 water</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 but with <I>figs and raisins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Though the Israelites were in haste, and had no great plenty for
 themselves, yet they would not <I>forbear to deliver one that was drawn 
 unto death,</I> nor say, <I>Behold, we knew it not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:11,12">Prov. xxiv. 11, 12</A>.

 Those are unworthy the name of Israelites who shut up the bowels of
 their compassion from persons in distress. It was also prudently done 
 to relieve this Egyptian; for, though despicable, he was capable of 
 doing them service: so it proved, though they were not certain of this 
 when they relieved him. It is a good reason why we should neither do an 
 injury nor deny a kindness to any man that we know not but, some time 
 or other, it may be in his power to return either a kindness or an 
 injury.  

 3. The intelligence David received from this poor Egyptian when he had
 come to himself. He gave him an account concerning his party.

 (1.) What they had done
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>We made an invasion,</I> &c.  The countries which David had
 pretended to Achish to have made an incursion upon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+27:10"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 10</A>)

 they really had invaded and laid waste. What was then false now proved
 too true. 

 (2.) Whither they had gone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This he promised David to inform him of upon condition he would spare
 his life and protect him from his master, who, if he could hear of him 
 again (he thought), would add cruelty to cruelty. Such an opinion this 
 poor Egyptian had of the obligation of an oath that he desired no 
 greater security for his life than this: <I>Swear unto me by God,</I> 
 not by the gods of Egypt or Amalek, but by the one supreme God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. David, being directed to the place where they lay, securely 
 celebrating their triumphs, fell upon them, and, as he used to pray, 
 <I>saw his desire upon his enemies.</I> 

 1. The spoilers were cut off.  The Amalekites, finding the booty was
 rich, and having got with it (as they thought) out of the reach of 
 danger, were making themselves very merry with it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 All thoughts of war were laid aside, nor were they in any haste to
 house their prey, but <I>spread themselves abroad on the earth</I> in 
 the most careless manner that could be, and there they were found 
 <I>eating, and drinking, and dancing,</I> probably in honour of their 
 idol-gods, to whom they gave the praise of their success. In this 
 posture David surprised them, which made the conquest of them, and the 
 blow he gave them, the more easy to him and the more dismal to them. 
 Then are sinners nearest to ruin when they cry, <I>Peace and 
 safety,</I> and <I>put the evil day far from them.</I> Nor does any 
 thing give our spiritual enemies more advantage against us than 
 sensuality and the indulgence of the flesh. <I>Eating, and drinking, 
 and dancing,</I> have been the soft and pleasant way in which many have 
 gone down to the congregation of the dead. Finding them thus off their 
 guard, and from their arms (many of them, it may be, drunk, and unable 
 to make any resistance), he put them all to the sword, and only 400 
 escaped, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Thus is the triumphing of the wicked short, and wrath comes on them, as
 on Belshazzar, when they are in the midst of their jollity.

 2. The spoil was recovered and brought off, and nothing was lost, but a
 great deal gotten.

 (1.) They retrieved all their own

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>):

 <I>David rescued his two wives;</I> this is mentioned particularly,
 because this pleased David more than all the rest of his achievements. 
 Providence had so ordered it that the Amalekites carefully preserved 
 all that they had taken, concluding that they kept it for themselves, 
 though really they preserved it for the right owners, so that there was 
 nothing lacking to them; so it proved, when they concluded all was 
 gone: so much better is God oftentimes to us than our own fears. Our 
 Lord Jesus was indeed the Son of David and the Son of Abraham, in this 
 resembling them both (Abraham, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:16">Gen. xiv. 16</A>,

 and David here), that he <I>took the prey from the mighty, and led
 captivity captive.</I> But this was not all.

 (2.) They took all that belonged to the Amalekites besides

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Flocks and herds,</I> either such as were taken from the Philistines
 and others, which David had the disposal of by the law of war; or 
 perhaps he made a sally into the enemy's country, and fetched off these 
 flocks and herds thence, as interest for his own. This drove was put in 
 the van of the triumph, with this proclamation, "<I>This is David's 
 spoil.</I> This we may thank him for." Those who lately spoke of 
 stoning him now caressed him and cried him up, because they got by him 
 more than they had then lost.  Thus are the world and its sentiments 
 governed by interest.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint
 that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to
 abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and
 to meet the people that <I>were</I> with him: and when David came near
 to the people, he saluted them.
 &nbsp; 22 Then answered all the wicked men and <I>men</I> of Belial, of
 those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with
 us, we will not give them <I>ought</I> of the spoil that we have
 recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they
 may lead <I>them</I> away, and depart.
 &nbsp; 23 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that
 which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath given us, who hath preserved us, and
 delivered the company that came against us into our hand.
 &nbsp; 24 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his
 part <I>is</I> that goeth down to the battle, so <I>shall</I> his part <I>be</I>
 that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.
 &nbsp; 25 And it was <I>so</I> from that day forward, that he made it a
 statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.
 &nbsp; 26 And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the
 elders of Judah, <I>even</I> to his friends, saying, Behold a present
 for you of the spoil of the enemies of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 &nbsp; 27 To <I>them</I> which <I>were</I> in Bethel, and to <I>them</I> which <I>were</I>
 in south Ramoth, and to <I>them</I> which <I>were</I> in Jattir,
 &nbsp; 28 And to <I>them</I> which <I>were</I> in Aroer, and to <I>them</I> which
 <I>were</I> in Siphmoth, and to <I>them</I> which <I>were</I> in Eshtemoa,
 &nbsp; 29 And to <I>them</I> which <I>were</I> in Rachal, and to <I>them</I> which
 <I>were</I> in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to <I>them</I> which
 <I>were</I> in the cities of the Kenites,
 &nbsp; 30 And to <I>them</I> which <I>were</I> in Hormah, and to <I>them</I> which
 <I>were</I> in Chorashan, and to <I>them</I> which <I>were</I> in Athach,
 &nbsp; 31 And to <I>them</I> which <I>were</I> in Hebron, and to all the places
 where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the distribution of the spoil which as taken 
 from the Amalekites. When the Amalekites had carried away a rich booty 
 from the land of Judah and the Philistines they spent it in sensuality, 
 in eating, and drinking, and making merry with it; but David disposed 
 of the spoil taken after another manner, as one that knew that justice 
 and charity must govern us in the use we make of whatever we have in 
 this world. What God gives us he designs we should do good with, not 
 serve our lusts with. In the distribution of the spoil,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David was just and kind to those who abode by the stuff. They came 
 forth to meet the conquerors, and to congratulate them on this success, 
 though they could not contribute to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 for we should rejoice in a good work done, though Providence had laid
 us aside and rendered us incapable of lending a hand to it. David 
 received their address very kindly, and was so far from upbraiding them 
 with their weakness that he showed himself solicitous concerning them. 
 He saluted them; <I>he asked them of peace</I> (so the word is), 
 enquired how they did, because he had left them faint and not well; or 
 wished them peace, bade them be of good cheer, they should lose nothing 
 by staying behind; for of this they seemed afraid, as perhaps David saw 
 by their countenances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There were those that opposed their coming in to share in the spoil; 
 some of David's soldiers, probably the same that spoke of stoning him, 
 spoke now of defrauding their brethren; they are called wicked men and 
 <I>men of Belial,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Let not the best of men think it strange if they have those attending
 them that are very bad and they cannot prevail to make them better. We 
 may suppose that David had instructed his soldiers, and prayed with 
 them, and yet there were many among them that were wicked men and men 
 of Belial, often terrified with the apprehensions of death and yet 
 wicked men still and men of Belial.  These made a motion that the 200 
 men who abode by the stuff should only have their wives and children 
 given them, but none of their goods. Well might they be called 
 <I>wicked men;</I> for this bespeaks them,

 (1.) Very covetous themselves and greedy of gain; for hereby the more
 would fall to their share. Awhile ago they would gladly have given half 
 their own to recover the other half, yet now that they have all their 
 own they are not content unless they can have their brethren's too; so 
 soon do men forget their low estate. All seek their own, and too often 
 more than their own.

 (2.) Very barbarous to their brethren; for, to give them their wives
 and children, and not their estates, was to give them the mouths 
 without the meat. What joy could they have of their families if they 
 had nothing to maintain them with? Was this to do as they would be done 
 by? Those are men of Belial indeed who delight in putting hardships 
 upon their brethren, and care not who is starved, so they may be fed to 
 the full.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. David would by no means admit this, but ordered that those who 
 tarried behind should come in for an equal share in the spoils with 
 those that went to the battle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.
 
 This he did,

 (1.) In gratitude to God. The spoil we have is that which God has given
 us; we have it from him, and therefore must use it under his direction 
 as good stewards. Let this check us when we are tempted to misapply 
 that which God has entrusted us with of this world's goods. "Nay, I 
 must not do so with that which God has given me, not serve Satan and a 
 base lust with those things which are not only the creatures of his 
 power, but the gifts of his bounty. God has recompensed us by 
 <I>delivering the company that came against us into our hand,</I> let 
 not us then wrong our brethren. God has been kind to us in preserving 
 us and giving us victory, let not us be unkind to them." God's mercy to 
 us should make us merciful to one another.

 (2.) In justice to them. It was true they tarried behind; but, 

 [1.] It was not for want of good-will to the cause or to their
 brethren, but because they had not strength to keep up with them. It 
 was not their fault, but their infelicity; and therefore they ought not 
 to suffer for it. 

 [2.] Though they tarried behind now, they had formerly engaged many
 times in battle and done their part as well as the best of their 
 brethren, and their former services must be considered now that there 
 was something to enjoy. 

 [3.] Even now they did good service, for they abode by the stuff, to
 guard that which somebody must take care of, else that might have 
 fallen into the hands of some other enemy. Every post of service is not 
 alike a post of honour, yet those that are in any way serviceable to 
 the common interest, though in a meaner station, ought to share in the 
 common advantages, as in the natural body every member has its use and 
 therefore has its share of the nourishment.  <I>First,</I> Thus David 
 overruled the wicked men, and men of Belial, with reason, but with a 
 great deal of mildness; for the force of reason is sufficient, without 
 the force of passion. He calls them <I>his brethren,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Superiors often lose their authority by haughtiness, but seldom by
 courtesy and condescension. <I>Secondly,</I> Thus he settled the matter 
 for the time to come, made it a statute of his kingdom (a statute of 
 distributions, <I>primo Davidis--in the first year of David's 
 reign</I>), an ordinance of war

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 that <I>as his part is that goes down to the battle,</I> and hazards
 his life in the high places of the field, so shall his be that guards 
 the carriages. Abraham returned the spoils of Sodom to the right 
 owners, and quitted his title to them <I>jure belli--derived from the 
 laws of war.</I> If we help others to recover their right, we must not 
 think that this alienates the property and makes it ours. God appointed 
 that the spoil of Midian should be divided between the soldiers and the 
 whole congregation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:27">Num. xxxi. 27</A>.

 The case here was somewhat different, but governed by the same general
 rule--that we are members one of another. The disciples, at first, 
 <I>had all things common,</I> and we should still be <I>ready to 
 distribute, willing to communicate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:18">1 Tim. vi. 18</A>.

 When <I>kings of armies did flee apace, she that tarried at home did
 divide the spoil,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:12">Ps. lxviii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David was generous and kind to all his friends. When he had given 
 every one his own with interest there was a considerable overplus, 
 which David, as general, had the disposal of; probably the spoil of the 
 tents of the Amalekites consisted much in plate and jewels 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:24,26">Judg. viii. 24, 26</A>),

 and these, because he thought they would but make his own soldiers
 proud and effeminate, he thought fit to make presents of to his 
 friends, even the <I>elders of Judah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Several places are here named to which he sent of these presents, all
 of them in or near the tribe of Judah. The first place named is Bethel, 
 which signifies <I>the house of God;</I> that place shall be first 
 served for its name's sake; or perhaps it means not the city so called, 
 but the place where the ark was, which was therefore <I>the house of 
 God.</I> Thither David sent the first and best, to those that attended 
 there, for his sake who is the first and best. <I>Hebron</I> is named 
 last

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),
 
 probably because thither he sent the residuum, which was the largest
 share, having an eye upon that place as fittest for his head-quarters,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+2:1">2 Sam. ii. 1</A>.

 In David's sending these presents observe, 

 1. His generosity. He aimed not to enrich himself, but to serve his
 country; and therefore God afterwards enriched him, and set him to rule 
 the country he had served.  It becomes gracious souls to be generous.  
 <I>There is that scatters, and yet increases.</I> 

 2. His gratitude. He sent presents to <I>all the places where he and
 his men were wont to haunt</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:31"><I>v.</I>  31</A>),

 that is, to all that he had received kindness from, that had sheltered
 him and sent him intelligence or provisions. Note, Honesty, as well as 
 honour, obliges us to requite the favours that have been done us, or at 
 least to make a real acknowledgment of them as far as is in the power 
 of our hand. 

 3. His piety. He calls his present <I>a blessing;</I> for no present we
 give to our friends will be a comfort to them but as it is made so by 
 the blessing of God: it intimates that his prayers for them accompanied 
 his present. He also sent it out of <I>the spoil of the enemies of the 
 Lord</I> (so he calls them, not <I>his</I> enemies), that they might 
 rejoice in the victory for the Lord's sake, and might join with him in 
 thanksgivings for it. 

 4. His policy.  He sent these presents among his countrymen to engage
 them to be ready to appear for him upon his accession to the throne, 
 which he now saw at hand. <I>A man's gift maketh room for him.</I> He 
 was fit to be a king who thus showed the bounty and liberality of a 
 king.  Munificence recommends a man more than magnificence. The 
 Ziphites had none of his presents, nor the men of Keilah; and thus he 
 showed that, though he was such a saint as not to revenge affronts, yet 
 he was not such a fool as not to take notice of them.</P>
