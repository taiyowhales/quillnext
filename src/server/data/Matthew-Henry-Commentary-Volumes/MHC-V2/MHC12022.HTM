 This chapter begins the story of the reign of good king Josiah, whose 
 goodness shines the brighter because it came just after so much 
 wickedness, which he had the honour to reform, and just before so great 
 a destruction, which yet he had not the honour to prevent. Here, after 
 his general character 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 we have a particular account of the respect he paid

 I. To God's house, which he repaired,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:3-7">ver. 3-7</A>

 II. To God's book, which he was much affected with the reading of,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>

 III. To God's messengers, whom he thereupon consulted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>

 And by whom he received from God an answer threatening Jerusalem's
 destruction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>),

 but promising favour to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>),

 upon which he set about that glorious work of reformation which we have
 an account of in the next chapter.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Josiah <I>was</I> eight years old when he began to reign, and he
 reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
 <I>was</I> Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.
 &nbsp; 2 And he did <I>that which was</I> right in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not
 aside to the right hand or to the left.
 &nbsp; 3 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah,
 <I>that</I> the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of
 Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying,
 &nbsp; 4 Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver
 which is brought into the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which the keepers of
 the door have gathered of the people:
 &nbsp; 5 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the
 work, that have the oversight of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and let
 them give it to the doers of the work which <I>is</I> in the house of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to repair the breaches of the house,
 &nbsp; 6 Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber
 and hewn stone to repair the house.
 &nbsp; 7 Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money
 that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt
 faithfully.
 &nbsp; 8 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I
 have found the book of the law in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. And
 Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.
 &nbsp; 9 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king
 word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that
 was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of
 them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 10 And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the
 priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the
 king.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Concerning Josiah we are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That he was very young when he began to reign 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 only eight years old. Solomon says, <I>Woe unto thee, O land! when thy
 king is a child;</I> but happy art thou, O land! when thy king is 
 <I>such</I> a child. Our English Israel had once a king that was such a 
 child, Edward VI. Josiah, being young, had not received any bad 
 impressions from the example of his father and grandfather, but soon 
 saw their errors, and God gave his grace to take warning by them. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:14-22">Ezek. xviii. 14</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That he <I>did that which was right in the sight of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 See the sovereignty of divine grace--the father passed by and left to
 perish in his sin, the son a chosen vessel. See the triumphs of that 
 grace--Josiah born of a wicked father, no good education nor good 
 example given him, but many about him who no doubt advised him to tread 
 in his father's steps and few that gave him any good counsel, and yet 
 the grace of God made him an eminent saint, <I>cut him off from the 
 wild olive</I> and <I>grafted him into the good olive,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:24">Rom. xi. 24</A>.
 
 Nothing is too hard for that grace to do. He walked in a good way, and
 turned not aside (as some of his predecessors had done who began well) 
 <I>to the right hand nor to the left.</I> There are errors on both 
 hands, but God kept him in the right way; he fell neither into 
 superstition nor profaneness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That he took care for the repair of the temple. This he did in the 
 eighteenth year of his reign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+34:8">2 Chron. xxxiv. 8</A>.

 He began much sooner to <I>seek the Lord</I> (as appears,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+34:3">2 Chron. xxxiv. 3</A>),

 but it is to be feared the work of reformation went slowly on and met
 with much opposition, so that he could not effect what he desired and 
 designed, till his power was thoroughly confirmed. The consideration of 
 the time we unavoidably lost in our minority should quicken us, when we 
 have come to years, to act with so much the more vigour in the service 
 of God. Having begun late we have need work hard. He sent Shaphan, the 
 secretary of state, to Hilkiah the high priest, to take an account of 
 the money that was collected for this use by the door-keepers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);
 
 for, it seems, they took much the same way of raising the money that
 Joash took,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:9"><I>ch.</I> xii. 9</A>.

 When people gave by a little at a time the burden was insensible, and,
 the contribution being voluntary, it was not complained of. This money, 
 so collected, he ordered him to lay out for the repair of the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 And now, it seems, the workmen (as in the days of Joash) acquitted
 themselves so well that <I>there was no reckoning made with them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 which is certainly mentioned to the praise of the workmen, that they
 gained such a reputation for honesty, but whether to the praise of 
 those that employed them I know not; a man should count money (we say) 
 after his own father; it would not have been amiss to have <I>reckoned 
 with the workmen,</I> that others also might be satisfied of their 
 honesty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That, in repairing the temple, <I>the book of the law</I> was 
 happily found and brought to the king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:8,10"><I>v.</I> 8, 10</A>.

 Some think this book was the autograph, or original manuscript, of the
 five books of Moses, under his own hand; others think it was only an 
 ancient and authentic copy. Most likely it was that which, by the 
 command of Moses, was laid up in the most holy place,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:24-26">Deut. xxxi. 24</A>,

 &c. 

 1. It seems, this book of the law was lost or missing. Perhaps it was 
 carelessly mislaid and neglected, thrown by into a corner (as some 
 throw their Bibles), by those that knew not the value of it, and 
 forgotten there; or it was maliciously concealed by some of the 
 idolatrous kings, or their agents, who were restrained by the 
 providence of God or their own consciences from burning and destroying 
 it, but buried it, in hopes it would never see the light again; or, as 
 some think, it was carefully laid up by some of its friends, lest it 
 should fall into the hands of its enemies.  Whoever were the 
 instruments of its preservation, we ought to acknowledge the hand of 
 God in it. If this was the only authentic copy of the Pentateuch then 
 in being, which had (as I may say) so narrow a turn for its life and 
 was so near perishing, I wonder the hearts of all good people did not 
 tremble for that sacred treasure, as Eli's for the ark, and I am sure 
 we now have reason to thank God, upon our knees, for that happy 
 providence by which Hilkiah found this book at this time, found it when 
 <I>he sought it not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:1">Isa. lxv. 1</A>.

 If the holy scriptures had not been of God, they would not have been in
 being at this day; God's care of the Bible is a plain indication of his 
 interest in it. 

 2. Whether this was the only authentic copy in being or no, it seems
 the things contained in it were new both to the king himself and to the 
 high priest; for the king, upon the reading of it, rent his clothes. We 
 have reason to think that neither the command for the king's writing a 
 copy of the law, nor that for the public reading of the law every 
 seventh year

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:18,31:10,11">Deut. xvii. 18; xxxi. 10, 11</A>),

 had been observed for a long time; and when the instituted means of
 keeping up religion are neglected religion itself will soon go to 
 decay. Yet, on the other hand, if the book of the law was lost, it 
 seems difficult to determine what rule Josiah went by in doing that 
 which was <I>right in the sight of the Lord,</I> and how the priests 
 and people kept up the rites of their religion. I am apt to think that 
 the people generally took up with abstracts of the law, like our 
 abridgements of the statutes, which the priests, to save themselves the 
 trouble of writing and the people of reading the book at large, had 
 furnished them with--a sort of ritual, directing them in the 
 observances of their religion, but leaving out what they thought fit, 
 and particularly the promises and threatenings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:1-14,De+28:1-68">Lev. xxvi. and Deut. xxviii.</A>,

 &c.), for I observe that these were the portions of the law which
 Josiah was so much affected with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 for these were new to him. No summaries, extracts, or collections, out
 of the Bible (though they may have their use) can be effectual to 
 convey and preserve the knowledge of God and his will like the Bible 
 itself. It was no marvel that the people were so corrupt when the book 
 of the law was such a scarce thing among them; where that vision is not 
 the people perish. Those that endeavoured to debauch them no doubt used 
 all the arts they could to get that book out of their hands. The church 
 of Rome could not keep up the use of images but by forbidding the use 
 of the scripture. 

 3.  It was a great instance of God's favour, and a token for good to
 Josiah and his people, that the book of the law was thus seasonably 
 brought to light, to direct and quicken that blessed reformation which 
 Josiah had begun. It is a sign that God has mercy in store for a people 
 when he magnifies his law among them and makes that honourable, and 
 furnishes them with means for the increase of scripture-knowledge. The 
 translating of the scriptures into vulgar tongues was the glory, 
 strength, and joy of the Reformation from Popery. It is observable that 
 they were about a good work, repairing the temple, when they found the 
 book of the law. Those that do their duty according to their knowledge 
 shall have their knowledge increased.  To him that hath shall be given.  
 The book of the law was an abundant recompence for all their care and 
 cost about the repair of the temple.  

 4. Hilkiah the priest was exceedingly well pleased with the discovery.
 "O," says he to Shaphan, "rejoice with me, for <I>I have found the book 
 of the law,</I> <B><I>eureka, eureka,</I></B>--<I>I have found, I have 
 found,</I> that jewel of inestimable value. Here, carry it to the king; 
 it is the richest jewel of his crown. Read it before him. He walks in 
 <I>the way of David his father,</I> and, if he be like him, he will 
 love the book of the law and bid that welcome; that will be his delight 
 and his counsellor."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of
 the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.
 &nbsp; 12 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the
 son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the
 scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,
 &nbsp; 13 Go ye, enquire of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for me, and for the people, and
 for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found:
 for great <I>is</I> the wrath of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that is kindled against us,
 because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this
 book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning
 us.
 &nbsp; 14 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan,
 and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum
 the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe;
 (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed
 with her.
 &nbsp; 15 And she said unto them, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel,
 Tell the man that sent you to me,
 &nbsp; 16 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Behold, I will bring evil upon this
 place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, <I>even</I> all the words of
 the book which the king of Judah hath read:
 &nbsp; 17 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
 other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the
 works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against
 this place, and shall not be quenched.
 &nbsp; 18 But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of
 Israel, <I>As touching</I> the words which thou hast heard;
 &nbsp; 19 Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled
 thyself before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, when thou heardest what I spake against
 this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should
 become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and
 wept before me; I also have heard <I>thee,</I> saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 20 Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and
 thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes
 shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.
 And they brought the king word again.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We hear no more of the repairing of the temple: no doubt that good work 
 went on well; but the book of the law that was found in it occupies us 
 now, and well it may. It is not laid up in the king's cabinet as a 
 piece of antiquity, a rarity to be admired, but it is read before the 
 king. Those put the truest honour upon their Bibles that study them and 
 converse with them daily, feed on that bread and walk by that light. 
 Men of honour and business must look upon an acquaintance with God's 
 word to be their best business and honour. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The impressions which the reading of the law made upon Josiah. He 
 rent his clothes, as one ashamed of the sin of his people and afraid of 
 the wrath of God; he had long thought the case of his kingdom bad, by 
 reason of the idolatries and impieties that had been found among them, 
 but he never thought it so bad as he perceived it to be by the book of 
 the law now read to him. The rending of his clothes signified the 
 rending of his heart for the dishonour done to God, and the ruin he saw 
 coming upon his people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The application he made to God hereupon: <I>Go, enquire of the Lord 
 for me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Two things we may suppose he desired to know:--"Enquire, 

 (1.) What we shall do; what course we shall take to turn away God's
 wrath and prevent the judgments which our sins have deserved." 
 Convictions of sin and wrath should put us upon this enquiry, <I>What 
 shall we do to be saved? Wherewithal shall we come before the Lord?</I> 
 If you will thus enquire, enquire quickly, before it be too late.

 (2.) "What we may expect and must provide for." He acknowledges,
 "<I>Our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book;</I> if 
 this be the rule of right, certainly our fathers have been much in the 
 wrong." Now that <I>the commandment came sin revived,</I> and appeared 
 sin; in the glass of the law, he saw the sins of his people more 
 numerous and more heinous than he had before seen them, and more 
 exceedingly sinful. He infers hence, "Certainly <I>great is the wrath 
 that is kindled against us;</I> if this be the word of God, as no doubt 
 it is, and he will be true to his word, as no doubt he will be, we are 
 all undone. I never thought the threatenings of the law so severe, and 
 the curses of the covenant so terrible, as now I find them to be; it is 
 time to look about us if these be in force against us." Note, Those who 
 are truly apprehensive of the weight of God's wrath cannot but be very 
 solicitous to obtain his favour, and inquisitive how they may make 
 their peace with him.  Magistrates should enquire for their people, and 
 study how to prevent the judgments of God that they see hanging over 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This enquiry Josiah sent, 

 (1.) By some of his great men, who are named 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>,
 
 and again

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Thus he put an honour upon the oracle, by employing those of the first
 rank to attend it.

 (2.) To Huldah the prophetess, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The spirit of prophecy, that inestimable treasure, was sometimes put
 not only into <I>earthen</I> vessels, but into the <I>weaker</I> 
 vessels, <I>that the excellency of the power might be of God.</I> 
 Miriam helped to lead Israel out of Egypt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:4">Mic. vi. 4</A>),

 Deborah judged them, and now Huldah instructed them in the mind of God,
 and her being a wife was no prejudice at all to her being a prophetess; 
 <I>marriage is honourable in all.</I> It was a mercy to Jerusalem that 
 when Bibles were scarce they had prophets, as afterwards, when prophecy 
 ceased, that they had more Bibles; for God never leaves himself without 
 witness, because he will leave sinners without excuse. Jeremiah and 
 Zephaniah prophesied at this time, yet the king's messengers made 
 Huldah their oracle, probably because her husband having a place at 
 court (for he was keeper of the wardrobe) they had had more and longer 
 acquaintance with her and greater assurances of her commission than of 
 any other; they had, it is likely, consulted her upon other occasions, 
 and had found that the word of God in her mouth was truth. She was 
 near, for she dwelt at Jerusalem, in a place called <I>Mishneh,</I> the 
 second rank of buildings from the royal palace. The Jews say that she 
 prophesied among the women, the court ladies, being herself one of 
 them, who it is probable had their apartments in that place. Happy the 
 court that had a prophetess within the verge of it, and knew how to 
 value her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The answer he received from God to his enquiry. Huldah returned it 
 not in the language of a courtier--"Pray give my humble service to his
 Majesty, and let him know that this is the message I have for him from 
 the God of Israel;" but in the dialect of a prophetess, speaking from 
 him before whom all stand upon the same level--<I>Tell the man that sent
 you to me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Even kings, though gods to us, are men to God, and shall so be dealt
 with; for <I>with him there is no respect of persons.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She let him know what judgments God had in store for Judah and 
 Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>):

 <I>My wrath shall be kindled against this place;</I> and what is hell
 itself but the fire of God's wrath kindled against sinners? Observe,

 (1.) The degree and duration of it. It is so kindled that <I>it shall
 not be quenched;</I> the decree has gone forth; it is too late now to 
 think of preventing it; the iniquity of Jerusalem shall not be purged 
 with sacrifice or offering. Hell is unquenchable fire.

 (2.) The reference it has, 

 [1.] To their sins: "They have committed them, as it were, with design, 
 and on purpose to provoke me to anger.  It is a fire of their own 
 kindling; they would provoke me, and at length I am provoked."

 [2.] To God's threatenings: "The evil I bring is according to the words 
 of the book which the king of Judah has read; the scripture is 
 fulfilled in it. Those that would not be bound by the precept shall be 
 bound by the penalty." God will be found no less terrible to impenitent 
 sinners than his word makes him to be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She let him know what mercy God had in store for him. 

 (1.) Notice is taken of his great tenderness and concern for the glory
 of God and the welfare of his kingdom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Thy heart was tender.</I> Note, God will distinguish those that
 distinguish themselves. The generality of the people were hardened and 
 their hearts unhumbled, so were the wicked kings his predecessors, but 
 Josiah's heart was tender. He received the impressions of God's word, 
 trembled at it and yielded to it; he was exceedingly grieved for the 
 dishonour done to God by the sins of his fathers and of his people; he 
 was afraid of the judgments of God, which he saw coming upon Jerusalem, 
 and earnestly deprecated them. This is tenderness of heart, and thus he 
 <I>humbled himself before the Lord,</I> and expressed these pious 
 affections by rending his clothes and weeping before God, probably in 
 his closet; but he that sees in secret says it was <I>before him,</I> 
 and he heard it, and put every tear of tenderness into his bottle. 
 Note, Those that most fear God's wrath are least likely to feel it. It 
 should seem that those words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:32">Lev. xxvi. 32</A>)

 much affected Josiah, <I>I will bring the land into desolation;</I> for
 when he heard of <I>the desolation and of the curse,</I> that is, that 
 God would forsake them and <I>separate them to evil</I> (for till it 
 came to that they were neither desolate nor accursed), then he rent his 
 clothes: the threatening went to his heart.

 (2.) A reprieve is granted till after his death

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+22:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>I will gather thee to thy fathers.</I> The saints then, no doubt,
 had a comfortable prospect of happiness on the other side death, else 
 being gathered to their fathers would not have been so often made the 
 matter of a promise as we find it was. Josiah could not prevail to 
 prevent the judgment itself, but God promised him he should not live to 
 see it, which (especially considering that he died in the midst of his 
 days, before he was forty years old) would have been but a small reward 
 for his eminent piety if there had not been another world in which he 
 should be abundantly recompensed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:16">Heb. xi. 16</A>.

 When the righteous is <I>taken away from the evil to come he enters
 into peace,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:1,2">Isa. lvii. 1, 2</A>.

 This is promised to Josiah here: <I>Thou shalt go to thy grave in
 peace,</I> which refers not to the manner of his death (for he was 
 killed in a battle), but to the time of it; it was a little before the 
 captivity in Babylon, that great trouble, in comparison with which the 
 rest were as nothing, so that he might be truly said to die in peace 
 that did not live to share in that. He died in the love and favour of 
 God, which secure such a peace as no circumstances of dying, no, not 
 dying in the field of war, could alter the nature of, or break in 
 upon.</P>
