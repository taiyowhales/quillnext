 We had some account given us of Benjamin in the foregoing chapter; here 
 we have a larger catalogue of the great men of that tribe. 

 1. Because of that tribe Saul came, the first king of Israel, to the
 story of whom the sacred writer is hastening, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+10:1"><I>ch.</I> x. 1</A>.

 2. Because that tribe clave to Judah, inhabited much of Jerusalem, was
 one of the two tribes that went into captivity, and returned back; and
 that story also he has an eye to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:1"><I>ch.</I> ix. 1</A>.

 Here is,

 I. Some of the heads of that tribe named,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now Benjamin begat Bela his firstborn, Ashbel the second, and
 Aharah the third,
 &nbsp; 2  Nohah the fourth, and Rapha the fifth.
 &nbsp; 3  And the sons of Bela were, Addar, and Gera, and Abihud,
 &nbsp; 4  And Abishua, and Naaman, and Ahoah,
 &nbsp; 5  And Gera, and Shephuphan, and Huram.
 &nbsp; 6  And these <I>are</I> the sons of Ehud: these are the heads of the
 fathers of the inhabitants of Geba, and they removed them to
 Manahath:
 &nbsp; 7  And Naaman, and Ahiah, and Gera, he removed them, and begat
 Uzza, and Ahihud.
 &nbsp; 8  And Shaharaim begat <I>children</I> in the country of Moab, after
 he had sent them away; Hushim and Baara <I>were</I> his wives.
 &nbsp; 9  And he begat of Hodesh his wife, Jobab, and Zibia, and Mesha,
 and Malcham,
 &nbsp; 10  And Jeuz, and Shachia, and Mirma. These <I>were</I> his sons,
 heads of the fathers.
 &nbsp; 11  And of Hushim he begat Abitub, and Elpaal.
 &nbsp; 12  The sons of Elpaal; Eber, and Misham, and Shamed, who built
 Ono, and Lod, with the towns thereof:
 &nbsp; 13  Beriah also, and Shema, who <I>were</I> heads of the fathers of
 the inhabitants of Aijalon, who drove away the inhabitants of
 Gath:
 &nbsp; 14  And Ahio, Shashak, and Jeremoth,
 &nbsp; 15  And Zebadiah, and Arad, and Ader,
 &nbsp; 16  And Michael, and Ispah, and Joha, the sons of Beriah;

 There is little or nothing of history in all these verses; we have not 
 therefore much to observe. 

 1. As to the difficulties that occur in this and the foregoing
 genealogies we need not perplex ourselves. I presume Ezra took them as 
 he found them <I>in the books of the kings of Israel and Judah</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:1"><I>ch.</I> ix. 1</A>),

 according as they were given in by the several tribes, each observing
 what method they thought fit. Hence some <I>as</I>cend, others 
 <I>de</I>secnd; some have <I>numbers</I> affixed, others <I>places;</I> 
 some have historical remarks intermixed, others have not; some are 
 shorter, others longer; some agree with other records, others differ; 
 some, it is likely, were torn, erased, and blotted, others more 
 legible. Those of Dan and Reuben were entirely lost. This holy man 
 wrote as he was moved by the Holy Ghost; but there was no necessity for 
 the making up of the defects, no, nor for the rectifying of the 
 mistakes, of these genealogies by inspiration. It was sufficient that 
 he copied them out as they came into his hand, or so much of them as 
 was requisite to the present purpose, which was the directing of the 
 returned captives to settle as nearly as they could with those of their 
 own family, and in the places of their former residence. We may suppose 
 that many things in these genealogies which to us seem intricate, 
 abrupt, and perplexed, were plain and easy to them then (who knew how 
 to fill up the deficiencies) and abundantly answered the intention of 
 the publishing of them. 

 2. Many great and mighty nations there were now in being upon earth,
 and many illustrious men in them, whose names are buried in perpetual 
 oblivion, while the names of multitudes of the Israel of God are here 
 carefully preserved in everlasting remembrance.  They are <I>Jasher, 
 Jeshurun--just ones,</I> and <I>the memory of the just is blessed.</I> 
 Many of these we have reason to fear, came short of everlasting honour 
 (for even the wicked kings of Judah come into the genealogy), yet the 
 perpetuating of their names here was a figure of the writing of the 
 names of all God's spiritual Israel in the Lamb's book of life. 

 3. This tribe of Benjamin was once brought to a very low ebb, in the
 time of the judges, upon the occasion of the iniquity of Gibeah, when 
 only 600 men escaped the sword of justice; and yet, in these 
 genealogies, it makes as good a figure as almost any of the tribes: for 
 it is the honour of God to help the weakest and raise up those that are 
 most diminished and abased. 
 
 4. Here is mention of one Ehud

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 in the preceding verse of one Gera
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)
 
 and
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 of one that descended from him, that <I>begat children in the country
 of Moab,</I> which inclines me to think it was that Ehud who was the 
 second of the judges of Israel; for he is said to be <I>the son of 
 Gera</I> and <I>a Benjamite</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+3:15">Judg. iii. 15</A>),

 and he delivered Israel from the oppression of the Moabites by killing
 the king of Moab, which might give him a greater sway in the country of 
 Moab than we find evidence of in his history and might occasion some of 
 his posterity to settle there. 

 5. Here is mention of some of the Benjamites that <I>drove away the
 inhabitants of Gath</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 perhaps those that had slain the Ephraimites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:21"><I>ch.</I> vii. 21</A>)

 or their posterity, by way of reprisal: and one of those that did this
 piece of justice was named <I>Beriah</I> too, that name in which the 
 memorial of that injury was preserved. 

 6. Particular notice is taken of those that <I>dwelt in Jerusalem</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+8:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>
 
 and again

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+8:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 that those whose ancestors had had their residence there might thereby
 be induced, at their return from captivity, to settle there too, which, 
 for aught that appears, few were willing to do, because it was the post 
 of danger: and therefore we find

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+11:2">Neh. xi. 2</A>)

 <I>the people blessed those that willingly offered themselves to dwell
 at Jerusalem,</I> the greater part being inclined to prefer the cities 
 of Judah. Those whose godly parents had their conversation in the new 
 Jerusalem should thereby be engaged to set their faces thitherward and 
 pursue the way thither, whatever it cost them.</P>

 It is observable that among all the genealogies of the tribes there is 
 no mention of any of the kings of Israel after the defection from the 
 house of David, much less of their families; not a word of Jeroboam's 
 house or Baasha's, of Umri's or Jehu's; for they were all idolaters. 
 But of the family of Saul, which was the royal family before the 
 elevation of David, we have here a particular account. 

 1. Before Saul, Kish and Ner only are named, his father and
 grandfather, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+8:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.
 
 His pedigree is carried higher

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:1">1 Sam. ix. 1</A>,

 only there Kish is said to be <I>the son of Abiel,</I> here <I>of
 Ner.</I> He was in truth the son of Ner but the grandson of Abiel, as 
 appears by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:51">1 Sam. xiv. 51</A>,

 where it is said that <I>Ner was the son of Abiel,</I> and that Abner,
 who was the son of Ner, was Saul's uncle (that is, his father's 
 brother); therefore his father was also the son of Ner. It is common in 
 all languages to put sons for grandsons and other descendents, much 
 more in the scanty language of the Hebrews. 

 2. After Saul, divers of his sons are named, but the posterity of none
 of them, save Jonathan only, who was blessed with numerous issue and 
 those honoured with a place in the sacred genealogies for the sake of 
 his sincere kindness to David. The line of Jonathan is drawn down here 
 for about ten generations. Perhaps David was, in a particular manner, 
 careful to preserve that, and assigned it a page by itself, because of 
 the covenant made between his seed and Jonathan's seed forever,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:15,23,42">1 Sam. xx. 15, 23, 42</A>.

 This genealogy ends in Ulam, whose family became famous in the tribe of
 Benjamin for the number of its valiant men. Of that one man's posterity 
 there were, as it should seem, at one time, 150 archers brought into 
 the field of battle, that were <I>mighty men of valour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+8:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 That is taken notice of concerning them which is more a man's praise
 than his pomp or wealth is, that they were qualified to serve their 
 country.</P>
