 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter is wholly taken up with the reign of Ahaz; and we have 
 quite enough of it, unless it were better. He had a good father, and a 
 better son, and yet was himself one of the worst of the kings of Judah. 

 I. He was a notorious idolater, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:1-4">ver.  1-4</A>.

 II. With the treasures of the temple, as well as his own, he hired the
 king of Assyria to invade Syria and Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.

 III. He took pattern from an idol's altar which he saw at Damascus for
 a new altar in God's temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:10-16">ver. 10-16</A>.

 IV. He abused and embezzled the furniture of the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:17,18">ver. 17, 18</A>.
 
 And so his story ends, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:19,20">ver. 19, 20</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the
 son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
 &nbsp; 2 Twenty years old <I>was</I> Ahaz when he began to reign, and
 reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not <I>that which was</I>
 right in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God, like David his father.
 &nbsp; 3 But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and
 made his son to pass through the fire, according to the
 abominations of the heathen, whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> cast out from before
 the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 4 And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and
 on the hills, and under every green tree.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a general character of the reign of Ahaz. Few and evil 
 were his days--few, for he died at thirty-six--evil, for we are here
 told, 

 1. That he <I>did not that which was right like David</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that is, he had none of that concern and affection for the instituted
 service and worship of God for which David was celebrated. He had no 
 love for the temple, made no conscience of his duty to God, nor had any 
 regard to his law. Herein he was unlike David; it was his honour that 
 he was of the house and lineage of David, and it was owing to God's 
 ancient covenant with David that he was now upon the throne, which 
 aggravated his wickedness; for he was a reproach to that honourable 
 name and family, which therefore was really a reproach to him 
 (<I>Degeneranti genus opprobrium</I>--<I>A good extraction is a 
 disgrace to him who degenerates from it</I>), and though he enjoyed the
 benefit of David's piety he did not tread in the steps of it.

 2. That he walked <I>in the way of the kings of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 who all worshipped the calves. He was not joined in any affinity with
 them, as Jehoram and Ahaziah were with the house of Ahab, but, <I>ex 
 mero motu--without any instigation,</I> walked in their way. The kings 
 of Israel pleaded policy and reasons of state for their idolatry, but 
 Ahaz had no such pretence: in him it was the most unreasonable 
 impolitic thing that could be. They were his enemies, and had proved 
 enemies to themselves too by their idolatry; yet he walked in their 
 way.

 3. That he <I>made his sons to pass through the fire,</I> to the honour 
 of his dunghill-deities. He burnt them, so it is expressly said of him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:3">2 Chron. xxviii. 3</A>),

 burnt some of them, and perhaps made others of them (Hezekiah himself
 not excepted, though afterwards he was never the worse for it) to pass 
 between two fires, or to be drawn through a flame, in token of their 
 dedication to the idol. 

 4. That he did <I>according to the abominations of the heathen whom the 
 Lord had cast out.</I> it was an instance of his great folly that he 
 would be guided in his religion by those whom he saw fallen into the 
 ditch before his eyes, and follow them; and it was an instance of his 
 great impiety that he would conform to those usages which God had 
 declared to be abominable to him, and set himself to write after the 
 copy of those whom God had cast out, thus walking directly contrary to 
 God. 
 
 5. That he <I>sacrificed in the high places,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 If his father had but had zeal enough to take them away, the debauching 
 of his sons might have been prevented; but those that connive at sin 
 know not what dangerous snares they lay for those that come after them. 
 He forsook God's house, was weary of that place where, in his father's 
 time, he had often been detained before the Lord, and performed his 
 devotions on high hills, where he had a better prospect, and under 
 green trees, where he had a more pleasant shade. It was a religion 
 little worth, which was guided by fancy, not by faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of
 Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but
 could not overcome <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 6 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria,
 and drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and
 dwelt there unto this day.
 &nbsp; 7 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria,
 saying, I <I>am</I> thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out
 of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king
 of Israel, which rise up against me.
 &nbsp; 8 And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent
 <I>it for</I> a present to the king of Assyria.
 &nbsp; 9 And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of
 Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried <I>the
 people of</I> it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The attempt of his confederate neighbours, the kings of Syria and 
 Israel, upon him. They thought to make themselves masters of Jerusalem, 
 and to set a king of their own in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:6">Isa. vii. 6</A>.

 In this they fell short, but the king of Syria recovered Elath, a
 considerable port upon the Red Sea, which Amaziah had taken from the 
 Syrians,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:22"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 22</A>.
 
 What can those keep that have lost their religion? Let them expect,
 thenceforward, to be always on the losing hand. 

 2. His project to get clear of them.  Having forsaken God, he had 
 neither courage nor strength to make head against his enemies, nor 
 could he, with any boldness, ask help of God; but he made his court to 
 the king of Assyria, and got him to come in for his relief. Those whose 
 hearts condemn them will go any where in a day of distress rather than 
 to God.  Was it because there was not a God in Israel that he sent to 
 the Assyrian for help? Was the rock of ages removed out of its place, 
 that he stayed himself on this broken reed? The sin itself was its own 
 punishment; for, though it is true that he gained his point (the king 
 of Assyria hearkened to him, and, to serve his own turn, made a descent 
 upon Damascus, whereby he gave a powerful diversion to the king of 
 Syria, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>,

 and obliged him to let fall his design against Ahaz, carrying the
 Syrians captive to Kir, as Amos had expressly foretold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+1:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 5</A>),

 yet, considering all, he made but a bad bargain; for, to compass this,
 
 (1.) He enslaved himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>I am thy servant and thy son,</I> that is, "I will be as dutiful and
 obedient to thee as to a master or father, if thou wilt but do me this 
 good turn." Had he thus humbled himself to God, and implored his 
 favour, he might have been delivered upon easier terms; he might have 
 saved his money, and needed only to have parted with his sins. But, if 
 the prodigal forsake his father's house, he soon becomes a slave to the 
 worst of masters,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:15">Luke xv. 15</A>.
 
 (2.) He impoverished himself; for he took the silver and gold that were
 laid up in the treasury both of the temple and of the kingdom, and sent 
 it to the king of Assyria, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Both church and state must be squeezed and exhausted, to gratify this
 his new patron and guardian. I know not what authority he had thus to 
 dispose of the public stock; but it is common for those that have 
 brought themselves into straits by one sin to help themselves out by 
 another; and those that have alienated themselves from God will make no 
 difficulty of alienating any of his rights.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king
 of Assyria, and saw an altar that <I>was</I> at Damascus: and king
 Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the
 pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.
 &nbsp; 11 And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that
 king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made <I>it</I>
 against king Ahaz came from Damascus.
 &nbsp; 12 And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the
 altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.
 &nbsp; 13 And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and
 poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace
 offerings, upon the altar.
 &nbsp; 14 And he brought also the brasen altar, which <I>was</I> before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and
 the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and put it on the north side of the altar.
 &nbsp; 15 And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the
 great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat
 offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering,
 with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their
 meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it
 all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the
 sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire <I>by.</I>
 &nbsp; 16 Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz
 commanded.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though Ahaz had himself sacrificed in high places, on hills, and under 
 every green tree 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 yet God's altar had hitherto continued in its place and in use, and the
 <I>king's burnt-offering and his meat-offering</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 had been offered upon it by the priests that attended it; but here we
 have it taken away by wicked Ahaz, and another altar, an idolatrous 
 one, put in the room of it--a bolder stroke than the worst of the kings 
 had yet given to religion. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The model of this new altar, taken from one at Damascus, by the king 
 himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The king of Assyria having taken Damascus, thither Ahaz went, to
 congratulate him on his success, to return him thanks for the kindness 
 he had done him by this expedition, and, as his servant and son, to 
 receive his commands. Had he been faithful to his God, he would not 
 have needed to crouch thus meanly to a foreign power. At Damascus, 
 either while viewing the rarities of the place, or rather while joining 
 with them in their devotions (for, when he was there, he thought it no 
 harm to do as they did), he saw an altar that pleased his fancy 
 extremely, not such a plain old-fashioned one as that which he had been 
 trained up in attendance upon at Jerusalem, but curiously carved, it is 
 likely, and adorned with image-work; there were many pretty things 
 about it which he thought significant, surprising, very charming, and 
 calculated to excite his devotion. Solomon had but a dull fancy, he 
 thought, compared with the ingenious artist that made this altar.  
 Nothing will serve him but he must have an altar just like this: a 
 pattern of it must be taken immediately; he cannot stay till he returns 
 himself, but sends it before him in all haste, with orders to Urijah 
 the priest to get one made exactly according to this model and have it 
 ready against he came home. The pattern God showed to Moses in the 
 mount or to David by the Spirit was not comparable to this pattern sent 
 from Damascus. The hearts of idolaters walked after their eyes, which 
 are therefore said to <I>go a whoring after their idols;</I> but the 
 true worshippers worship the true God by faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The making of it by Urijah the priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This Urijah, it is likely, was the chief priest who at this time 
 presided in the temple-service. To him Ahaz sent an intimation of his 
 mind (for we read not of any express orders he gave him), to get an 
 altar made by this pattern. And, without any dispute or objection, he 
 put it in hand immediately, being perhaps as fond of it as the king 
 was, at least being very willing to humour the king and desirous to 
 curry favour with him. Perhaps he might have this excuse for gratifying 
 the king herein, that, by this means, he might keep him to the temple 
 at Jerusalem and prevent his totally deserting it for the high places 
 and the groves.  "Let us oblige him in this," thinks Urijah, "and then 
 he will bring all his sacrifices to us; for by this craft we get our 
 living." But, whatever pretence he had, it was a most base wicked thing 
 for him that was a priest, a chief priest, to make this altar, in 
 compliance with an idolatrous prince, for hereby,

 1. He prostituted his authority and profaned the crown of his 
 priesthood, making himself a servant to the lusts of men. There is not 
 a greater disgrace to the ministry than obsequiousness to such wicked 
 commands as this was. 

 2. He betrayed his trust. As priest, he was bound to maintain and 
 defend God's institutions, and to oppose and witness against all 
 innovations; and, for him to assist and serve the king in setting up an 
 altar to confront the altar which by divine appointment he was 
 consecrated to minister at, was such a piece of treachery and 
 perfidiousness as may justly render him infamous to all posterity. Had 
 he only connived at the doing of it,--had he been frightened into it by 
 menaces,--had he endeavoured to dissuade the king from it, or but 
 delayed the doing of it till he came home, that he might first talk 
 with him about it,--it would not have been so bad; but so willingly to 
 walk after his commandment, as if he were glad of the opportunity to 
 oblige him, was such an affront to the God he served as was utterly 
 inexcusable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The dedicating of it. Urijah, perceiving that the king's heart was 
 much upon it, took care to have it ready against he came down, and set 
 it near the brazen altar, but somewhat lower and further from the door 
 of the temple. The king was exceedingly pleased with it, approached it 
 with all possible veneration, and offered thereon his burnt-offering, 
 &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 His sacrifices were not offered to the God of Israel, but to the gods
 of Damascus (as we find

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:23">2 Chron. xxviii. 23</A>),

 and, when he borrowed the Syrians' altar, no marvel that he borrowed
 their gods.  Naaman, the Syrian, embraced the God of Israel when he got 
 earth from the land of Israel to make an altar of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The removal of God's altar, to make room for it. Urijah was so 
 modest that he put this altar at the lower end of the court, and left 
 God's altar in its place, <I>between this and the house of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 But that would not satisfy Ahaz; he removed God's altar to an obscure 
 corner in the north side of the court, and put his own before the 
 sanctuary, in the place of it. He thinks his new altar is much more 
 stately, and much more sightly, and disgraces that; and therefore "let 
 that be laid aside as a vessel in which there is no pleasure." His 
 superstitious invention, at first, jostled <I>with</I> God's sacred 
 institution, but at length jostled it <I>out.</I> Note, Those will soon 
 come to make nothing of God that will not be content to make him their 
 all. Ahaz durst not (perhaps for fear of the people) quite demolish the 
 brazen altar and knock it to pieces; but, while he ordered all the 
 sacrifices to be offered upon this new altar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 <I>The brazen altar</I> (says he) <I>shall be for me to enquire by.</I>
 Having thrust it out from the use for which it was instituted, which 
 was to sanctify the gifts offered upon it, he pretends to advance it 
 above its institution, which it is common for superstitious people to 
 do. The altar was never designed for an oracle, yet Ahaz will have it 
 for that use. The Romish church seemingly magnifies Christ's 
 sacraments, yet wretchedly corrupts them. But some give another sense 
 of Ahaz's purpose: "As for the brazen altar, I will consider what to do 
 with it, and give order about it." The Jews say that, afterwards, of 
 the brass of it he made that famous dial which was called <I>the dial 
 of Ahaz,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:11"><I>ch.</I> xx. 11</A>.

 The base compliance of the poor-spirited priest with the presumptuous
 usurpations of an ill-spirited king is again taken notice of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):
 
 <I>Urijah the priest did according to all that king Ahaz commanded.</I>
 Miserable is the case of great men when those that should reprove them 
 for their sins strengthen and serve them in their sins.</P>

 <A NAME="2Ki16_18"> </A>
 <A NAME="2Ki16_19"> </A>
 <A NAME="2Ki16_20"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed
 the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the
 brasen oxen that <I>were</I> under it, and put it upon a pavement of
 stones.
 &nbsp; 18 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the
 house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for the king of Assyria.
 &nbsp; 19 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, <I>are</I> they
 not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
 &nbsp; 20 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
 fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his
 stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Ahaz abusing the temple, not the building itself, but some of the 
 furniture of it. 
 
 1. He defaced the bases on which the lavers were set

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+7:28,29">1 Kings vii. 28, 29</A>)

 and took down the molten sea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 These the priests used for washing; against them therefore he seems to
 have had a particular spite. It is one of the greatest prejudices that 
 can be done to religion to obstruct the purifying of the priests, the 
 Lord's ministers.

 2. He removed <I>the covert for the sabbath,</I> erected either in 
 honour of the sabbath or for the conveniency of the priests, when, on 
 the sabbath, they officiated in greater numbers than on other days. 
 Whatever it was, it should seem that in removing it he intended to put 
 a contempt upon the sabbath, and so to open as wide an inlet as any to 
 all manner of impiety. 

 3. The king's entry, which led to the house of the Lord, for the 
 convenience of the royal family (perhaps that ascent which Solomon had 
 made, and which the queen of Sheba admired,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:5">1 Kings x. 5</A>),

 he turned another way, to show that he did not intend to frequent the
 house of the Lord any more. This he did for the king of Assyria, to 
 oblige him, who perhaps returned his visit, and found fault with this 
 entry, as an inconvenience and disparagement to his palace. When those 
 that have had a ready passage to the house of the Lord, to please their 
 neighbours, turn it another way, they are going down the hill apace 
 towards their ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Ahaz resigning his life in the midst of his days, at thirty-six 
 years of age 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 and leaving his kingdom to a better man, Hezekiah his son

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 who proved as much a friend to the temple as he had been an enemy to
 it. Perhaps this very son he had made to pass through the fire, and 
 thereby dedicated him to Moloch; but God, by his grace, snatched him as 
 a brand out of the burning.</P>
