 How do the clouds return after the rain! No sooner is one of David's 
 troubles over than another arises, as it were out of the ashes of the 
 former, wherein the threatening is fulfilled, that the sword should 
 never depart from his house. 

 I. Before he reaches Jerusalem a new rebellion is raised by Sheba, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. His first work, when he comes to Jerusalem, is to condemn his
 concubines to perpetual imprisonment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:3">ver. 3</A>.

 III. Amass, whom he entrusts to raise an army against Sheba, is too
 slow in his motions, which puts him into a fright, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>.

 IV. One of his generals barbarously murders the other, when they are
 taking the field, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:7-13">ver. 7-13</A>.

 V. Sheba is at length shut up in the city of Abel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:14,15">ver. 14, 15</A>),

 but the citizens deliver him up to Joab, and so his rebellion is
 crushed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:16-22">ver. 16-22</A>.

 The chapter concludes with a short account of David's great officers,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name
 <I>was</I> Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a
 trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we
 inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 2 So every man of Israel went up from after David, <I>and</I>
 followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto
 their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 3 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took
 the ten women <I>his</I> concubines, whom he had left to keep the
 house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto
 them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in
 widowhood.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, in the midst of his triumphs, has here the affliction to see his 
 kingdom disturbed and his family disgraced.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His subjects revolting from him at the instigation of <I>a man of 
 Belial,</I> whom they followed when they forsook the <I>man after God's 
 own heart.</I> Observe, 

 1. That this happened immediately upon the crushing of Absalom's
 rebellion. We must not think it strange, while we are in this world, if 
 the end of one trouble be the beginning of another: deep sometimes 
 calls unto deep. 

 2. That the people were now just returning to their allegiance, when,
 of a sudden, they flew off from it. When a reconciliation is newly 
 made, it ought to be handled with great tenderness and caution, lest 
 the peace break again before it be settled. A broken bone, when it is 
 set, must have time to knot. 

 3.  That the ring-leader of this rebellion was Sheba, a Benjamite by 
 birth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 who had his habitation in Mount Ephraim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Shimei and he were both of Saul's tribe, and both retained the ancient
 grudge of that house.  Against the kingdom of the Messiah there is an 
 hereditary enmity in the serpent's seed, and a succession of attempts 
 to overthrow it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1,2">Ps. ii. 1, 2</A>);

 but he that sits in heaven laughs at them all.

 4. That the occasion of it was that foolish quarrel, which we read of
 in the close of the foregoing chapter, between the elders of Israel and 
 the elders of Judah, about bringing the king back. It was a point of 
 honour that was disputed between them, which had most interest in 
 David. "We are more numerous," say the elders of Israel. "We are nearer 
 akin to him," say the elders of Judah. Now one would think David very 
 safe and happy when his subjects are striving which shall love him 
 best, and be most forward to show him respect; yet even that strife 
 proves the occasion of a rebellion. The men of Israel complained to 
 David of the slight which the men of Judah had put upon them. If he had 
 now countenanced their complaint, commended their zeal, and returned 
 them thanks for it, he might have confirmed them in his interest; but 
 he seemed partial to his own tribe: <I>Their words prevailed above the 
 words of the men of Israel;</I> as some read the last words of the 
 foregoing chapter. David inclined to justify them, and, when the men of 
 Israel perceived this, they flew off with indignation. "If the king 
 will suffer himself to be engrossed by the men of Judah, let him and 
 them make their best of one another, and we will set up one for 
 ourselves. We thought we had ten parts in David, but such an interest 
 will not be allowed us; the men of Judah tell us, in effect, <I>we have 
 no part in him,</I> and therefore we will have none, nor will we attend 
 him any further in his return to Jerusalem, nor own him for our king." 
 This was proclaimed by Sheba 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 who probably was a man of note, and had been active in Absalom's
 rebellion; the disgusted Israelites took the hint, and <I>went up from 
 after David to follow Sheba</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that is, the generality of them did so, only the men of Judah adhered
 to him. Learn hence,

 (1.) That it is as impolitic for princes to be partial in their 
 attentions to their subjects as it is for parents to be so to their 
 children; both should carry it with an even hand. 

 (2.) Those know not what they do that make light of the affections of 
 their inferiors, by not countenancing and accepting it.  Their hatred 
 may be feared whose love is despised. 

 (3.) <I>The beginning of strife is as the letting forth of water;</I> 
 it is <I>therefore</I> wisdom to <I>leave it off before it be meddled 
 with,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:14">Prov. xvii. 14</A>.

 How great a matter doth a little of this fire kindle!

 (4.) The perverting of words is the subverting of peace; and much 
 mischief is made by forcing invidious constructions upon what is said 
 and written and drawing consequences that were never intended. The men 
 of Judah said, <I>The king is near of kin to us.</I> "By this," say the 
 men of Israel, "you mean that <I>we have no part in him;</I>" whereas 
 they meant no such thing. 

 (5.) People are very apt to run into extremes. <I>We have ten parts in
 David,</I> said they; and, almost in the next breath, <I>We have no 
 part in him.</I> Today <I>Hosanna,</I> to-morrow <I>Crucify.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His concubines imprisoned for life, and he himself under a 
 necessity of putting them in confinement, because they had been defiled 
 by Absalom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 David had multiplied wives, contrary to the law and they proved a grief
 and shame to him. Those whom he had sinfully taken pleasure in he was 
 now,

 1. Obliged, in duty, to put away, they being rendered unclean to him by 
 the vile uncleanness his son had committed with them. Those whom he had 
 loved must now be loathed. 

 2. Obliged, in prudence, to shut up in privacy, not to be seen abroad
 for shame, lest the sight of them should give occasion to people to 
 speak of what Absalom had done to them, which ought not to be so much 
 as named, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:1">1 Cor. v. 1</A>.
 
 That that villany might be buried in obscurity.

 3. Obliged, in justice to shut up in prison, to punish them for their 
 easy submission to Absalom's lust, despairing perhaps of David's 
 return, and giving him up for gone. Let none expect to do ill and fare 
 well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah
 within three days, and be thou here present.
 &nbsp; 5 So Amasa went to assemble <I>the men of</I> Judah: but he tarried
 longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
 &nbsp; 6 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri
 do us more harm than <I>did</I> Absalom: take thou thy lord's
 servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities,
 and escape us.
 &nbsp; 7 And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites,
 and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of
 Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
 &nbsp; 8 When they <I>were</I> at the great stone which <I>is</I> in Gibeon,
 Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was
 girded unto him, and upon it a girdle <I>with</I> a sword fastened
 upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it
 fell out.
 &nbsp; 9 And Joab said to Amasa, <I>Art</I> thou in health, my brother? And
 Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.
 &nbsp; 10 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that <I>was</I> in Joab's
 hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth <I>rib,</I> and shed out
 his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.
 So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of
 Bichri.
 &nbsp; 11 And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that
 favoureth Joab, and he that <I>is</I> for David, <I>let him go</I> after
 Joab.
 &nbsp; 12 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And
 when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed
 Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon
 him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
 &nbsp; 13 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went
 on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Amasa's fall just as he began to rise. He was nephew to 
 David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+17:25"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 25</A>),

 had been Absalom's general and commander-in-chief of his rebellious
 army, but, that being routed, he came over into David's interest, upon 
 a promise that he should be general of his forces instead of Joab. 
 Sheba's rebellion gives David an occasion to fulfil his promise sooner 
 than he could wish, but Joab's envy and emulation rendered its 
 fulfillment of ill consequence both to him and David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Amasa has a commission to raise forces for the suppressing of 
 Sheba's rebellion, and is ordered to raise them with all possible 
 expedition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 It seems, the men of Judah, though forward to attend the king's
 triumphs, were backward enough to fight his battles; else, when they 
 were all in a body attending him to Jerusalem, they might immediately 
 have pursued Sheba, and have crushed that cockatrice in the egg. But 
 most love a loyalty, as well as a religion, that is cheap and easy. 
 Many boast of their being akin to Christ that yet are very loth to 
 venture for him. Amasa is sent to assemble the men of Judah within 
 three days; but he finds them so backward and unready that he cannot do 
 it within the time appointed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 though the promotion of Amasa, who had been their general under
 Absalom, was very obliging to them, and a proof of the clemency of 
 David's government.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Upon Amasa's delay, Abishai, the brother of Joab, is ordered to 
 take the guards and standing forces, and with them to pursue Sheba 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>),

 for nothing could be of more dangerous consequence than to give him
 time. David gives these orders to Abishai, because he resolves to 
 mortify Joab, and degrade him, not so much, I doubt, for the blood of 
 Abner, which he had shed basely, as for the blood of Absalom, which he 
 had shed justly and honourably. "Now (says bishop Hall) Joab smarteth 
 for a loyal disobedience. How slippery are the stations of earthly 
 honours and subject to continual mutability! Happy are those who are in 
 favour with him in whom there is no shadow of change." Joab, without 
 orders, though in disgrace, goes along with his brother, knowing he 
 might be serviceable to the public, or perhaps now meditating the 
 removal of his rival.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Joab, near Gibeon, meets with Amasa, and barbarously murders him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.

 It should seem, the great stone in Gibeon was the place appointed for
 the general rendezvous. There the rivals met; and Amasa, relying upon 
 his commission, went before, as general both of the new-raised forces 
 which he had got together, and of the veteran troops which Abishai had 
 brought in; but Joab there took an opportunity to kill him with his own 
 hand; and,

 1. He did it subtilely, and with contrivance, and not upon a sudden 
 provocation. He girded his coat about him, that it might not hang in 
 his way, and girded his belt upon his coat, that his sword might be the 
 readier to his hand; he also put his sword in a sheath too big for it, 
 that, whenever he pleased, it might, upon a little shake, fall out, as 
 if it fell by accident, and so he might take it into his hand, 
 unsuspected, as if he were going to return it into the scabbard, when 
 he designed to sheath it in the bowels of Amasa. The more there is of 
 plot in a sin the worse it is. 

 2.  He did it treacherously, and under pretence of friendship, that
 Amasa might not be upon his guard. He called him <I>brother,</I> for 
 they were own cousins, enquired of his welfare (<I>Art thou in 
 health?</I>) and <I>took him by the beard,</I> as one he was free with, 
 to kiss him, while with the drawn sword in his other hand he was aiming 
 at his heart. Was this done like a gentleman, like a soldier, like a 
 general?  No, but like a villain, like a base coward. Just thus he slew 
 Abner, and went unpunished for it, which encouraged him to do the like 
 again.  

 3. He did it impudently, not in a corner, but at the head of his 
 troops, and in their sight, as one that was neither ashamed nor afraid 
 to do it, that was so hardened in blood and murders that he could 
 neither blush nor tremble. 

 4. He did it at one blow, gave the fatal push with a good-will, as we
 say, so that he needed not strike him again; with such a strong and 
 steady hand he gave this one stroke that it was fatal. 

 5. He did it in contempt and defiance of David and the commission he 
 had given to Amasa; for that commission was the only ground of his 
 quarrel with him, so that David was struck at through the side of 
 Amasa, and was, in effect, told to his face that Joab would be general, 
 in spite of him.  

 6. He did it very unseasonably, when they were going against a common
 enemy and were concerned to be unanimous.  This ill-timed quarrel might 
 have scattered their forces, or engaged them one against another, and 
 so have made them all an easy prey to Sheba.  So contentedly could Joab 
 sacrifice the interest both of king and kingdom to his personal 
 revenge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Joab immediately resumes his general's place, and takes care to 
 lead the army on in pursuit of Sheba, that, if possible, he might 
 prevent any prejudice to the common cause by what he had done. 

 1. He leaves one of his men to make proclamation to the forces that 
 were coming up that they were still engaged in David's cause, but under 
 Joab's command, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He knew what an interest he had in the soldiery, and how many favoured
 him rather than Amasa, who had been a traitor, was now a turn-coat, and 
 had never been successful; on this he boldly relied, and called them 
 all to follow him. What man of Judah would not be for his old king and 
 his old general? But one would wonder with what face a murderer could 
 pursue a traitor; and how, under such a heavy load of guilt, he had 
 courage to enter upon danger. Surely his conscience was seared with a 
 hot iron.

 2. Care is taken to remove the dead body out of the way, because at
 that they made a stand (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+2:23"><I>ch.</I> ii. 23</A>),

 and to cover it with a cloth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 Wicked men think themselves safe in their wickedness if they can but
 conceal it from the eye of the world: if it be hidden, it is with them 
 as if it were never done. But the covering of blood with a cloth cannot 
 stop its cry in God's ear for vengeance, or make it the less loud. 
 However, since this was no time to arraign Joab for what he had done, 
 and the common safety called for expedition, it was prudent to remove 
 that which retarded the march of the army; and then they all went on 
 after Joab, while David, who no doubt had notice soon brought him of 
 this tragedy, could not but reflect upon it with regret that he had not 
 formerly done justice upon Joab for the death of Abner, and that he now 
 had exposed Amasa by preferring him. And perhaps his conscience 
 reminded him of his employing Joab in the murder of Uriah, which had 
 helped to harden him in cruelty.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and
 to Beth-maachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered
 together, and went also after him.
 &nbsp; 15 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and
 they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench:
 and all the people that <I>were</I> with Joab battered the wall, to
 throw it down.
 &nbsp; 16 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I
 pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with
 thee.
 &nbsp; 17 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, <I>Art</I>
 thou Joab? And he answered, I <I>am he.</I> Then she said unto him,
 Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.
 &nbsp; 18 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,
 saying, They shall surely ask <I>counsel</I> at Abel: and so they
 ended <I>the matter.</I>
 &nbsp; 19 I <I>am one of them that are</I> peaceable <I>and</I> faithful in
 Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel:
 why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>?
 &nbsp; 20 And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me,
 that I should swallow up or destroy.
 &nbsp; 21 The matter <I>is</I> not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba
 the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the
 king, <I>even</I> against David: deliver him only, and I will depart
 from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head
 shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
 &nbsp; 22 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And
 they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast <I>it</I>
 out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the
 city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto
 the king.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the conclusion of Sheba's attempt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The rebel, when he had rambled over all the tribes of Israel, and 
 found them not so willing, upon second thoughts, to follow him, as they 
 had been upon a sudden provocation to desert David (having only picked 
 up a few like himself, that sided with him), at length entered 
 Abel-Beth-maacah, a strong city in the north, in the lot of Naphtali, 
 where we find it placed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:29">2 Kings xv. 29</A>.

 Here he took shelter, whether by force or with consent does not appear;
 but his adherents were most Berites, of Beeroth in Benjamin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 One bad man will find or make more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Joab drew up all his force against the city, besieged it, battered 
 the wall, and made it almost ready for a general storm, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Justly is that place attacked with all this fury which dares harbour a
 traitor; nor will that heart fare better which indulges those 
 rebellious lusts that will not have Christ to reign over them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A discreet good woman of the city of Abel brings this matter, by 
 her prudent management, to a good issue, so as to satisfy Joab and yet 
 save the city. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Her treaty with Joab, and her capitulation with him, by which he is 
 engaged to raise the siege, upon condition that Sheba be delivered up. 
 It seems, none of all the men of Abel, none of the elders or 
 magistrates, offered to treat with Joab, no, not when they were reduced 
 to the last extremity. They were stupid and unconcerned for the public 
 safety, or they stood in awe of Sheba, or they despaired of gaining any 
 good terms with Joab, or they had not sense enough to manage the 
 treaty. But this one woman and her wisdom saved the city. Souls know no 
 difference of sexes. Though the man be the head, it does not therefore 
 follow that he has the monopoly of the brains, and therefore he ought 
 not, by any salique law, to have the monopoly of the crown. Many a 
 masculine heart, and more than masculine, has been found in a female 
 breast; nor is the treasure of wisdom the less valuable for being 
 lodged in the weaker vessel. In the treaty between this nameless 
 heroine and Joab,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) She gains his audience and attention, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 We may suppose it was the first time he had ever treated with a woman
 in martial affairs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) She reasons with him on behalf of her city, and very ingeniously. 
 
 [1.] That it was a city famous for wisdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 as we translate it.  She pleads that this city had been long in such
 reputation for prudent knowing men that it was the common referee of 
 the country, and all agreed to abide by the award of its elders. Their 
 sentence was an oracle; let them be consulted and the matter is ended, 
 all sides will acquiesce. Now shall such a city as this be laid in 
 ashes and never treated with?

 [2.] That the inhabitants were generally peaceable and faithful in 
 Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 She could speak, not for herself only, but for all those whose cause
 she pleaded, that they were not of turbulent and seditious spirits, but 
 of known fidelity to their prince and peaceableness with their 
 fellow-subjects; they were neither seditious nor litigious.

 [3.] That it was a mother in Israel, a guide and nurse to the towns and 
 country about; and that it was a part of <I>the inheritance of the 
 Lord,</I> a city of Israelites, not of heathen; and the destruction of 
 it would lessen and weaken that nation which God had chosen for his 
 heritage.

 [4.] That they expected him to offer them peace before he made an 
 attack upon the, according to that known law of war, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:10">Deut. xx. 10</A>.

 So the margin reads

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>They plainly spoke in the beginning</I> (of the siege), <I>saying,
 Surely they will ask of Abel,</I> that is, "The besiegers will demand 
 the traitor, and will ask us to surrender him; and if they do, we will 
 soon come to an agreement, and so end the matter." Thus she tacitly 
 upbraids Joab for not offering them peace, but hopes it is not too late 
 to beg it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Joab and Abel's advocate soon agree that Sheba's head shall be the
 ransom of the city. Joab, though in a personal quarrel he had lately 
 swallowed up and destroyed Amasa, yet, when he acts as a general, will 
 by no means bear the imputation of delighting in bloodshed: "<I>Far be 
 it from me that I should</I> delight to <I>swallow up or destroy,</I> 
 or design it but when it is necessary for the public safety, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 The matter is not so. Our quarrel is not with your city; we would
 hazard our lives for its protection. Our quarrel is only with the 
 traitor that is harboured among you; deliver him up, and we have done." 
 A great deal of mischief would be prevented if contending parties would 
 but understand one another. The city obstinately holds out, believing 
 Joab aims at its ruin. Joab furiously attacks it, believing the 
 citizens all confederates with Sheba. Whereas both were mistaken; let 
 both sides be undeceived, and the matter is soon accommodated. The 
 single condition of peace is the surrender of the traitor. It is so in 
 God's dealing with the soul, when it is besieged by conviction and 
 distress: sin is the traitor; the beloved lust is the rebel; part with 
 that, cast away the transgression, and all shall be well. No peace on 
 any other terms.  Our wise woman immediately agrees to the proposal: 
 <I>Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee presently.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Her treaty with the citizens. She went to them in her wisdom (and
 perhaps she had as much need of it in dealing with them as in dealing 
 with Joab) and persuaded them to cut off Sheba's head, probably by some 
 public order of their government, and it was thrown over the wall to
 Joab. He knew the traitor's face, and therefore looked no further, 
 intending not that any of his adherents should suffer. The public 
 safety was secured, and he felt no wish to gratify the public revenge. 
 Joab hereupon raised the siege, and marched back to Jerusalem, with the 
 trophies rather of peace than victory.</P>

 Here is an account of the state of David's court after his restoration. 
 Joab retained the office of general, being too great to be displaced. 
 Benaiah, as before, was captain of the guards. Here is one new office 
 erected, which we had not

 that of <I>treasurer,</I> or one <I>over the tribute,</I> for it was
 not till towards the latter end of his time that David began to raise 
 taxes. Adoram was long in this office, but it cost him his life at 
 last,
