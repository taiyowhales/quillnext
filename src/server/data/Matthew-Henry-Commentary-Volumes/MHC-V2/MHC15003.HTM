 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the close of the foregoing chapter we left Israel in their cities, 
 but we may well imagine what a bad posture their affairs were in, the 
 ground untilled, the cities in ruins, all out of order; but here we 
 have an account of the early care they took about the re-establishment 
 of religion among them. Thus did they lay the foundation well, and
 begin their work at the right end. 

 I. They set up an altar, and offered sacrifices upon it, kept the
 feasts, and contributed towards the rebuilding of the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.
 
 II. They laid the foundation of the temple with a mixture of joy and
 sorrow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:8-13">ver. 8-13</A>.

 This was the day of small things, which was not to be despised,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And when the seventh month was come, and the children of
 Israel <I>were</I> in the cities, the people gathered themselves
 together as one man to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 2  Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the
 priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren,
 and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt
 offerings thereon, as <I>it is</I> written in the law of Moses the man
 of God.
 &nbsp; 3  And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear <I>was</I> upon
 them because of the people of those countries: and they offered
 burnt offerings thereon unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>even</I> burnt offerings
 morning and evening.
 &nbsp; 4  They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as <I>it is</I> written,
 and <I>offered</I> the daily burnt offerings by number, according to
 the custom, as the duty of every day required;
 &nbsp; 5  And afterward <I>offered</I> the continual burnt offering, both of
 the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> that were
 consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill
 offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6  From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer
 burnt offerings unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. But the foundation of the temple
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was not <I>yet</I> laid.
 &nbsp; 7  They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters;
 and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of
 Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa,
 according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. A general assembly of the returned Israelites at Jerusalem,
 in the <I>seventh month,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 We may suppose that they came from Babylon in the spring, and must
 allow at least four months for the journey, for so long Ezra and his 
 company were in coming,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:9"><I>ch.</I> vii. 9</A>.

 The seventh month therefore soon came, in which many of the feasts of
 the Lord were to be solemnized; and then they gathered themselves 
 together by agreement among themselves, rather than by the command of 
 authority, to Jerusalem.  Though they had newly come to their cities, 
 and had their hands full of business there, to provide necessaries for 
 themselves and their families, which might have excused them from 
 attending on God's altar till the hurry was a little over, as many 
 foolishly put off their coming to the communion till they are settled 
 in the world, yet such was their zeal for religion, now that they had 
 newly come from under correction for their irreligion, that they left 
 all their business in the country, to attend God's altar; and (which is 
 strange) in this pious zeal they were all of a mind, they came <I>as 
 one man.</I> Let worldly business be postponed to the business of 
 religion and it will prosper the better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The care which their leading men took to have an altar ready for 
 them to attend upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Joshua and his brethren the priests, Zerubbabel and his brethren the 
 princes, built <I>the altar of the God of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 in the same place (it is likely) where it had stood, upon the same
 bases, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Bishop Patrick, observing that before the temple was built there seems
 to have been a tabernacle pitched for the divine service, as was in 
 David's time, not on Mount Moriah, but Mount Sion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:23">1 Chron. ix. 23</A>),

 supposes that this altar was erected there, to be sued while the temple 
 was in building.  Let us learn hence, 

 (1.) To <I>begin with God.</I> The more difficult and necessitous our 
 case is the more concerned we are to take him along with us in all our 
 ways. If we expect to be directed by his oracles, let him be honoured 
 by our offerings. 

 (2.) To <I>do what we can</I> in the worship of God when <I>we cannot 
 do what we would.</I> They could not immediately have a temple, but 
 they would not be without an altar. Abraham, wherever he came, <I>built 
 an altar;</I> and wherever we come, though we may perhaps want the 
 benefit of the candlestick of preaching, and the showbread of the 
 eucharist, yet, if we bring not the sacrifices of prayer and praise, we 
 are wanting in our duty, for we have an altar that sanctifies the gift 
 ever ready.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Observe the reason here given why they hastened to set up the altar: 
 <I>Fear was upon them, because of the people of the land.</I> They were 
 in the midst of enemies that bore ill will to them and their religion, 
 for whom they were an unequal match.  And, 

 (1.) <I>Though</I> they were so, yet they built the altar (so some read
 it); they would not be frightened from their religion by the opposition 
 they were likely to meet with in it. Never let the fear of man bring us 
 into this snare.  

 (2.) <I>Because</I> they were so, therefore they set up the altar.  
 Apprehension of danger should stir us up to our duty.  Have we many 
 enemies? Then it is good to have God our friend and to keep up our 
 correspondence with him. This good use we should make of our fears, we 
 should be driven by them to our knees. Even Saul would think himself 
 undone if the enemy should come upon him before he had made his 
 supplication to God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:12">1 Sam. xii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The sacrifices they offered upon the altar. The altar was reared 
 to be used, and they used it accordingly. Let not those that have an 
 altar starve it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They began <I>on the first day of the seventh month,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It does not appear that they had any fire from heaven to begin with, as
 Moses and Solomon had, but common fire served them, as it did the 
 patriarchs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Having begun, they kept up the <I>continual burnt-offering</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>morning and evening,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They had known by sad experience what it was to want the comfort of the
 daily sacrifice to plead in their daily prayers, and now that it was 
 revived they resolved not to let it fall again. The daily lamb typified 
 the Lamb of God, whose righteousness must be our confidence in all our 
 prayers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They observed all the <I>set feasts of the Lord,</I> and offered the 
 sacrifices appointed for each, and particularly <I>the feast of 
 tabernacles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 Now that they had received such great mercy from God that joyful feast
 was in a special manner seasonable. And now that they were beginning to 
 settle in their cities it might serve well to remind them of their 
 fathers dwelling in tents in the wilderness.  That feast also which had 
 a peculiar reference to gospel times (as appears,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:18">Zech. xiv. 18</A>)

 was brought, in a special manner, into reputation, now that those times
 drew on. Of the services of this feast, which continued seven days and 
 had peculiar sacrifices appointed, it is said that they did <I>as the 
 duty of every day required</I> (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+29:13-38">Num. xxix. 13, 17</A>,

 &c.), <I>Verbum die in die suo--the word, or matter, of the
 day in its day</I> (so it is in the original)--a phrase that has become
 proverbial with those that have used themselves to scripture-language. 
 If the feast of tabernacles was a figure of a gospel conversation, in 
 respect of continual weanedness from the world and joy in God, we may 
 infer that it concerns us all to do the <I>work of the day in its day, 
 according as the duty of the day requires,</I> that is, 

 (1.) We must improve time, by finding some business to do every day 
 that will turn to a good account. 

 (2.) We must improve opportunity, by accommodating ourselves to that 
 which is the proper business of the present day.  Every thing is 
 beautiful in its season. The tenth day of this month was the day of
 atonement, a solemn day, and very seasonable now: it is very probable
 that they observed it, yet it is not mentioned, nor indeed in all the
 Old Testament do I remember the least mention of the observance of that
 day; as if it were enough that we have the law of it in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:1-34">Lev. xvi.</A>,

 and the gospel of it, which was the chief intention of it, in the New
 Testament.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They offered <I>every man's free-will offering,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The law required much, but they brought more; for, though they had
 little wealth to support the expense of their sacrifices, they had much 
 zeal, and, we may suppose, spared at their own tables that they might 
 plentifully supply God's altar. Happy are those that bring with them 
 out of the furnace of affliction such a holy heat as this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The preparation they made for the building of the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 This they applied themselves immediately to; for, while we do what we
 can, we must still be aiming to do more and better. Tyre and Sidon must 
 now, as of old, furnish them with workmen, and Lebanon with timber, 
 orders for both which they had from Cyrus. What God calls us to we may 
 depend upon his providence to furnish us for.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God
 at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of
 Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of
 their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that
 were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the
 Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the
 work of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9  Then stood Jeshua <I>with</I> his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel
 and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the
 workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, <I>with</I> their
 sons and their brethren the Levites.
 &nbsp; 10  And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets,
 and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.
 &nbsp; 11  And they sang together by course in praising and giving
 thanks unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; because <I>he is</I> good, for his mercy
 <I>endureth</I> for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted
 with a great shout, when they praised the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, because the
 foundation of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was laid.
 &nbsp; 12  But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the
 fathers, <I>who were</I> ancient men, that had seen the first house,
 when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes,
 wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:
 &nbsp; 13  So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout
 of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the
 people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar
 off.
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There was no dispute among the returned Jews whether they should build 
 the temple or no; that was immediately resolved on, and that it should 
 be done with all speed; what comfort could they take in their own land 
 if they had not that token of God's presence with them and the record 
 of his name among them? We have here therefore an account of the 
 beginning of that good work.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. When it was begun-in the second month of the second year, as soon as 
 ever the season of the year would permit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and when they had ended the solemnities of the passover. They took
 little more than half a year for making preparation of the ground and 
 materials; so much were their hearts upon it. Note, When any good work 
 is to be done it will be our wisdom to set about it quickly, and not to 
 lose time, yea, though we foresee difficulty and opposition in it. Thus 
 we engage ourselves to it, and engage God for us. Well begun (we say) 
 is half ended.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Who began it--Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and their brethren. Then the
 work of God is likely to go on well when magistrates, ministers, and 
 people, are hearty for it, and agree in their places to promote it. It 
 was God that gave them one heart for this service, and it boded 
 well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Who were employed to further it. They appointed the <I>Levites to 
 set forward the work</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and they did it by <I>setting forward the workmen</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 and strengthening their hands with good and comfortable words. Note,
 Those that do not work themselves may yet do good service by quickening 
 and encouraging those that do work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How God was praised at the laying of the foundation of the temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>);

 the priests with the trumpets appointed by Moses, and the Levites with
 the cymbals appointed by David, made up a concert of music, not to 
 please the ear, but to assist the singing of that everlasting hymn 
 which will never be out of date, and to which our tongues should never 
 be out of tune, <I>God is good, and his mercy endureth for ever,</I> 
 the burden of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:1-26">Ps. cxxxvi.</A>

 Let all the streams of mercy be traced up to the fountain. Whatever our
 condition is, how many soever our griefs and fears, let it be owned 
 that God is good; and, whatever fails, that his mercy fails not. Let 
 this be sung with application, as here; not only his mercy endures for 
 ever, but it endures for ever towards Israel, Israel when captives in a 
 strange land and strangers in their own land.  However it be, yet 
 <I>God is good to Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:1">Ps. lxxiii. 1</A>),

 good to us. Let the reviving of the church's interests, when they
 seemed dead, be ascribed to the continuance of God's mercy for ever, 
 for therefore the church continues.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. How the people were affected. A remarkable mixture of various 
 affections there was upon this occasion. Different sentiments there 
 were among the people of God, and each expressed himself according to 
 his sentiments, and yet there was no disagreement among them, their 
 minds were not alienated from each other nor the common concern 
 retarded by it. 

 1. Those that only knew the misery of having no temple at all praised 
 the Lord with shouts of joy when they saw but the foundation of one 
 laid,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 To them even this foundation seemed great, and was as life from the
 dead; to their hungry souls even this was sweet. They shouted, so that 
 <I>the noise was heard afar off.</I> Note, We ought to be thankful for 
 the beginnings of mercy, though we have not yet come to the perfection 
 of it; and the foundations of a temple, after long desolations, cannot 
 but be fountains of joy to every faithful Israelite. 

 2. Those that remembered the glory of the first temple which Solomon 
 built, and considered how far this was likely to be inferior to that, 
 perhaps in dimensions, certainly in magnificence and sumptuousness, 
 <I>wept with a loud voice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 If we date the captivity with the first, from the fourth of Jehoiakim,
 it was about fifty-two years since the temple was burnt; if from 
 Jeconiah's captivity, it was but fifty-nine. So that many now alive 
 might remember it standing; and a great mercy it was to the captives 
 that they had the lives of so many of their priests and Levites 
 lengthened out, who could tell them what they themselves remembered of 
 the glory of Jerusalem, to quicken them in their return.  These 
 lamented the disproportion between this temple and the former.  And,

 (1.) There was some reason for it; and if they turned their tears into 
 the right channel, and bewailed the sin that was the cause of this 
 melancholy change, they did well. Sin sullies the glory of any church 
 or people, and, when they find themselves diminished and brought low, 
 that must bear the blame. 

 (2.) Yet it was their infirmity to mingle those tears with the common 
 joys and so to cast a damp upon them. They <I>despised the day of small 
 things,</I> and were unthankful for the good they enjoyed, because it 
 was not so much as their ancestors had, though it was much more than 
 they deserved.  In the harmony of public joys, let not us be jarring 
 strings. It was an aggravation of the discouragement they hereby gave 
 to the people that they were priests and Levites, who should have known 
 and taught others how to be duly affected under various providences, 
 and not to let the remembrance of former afflictions drown the sense of 
 present mercies. This mixture of sorrow and joy here is a 
 representation of this world. Some are bathing in rivers of joy, while 
 others are drowned in floods of tears. In heaven all are singing, and 
 none sighing; in hell all are weeping and wailing, and none rejoicing; 
 but here on earth we can scarcely <I>discern the shouts of joy from the 
 noise of the weeping.</I> Let us learn to <I>rejoice with those that do 
 rejoice</I> and <I>weep with those that weep,</I> and ourselves to 
 rejoice as though we rejoiced not, and weep as though we wept not.</P>
