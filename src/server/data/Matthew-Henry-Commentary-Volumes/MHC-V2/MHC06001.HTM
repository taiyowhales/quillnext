 The book begins with the history, not of Joshua's life (many remarkable
 passages of that we had before in the books of Moses) but of his reign
 and government. In this chapter, 

 I. God appoints him to the government in the stead of Moses, gives him 
 an ample commission, full instructions, and great encouragements,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. He accepts the government, and addresses himself immediately to the
 business of it, giving orders to the officers of the people in 
 general,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>,

 and particularly to the two tribes and a half, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 III. The people agree to it, and take an oath of fealty to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:16-18">ver. 16-18</A>.

 A reign which thus began with God could not but be honourable to the 
 prince and comfortable to the subject. The last words of Moses are 
 still verified, "Happy art thou, O Israel! Who is like unto thee, O 
 people?"

 1 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> it came
 to pass, that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses'
 minister, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this
 Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give
 to them, <I>even</I> to the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 3 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that
 have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.
 &nbsp; 4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great
 river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and
 unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be
 your coast.
 &nbsp; 5 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the
 days of thy life: as I was with Moses, <I>so</I> I will be with thee:
 I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
 &nbsp; 6 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt
 thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their
 fathers to give them.
 &nbsp; 7 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest
 observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant
 commanded thee: turn not from it <I>to</I> the right hand or <I>to</I> the
 left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.
 &nbsp; 8 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but
 thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest
 observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then
 thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good
 success.
 &nbsp; 9 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage;
 be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God
 <I>is</I> with thee whithersoever thou goest.
 </FONT></P>

 Honour is here put upon Joshua, and great power lodged in his hand, by 
 him that is the fountain of honour and power, and by whom kings reign. 
 Instructions are given him by Infinite Wisdom, and encouragements by 
 the God of all consolation. God had before spoken to Moses concerning 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:18">Num. xxvii. 18</A>),

 but now he speaks to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 probably as he spoke to Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:1">Lev. i. 1</A>)

 <I>out of the tabernacle of the congregation,</I> where Joshua had with 
 Moses presented himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:14">Deut. xxxi. 14</A>),

 to learn the way of attending there. Though Eleazar had the 
 breast-plate of judgment, which Joshua was directed to consult as there 
 was occasion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+27:21">Num. xxvii. 21</A>),

 yet, for his greater encouragement, God here speaks to him immediately, 
 some think in a dream or vision (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:15">Job xxxiii. 15</A>);

 for though God has tied us to instituted ordinances, in them to attend 
 him, yet he has not tied himself to them, but that he may without them 
 make himself known to his people, and speak to their hearts otherwise 
 than by their ears. Concerning Joshua's call to the government observe
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The time when it was given him: <I>After the death of Moses.</I> As 
 soon as ever Moses was dead, Joshua took upon him the administration, 
 by virtue of his solemn ordination in Moses's life-time. An 
 interregnum, though but for a few days, might have been of bad 
 consequence; but it is probable that God did not speak to him to go 
 forward towards Canaan till after the thirty days of mourning for Moses 
 were ended; not, as the Jews say, because the sadness of his spirit 
 during those days unfitted him for communion with God (he sorrowed not 
 as one that had no hope), but by this solemn pause, and a month's 
 adjournment of the public councils, even now when time was so very 
 precious to them, God would put an honour upon the memory of Moses, and 
 give time to the people not only to lament their loss of him, but to 
 repent of their miscarriages towards him during the forty years of his 
 government.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The place Joshua had been in before he was thus preferred. He was 
 Moses's minister, that is, an immediate attendant upon his person and 
 assistant in business. The LXX. translates it
 <B><I>hypourgos,</I></B> a workman under Moses, under his direction and 
 command. Observe, 

 1. He that was here called to honour had been long bred to business.
 Our Lord Jesus himself took upon him the form of a servant, and then 
 God highly exalted him. 

 2. He was trained up in subjection and under command. Those are fittest
 to rule that have learnt to obey. 

 3. He that was to succeed Moses was intimately acquainted with him,
 that he might <I>fully know his doctrine and manner of life, his 
 purpose and long-suffering</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:10">2 Tim. iii. 10</A>),

 might take the same measures, walk in the same spirit, in the same 
 steps, having to carry on the same work. 

 4. He was herein a type of Christ, who might therefore be called
 Moses's minister, because he was made under the law and fulfilled all 
 the righteousness of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The call itself that God gave him, which is very full.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The consideration upon which he was called to the government: 
 <I>Moses my servant is dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 All good men are God's servants; and it is no disparagement, but an
 honour, to the greatest of men to be so: angels themselves are his 
 ministers. Moses was called to extraordinary work, was a steward in
 God's house, and in the discharge of the trusts reposed in him he 
 served not himself but God who employed him; he was faithful as a 
 servant, and with an eye to the Son, as is intimated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:5">Heb. iii. 5</A>,

 where what he did is said to be for a <I>testimony of the things that
 should be spoken after.</I> God will own his servants, will confess 
 them in the great day. But Moses, though God's servant, and one that 
 could ill be spared, is dead; for God will change hands, to show that 
 whatever instruments he uses he is not tied to any. Moses, when he has
 done his work as a servant, dies and goes to <I>rest from his labours, 
 and enters into the joy of his Lord.</I> Observe, God takes notice of 
 the death of his servants. It is precious in his sight,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:15">Ps. cxvi. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The call itself. <I>Now therefore arise.</I> 

 (1.) "Though Moses is dead, the work must go on; therefore arise, and 
 go about it." Let not weeping hinder sowing, nor the withering of the 
 most useful hands be the weakening of ours; for, when God has work to 
 do, he will either find or make instruments fit to carry it on. Moses 
 the <I>servant</I> is dead, but God the <I>Master</I> is not: he lives 
 for ever. 

 (2.) "Because Moses is dead, therefore the work devolves upon thee as 
 his successor, for hereunto thou wast appointed. Therefore there is 
 need of thee to fill up his place; up, and be doing." Note,

 [1.] The removal of useful men should quicken survivors to be so much 
 the more diligent in doing good. Such and such are dead, and we must 
 die shortly, therefore let us work while it is day. 

 [2.] It is a great mercy to a people, if, when useful men are taken 
 away in the midst of their usefulness, others are raised up in their 
 stead to go on where they broke off. Joshua must arise to finish what 
 Moses began. Thus the latter generations enter into the labours of the 
 former. And thus Christ, our Joshua, does that for us which could never 
 be done by the law of Moses,--<I>justifies</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:39">Acts xiii. 39</A>),

 and <I>sanctifies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:3">Romans viii. 3</A>.

 The life of Moses made way for Joshua, and prepared the people for what 
 was to be done by him. Thus the law is a schoolmaster to bring us to
 Christ: and then the death of Moses made room for Joshua; thus we are 
 dead to the law, our first husband, that we may be <I>married to 
 Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:4">Rom. vii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The particular service he was now called out to: "<I>Arise, go over 
 this Jordan,</I> this river which you have in view, and on the banks of 
 which you lie encamped." This was a trial to the faith of Joshua, 
 whether he would give orders to make preparation for passing the river 
 when there was no visible way of getting over it, at least not at this 
 place and at this time, when <I>all the banks were overflown,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:15"><I>ch.</I> iii. 15</A>.

 He had no pontoons or bridge of boats by which to convey them over, and
 yet he must believe that God, who had ordered them over, would open a 
 way for them. Going over Jordan was going into Canaan; thither Moses 
 might not, could not, bring them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:2">Deut. xxxi. 2</A>.

 Thus the honour of bringing the many sons to glory is reserved for
 Christ the <I>captain of our salvation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:10">Heb. ii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The grant of the land of Canaan to the children of Israel is here 
 repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>):

 <I>I do give it them.</I> To the patriarchs it was promised, <I>I will 
 give it;</I> but, now that the fourth generation had expired, the 
 iniquity of the Amorites was full, and the time had come for the 
 performance of the promise, it is actually conveyed, and they are put 
 in possession of that which they had long been in expectation of: "I do 
 give it, enter upon it, it is all your own; nay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>I have given it;</I> though it be yet unconquered, it is as sure to 
 you as if it were in your hands." Observe, 

 (1.) The persons to whom the conveyance is made: <I>To them, even to 
 the children of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 because they are the seed of Jacob, who was called <I>Israel</I> at the 
 time when this promise was made to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:10,12">Gen. xxxv. 10, 12</A>.

 The children of Israel, though they had been very provoking in the
 wilderness, yet, for their fathers' sakes, should have the entail 
 preserved. And it was the children of the murmurers that God said 
 should enter Canaan,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:31">Num. xiv. 31</A>.
 
 (2.) The land itself that is conveyed: From the river Euphrates
 eastward, to the Mediterranean Sea westward, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Though their sin cut them short of this large possession, and they
 never replenished all the country within the bounds here mentioned, 
 yet, had they been obedient, God would have given them this and much
 more. Out of all these countries, and many others, there were in
 process of time proselytes to the Jewish religion, as appears,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:5">Acts ii. 5</A>,

 &c. If their church was enlarged, though their nation was not
 multiplied, it cannot be said that the promise was of no effect. And, 
 if this promise had not its full accomplishment in the letter, 
 believers might thence infer that it had a further meaning, and was to 
 be fulfilled in the kingdom of the Messiah, both that of grace and that 
 of glory.

 (3.) The condition is here implied upon which this grant is made, in 
 those words, <I>as I said unto Moses,</I> that is, "upon the terms that 
 Moses told you of many a time, <I>if you will keep my statutes,</I> you 
 shall go in and possess that good land. Take it under those provisos 
 and limitations, and not otherwise." The precept and promise must not 
 be separated. 

 (4.) It is intimated with what ease they should gain the possession of 
 this land, if it were not their own fault, in these words, "<I>Every 
 place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon</I> (within the 
 following bounds) shall be your own. Do but set your foot upon it and 
 you have it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The promises God here makes to Joshua for his encouragement. 

 (1.) That he should be sure of the presence of God with him in this 
 great work to which he was called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>As I was with Moses,</I> to direct and strengthen him, to own and 
 prosper him, and give him success in bringing Israel out of Egypt and 
 leading them through the wilderness, so I will be with thee to enable 
 thee to settle them in Canaan." Joshua was sensible how far he came 
 short of Moses in wisdom and grace; But what Moses did was done by 
 virtue of the presence of God with him, and, though Joshua had not 
 always the same presence of mind that Moses had, yet, if he had always 
 the same presence of God, he would do well enough. Note, it is a great 
 comfort to the rising generation of ministers and Christians that the 
 same grace which was sufficient for those that went before them shall 
 not be wanting to them if they be not wanting to themselves in the 
 improvement of it. It is repeated here again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>).

 "<I>The Lord thy God is with thee</I> as a God of power, and that power 
 engaged for thee whithersoever thou goest." Note, Those that go where 
 God sends them shall have him with them wherever they go and they need 
 desire no more to make them easy and prosperous. 

 (2.) That the presence of God should never be withdrawn from him: <I>I 
 will not fail thee, nor forsake thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Moses had assured him of this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:8">Deut. xxxi. 8</A>),

 that, though he must now leave him, God never would: and here God 
 himself confirms that word of his servant Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:26">Isa. xliv. 26</A>),

 and engages never to leave Joshua. We need the presence of God, not 
 only when we are beginning our work to set us in, but in the progress 
 of it to further us with a continual help. If that at any time fail us, 
 we are gone; this we may be sure, that <I>the Lord is with us while we 
 are with him.</I> This promise here made to Joshua is applied to all 
 believers, and improved as an argument against covetousness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:5">Heb. xiii. 5</A>,

 <I>Be content with such things as you have, for he hath said, I will
 never leave thee.</I> 

 (3.) That he should have victory over all the enemies of Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 <I>There shall not any man</I> that comes against thee <I>be able to 
 stand before thee.</I> Note, There is no standing before those that 
 have God on their side. <I>If he be for us, who can be against us?</I>
 God promises him clear success--the enemy should not make any head
 against him; and constant success--all the days of his life. However it
 might be with Israel when he was gone, all his reign should be graced 
 with triumphs. What Joshua had himself encouraged the people with long 
 ago 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:9">Num. xiv. 9</A>)

 God here encourages him with. 

 (4.) That he should himself have the dividing of this land among the 
 people of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It was a great encouragement to him in beginning this work that he was
 sure to see it finished and his labour should not be in vain. Some make 
 it a reason why he should arm himself with resolution, and be of good 
 courage, because of the bad character of the people whom he must cause 
 to inherit that land. He knew well what a froward discontented people
 they were, and how unmanageable they had been in his predecessor's 
 time; let him therefore expect vexation from them and be of good 
 courage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The charge or command he gives to Joshua, which is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That he conform himself in every thing to the law of God, and make 
 this his rule 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 God does, as it were, put the book of the law into Joshua's hand; as,
 when Joash was crowned, they <I>gave him the testimony,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:12">2 Kings xi. 12</A>.
 
 And concerning this book he is charged,

 [1.] To <I>meditate therein day and night,</I> that he might understand 
 it and have it ready in him upon all occasions. If ever any man's 
 business might have excused him from meditation, and other acts of 
 devotion, one would think Joshua's might at this time. It was a great 
 trust that was lodged in his hands; the care of it was enough to fill 
 him, if he had had ten souls, and yet he must find time and thoughts 
 for meditation. Whatever affairs of this world we have to mind, we must 
 not neglect the one thing needful. 

 [2.] Not to let it depart out of his mouth; that is, all his orders to
 the people, and his judgments upon appeals made to him, must be
 consonant to the law of God; upon all occasions he must <I>speak
 according to this rule,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:20">Isa. viii. 20</A>.

 Joshua was to maintain and carry on the work that Moses had begun, and
 therefore he must not only complete the salvation Moses had wrought for 
 them, but must uphold the holy religion he had established among them.
 There was no occasion to make new laws; but <I>that good thing which 
 was committed to him</I> he must carefully and faithfully keep,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:14">2 Tim. i. 14</A>.

 [3.] He must <I>observe to do according to all this law.</I> To this
 end he must meditate therein, not for contemplation sake only, or to 
 fill his head with notions, or that he might find something to puzzle 
 the priests with, but that he might, both as a man and as a magistrate, 
 observe to do <I>according to what was written</I> therein; and several 
 things were written there which had particular reference to the 
 business he had now before him, as the laws concerning their wars, the 
 destroying of the Canaanites and the dividing of Canaan; &c.; these he 
 must religiously observe. Joshua was a man of great power and 
 authority, yet he must himself be under command and do as he is bidden.
 No man's dignity or dominion, how great soever, sets him above the law 
 of God. Joshua must not only govern by law, and take care that the
 people observed the law, but he must observe it himself, and so by his 
 own example maintain the honour and power of it. <I>First,</I> He must 
 do what was written. It is not enough to hear and read the word, to 
 commend and admire it, to know and remember it, to talk and discourse 
 of it, but we must do it. <I>Secondly,</I> He must do according to
 what was written, exactly observing the law as his copy, and doing, not 
 only that which was there required, but in all circumstances according 
 to the appointment. <I>Thirdly,</I> He must do according to all that 
 was written, without exception or reserve, having a <I>respect to all 
 God's commandments,</I> even those which are most displeasing to flesh 
 and blood. <I>Fourthly,</I> He must observe to do so, observe the 
 checks of conscience, the hints of providence; and all the advantages 
 of opportunity. Careful observance is necessary to universal obedience.
 <I>Fifthly,</I> He must <I>not turn from it,</I> either in his own 
 practice or in any act of government, to the right hand or to the left, 
 for there are errors on both hands, and virtue is in the mean.
 <I>Sixthly,</I> He must be <I>strong and courageous,</I> that he might 
 do according to the law. So many discouragements there are in the way 
 of duty that those who will proceed and persevere in it must put on 
 resolution. And, <I>lastly,</I> to encourage him in his obedience, he 
 assures him that then he shall <I>do wisely</I> (as it is in the 
 margin) and <I>make his way prosperous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 Those that make the word of God their rule, and conscientiously walk by
 that rule, shall both do well and speed well; it will furnish them with 
 the best maxims by which to order their conversation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:10">Ps. cxi. 10</A>);

 and it will entitle them to the best blessings: God shall <I>give them 
 the desire of their heart.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That he encourage himself herein with the promise and presence of 
 God, and make these his stay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Be strong and of a good courage.</I> And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 as if this was the one thing needful: <I>Only be strong and very 
 courageous.</I> And he concludes with this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou 
 dismayed.</I> Joshua had long since signalized his valour, in the war 
 with Amalek, and in his dissent from the report of the evil spies; and 
 yet God sees fit thus to inculcate this precept upon him. Those that 
 have grace have need to be called upon again and again to exercise 
 grace and to improve in it. Joshua was humble and low in his own eyes,
 not distrustful of God, and his power, and promise, but diffident of 
 himself, and of his own wisdom, and strength, and sufficiency for the 
 work, especially coming after so great a man as Moses; and therefore 
 God repeats this so often, "<I>Be strong and of a good courage;</I> let 
 not the sense of thy own infirmities dishearten thee; God is 
 all-sufficient. <I>Have not I commanded thee?</I>"

 [1.] "I have commanded the work to be done, and therefore it shall be 
 done, how invincible soever the difficulties may seem that lie in the 
 way." Nay, 

 [2.] "I have commanded, called, and commissioned, thee to do it, and 
 therefore will be sure to own thee, and strengthen thee, and bear thee 
 out in it." Note, When we are in the way of our duty we have reason to
 be strong and very courageous; and it will help very much to animate 
 and embolden us if we keep our eye upon the divine warrant, hear God 
 saying, "<I>Have not I commanded thee?</I> I will therefore help thee, 
 succeed thee, accept thee, reward thee." Our Lord Jesus, as Joshua 
 here, was borne up under his sufferings by a regard to the will of God 
 and the <I>commandment he had received from his Father,</I>

 &nbsp; 11 Pass through the host, and command the people, saying,
 Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over
 this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your
 God giveth you to possess it.
 &nbsp; 12 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the

 &nbsp; 13 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 commanded you, saying, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God hath given you rest, and
 hath given you this land.
 &nbsp; 14 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain
 in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye
 shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of
 valour, and help them;
 &nbsp; 15 Until the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have given your brethren rest, as <I>he hath
 given</I> you, and they also have possessed the land which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your
 possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s servant gave you
 on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.

 Joshua, being settled in the government, immediately applies himself to 
 business; not to take state or to take his pleasure, but to further the 
 work of God among, the people over whom God had set him. As he that 
 desires the office of a minister 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:1">1 Tim. iii. 1</A>),

 so he that desires the office of a magistrate, desires a work, a good 
 work; neither is preferred to be idle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He issues out orders to the people to provide for a march; and they 
 had been so long encamped in their present post that it would be a work 
 of some difficulty to decamp. The officers of the people that commanded 
 under Joshua in their respective tribes and families attended him for 
 orders, which they were to transmit to the people. Inferior magistrates 
 are as necessary and as serviceable to the public good in their places 
 as the supreme magistrate in his. What could Joshua have done without 
 officers? We are therefore required to be subject, not only to <I>the
 king as supreme, but to governors as to those that are sent by him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:13,14">1 Pet. ii. 13, 14</A>.

 By these officers, 

 1. Joshua gives public notice that they were <I>to pass over Jordan
 within three days.</I> These orders, I suppose, were not given till 
 after the return of the spies that were sent to bring an account of 
 Jericho, though the story of that affair follows,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:1-24"><I>ch.</I> ii.</A>

 And perhaps that was such an instance of his jealousy, and excessive
 caution, as made it necessary that he should be so often bidden as he 
 was to be strong and of a good courage. Observe with what assurance 
 Joshua says to the people, because God had said it to him, <I>You shall 
 pass over Jordan, and shall possess</I> the land. We greatly honour the 
 truth of God. 

 2. He gives them directions to prepare victuals, not to prepare
 transport vessels. He that bore Egypt upon eagle's wings would in like 
 manner bear them into Canaan, to bring them to himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:4">Exod. xix. 4</A>.

 But those that were desirous to have other victuals besides the manna,
 which had not yet ceased, must prepare it and have it ready against the 
 time appointed. Perhaps, though the manna did not quite cease till they 
 came into Canaan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:12"><I>ch.</I> v. 12</A>),

 yet since they had come <I>into a land inhabited</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:35">Exod. xvi. 35</A>),

 where they might be furnished in part with other provisions, it did not 
 fall so plentifully, nor did they gather so much as when they had it 
 first given to them in the wilderness, but decreased gradually, and 
 therefore they are ordered to provide other victuals, in which perhaps 
 was included all other things necessary to their march. And some of the 
 Jewish writer, considering that having manna they needed not to provide 
 other victuals, understand it figuratively, that they must <I>repent of 
 their sins,</I> and make their <I>peace with God,</I> and resolve to 
 live a new life, that they might be ready to receive this great favour.
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:10,11">Exod. xix. 10, 11</A>.</P>

 II. He reminds the two tribes and a half of the obligations they were 
 under to go over Jordan with their brethren, though they left their 
 possessions and families on this side. Interest would make the other 
 tribes glad to go over Jordan, but in these it was an act of 
 self-denial, and against the grain; therefore it was needful to produce 
 the agreement which Moses had made with them, when he gave them their 
 possession before their brethren 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Remember the word which Moses commanded you.</I> Some of them 
 perhaps were ready to think now that Moses was dead, who they thought 
 was too hard upon them in this matter, they might find some excuse or 
 other to release themselves from this engagement, or might prevail with 
 Joshua to dispense with them; but he holds them to it, and lets them 
 know that, though Moses was dead, his commands and their promises were 
 still in full force. He reminds them, 

 1. Of the advantages they had received in being first settled: "<I>The
 Lord your God hath given you rest.</I> He has given your minds rest; 
 you know what you have to trust to, and are not as the rest of the 
 tribes waiting the issue of the war first and then of the lot. He has 
 also given your families rest, your wives and children, whose 
 settlement is your satisfaction. He has given you rest by giving you 
 this land, this good land, of which you are in full and quiet 
 possession." Note, When God by his providence has given us rest we 
 ought to consider how we may honour him with the advantages of it, and 
 what service we may do to our brethren who are unsettled, or not so 
 well settled as we are When God had given David rest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:1">2 Sam. vii. 1</A>),

 see how restless he was till he had <I>found out a habitation</I> for 
 the ark, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:4,5">Ps. cxxxii. 4, 5</A>.

 When God has given us rest, we must take heed of slothfulness and of
 settling upon our lees.

 2. He reminds them of their agreement to help their brethren in the
 wars of Canaan till God had in like manner given them rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.
 
 This was,

 (1.) Reasonable in itself. So closely were all the tribes incorporated 
 that they must needs look upon themselves as members one of another. 
 
 (2.) It was enjoined them by Moses, the servant of the Lord; he 
 commanded them to do this, and Joshua his successor would see his 
 commands observed.

 (3.) It was the only expedient they had to save themselves from the
 guilt of a great sin in settling on that side Jordan, a sin which would 
 one time or other find them out, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:23">Num. xxxii. 23</A>.

 (4.) It was the condition of the grant Moses had made them of the land 
 they were possessed of, so that they could not be sure of a good title 
 to, or a comfortable enjoyment of, <I>the land of their possession,</I> 
 as it is here called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 if they did not fulfil the condition.
 
 (5.) They themselves had covenanted and agreed thereunto 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:25">Num. xxxii. 25</A>):
 
 <I>Thy servants will do as my Lord commandeth.</I> Thus we all lie 
 under manifold obligations to strengthen the hands one of another, and 
 not to seek our own welfare only, but one another's.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest
 us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.
 &nbsp; 17 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will
 we hearken unto thee: only the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God be with thee, as he
 was with Moses.
 &nbsp; 18 Whosoever <I>he be</I> that doth rebel against thy commandment,
 and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest
 him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good
 courage.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This answer was given not by the two tribes and a half only (though 
 they are spoken of immediately before), but by the <I>officers of all 
 the people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 as their representatives, concurring with the divine appointment, by 
 which Joshua was set over them, and they did it heartily, and with a 
 great deal of cheerfulness and resolution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They promise him obedience 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 not only as subjects to their prince, but as soldiers to their general, 
 of whose particular orders they are to be observant. He that hath 
 <I>soldiers under him saith to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to 
 another, Come, and he cometh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:9">Matt. viii. 9</A>.

 Thus the people of Joshua; "<I>All that thou commandest us we will
 readily do,</I> without murmuring or disputing; and whithersoever thou 
 sends us, though upon the most difficult and perilous expedition, we 
 will go." We must thus swear allegiance to our Lord Jesus, as the 
 captain of our salvation, and bind ourselves to do what he commands us 
 by his word, and to go where he sends us by his providence. And since 
 Joshua, being humbly conscious to himself how far short he came of 
 Moses, feared he should not have such an influence upon the people and 
 such an interest in them as Moses had, they here promise that they will 
 be as obedient to him as ever they had been to Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 To speak truth, they had no reason to boast of their obedience to
 Moses; he had found them a stiff-necked people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:24">Deut. ix. 24</A>.

 But they meant that they would be as observant of Joshua as they should
 have been, and as some of them were (and the generality of them at 
 least sometimes) of Moses. Note, We must not so magnify those that are
 gone, how eminent soever they were, either in the magistracy or in the 
 ministry, as to be wanting in the honour and duty we owe to those that 
 survive and succeed them, though in gifts they may come short of them.
 Obedience for conscience' sake will continue, though Providence change 
 the hands by which it rules and acts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They pray for the presence of God with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Only the Lord thy God be with thee,</I> to bless and prosper thee, 
 and give thee success, <I>as he was with Moses.</I>" Prayers and 
 supplications are to be made for all in authority, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:1,2">1 Tim. ii. 1, 2</A>.

 And the best thing we can ask of God for our magistrates is that they
 may have the presence of God with them; this will make them blessings 
 to us, so that in seeking this for them we consult our own interest. A 
 reason is here intimated why they would obey him as they had obeyed 
 Moses, because they believed (and in faith prayed) that God's presence 
 would be with him as it was with Moses. Those that we have reason to 
 think have favour from God should have honour and respect from us. Some 
 understand it as a limitation of their obedience: "We will obey only as 
 far as we perceive the Lord is with thee, but no further. While thou
 keepest close to God we will keep close to thee; hitherto shall our 
 obedience come, but no further." But they were so far from having any 
 suspicion of Joshua's deviating from the divine rule that there needed 
 not such a proviso.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They pass an act to make it death for any Israelite to disobey 
 Joshua's orders, or <I>rebel against his commandment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 Perhaps if such a law had been made in Moses's time it might have
 prevented many of the rebellions that were formed against him; for most 
 men fear the sword of the magistrate more than the justice of God. Yet 
 there was a special reason for the making of this law now that they
 were entering upon the wars of Canaan; for in times of war the severity 
 of military discipline is more necessary than at other times. Some 
 think that in this statute they had an eye to that law concerning the 
 prophet God would raise up like unto Moses, which they think, though it 
 refer chiefly to Christ, yet takes in Joshua by the way as a type of 
 him, that whosoever would not hearken to him should be <I>cut off from 
 his people.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+18:19">Deut. xviii. 19</A>,
 
 <I>I will require it of him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They animate him to go on with cheerfulness in the work to which
 God had called him; and, in desiring that he would be strong and of a
 good courage, they did in effect promise him that they would do all
 they could, by an exact, bold, and cheerful observance of all his
 orders, to encourage him. It very much heartens those that lead in a
 good work to see those that follow follow with a good will. Joshua,
 though of approved valour, did not take it as an affront, but as a
 great kindness, for the people to bid him be strong and of a good
 courage.</P>
