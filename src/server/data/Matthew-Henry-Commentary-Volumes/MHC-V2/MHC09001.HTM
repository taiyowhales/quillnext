 The history of Samuel here begins as early as that of Samson did, even
 before he was born, as afterwards the history of John the Baptist and
 our blessed Saviour. Some of the scripture-worthies drop out of the
 clouds, as it were, and their first appearance is in their full growth
 and lustre. But others are accounted for from the birth, and from the
 womb, and from the conception. What God says of the prophet Jeremiah is
 true of all: "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:5">Jer. i. 5</A>.

 But some great men were brought into the world with more observation
 than others, and were more early distinguished from common persons, as
 Samuel for one. God, in this matter, acts as a free agent. The story of
 Samson introduces him as a child of promise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:1-25">Judg. xiii</A>.

 But the story of Samuel introduces him as a child of prayer. Samson's 
 birth was foretold by an angel to his mother; Samuel was asked of God 
 by his mother. Both together intimate what wonders are produced by the 
 word and prayer.  Samuel's mother was Hannah, the principal person 
 concerned in the story of this chapter.

 I. Here is her affliction--she was childless, and this affliction 
 aggravated by her rival's insolence, but in some measure balanced by 
 her husband's kindness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. The prayer and vow she made to God under this affliction, in which
 Eli the high priest at first censured her, but afterwards encouraged 
 her,

 III. The birth and nursing of Samuel,

 IV. The presenting of him to the Lord,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount
 Ephraim, and his name <I>was</I> Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son
 of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:
 &nbsp; 2 And he had two wives; the name of the one <I>was</I> Hannah, and
 the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but
 Hannah had no children.
 &nbsp; 3 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
 sacrifice unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of
 Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>were</I> there.
 &nbsp; 4 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to
 Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters,
 portions:
 &nbsp; 5 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved
 Hannah: but the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had shut up her womb.
 &nbsp; 6 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her
 fret, because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had shut up her womb.
 &nbsp; 7 And <I>as</I> he did so year by year, when she went up to the
 house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and
 did not eat.
 &nbsp; 8 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest
 thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? <I>am</I>
 not I better to thee than ten sons?

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the state of the family into which Samuel 
 the prophet was born. His father's name was Elkanah, a Levite, and of 
 the family of the Kohathites (the most honourable house of that tribe) 
 as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:33,34">1 Chron. vi. 33, 34</A>.

 His ancestor Zuph was an Ephrathite, that is, of Bethlehem-Judah, which
 was called <I>Ephrathah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:2">Ruth i. 2</A>.

 There this family of the Levites was first seated, but one branch of
 it, in process of time, removed to Mount Ephraim, from which Elkanah 
 descended.  Micah's Levite came from Bethlehem to Mount Ephraim,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:8">Judg. xvii. 8</A>.

 Perhaps notice is taken of their being originally Ephrathites to show
 their alliance to David. This Elkanah lived at Ramah, or Ramathaim, 
 which signifies <I>the double Ramah,</I> the higher and lower town, the 
 same with Arimathea of which Joseph was, here called 
 <I>Ramathaim-zophim.</I> Zophim signifies <I>watchmen;</I> probably 
 they had one of the schools of the prophets there, for prophets are 
 called <I>watchmen:</I> the Chaldee paraphrase calls Elkanah <I>a 
 disciple of the prophets.</I> But it seems to me that it was in Samuel 
 that prophecy revived, before his time there being, for a great while, 
 no open vision,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:1"><I>ch.</I> iii. 1</A>.

 Nor is there any mention of a prophet of the Lord from Moses to Samuel,
 except 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:8">Judg. vi. 8</A>.

 So that we have no reason to think that there was any nursery or
 college of prophets here till Samuel himself founded one,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:19,20"><I>ch.</I> xix. 19, 20</A>.

 This is the account of Samuel's parentage, and the place of his
 nativity. Let us now take notice of the state of the family.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It was a devout family. All the families of Israel should be so, but 
 Levites' families in a particular manner. Ministers should be patterns 
 of family religion. Elkanah went up at the solemn feasts to the 
 tabernacle at Shiloh, to <I>worship and to sacrifice to the Lord of 
 hosts.</I> I think this is the first time in scripture that God is 
 called <I>the Lord of hosts</I>--<I>Jehovah Sabaoth,</I> a name by which
 he was afterwards very much called and known. Probably Samuel the 
 prophet was the first that used this title of God, for the comfort of 
 Israel, when in his time their hosts were few and feeble and those of 
 their enemies many and mighty; then it would be a support to them to 
 think that the God they served was Lord of hosts, of all the hosts both 
 of heaven and earth; of them he has a sovereign command, and makes what 
 use he pleases of them. Elkanah was a country Levite, and, for aught 
 that appears, had not any place or office which required his attendance 
 at the tabernacle, but he went up as a common Israelite, with his own 
 sacrifices, to encourage his neighbours and set them a good example. 
 When he sacrificed he worshipped, joining prayers and thanksgivings 
 with his sacrifices. In this course of religion he was constant, for he 
 went up yearly.  And that which made it the more commendable in him 
 was, 

 1. That there was a general decay and neglect of religion in the
 nations. Some among them worshipped other gods, and the generality were 
 remiss in the service of the God of Israel, and yet Elkanah kept his 
 integrity; whatever others did, his resolution was that he and his 
 house should serve the Lord. 

 2. That Hophni and Phinehas, the sons of Eli, were the men that were
 now chiefly employed in the service of the house of God; and they were 
 men that conducted themselves very ill in their place, as we shall find 
 afterwards; yet Elkanah went up to sacrifice. God had then tied his 
 people to one place and one altar, and forbidden them, under any 
 pretence whatsoever, to worship elsewhere, and therefore, in pure 
 obedience to that command, he attended at Shiloh. If the priests did 
 not do their duty, he would do his. Thanks be to God, we, under the 
 gospel, are not tied to any one place or family; but the pastors and 
 teachers whom the exalted Redeemer has given to his church are those 
 only whose ministration tends to the <I>perfecting of the saints</I> 
 and the <I>edifying of the body of Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:11,12">Eph. iv. 11, 12</A>.

 None have dominion over our faith; but our obligation is to those that
 are the helpers of our holiness and joy, not to any that by their 
 scandalous immoralities, like Hophni and Phinehas, make the sacrifices 
 of the Lord to be abhorred, though still the validity and efficacy of 
 the sacraments depend not on the purity of him that administers 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Yet it was a divided family, and the divisions of it carried with 
 them both guilt and grief. Where there is piety, it is a pity but there 
 should be unity. The joint-devotions of a family should put an end to 
 divisions in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The original cause of this division was Elkanah's marrying two 
 wives, which was a transgression of the original institution of 
 marriage, to which our Saviour reduces it. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:5,8">Matt. xix. 5, 8</A>,

 <I>From the beginning it was not so.</I> It made mischief in Abraham's
 family, and Jacob's, and here in Elkanah's. How much better does the 
 law of God provide for our comfort and ease in this world than we 
 should, if we were left to ourselves! It is probable that Elkanah 
 married Hannah first, and, because he had not children by her so soon 
 as he hoped, he married Peninnah, who bore him children indeed, but was 
 in other things a vexation to him. Thus are men often beaten with rods 
 of their own making.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That which followed upon this error was that the two wives could not 
 agree. They had different blessings: Peninnah, like Leah, was fruitful 
 and had many children, which should have made her easy and thankful, 
 though she was but a second wife, and was less beloved; Hannah, like 
 Rachel, was childless indeed, but she was very dear to her husband, and 
 he took all occasions to let both her and others know that she was so, 
 and many a <I>worthy portion he gave her</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and this should have made her easy and thankful. But they were of
 different tempers: Peninnah could not bear the blessing of 
 fruitfulness, but she grew haughty and insolent; Hannah could not bear 
 the affliction of barrenness, but she grew melancholy and discontented: 
 and Elkanah had a difficult part to act between them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Elkanah kept up his attendance at God's altar notwithstanding this 
 unhappy difference in his family, and took his wives and children with 
 him, that, if they could not agree in other things, they might agree to 
 worship God together. If the devotions of a family prevail not to put 
 an end to its divisions, yet let not the divisions put a stop to the 
 devotions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He did all he could to encourage Hannah, and to keep up her 
 spirits under her affliction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 At the feast he offered peace-offerings, to supplicate for peace in his
 family; and when he and his family were to eat their share of the 
 sacrifice, in token of their communion with God and his altar, though 
 he carved to Peninnah and her children competent portions, yet to 
 Hannah he gave a worthy portion, the choicest piece that came to the 
 table, the piece (whatever it was) that used to be given on such 
 occasions to those that were most valued; this he did in token of his 
 love to her, and to give all possible assurances of it. Observe,

 [1.] Elkanah loved his wife never the less for her being barren.
 <I>Christ loves his church,</I> notwithstanding her infirmities, her 
 barrenness; and <I>so ought men to love their wives,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:25">Eph. v. 25</A>.

 To abate our just love to any relation for the sake of any infirmity
 which they cannot help, and which is not their sin but their 
 affliction, is to make God's providence quarrel with his precept, and 
 very unkindly to add affliction to the afflicted.

 [2.] He studied to show his love so much the more because she was
 afflicted, insulted, and low-spirited. It is wisdom and duty to support 
 the weakest, and to hold up those that are run down. 

 [3.] He showed his great love to her by the share he gave her of his
 peace-offerings. Thus we should testify our affection to our friends 
 and relations, by abounding in prayer for them. The better we love them 
 the more room let us give them in our prayers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Peninnah was extremely peevish and provoking. 

 [1.] She upbraided Hannah with her affliction, despised her because she
 was barren, and gave her taunting language, as one whom Heaven did not 
 favour. 

 [2.] She envied the interest she had in the love of Elkanah, and the
 more kind he was to her the more was she exasperated against her, which 
 was all over base and barbarous. 

 [3.] She did this most when they <I>went up to the house of the
 Lord,</I> perhaps because then they were more together than at other 
 times, or because then Elkanah showed his affection most to Hannah. But 
 it was very sinful at such a time to show her malice, when pure hands 
 were to be lifted up at God's altar without wrath and quarrelling. It 
 was likewise very unkind at that time to vex Hannah, not only because 
 then they were in company, and others would take notice of it, but then 
 Hannah was to mind her devotions, and desired to be most calm and 
 composed, and free from disturbance. The great adversary to our purity 
 and peace is then most industrious to ruffle us when we should be most 
 composed. When the <I>sons of God</I> come to <I>present themselves 
 before the Lord Satan</I> will be sure to <I>come among them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:6">Job i. 6</A>.

 [4.] She continued to do this from year to year, not once or twice, but
 it was her constant practice; neither deference to her husband nor 
 compassion to Hannah could break her of it. 

 [5.] That which she designed was to make her fret, perhaps in hopes to
 break her heart, that she might possess her husband's heart solely, or 
 because she took a pleasure in her uneasiness, nor could Hannah gratify 
 her more than by fretting. Note, It is an evidence of a base 
 disposition to delight in grieving those that are melancholy and of a 
 sorrowful spirit, and in putting those out of humour that are apt to 
 fret and be uneasy. We ought to bear one another's burdens, not add to 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Hannah (poor woman) could not hear the provocation: <I>She wept,
 and did not eat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It made her uneasy to herself and to all her relations. She did not eat
 of the feast; her trouble took away her appetite, made her unfit for 
 any company, and a jar in the harmony of family-joy. It was of the 
 <I>feast upon the sacrifice</I> that she <I>did not eat,</I> for they 
 were not to <I>eat of the holy things in their mourning,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+26:14,Le+10:19">Deut. xxvi. 14; Lev. x. 19</A>.

 Yet it was her infirmity so far to give way to the sorrow of the world
 as to unfit herself for holy joy in God. Those that are of a fretful 
 spirit, and are apt to lay provocations too much to heart, are enemies 
 to themselves, and strip themselves very much of the comforts both of 
 life and godliness.  We find that God took notice of this ill effect of 
 discontents and disagreements in the conjugal relation, that the 
 parties aggrieved <I>covered the altar of the Lord with tears, insomuch 
 that he regarded not the offering,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:13">Mal. ii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Elkanah said what he could to her to comfort her. She did not 
 upbraid him with his unkindness in marrying another wife as Sarah did, 
 nor did she render to Peninnah railing for railing, but took the 
 trouble wholly to herself, which made her an object of much compassion. 
 Elkanah showed himself extremely grieved at her grief 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):
 
 <I>Hannah, why weepest thou?</I> 

 [1.] He is much disquieted to see her thus overwhelmed with sorrow.
 Those that by marriage are made one flesh ought thus far to be of one 
 spirit too, to share in each other's troubles, so that one cannot be 
 easy while the other is uneasy. 

 [2.] He gives her a loving reproof for it: <I>Why weepest thou? And why
 is thy heart grieved?</I> As many as God loves he rebukes, and so 
 should we.  He puts her upon enquiring into the cause of her grief. 
 Though she had just reason to be troubled, yet let her consider whether 
 she had reason to be troubled to such a degree, especially so much as 
 to be taken off by it from eating of the holy things. Note, Our sorrow 
 upon any account is sinful and inordinate when it diverts us from our 
 duty to God and embitters our comfort in him, when it makes us 
 unthankful for the mercies we enjoy and distrustful of the goodness of 
 God to us in further mercies, when it casts a damp upon our joy in 
 Christ, and hinders us from doing the duty and taking the comfort of 
 our particular relations. 

 [3.] He intimates that nothing should be wanting on his part to balance
 her grief: "<I>Am not I better to thee than ten sons?</I> Thou knowest 
 thou hast my entire affection, and let that comfort thee." Note, We 
 ought to take notice of our comforts, to keep us from grieving 
 excessively for our crosses; for our crosses we deserve, but our 
 comforts we have forfeited. If we would keep the balance even, we must 
 look at that which is for us, as well as at that which is against us, 
 else we are unjust to Providence and unkind to ourselves. <I>God hath 
 set the one over-against the other</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:14">Eccl. vii. 14</A>)

 and so should we.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after
 they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of
 the temple of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 10 And she <I>was</I> in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and wept sore.
 &nbsp; 11 And she vowed a vow, and said, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, if thou wilt
 indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me,
 and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid
 a man child, then I will give him unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> all the days of
 his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
 &nbsp; 12 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that Eli marked her mouth.
 &nbsp; 13 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but
 her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been
 drunken.
 &nbsp; 14 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put
 away thy wine from thee.
 &nbsp; 15 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I <I>am</I> a woman of
 a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink,
 but have poured out my soul before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 16 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out
 of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken
 hitherto.
 &nbsp; 17 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of
 Israel grant <I>thee</I> thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
 &nbsp; 18 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So
 the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no
 more <I>sad.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Elkanah had gently reproved Hannah for her inordinate grief, and here 
 we find the good effect of the reproof.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It brought her to her meat. She ate and drank, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 She did not harden herself in sorrow, nor grow sullen when she was
 reproved for it; but, when she perceived her husband uneasy that she 
 did not come and eat with them, she cheered up her own spirits as well 
 as she could, and came to table. It is as great a piece of self-denial
 to control our passions as it is to control our appetites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It brought her to her prayers. It put her upon considering, "Do I 
 well to be angry? Do I well to fret? What good does it do me? Instead 
 of binding the burden thus upon my shoulders, had I not better easy 
 myself of it, and cast it upon the Lord by prayer?" Elkanah had said, 
 <I>Am not I better to thee than ten sons?</I> which perhaps occasioned 
 her to think within herself, "Whether <I>he</I> be so or no, <I>God</I> 
 is, and therefore to him will I apply, and before him will I pour out 
 my complaint, and try what relief that will give me." If ever she will 
 make a more solemn address than ordinary to the throne of grace upon 
 this errand, now is the time. They are at Shiloh, at the door of the 
 tabernacle, where God had promised to meet his people, and which was 
 the <I>house of prayer.</I> They had recently offered their 
 peace-offerings, to obtain the favour of God and all good and in token 
 of their communion with him; and, taking the comfort of their being 
 accepted of him, they had feasted upon the sacrifice; and now it was 
 proper to put up her prayer in virtue of that sacrifice, for the 
 peace-offerings, for by it not only atonement is made for sin, but the 
 audience and acceptance of our prayers and an answer of peace to them 
 are obtained for us: to that sacrifice, in all our supplications, we 
 must have an eye. Now concerning Hannah's prayer we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The warm and lively devotion there was in it, which appeared in 
 several instances, for our direction in prayer. 

 (1.) She improved the present grief and trouble of her spirit for the
 exciting and quickening of her pious affections in prayer: <I>Being in 
 bitterness of soul, she prayed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 This good use we should make of our afflictions, they should make us
 the more lively in our addresses to God. Our blessed Saviour himself, 
 <I>being in an agony, prayed more earnestly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:44">Luke xxii. 44</A>.

 (2.) She mingled tears with her prayers. It was not a dry prayer: she
 wept sore. Like a true Israelite, she <I>wept and made supplication</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:4">Hos. xii. 4</A>),

 with an eye to the tender mercy of our God, who knows the troubled
 soul. The prayer came from her heart, as the tears from her eyes.

 (3.) She was very particular, and yet very modest, in her petition. She
 begged a child, a man-child, that it might be fit to serve in the 
 tabernacle. God gives us leave, in prayer, not only to ask good things 
 in general, but to mention that special good thing which we most need 
 and desire. Yet she says not, as Rachel, <I>Give me children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:1">Gen. xxx. 1</A>.
 
 She will be very thankful for <I>one.</I>

 (4.) She made a solemn vow, or promise, that if God would give her a
 son she would <I>give him up to God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He would be by birth a Levite, and so devoted to the service of God,
 but he should be by her vow a Nazarite, and his very childhood should 
 be sacred. It is probable she had acquainted Elkanah with her purpose 
 before, and had had his consent and approbation. Note, Parents have a 
 right to dedicate their children to God, as living sacrifices and 
 spiritual priests; and an obligation is thereby laid upon them to serve 
 God faithfully <I>all the days of their life.</I> Note further, It is 
 very proper, when we are in pursuit of any mercy, to bind our own souls 
 with a bond, that, if God give it us, we will devote it to his honour 
 and cheerfully use it in his service. Not that hereby we can pretend to 
 merit the gift, but thus we are qualified for it and for the comfort of 
 it. In hope of mercy, let us promise duty.

 (5.) She spoke all this so softly that none could hear her. Her lips
 moved, but <I>her voice was not heard,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Hereby she testified her belief of God's knowledge of the heart and its
 desires. Thoughts are words to him, nor is he one of those gods that 
 must be <I>cried aloud to,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:27">1 Kings  xviii. 27</A>.

 It was likewise an instance of her humility and holy shamefacedness in
 her approach to God. She was none of those that <I>made her voice to be 
 heard on high,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:4">Isa. lviii. 4</A>.

 It was a secret prayer, and therefore, though made in a public place,
 yet was thus made secretly, and not, as the Pharisees prayed, <I>to be 
 seen of men.</I> It is true prayer is not a thing we have reason to be 
 ashamed of, but we must avoid all appearances of ostentation. Let what 
 passes between God and our souls be kept to ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The hard censure she fell under for it. Eli was now high priest, and 
 judge in Israel; he sat upon a seat in the temple, to oversee what was 
 done there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The tabernacle is here called the <I>temple,</I> because it was now
 fixed, and served all the purposes of a temple.  There Eli sat to 
 receive addresses and give direction, and somewhere (it is probable in 
 a private corner) he espied Hannah at her prayers, and by her unusual 
 manner fancied she was drunken, and spoke to her accordingly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>How long wilt thou be drunken?</I>--the very imputation that Peter
 and the apostles fell under when the Holy Ghost <I>gave them 
 utterance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:13">Acts ii. 13</A>.

 Perhaps in this degenerate age it was no strange thing to see drunken
 women at the door of the tabernacle; for otherwise, one would think, 
 the vile lust of Hophni and Phinehas could not have found so easy a 
 prey there,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:22"><I>ch.</I> ii. 22</A>.

 Eli took Hannah for one of these. It is one bad effect of the abounding
 of iniquity, and its becoming fashionable, that it often gives occasion 
 to suspect the innocent. When a disease is epidemical every one is 
 suspected to be tainted with it. Now, 

 (1.) This was Eli's fault; and a great fault it was to pass so severe a
 censure without better observation or information. If his own eyes had 
 already become dim, he should have employed those about him to enquire. 
 Drunkards are commonly noisy and turbulent, but this poor woman was 
 silent and composed. His fault was the worse that he was the priest of 
 the Lord, who should have had <I>compassion on the ignorant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:2">Heb. v. 2</A>.

 Note, It ill becomes us to be rash and hasty in our censures of others,
 and to be forward to believe people guilty of bad things, while either 
 the matter of fact on which the censure is grounded is doubtful and 
 unproved or is capable of a good construction. Charity commands us to 
 hope the best concerning all, and forbids censoriousness. Paul had very 
 good information when he did but <I>partly believe</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:18">1 Cor. xi. 18</A>),

 hoping it was not so.  Especially we ought to be cautious how we
 censure the devotions of others, lest we call that <I>hypocrisy, 
 enthusiasm,</I> or <I>superstition,</I> which is really the fruit of an 
 honest zeal, and it is accepted of God. 

 (2.) It was Hannah's affliction; and a great affliction it was, added
 to all the rest, vinegar to the wounds of her spirit. She had been 
 reproved by Elkanah because she would not eat and drink, and now to be 
 reproached by Eli as if she had eaten and drunk too much was very hard. 
 Note, It is no new thing for those that do well to be ill thought of, 
 and we must not think it strange if at any time it be our lot.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Hannah's humble vindication of herself from this crime with which 
 she was charged. She bore it admirably well. She did not retort the 
 charge and upbraid him with the debauchery of his own sons, did not bid 
 him look at home and restrain them, did not tell him how ill it became 
 one in his place thus to abuse a poor sorrowful worshipper at the 
 throne of grace. When we are at any time unjustly censured we have need 
 to set a double watch before the door of our lips, that we do not 
 recriminate, and return censure for censure. Hannah thought it enough 
 to vindicate herself, and so must we, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 (1.) In justice to herself, she expressly denies the charge, speaks to
 him with all possible respect, calls him, <I>My lord,</I> intimates how 
 very desirous she was to stand right in his opinion and how loth to lie 
 under his censure. "No, my lord, it is not as you suspect; I have drunk 
 neither wine nor strong drink, not any at all" (though it was proper 
 enough to be given to one of such a <I>heavy heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:6">Prov. xxxi. 6</A>),
 
 "much less to any excess; therefore <I>count not thy handmaid for a
 daughter of Belial.</I>" Note, Drunkards are children of Belial 
 (women-drunkards, particularly), children of the wicked one, children 
 of disobedience, children that will not endure the yoke (else they 
 would not be drunk), more especially when they are actually drunk. 
 Those that cannot govern themselves will not bear that any one else 
 should. Hannah owns that the crime would have been very great if she 
 had indeed been guilty of it, and he might justly have shut her out of 
 the courts of God's house; but the very manner of her speaking in her 
 own defence was sufficient to demonstrate that she was not drunk. 

 (2.) In justice to him, she gives an account of her present behaviour,
 which had given occasion to his suspicion: "<I>I am a woman of a 
 sorrowful spirit,</I> dejected and discomposed, and that is the reason 
 I do not look as other people; the eyes are red, not with wine, but 
 with weeping. And at this time I have not been talking to myself, as 
 drunkards and fools do, but I have been pouring out my soul before the 
 Lord, who hears and understands the language of the heart, and this out 
 of the abundance of my complaint and grief." She had been more than 
 ordinarily fervent in prayer to God, and this, she tells him, was the 
 true reason of the transport and disorder she seemed to be in. Note, 
 When we are unjustly censured we should endeavour, not only to clear 
 ourselves, but to satisfy our brethren, by giving them a just and true 
 account of that which they misapprehended.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The atonement Eli made for his rash unfriendly censure, by a kind 
 and fatherly benediction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He did not (as many are apt to do in such a case) take it for an
 affront to have his mistake rectified and to be convinced of his error, 
 nor did it put him out of humour. But, on the contrary, he now 
 encouraged Hannah's devotions as much as before he had discountenanced 
 them; not only intimated that he was satisfied of her innocency by 
 those words, <I>Go in peace,</I> but, being high priest, as one having 
 authority he blessed her in the name of the Lord, and, though he knew 
 not what the particular blessing was that she had been praying for, yet 
 he puts his <I>Amen</I> to it, so good an opinion had he now conceived 
 of her prudence and piety: <I>The God of Israel grant thee thy 
 petition,</I> whatever it is, <I>that thou hast asked of him.</I> Note, 
 By our meek and humble carriage towards those that reproach us because 
 they do not know us, we may perhaps make them our friends, and turn 
 their censures of us into prayers for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The great satisfaction of mind with which Hannah now went away, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 She begged the continuance of Eli's good opinion of her and his good
 prayers for her, and then she went her way and did eat of what remained 
 of the peace-offerings (none of which was to be left until the 
 morning), <I>and her countenance was no more sad,</I> no more as it had 
 been, giving marks of inward trouble and discomposure; but she looked 
 pleasant and cheerful, and all was well. Why, what had happened? Whence 
 came this sudden happy change? She had by prayer committed her case to 
 God and left it with him, and now she was no more perplexed about it.  
 She had prayed for herself, and Eli had prayed for her; and she 
 believed that God would either give her the mercy she had prayed for or 
 make up the want of it to her some other way. Note, Prayer is 
 heart's-ease to a gracious soul; the seed of Jacob have often found it 
 so, being confident that God will never say unto them, <I>Seek you me 
 in vain,</I> see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:6,7">Phil. iv. 6, 7</A>.

 Prayer will smooth the countenance; it should do so.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and
 Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> remembered her.
 &nbsp; 20 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about
 after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his
 name Samuel, <I>saying,</I> Because I have asked him of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 21 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer
 unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.
 &nbsp; 22 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, <I>I
 will not go up</I> until the child be weaned, and <I>then</I> I will
 bring him, that he may appear before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and there abide
 for ever.
 &nbsp; 23 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee
 good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> establish
 his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she
 weaned him.
 &nbsp; 24 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with
 three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and
 brought him unto the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in Shiloh: and the child
 <I>was</I> young.
 &nbsp; 25 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.
 &nbsp; 26 And she said, Oh my lord, <I>as</I> thy soul liveth, my lord, I
 <I>am</I> the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 27 For this child I prayed; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath given me my
 petition which I asked of him:
 &nbsp; 28 Therefore also I have lent him to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; as long as he
 liveth he shall be lent to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. And he worshipped the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 there.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The return of Elkanah and his family to their own habitation, when 
 the days appointed for the feast were over,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 Observe how they improved their time at the tabernacle. Every day they
 were there, even that which was fixed for their journey home, they 
 worshipped God; and they rose up early to do it. It is good to begin 
 the day with God. Let him that is the first have the first. They had a 
 journey before them, and a family of children to take with them, and 
 yet they would not stir till they had worshipped God together. Prayer 
 and provender do not hinder a journey. They had spent several days now 
 in religious worship, and yet they attended once more. We should not be 
 weary of well-doing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The birth and name of this desired son. At length the Lord
 remembered Hannah, the very thing she desired 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and more she needed not desire, that was enough, for then she conceived
 and bore a son. Though God seem long to forget his people's burdens, 
 troubles, cares, and prayers, yet he will at length make it to appear 
 that they are not out of his mind. This son the mother called 
 <I>Samuel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Some make the etymology of this name to be much the same with that of
 <I>Ishmael--heard of God,</I> because the mother's prayers were 
 remarkably heard, and he was an answer to them.  Others, because of the 
 reason she gives for the name, make it to signify <I>asked of God.</I> 
 It comes nearly to the same; she designed by it to perpetuate the 
 remembrance of God's favour to her in answering her prayers. Thus she 
 designed, upon every mention of his name, to take the comfort to 
 herself and to give God the glory of that gracious condescension. Note, 
 Mercies in answer to prayer are to be remembered with peculiar 
 expressions of thankfulness, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:1,2">Ps.  cxvi. 1, 2</A>.

 How many seasonable deliverances and supplies may we call <I>Samuels,
 asked of God;</I> and whatever is so we are in a special manner engaged 
 to devote to him.  Hannah intended by this name to put her son in mind 
 of the obligation he was under to be the Lord's, in consideration of 
 this, that he was asked of God and was at the same time dedicated to 
 him. A child of prayer is in a special manner bound to be a good child.  
 Lemuel's mother reminds him that he was the <I>son of her vows,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:2">Prov.  xxxi. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The close attendance Hannah gave to the nursing of him, not only 
 because he was dear to her, but because he was devoted to God, and for 
 him she nursed him herself, and did not hang him on another's breast. 
 We ought to take care of our children, not only with an eye to the law 
 of nature as they are ours, but with an eye to the covenant of grace as 
 they are given up to God. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:20,21">Ezek. xvi. 20, 21</A>.

 This sanctifies the nursing of them, when it is done as unto the Lord.
 Elkanah went up every year to worship at the tabernacle, and 
 particularly to perform his vow, perhaps some vow he had made distinct 
 from Hannah's if God would give him a son by her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 But Hannah, though she felt a warm regard for the courts of God's
 house, begged leave of her husband to stay at home; for the women were 
 not under any obligation to go up to the three yearly feasts, as the 
 men were.  However Hannah had been accustomed to go, but now desired to 
 be excused,

 1. Because she would not be so long absent from her nursery.  <I>Can a 
 woman forget her sucking child?</I> We may suppose she kept constantly 
 at home, for, if she had gone any where, she would have gone to Shiloh. 
 Note, God will have mercy and not sacrifice. Those that are detained 
 from public ordinances by the nursing and tending of little children 
 may take comfort from this instance, and believe that, if they do that 
 with an eye to God, he will graciously accept them therein, and though 
 they tarry at home they shall divide the spoil. 

 2. Because she would not go up to Shiloh till her son was big enough,
 not only to be taken thither, but to be left there; for, if once she 
 took him thither, she thought she could never find in her heart to 
 bring him back again.  Note, Those who are stedfastly resolved to pay 
 their vows may yet see good cause to defer the payment of them. 
 <I>Every thing is beautiful in its season.</I> No animal was accepted 
 in sacrifice till it had been for some time under the dam, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+22:27">Lev. xxii. 27</A>.
 
 Fruit is best when it is ripe.  Elkanah agrees to what she proposes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Do what seemeth thee good.</I> So far was he from delighting to
 cross her that he referred it entirely to her. <I>Behold how good and 
 pleasant a thing it is,</I> when yoke-fellows thus draw even in the 
 yoke, and accommodate themselves to one another, each thinking well of 
 what the other does, especially in works of piety and charity. He adds 
 a prayer: <I>Only the Lord establish his word,</I> that is, "God 
 preserve the child through the perils of his infancy, that the solemn 
 vow which God signified his acceptance of, by giving us the child, may 
 be performed in its season, and so the whole matter may be 
 accomplished." Note, Those that have in sincerity devoted their 
 children to God may with comfort pray for them, that God will establish 
 the word sealed to them at the same time that they were sealed for 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The solemn entering of this child into the service of the 
 sanctuary. We may take it for granted that he was presented to the Lord
 at forty days old, as all the first-born were 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:22,23">Luke ii. 22, 23</A>):

 but this is not mentioned, because there was nothing in it singular;
 but now that he was weaned he was presented, not to be redeemed. Some 
 think it was as soon as he was weaned from the breast, which, the Jews 
 say, was not till he was three years old; it is said she gave him suck 
 till she had weaned him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Others think it was not till he was weaned from childish things, at
 eight or ten years old.  But I see no inconvenience in admitting such 
 an extraordinary child as this into the tabernacle at three years old, 
 to be educated among the children of the priests. It is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 <I>The child was young,</I> but, being intelligent above his years, he
 was no trouble.  None can begin too soon to be religious. <I>The child 
 was a child,</I> so the Hebrew reads it, in his learning-age. For 
 <I>whom shall he teach knowledge</I> but <I>those that are</I> newly 
 <I>weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:9">Isa. xxviii. 9</A>.
 
 Observe how she presented her child,

 1. With a sacrifice; no less than three bullocks, with a meat-offering 
 for each, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 A bullock, perhaps, for each year of the child's life.  Or one for a
 burnt-offering, another for a sin-offering, and the third of a 
 peace-offering. So far was she from thinking that, by presenting her 
 son to God, she made God her debtor, that she thought it requisite by 
 these slain offerings to seek God's acceptance of her living sacrifice.  
 All our covenants with God for ourselves and ours must be made by 
 sacrifice, the great sacrifice.

 2. With a grateful acknowledgement of God's goodness in answer to
 prayer. This she makes to Eli, because he had encouraged her to hope 
 for an answer of peace

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>):

 "<I>For this child I prayed.</I> Here it was obtained by prayer, and
 here it is resigned to the prayer-hearing God. You have forgotten me, 
 my lord, but I who now appear so cheerful am the woman, the very same, 
 that three years ago stood by thee here weeping and praying, and this 
 was the child I prayed for." Answers of prayer may thus be humbly 
 triumphed in, to the glory of God. Here is a living testimony for God. 
 "I am his witness that he is gracious (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:16-19">Ps.  lxvi. 16-19</A>);

 for this mercy, this comfort, I prayed, <I>and the Lord has given me my
 petition.</I>" See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:2,4,6">Ps. xxxiv. 2, 4, 6</A>.

 Hannah does not remind Eli of it by adverting to the suspicion he had
 formerly expressed; she does not say, "I am the woman whom you passed 
 that severe censure upon; what do you think of me now?" Good men ought 
 not to be upbraided with their infirmities and oversights. They have 
 themselves repented of them; let them hear no more of them.

 3. With a full surrender of all her interest in this child unto the
 Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>I have lent him to the Lord as long as he liveth.</I> And she
 repeats it, because she will never revoke it: <I>He shall be</I> (a 
 deodand) <I>lent</I> or given <I>to the Lord.</I> Not that she designed 
 to call for him back, as we do what we lend, but she uses this word 
 <I>Shaol, lent,</I> because it is the same word that she had used 
 before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>,

 <I>I asked</I> him of the Lord), only in another conjugation. And

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>)

 the Lord gave me the petition which <I>I asked</I> (<I>Shaalti,</I> in
 Kal), therefore <I>I have lent him</I> (<I>Hishilti,</I> the same word 
 in Hiphil), and so it gives another etymology of his name 
 <I>Samuel,</I> not only <I>asked of God,</I> but <I>lent to God.</I> 
 And observe,

 (1.) Whatever we give to God, it is what we have first asked and
 received from him.  All our gifts to him were first his gifts to us. 
 <I>Of thy own, Lord, have we given thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:14,16">1 Chron. xxix. 14, 16</A>.

 (2.) Whatever we give to God may upon this account be said to be
 <I>lent</I> to him, that though we may not recall it, as a thing lent, 
 yet he will certainly repay it, with interest, to our unspeakable 
 advantage, particularly what is given <I>to his poor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:17">Prov. xix. 17</A>.
 
 When by baptism we dedicate our children to God, let us remember that
 they were his before by a sovereign right, and that they are ours still 
 so much the more to our comfort. Hannah resigns him to the Lord, not 
 for a certain term of years, as children are sent apprentices, but 
 <I>durante vita--as long as he liveth, he shall be lent unto the 
 Lord,</I> a Nazarite for life.  Such must our covenant with God be, a 
 marriage-covenant; as long as live we must be his, and never forsake 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The child Samuel did his part beyond what could have 
 been expected from one of his years; for of him that seems to be 
 spoken, <I>He worshipped the Lord there,</I> that is <I>he said his 
 prayers.</I> He was no doubt extraordinarily forward (we have known
 children that have discovered some sense of religion very young), and 
 his mother, designing him for the sanctuary, took particular care to 
 train him up to that which was to be his work in the sanctuary. Note, 
 Little children should learn betimes to worship God. Their parents 
 should instruct them in his worship and bring them to it, put them upon 
 engaging in it as well as they can, and God will graciously accept them 
 and teach them to do better.</P>
