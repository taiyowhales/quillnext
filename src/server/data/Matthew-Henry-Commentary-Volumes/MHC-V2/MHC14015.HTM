 Asa and his army were now returning in triumph from the battle, laden 
 with spoils and adorned with the trophies of victory, the pious prince, 
 we may now suppose, studying what he should render to God for this 
 great favour. He knew that the work of reformation, which he had begun 
 in his kingdom, was not perfected; his enemies abroad were subdued, but 
 there were more dangerous enemies at home that were yet 
 unconquered--idols in Judah and Benjamin: his victory over the former
 emboldened him vigorously to renew his attack upon the latter. Now here 
 we have, 

 I. The message which God sent to him, by a prophet, to engage him to,
 and encourage him in, the prosecution of his reformation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:1-7">ver.  1-7</A>.

 II.  The life which this message put into that good cause, and their
 proceedings in pursuance of it. Idols removed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:8">ver. 8</A>.

 The spoil dedicated to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>.

 A covenant made with God, and a law for the punishing of idolaters, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.
 
 A reformation at court, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:16">ver. 16</A>.

 Dedicated things brought into the house of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:18">ver. 18</A>.

 All well, but that the high places were permitted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:17">ver. 17</A>.

 And the effect of this was great peace,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:
 &nbsp; 2  And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me,
 Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> with you, while ye
 be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if
 ye forsake him, he will forsake you.
 &nbsp; 3  Now for a long season Israel <I>hath been</I> without the true
 God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.
 &nbsp; 4  But when they in their trouble did turn unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of
 Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.
 &nbsp; 5  And in those times <I>there was</I> no peace to him that went out,
 nor to him that came in, but great vexations <I>were</I> upon all the
 inhabitants of the countries.
 &nbsp; 6  And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God
 did vex them with all adversity.
 &nbsp; 7  Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for
 your work shall be rewarded.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was a great happiness to Israel that they had prophets among them; 
 yet, while they were thus blessed, they were strangely addicted to 
 idolatry, whereas, when the spirit of prophecy had ceased under the 
 second temple, and the canon of the Old Temple was completed (which was 
 constantly read in their synagogues), they were pure from idolatry; for 
 the scriptures are of all other the <I>most sure word of prophecy,</I> 
 and most effectual, and the church could not be so easily imposed upon 
 by a counterfeit Bible as by a counterfeit prophet. Here was a prophet 
 sent to Asa and his army, when they returned victorious from the war 
 with the Ethiopians, not to compliment them and congratulate them on 
 their success, but to quicken them to their duty; this is the proper 
 business of God's ministers, even with princes and the greatest men. 
 The <I>Spirit of God came</I> upon the prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 both to instruct him what he should say and to enable him to say it
 with clearness and boldness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He told them plainly upon what terms they stood with God. Let them 
 not think that, having obtained this victory, all was their own for 
 ever; no, he must let them know they were upon their good behaviour. 
 Let them do well, and it will be well with them, otherwise not. 

 1.  <I>The Lord is with you while you are with him.</I> This is both a
 word of comfort, that those who keep close to God shall always have his 
 presence with them, and also a word of caution: "He is <I>with you, 
 while you are with him,</I> but no longer; you have now a signal token 
 of his favourable presence with you, but the continuance of it depends 
 upon your perseverance in the way of your duty." 

 2. "<I>If you seek him, he will be found of you.</I> Sincerely desire
 his favour, and aim at it, and you shall obtain it. Pray, and you shall 
 prevail. He never said, nor ever will, <I>Seek you me in vain.</I>" See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:6">Heb. xi. 6</A>.
 
 But,

 3. "If you forsake him and his ordinances, he is not tied to you, but
 will certainly forsake you, and then you are undone, your present 
 triumphs will be no security to you; woe to you when God departs."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He set before them the dangerous consequence of forsaking God and 
 his ordinances, and that there was no way of having grievances 
 redressed, but by repenting, and returning unto God. When Israel 
 forsook their duty they were over-run with a deluge of atheism, 
 impiety, irreligion, and all irregularity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and were continually embarrassed with vexatious and destroying wars,
 foreign and domestic, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 But when their troubles drove them to God they found it not in vain to
 seek him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 But the question is, What time does this refer to?

 1. Some think it looks as far back as the days of the Judges. <I>A long
 season</I> ago Israel was <I>without the true God,</I> for they 
 worshipped false gods; it was a time of ignorance, for, though they had 
 priests, they had no teaching priests, though they had elders, yet no 
 law to any purpose, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 These were sad times, when they were frequently oppressed by one enemy
 or other and grievously harassed by Moabites, Midianites, Ammonites, 
 and other nations.  They were <I>vexed with all adversity</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 yet when, in their perplexity, they turned to God by repentance,
 prayer, and reformation, he raised up deliverers for them. Then was 
 that maxim often verified, that God is with us while we are with him.  
 Whatsoever things of this kind were written aforetime were written for 
 our admonition. 

 2. Others think it describes the state of the ten tribes (who were now
 properly called <I>Israel</I>) in the days of Asa.  "<I>Now,</I> since 
 Jeroboam set up the calves, though he pretended to honour the God that 
 brought them out of Egypt, yet his idolatry has brought them to 
 downright infidelity; they are <I>without the true God,</I>" and no 
 marvel when they were without teaching priests.  Jeroboam's priests 
 were not teachers, and thus they came to be without law. It is next to 
 impossible that any thing of religion should be kept up without a 
 preaching ministry. In those times there was no peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Their war with Judah gave them frequent alarms; so did the late
 insurrection of Baasha and other occasions not mentioned. They provoked 
 God with all iniquity, and then he <I>vexed them with all 
 adversity;</I> yet, <I>when they turned to God,</I> he was entreated 
 for them. Let Judah take notice of this; let their neighbours' harms be 
 their warnings.  Give no countenance to graven images for you see what 
 mischiefs they produce.

 3. Others think the whole passage may be read in the future tense, and
 that it looks forward: Hereafter <I>Israel will be without the true God 
 and a teaching priest,</I> and they will be destroyed by one judgment 
 after another till they <I>return to God</I> and <I>seek him.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:4">Hos. iii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Upon this he grounded his exhortation to prosecute the work of 
 reformation with vigour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Be strong, for your work shall be rewarded.</I> Note, 

 1. God's work should be done with diligence and cheerfulness, but will
 not be done without resolution. 

 2. This should quicken us to the work of religion, that we shall be
 sure not to lose by it ultimately. It will not go unrewarded. How 
 should it, when the work is its own reward?</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the
 prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out
 of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities
 which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that <I>was</I> before the porch of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9  And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers
 with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for
 they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God <I>was</I> with him.
 &nbsp; 10  So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the
 third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
 &nbsp; 11  And they offered unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> the same time, of the spoil
 <I>which</I> they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand
 sheep.
 &nbsp; 12  And they entered into a covenant to seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of
 their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;
 &nbsp; 13  That whosoever would not seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel should
 be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.
 &nbsp; 14  And they sware unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with a loud voice, and with
 shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.
 &nbsp; 15  And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with
 all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he
 was found of them: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> gave them rest round about.
 &nbsp; 16  And also <I>concerning</I> Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he
 removed her from <I>being</I> queen, because she had made an idol in a
 grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped <I>it,</I> and burnt
 <I>it</I> at the brook Kidron.
 &nbsp; 17  But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:
 nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
 &nbsp; 18  And he brought into the house of God the things that his
 father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver,
 and gold, and vessels.
 &nbsp; 19  And there was no <I>more</I> war unto the five and thirtieth year
 of the reign of Asa.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told what good effect the foregoing sermon had upon 
 Asa.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He grew more bold for God than he had been. His victory would 
 inspire him with some new degrees of resolution, but this message from 
 God with much more. Now he took courage. he saw how necessary a further 
 reformation was, and what assurance he had of God's presence with him 
 in it; and this made him daring, and helped him over the difficulties 
 which had before deterred him and driven him off from the undertaking. 
 Now he ventured to destroy all the abominable idols (and all idolatries 
 are abominable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:3">1 Pet. iv. 3</A>)

 as far as ever his power went. Away with them all. He also <I>renewed
 the altar of the Lord,</I> which, it seems, had gone out of repair, 
 though it was not above thirty-five years since Solomon's head was 
 laid, who erected it. So soon did these ceremonial institutions begin 
 to wax old, as things which, in the fulness of time, must <I>vanish 
 away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:13">Heb. viii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He extended his influence further than before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He summoned a solemn assembly, and particularly brought the strangers
 to it, who had come over to him from the ten tribes.

 1. Their coming was a great encouragement to him; for the reason of
 their coming was because <I>they saw that the Lord his God was with 
 him.</I> It is good to be with those that have God with them, to come 
 into relation to, and contract acquaintance and friendship with, those 
 that live in the fear and favour of God. <I>We will go with you, for we 
 have heard that God is with you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23">Zech. viii. 23</A>.

 2. The cognizance he took of them, and the invitation he gave them to
 the general assembly, were a great encouragement to them. All strangers 
 are to be helped, but those that cast themselves upon God's good 
 providence, purely to keep a good conscience, are worthy of double 
 honour. Asa gave orders for the gathering of them together 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 yet it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 that they <I>gathered themselves together,</I> made it their own act,
 so forward were they to obey the king's orders. This meeting was held 
 in the third month, probably at the feast of Pentecost, which was in 
 that month.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He and his people offered sacrifices to God, as his share of the 
 spoil they had got, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Their offering here was nothing to Solomon's
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+7:5"><I>ch.</I> vii. 5</A>),

 which was owing to the diminution either of their zeal or of their
 wealth, or of both. These sacrifices were intended by way of 
 thanksgiving for the favours they had received, and supplication for 
 further favours. Prayers and praises are now our spiritual sacrifices.  
 And, as he took care that the altar should have its gift, so he took 
 care that the temple should have its gold: <I>He brought into the house 
 of God all the dedicated things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 It is honesty to render to God the things that are his. What has been
 long designed for him, and long laid by for him, as it should seem 
 these dedicated things had been, should at length be laid out for him. 
 Will a man rob God, or make slow payment to him, who is always ready to 
 do us good?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. <I>They entered into covenant with God,</I> repenting that they had 
 violated their engagements to him and resolving to do better for the 
 future. It is proper for penitents, for converts, to renew their 
 covenants. It should seem, the motion came not from Asa, but from the 
 people themselves. Let every man be a volunteer that covenants with 
 God. <I>Thy people shall be willing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What was the matter of this covenant. Nothing but what they were 
 before obliged to; and, though no vow or promise of theirs could lay 
 any higher obligation upon them than they were already under from the 
 divine precept, yet it would help to increase their sense of the 
 obligation, to arm them against temptations, and would be a testimony 
 to the equity and goodness of the precept. And, by joining all together 
 in this covenant, they strengthened the hands one of another. Two 
 things they engaged themselves to:--

 (1.) That they would diligently seek God themselves, seek his precepts,
 seek his favour. What is religion but seeking God, enquiring after him, 
 applying to him, upon all occasions? We shall not enjoy him till we 
 come to heaven; while we are here we must continue seeking. They would 
 seek God as the <I>God of their fathers,</I> in the way that their 
 fathers sought him and in dependence upon the promise made to their 
 fathers; and they would do it <I>with all their heart</I> and <I>with 
 all their soul,</I> for those only seek God acceptably and successfully 
 that are inward with him, intent upon him, and entire for him, in their 
 seeking him. We make nothing of our religion if we do not make 
 heart-work of it. God will have all the heart or none; and, when a 
 jewel of such inestimable value as the divine favour is to be found, it 
 is worth while to seek it <I>with all our soul.</I>

 (2.) That they would, to the utmost of their power, oblige others to
 seek him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 They agreed that <I>whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel</I>
 (that is, would either worship other gods or refuse to join with them 
 in the worship of the true God, that was either an obstinate idolater 
 or an obstinate atheist) he should be put to death.  This was no new 
 law of their own making, but an order to put in execution that law of 
 God to this purport,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:2-5">Deut. xvii. 2</A>,

 &c. If this law had been duly executed, there would
 not have been so many abominable idols found in Judah and Benjamin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Whether men may now, under the gospel, be compelled by such methods as
 these to seek the Lord is justly questioned; for the weapons of our 
 warfare are not carnal, and yet mighty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In what manner they made this covenant. 

 (1.) With great cheerfulness, and all possible expressions of joy:
 <I>The swore unto the Lord;</I> not secretly, as if they were either 
 ashamed of what they did or afraid of binding themselves too fast to 
 him, but with a loud voice, to express their own zeal and to animate 
 one another; and they all rejoiced at the oath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 They did not swear to God with reluctancy (as the poor debtor confesses
 a judgment to his creditor), but with all the pleasure and satisfaction 
 imaginable, as the bridegroom plights his troth to the bride in the 
 marriage covenant.  Every honest Israelite was pleased with his own 
 engagements to God, and they were all pleased with one another's. They 
 rejoiced in it as a hopeful expedient to prevent their apostasy from 
 God and a happy indication of God's presence with them. Note, The times 
 of renewing our covenant with God should be times of rejoicing, and 
 national reformation cannot but give general satisfaction to all that 
 are good.  It is an honour and happiness to be in bonds to God.

 (2.) They did it with great sincerity, zeal and resolution: <I>They
 swore to God with all their hearts,</I> and <I>sought him with their 
 whole desire.</I> The Israelites were now in an extraordinarily good 
 frame. O that there had always been such a heart in them! This comes in 
 as the reason why they rejoiced so much in what they did: it was 
 because they were hearty in it. Note, Those only experience the 
 pleasure and comfort of religion that are sincere and upright in it. 
 What is done in hypocrisy is a mere drudgery. But, if God has the 
 heart, we have the joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. We are told what was the effect of this their solemn covenanting 
 with God. 

 1. God did well for them: <I>He</I> was <I>found of them, and gave them
 rest round about</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 so that there was no war for a long time after

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 no open general war, though there were constant bickerings between
 Judah and Israel upon the frontiers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:16">1 Kings xv. 16</A>.

 National piety procures national blessings. 

 2. They did, on the whole, well for him. They carried on the
 reformation so far that Maachah the queen-mother was deposed for 
 idolatry and her idol destroyed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This was bravely done of Asa, that he would not connive at idolatry in
 those that were nearest to him, like Levi, that <I>said to his father 
 and mother, I have not seen him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:9">Deut. xxxiii. 9</A>.

 Asa knows he must honour God more than his grandmother, and dares not
 leave an idol in an apartment of his palace while he is destroying 
 idols in the cities of his kingdom. We may suppose this Maachah was so 
 far convinced of her sin that she was willing to subscribe the 
 association mentioned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>),

 binding herself to seek the Lord, and therefore was not put to death as
 those were that refused to sign it, great as well as small, women as 
 well as men: probably it was with an eye to her that <I>women</I> were 
 specified. But because she had been an idolater Asa thought fit to 
 divest her of the dignity and authority she had, and probably he 
 banished her the court and confined her to privacy, lest she should 
 influence and infect others. But the reformation was not complete; the 
 high places were not all taken away, though many of them were,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:3,5"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 3, 5</A>.

 Those in the cities were removed, but not those in the cities of Judah,
 but not those in the cities of Israel which were reduced to the house 
 of David; or those that were used in the service of false gods, but not 
 those that were used in the service of the God of Israel. These he 
 connived at, and yet his heart was perfect. There may be defects in 
 some particular duties where yet the heart, in the man, is upright with 
 God. Sincerity is something less than sinless perfection.</P>
