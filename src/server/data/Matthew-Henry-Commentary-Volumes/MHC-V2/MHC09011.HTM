 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have the first-fruits of Saul's government, in the
 glorious rescue of Jabesh-Gilead out of the hands of the Ammonites. Let
 not Israel thence infer that therefore they did well to ask a king (God
 could and would have saved them without one); but let them admire God's
 goodness, that he did not reject them when they rejected him, and
 acknowledge his wisdom in the choice of the person whom, if he did not
 find fit, yet he made fit, for the great trust he called him to, and
 enabled, in some measure, to merit the crown by his public services,
 before it was fixed on his head by the public approbation. Here is, 

 I.  The great extremity to which the city of Jabesh-Gilead, on the
 other side of Jordan, was reduced by the Ammonites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II.  Saul's great readiness to come to their relief, whereby he
 signalized himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:4-10">ver. 4-10</A>.

 III. The good success of his attempt, by which God signalized him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:11">ver. 11</A>.

 IV. Saul's tenderness, notwithstanding this, towards those that had
 opposed him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:12,13">ver. 12, 13</A>.

 V. The public confirmation and recognition of his election to the
 government,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against
 Jabesh-gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a
 covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
 &nbsp; 2 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this <I>condition</I>
 will I make <I>a covenant</I> with you, that I may thrust out all your
 right eyes, and lay it <I>for</I> a reproach upon all Israel.
 &nbsp; 3 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days'
 respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of
 Israel: and then, if <I>there be</I> no man to save us, we will come
 out to thee.
 &nbsp; 4 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the
 tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up
 their voices, and wept.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Ammonites were bad neighbours to those tribes of Israel that lay 
 next them, though descendants from just Lot, and, for that reason, 
 dealt civilly with by Israel. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+2:19">Deut. ii. 19</A>.

 Jephthah, in his time, had humbled them, but now the sin of Israel had
 put them into a capacity to make head again, and avenge that quarrel. 
 The city of Jabesh-Gilead had been, some ages ago, destroyed by 
 Israel's sword of justice, for not appearing against the wickedness of 
 Gibeah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+21:10">Judges xxi. 10</A>);

 and now being replenished again, probably by the posterity of those
 that then escaped the sword, it is in danger of being destroyed by the 
 Ammonites, as if some bad fate attended the place. Nahash, king of 
 Ammon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+19:1">1 Chron. xix. 1</A>)
 
 laid siege to it. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The besieged beat a parley 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>Make a covenant with us, and we will</I> surrender upon terms, and
 <I>serve thee.</I>" They had lost the virtue of Israelites, else they 
 would not have thus lost the valour of Israelites, nor tamely yielded 
 to serve an Ammonite, without one bold struggle for themselves. Had 
 they not broken their covenant with God, and forsaken his service, they 
 needed not thus to have courted a covenant with a Gentile nation, and 
 offered themselves to serve them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The besiegers offer them base and barbarous conditions; they will 
 spare their lives, and take them to be their servants, upon condition 
 that they shall <I>put out their right eyes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The Gileadites were content to part with their liberty and estates for
 the ransom of their blood; and, had the Ammonites taken them at their 
 word, the matter would have been so settled immediately, and the 
 Gileadites would not have sent out for relief. But their abject 
 concessions make the Ammonites more insolent in their demands, and they 
 cannot be content to have them for their servants, but,

 1. They must torment them, and put them to pain, exquisite pain, for so
 the thrusting out of an eye would do. 

 2. They must disable them for war, and render them incapable, though
 not of labour (that would have been a loss to their lords), yet of 
 bearing arms; for in those times they fought with shields in their left 
 hands, which covered their left eye, so that a soldier without his 
 right eye was in effect blind. 

 3.  They must put a <I>reproach upon all Israel,</I> as weak and
 cowardly, that would suffer the inhabitants of one of their chief 
 cities to be thus miserably used, and not offer to rescue them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The besieged desire, and obtain, seven days' time to consider of 
 this proposal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 If Nahash had not granted them this respite, we may suppose the horror
 of the proposal would have made them desperate, and they would rather 
 have died with their swords in their hands than have surrendered to 
 such merciless enemies: therefore Nahash, not imagining it possible 
 that, in so short a time, they should have relief, and being very 
 secure of the advantages he thought he had against them, in a bravado 
 gave them seven days, that the reproach upon Israel, for not rescuing 
 them, might be the greater, and his triumphs the more illustrious. But 
 there was a providence in it, that his security might be his 
 infatuation and ruin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Notice is sent of this to Gibeah. They said they would send 
 messengers <I>to all the coasts of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 which made Nahash the more secure, for that, he thought, would be a
 work of time, and none would be forward to appear if they had not one 
 common head; and perhaps Nahash had not yet heard of the new-elected 
 king. But the messengers, either of their own accord or by order from 
 their masters, went straight to Gibeah, and, not finding Saul within, 
 told their news to the people, who fell a weeping upon hearing it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They would sooner lament their brethren's misery and danger than think
 of helping them, shed their tears for them than shed their blood.  They 
 wept, as despairing to help the men of Jabesh-Gilead, and fearing lest, 
 if that frontier-city should be lost, the enemy would penetrate into 
 the very bowels of their country, which now appeared in great 
 hazard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and
 Saul said, What <I>aileth</I> the people that they weep? And they told
 him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.
 &nbsp; 6 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those
 tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.
 &nbsp; 7 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and
 sent <I>them</I> throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of
 messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and
 after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.
 &nbsp; 8 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel
 were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty
 thousand.
 &nbsp; 9 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye
 say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To morrow, by <I>that time</I> the
 sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and
 shewed <I>it</I> to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
 &nbsp; 10 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out
 unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.
 &nbsp; 11 And it was <I>so</I> on the morrow, that Saul put the people in
 three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the
 morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day:
 and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so
 that two of them were not left together.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What is here related turns very much to the honour of Saul, and shows 
 the happy fruits of that other spirit with which he was endued. Observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His humility. Though he was anointed king, and accepted by his 
 people, yet he did not think it below him to know the state of his own 
 flocks, but went himself to see them, and came in the evening, with his 
 servants, <I>after the herd out of the field,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 This was an evidence that he was not puffed up with his advancement, as
 those are most apt to be that are raised from a mean estate. Providence 
 had not yet found him business as a king; he left all to Samuel; and 
 therefore, rather than be idle, he would, for the present, apply 
 himself to his country business again. Though the sons of Belial would, 
 perhaps, despise him the more for it, such as were virtuous and wise, 
 and loved business themselves, would think never the worse of him. He 
 had no revenues settled upon him for the support of his dignity, and he 
 was desirous not to be burdensome to the people, for which reason, like 
 Paul, he worked with his hands; for, if he neglect his domestic 
 affairs, how must he maintain himself and his family?  Solomon gives it 
 as a reason why men should look well to their herds because <I>the 
 crown doth not endure to every generation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:23,24">Prov. xxvii. 23, 24</A>.

 Saul's did not; he must therefore provide something surer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His concern for his neighbours. When he perceived them in tears, he 
 asked, "<I>What ails the people that they weep?</I> Let me know, that, 
 if it be a grievance which can be redressed, I may help them, and that, 
 if not, I may weep with them." Good magistrates are in pain if their 
 subjects are in tears.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His zeal for the safety and honour of Israel. When he heard of the 
 insolence of the Ammonites, and the distress of a city, a mother in 
 Israel, <I>the Spirit of God came upon him,</I> and put great thoughts 
 into his mind, <I>and his anger was kindled greatly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He was angry at the insolence of the Ammonites, angry at the mean and
 sneaking spirit of the men of Jabesh-Gilead, angry that they had not 
 sent him notice sooner of the Ammonites' descent and the extremity they 
 were likely to be reduced to. He was angry to see his neighbours 
 weeping, when it was fitter for them to be preparing for war. It was a 
 brave and generous fire that was now kindled in the breast of Saul, and 
 such as became his high station.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The authority and power he exerted upon this important occasion. He 
 soon let Israel know that, though he had retired to his privacy, he had 
 a care for the public, and knew how to command men into the field, as 
 well as how to drive cattle out of the field, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:5,7"><I>v.</I> 5, 7</A>.

 He sent a summons to all the coasts of Israel, to show the extent of
 his power beyond his own tribe, even to all the tribes, and ordered all 
 the military men forthwith to appear in arms at a general rendezvous in 
 Bezek. Observe,

 1. His modesty, in joining Samuel in commission with himself. He would
 not execute the office of a king without a due regard to that of a 
 prophet. 

 2. His mildness in the penalty threatened against those that should
 disobey his orders. He hews a yoke of oxen in pieces, and sends the 
 pieces to the several cities of Israel, threatening, with respect to 
 him who should decline the public service, not, "Thus shall it be done 
 to <I>him,</I>" but, "Thus shall it be done to his <I>oxen.</I>" God 
 had threatened it as a great judgment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:31">Deut. xxviii. 31</A>),
 
 <I>Thy ox shall be slain before thy eyes, and thou shalt not eat
 thereof.</I> It was necessary that the command should be enforced with 
 some penalty, but this was not nearly so severe as that which was 
 affixed to a similar order by the whole congregation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+21:5">Judg. xxi. 5</A>.

 Saul wished to show that his government was more gentle than that which
 they had been under. The effect of this summons was that the militia, 
 or trained bands, of the nation, <I>came out as one man,</I> and the 
 reason given is, because <I>the fear of the Lord fell upon them.</I> 
 Saul did not affect to make them fear him, but they were influenced to 
 observe his orders by the fear of God and a regard to him who had made 
 Saul their king and them members one of another.  Note, Religion and 
 the fear of God will make men good subjects, good soldiers, and good 
 friends to the public interests of the country. Those that fear God 
 will make conscience of their duty to all men, particularly to their 
 rulers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. His prudent proceedings in this great affair, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He numbered those that came in to him, that he might know his own
 strength, and how to distribute his forces in the best manner their 
 numbers would allow.  It is the honour of princes to know the number of 
 their men, but it is the honour of the King of kings that <I>there is 
 not any number of his armies,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+25:3">Job xxv. 3</A>.

 In this muster, it seems, Judah, though numbered by itself, made no
 great figure; for, as it was one tribe of twelve, so it was but an 
 eleventh part of the whole number, 30,330, though the rendezvous was at 
 Bezek, in that tribe. They wanted the numbers, or the courage, or the 
 zeal for which that tribe used to be famous; so low was it, just before 
 the sceptre was brought into it in David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. His faith and confidence, and (grounded thereon) his courage and 
 resolution, in this enterprise. It should seem that those very 
 messengers who brought the tidings from Jabesh-Gilead Saul sent into 
 the country to raise the militia, who would be sure to be faithful and 
 careful in their own business, and them he now sends back to their 
 distressed countrymen, with this assurance (in which, it is probable, 
 Samuel encouraged him): "<I>To-morrow,</I> by such an hour, before the 
 enemy can pretend that the seven days have expired, <I>you shall have 
 deliverance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Be you ready to do your part, and we will not fail to do ours. Do you
 sally out upon the besiegers, while we surround them." Saul knew he had 
 a just cause, a clear call, and God on his side, and therefore doubted 
 not of success. This was good news to the besieged Gileadites, whose 
 right eyes had wept themselves dry for their calamities, and now began 
 to fail with looking for relief and to ache in expectation of the doom 
 of the ensuing day, when they must look their last; the greater the 
 exigence the more welcome the deliverance.  When they heard it they 
 were glad, relying on the assurances that were sent to them. And they 
 sent into the enemies' camp

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 to tell them that next day they would be ready to meet them, which the
 enemies understood as an intimation that they despaired of relief, and 
 so were made the more secure by it. If they took not care, by sending 
 out scouts, to rectify their own mistake, they must thank themselves if 
 they were surprised: the besieged were under no obligation to give them 
 notice of the help they were assured of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. His industry and close application to this business. If he had 
 been bred up to war from his youth, and had led regiments as often as 
 he had followed droves, he could not have gone about an affair of this 
 nature more dexterously nor more diligently. When the Spirit of the 
 Lord comes upon men it will make them expert even without experience. A 
 vast army (especially in comparison with the present usage) Saul had 
 now at his foot, and a long march before him, nearly sixty miles, and 
 over Jordan too.  No cavalry in his army, but all infantry, which he 
 divides into three battalions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 And observe,

 1. With what incredible swiftness he flew to the enemy. In a day and a
 night he came to the place of action, where his own fate, and that of 
 Israel, must be determined. He had passed his word, and would not break 
 it; nay, he was better than his word, for he promised help next day, 
 <I>by that time the sun was hot</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 but brought it before day, <I>in the morning-watch,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Whom God helps he <I>helps right early,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:5">Ps. xlvi. 5</A>.

 2. With what incredible bravery he flew upon the enemy.  Betimes in the
 morning, when they lay dreaming of the triumphs they expected that day 
 over the miserable inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead, before they were aware 
 he was in the midst of their host; and his men, being marched against 
 them in three columns, surrounded them on every side, so that they 
 could have neither heart nor time to make head against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> To complete his honour, God crowned all these virtues 
 with success. Jabesh-Gilead was rescued, and the Ammonites were totally 
 routed; he had now the day before him to complete his victory in, and 
 so complete a victory it was that those who remained, after a great 
 slaughter, were scattered so that <I>two of them were not left 
 together</I> to encourage or help one another, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 We may suppose that Saul was the more vigorous in this matter,

 1. Because there was some alliance between the tribe of Benjamin and
 the city of Jabesh-Gilead. That city had declined joining with the rest 
 of the Israelites to destroy Gibeah, which was then punished as their 
 crime, but perhaps was now remembered as their kindness, when Saul of 
 Gibeah came with so much readiness and resolution to relieve 
 Jabesh-Gilead.  Yet that was not all; two-thirds of the Benjamites that 
 then remained were provided with wives from that city

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+21:14">Judg. xxi. 14</A>),

 so that most of the mothers of Benjamin were daughters of
 Jabesh-Gilead, for which city Saul, being a Benjamite, had therefore a 
 particular kindness; and we find they returned his kindness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+31:11,12"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 11, 12</A>.

 2. Because it was the Ammonites' invasion that induced the people to
 desire a king (so Samuel says, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+12:12"><I>ch.</I> xii. 12</A>),

 so that if he had not done his part, in this expedition, he would have
 disappointed their expectations, and for ever forfeited their 
 respect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  And the people said unto Samuel, Who <I>is</I> he that said,
 Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to
 death.
 &nbsp; 13 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this
 day: for to day the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath wrought salvation in Israel.
 &nbsp; 14 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to
 Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.
 &nbsp; 15 And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul
 king before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed
 sacrifices of peace offerings before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and there Saul and
 all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the improvement of the glorious victory which Saul had 
 obtained, not the improvement of it abroad, though we take it for 
 granted that the men of Jabesh-Gilead, having so narrowly saved their 
 right eyes, would with them now discern the opportunity they had of 
 avenging themselves upon these cruel enemies and disabling them from 
 ever straitening them in like manner again; now shall they be avenged 
 on the Ammonites for their right eyes condemned, as Samson on the 
 Philistines for his two eyes put out, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+16:28">Judg. xvi. 28</A>.

 But the account here given is of the improvement of this victory at
 home.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The people took this occasion to show their jealousy for the honour 
 of Saul, and their resentment of the indignities done him. Samuel, it 
 seems, was present, if not in the action (it was too far for him to 
 march) yet to meet them when they returned victorious; and to him, as 
 judge, the motion was made (for they knew Saul would not be judge in 
 his own cause) that the sons of Belial that would not have him to reign 
 over them should be brought forth and slain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Saul's good fortune (as foolish men commonly call it) went further with
 them to confirm his title than either his choice by lot or Samuel's 
 anointing him. They had not courage thus to move for the prosecution of 
 those that opposed him when he himself looked mean, but, now that his 
 victory made him look great, nothing would serve but they must be put 
 to death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Saul took this occasion to give further proofs of his clemency, 
 for, without waiting for Samuel's answer, he himself quashed the motion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>There shall not a man be put to death this day,</I> no, not those
 men, those bad men, that had abused him, and therein reflected on God 
 himself, 

 1. Because it was a day of joy and triumph: "<I>To day the Lord has
 wrought salvation in Israel;</I> and, since God has been so good to us 
 all, let us not be harsh one to another. Now that God has made the 
 heart of Israel in general so glad, let not us make sad the hearts of 
 any particular Israelites." 

 2. Because he hoped they were by this day's work brought to a better
 temper, were now convinced that this man, under God, could save them, 
 now honoured him whom before they had despised; and, if they are but 
 reclaimed, he is secured from receiving any disturbance by them, and 
 therefore his point is gained.  If an enemy be made a friend, that will 
 be more to our advantage than to have him slain. And all good princes 
 consider that their power is for edification, not for destruction.</P>

 III. Samuel took this occasion to call the people together <I>before 
 the Lord in Gilgal,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 1. That they might publicly give God thanks for their late victory.
 There they <I>rejoiced greatly,</I> and, that God might have the praise 
 of that which they had the comfort of, they <I>sacrificed to him,</I> 
 as the giver of all their successes, <I>sacrifices of 
 peace-offerings.</I> 

 2. That they might confirm Saul in the government, more solemnly than
 had been yet done, that he might not retire again to his obscurity. 
 Samuel would have the kingdom renewed; he would renew his resignation, 
 and the people should renew their approbation, and so in concurrence 
 with, or rather in attendance upon, the divine nomination, they made 
 Saul king, making it their own act and deed to submit to him.</P>
