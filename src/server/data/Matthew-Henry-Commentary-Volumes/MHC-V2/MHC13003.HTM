 Of all the families of Israel none was so illustrious as the family of
 David. That is the family which was mentioned in the foregoing chapter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:15">ver. 15</A>.

 Here we have a full account of it.

 I. David's sons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. His successors in the throne as long as the kingdom continued, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:10-16">ver. 10-16</A>.

 III. The remains of his family in and after the captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:17-24">ver. 17-24</A>.
 
 From this family, "as concerning the flesh, Christ came."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now these were the sons of David, which were born unto him in
 Hebron; the firstborn Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; the
 second Daniel, of Abigail the Carmelitess:
 &nbsp; 2  The third, Absalom the son of Maachah the daughter of Talmai
 king of Geshur: the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith:
 &nbsp; 3  The fifth, Shephatiah of Abital: the sixth, Ithream by Eglah
 his wife.
 &nbsp; 4  <I>These</I> six were born unto him in Hebron; and there he
 reigned seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned
 thirty and three years.
 &nbsp; 5  And these were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and
 Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bath-shua the daughter
 of Ammiel:
 &nbsp; 6  Ibhar also, and Elishama, and Eliphelet,
 &nbsp; 7  And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,
 &nbsp; 8  And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet, nine.
 &nbsp; 9  <I>These were</I> all the sons of David, beside the sons of the
 concubines, and Tamar their sister.

 We had an account of David's sons, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:2-5,5:14-16">2 Sam. iii. 2, &c., and v. 14</A>,

 &c. 

 1. He had many sons; and no doubt wrote as he thought, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:5">Ps. cxxvii. 5</A>.
 
 <I>Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of</I> these arrows.

 2.  Some of them were a grief to him, as Amnon, Absalom, and Adonijah;
 and we do not read of any of them that imitated his piety or devotion 
 except Solomon, and he came far short of it. 

 3. One of them, which Bath-sheba bore to him, he called Nathan,
 probably in honour of Nathan the prophet, who reproved him for his sin 
 in that matter and was instrumental to bring him to repentance. It 
 seems he loved him the better for it as long as he lived. It is wisdom 
 to esteem those our best friends that deal faithfully with us. From 
 this son of David our Lord Jesus descended, as appears

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:31">Luke iii. 31</A>.

 4. Here are two Elishamas, and two Eliphelets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:6,8"><I>v.</I> 6, 8</A>.

 Probably the two former were dead, and therefore David called two more
 by their names, which he would not have done if there had been any ill 
 omen in this practice as some fancy.

 5.  David had many concubines; but their children are not named, as not
 worthy of the honour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 the rather because the concubines had dealt treacherously with David in
 the affair of Absalom. 

 6. Of all David's sons Solomon was chosen to succeed him, perhaps not
 for any personal merits (his wisdom was God's gift), but so, <I>Father, 
 because it seemed good unto thee.</I></P>

 David having nineteen sons, we may suppose them to have raised many 
 noble families in Israel whom we never hear of in the history. But the 
 scripture gives us an account only of the descendants of Solomon here, 
 and of Nathan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:31">Luke iii.</A>

 The rest had the honour to be the sons of David; but these only had the
 honour to be related to the Messiah. The sons of Nathan were his 
 fathers as man, the sons of Solomon his predecessors as king. We have 
 here, 

 1. The great and celebrated names by which the line of David is drawn
 down to the captivity, the kings of Judah in a lineal succession, the 
 history of whom we have had at large in the two books of Kings and 
 shall meet with again in the second book of Chronicles.  Seldom has a 
 crown gone in a direct line from father to son for seventeen descents 
 together, as here. This was the recompence of David's piety. About the 
 time of the captivity the lineal descent was interrupted, and the crown 
 went from one brother to another and from a nephew to an uncle, which 
 was a presage of the eclipsing of the glory of that house. 

 2. The less famous, and most of them very obscure, names, in which the
 house of David subsisted after the captivity. The only famous man of 
 that house that we meet with at their return from captivity was 
 Zerubbabel, elsewhere called <I>the son of Salathiel,</I> but appearing 
 here to be his grandson

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:17-19"><I>v.</I> 17-19</A>),

 which is usual in scripture. Belshazzar is called <I>Nebuchadnezzar's
 son,</I> but was his grandson. Salathiel is said to be <I>the son</I> 
 of Jeconiah because adopted by him, and because, as some think, he 
 succeeded him in the dignity to which he was restored by Evil-merodach. 
 Otherwise Jeconiah was written childless: he was <I>the signet God 
 plucked from his right hand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:24">Jer. xxii. 24</A>),

 and in his room Zerubbabel was placed, and therefore God saith to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:23">Hag. ii. 23</A>),

 <I>I will make thee as a signet.</I> The posterity of Zerubbabel here
 bear not the same names that they do in the genealogies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:1-17,Lu+3:23-38">Matt. i., or Luke iii.</A>),

 but those no doubt were taken from the then herald's office, the public
 registers which the priests kept of all the families of Judah, 
 especially that of David. The last person named in this chapter is 
 Anani, of whom bishop Patrick says that the Targum adds these words, 
 <I>He is the king Messiah, who is to be revealed,</I> and some of the 
 Jewish writers give this reason, because it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:13">Dan. vii. 13</A>),

 the son of man came <I>gnim gnanani--with the clouds of heaven.</I> The
 reason indeed is very foreign and far-fetched; but that learned man 
 thinks it may be made use of as an evidence that their minds were 
 always full of the thoughts of the Messiah and that they expected it 
 would not be very long after the days of Zerubbabel before the set time 
 of his approach would come.</P>
