 This chapter intimates to us that one end of recording all these
 genealogies was to direct the Jews, now that they had returned out of
 captivity, with whom to incorporate and where to reside; for here we
 have an account of those who first took possession of Jerusalem after
 their return from Babylon, and began the rebuilding of it upon the old
 foundation. 
 
 I. The Israelites,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:2-9">ver. 2-9</A>.

 II. The priests,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:10-13">ver. 10-13</A>.

 III. The Levites and other Nethinim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:14-26">ver. 14-26</A>.

 IV. Here is the particular charge of some of the priests and Levites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:27-34">ver. 27-34</A>.

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they
 <I>were</I> written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah,
 <I>who</I> were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.
 &nbsp; 2  Now the first inhabitants that <I>dwelt</I> in their possessions
 in their cities <I>were,</I> the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and
 the Nethinims.
 &nbsp; 3  And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the
 children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and
 Manasseh;
 &nbsp; 4  Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri,
 the son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah.
 &nbsp; 5  And of the Shilonites; Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons.
 &nbsp; 6  And of the sons of Zerah; Jeuel, and their brethren, six
 hundred and ninety.
 &nbsp; 7  And of the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of Meshullam, the
 son of Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah,
 &nbsp; 8  And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, the
 son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephathiah, the son of
 Reuel, the son of Ibnijah;
 &nbsp; 9  And their brethren, according to their generations, nine
 hundred and fifty and six. All these men <I>were</I> chief of the
 fathers in the house of their fathers.
 &nbsp; 10  And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin,
 &nbsp; 11  And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the
 son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler
 of the house of God;
 &nbsp; 12  And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of
 Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the
 son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer;
 &nbsp; 13  And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a
 thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for the
 work of the service of the house of God.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:1">The first verse</A>

 looks back upon the foregoing genealogies, and tells us they were
 gathered out of <I>the books of the kings of Israel and Judah,</I> not 
 that which we have in the canon of scripture, but another civil record, 
 which was authentic, as the king's books with us.  Mentioning Israel 
 and Judah, the historian takes notice of their being <I>carried away to 
 Babylon for their transgression.</I> Let that judgment never be 
 forgotten, but ever be remembered, for warning to posterity to take 
 heed of those sins that brought it upon them.  Whenever we speak of any 
 calamity that has befallen us, it is good to add this, "it was for my 
 transgression," that God may be justified and clear when he judges. 
 Then follows an account of the first inhabitants, after their return 
 from captivity, that dwelt in their cities, especially in Jerusalem. 

 1.  The Israelites. That general name is used

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 because with those of Judah and Benjamin there were many of Ephraim and
 Manasseh, and the other ten tribes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 such as had escaped to Judah when the body of the ten tribes were
 carried captive or returned to Judah upon the revolutions in Assyria, 
 and so went into captivity with them, or met them when they were in 
 Babylon, associated with them, and so shared in the benefit of their 
 enlargement. It was foretold that the <I>children of Judah and of 
 Israel</I> should be <I>gathered together and come up out of the 
 land</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:11">Hos. i. 11</A>),

 and that they should be one nation again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:22">Ezek. xxxvii. 22</A>.

 Trouble drives those together that have been at variance; and the
 pieces of metal that had been separated will run together again when 
 melted in the same crucible. Many both of Judah and Israel staid behind 
 in captivity; but some of both, whose spirit God stirred up, enquired 
 the way to Zion again. Divers are here named, and many more numbered, 
 who were <I>chief of the fathers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 who ought to be remembered with honour, as Israelites indeed. 2. The
 priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It was their praise that they came with the first. Who should lead in a
 good work if the priests, the Lord's ministers, do not? It was the 
 people's praise that they would not come without them; for who but the 
 priests should keep knowledge?  Who but the priests should bless them 
 in the name of the Lord?

 (1.) It is said of one of them that he was <I>the ruler of the house of
 God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 not the chief ruler, for Joshua was then the high priest, but the
 sagan, and the next under him, his deputy, who perhaps applied more 
 diligently to the business than the high priest himself. In the house 
 of God it is requisite that there be rulers, not to make new laws, but 
 to take care that the laws of God be duly observed by priests as well 
 as people.

 (2.) It is said of many of them that they were <I>very able men for the
 service of the house of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 In the house of God there is service to be done, constant service; and
 it is well for the church when those are employed in that service who 
 are qualified for it, <I>able ministers of the New Testament,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:6">2 Cor. iii. 6</A>.

 The service of the temple was such as required at all times, especially
 in this critical juncture, when they had newly come out of Babylon, 
 great courage and vigour of mind, as well as strength of body; and 
 therefore they are praised as <I>mighty men of valour.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of
 Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;
 &nbsp; 15  And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of
 Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;
 &nbsp; 16  And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son
 of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah,
 that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.
 &nbsp; 17  And the porters <I>were,</I> Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and
 Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum <I>was</I> the chief;
 &nbsp; 18  Who hitherto <I>waited</I> in the king's gate eastward: they
 <I>were</I> porters in the companies of the children of Levi.
 &nbsp; 19  And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of
 Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the
 Korahites, <I>were</I> over the work of the service, keepers of the
 gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, <I>being</I> over the host
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>were</I> keepers of the entry.
 &nbsp; 20  And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in
 time past, <I>and</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>was</I> with him.
 &nbsp; 21  <I>And</I> Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah <I>was</I> porter of the
 door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
 &nbsp; 22  All these <I>which were</I> chosen to be porters in the gates
 <I>were</I> two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their
 genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did
 ordain in their set office.
 &nbsp; 23  So they and their children <I>had</I> the oversight of the gates
 of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>namely,</I> the house of the tabernacle,
 by wards.
 &nbsp; 24  In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west,
 north, and south.
 &nbsp; 25  And their brethren, <I>which were</I> in their villages, <I>were</I>
 to come after seven days from time to time with them.
 &nbsp; 26  For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in <I>their</I>
 set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the
 house of God.
 &nbsp; 27  And they lodged round about the house of God, because the
 charge <I>was</I> upon them, and the opening thereof every morning
 <I>pertained</I> to them.
 &nbsp; 28  And <I>certain</I> of them had the charge of the ministering
 vessels, that they should bring them in and out by tale.
 &nbsp; 29  <I>Some</I> of them also <I>were</I> appointed to oversee the vessels,
 and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and
 the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.
 &nbsp; 30  And <I>some</I> of the sons of the priests made the ointment of
 the spices.
 &nbsp; 31  And Mattithiah, <I>one</I> of the Levites, who <I>was</I> the
 firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the
 things that were made in the pans.
 &nbsp; 32  And <I>other</I> of their brethren, of the sons of the
 Kohathites, <I>were</I> over the showbread, to prepare <I>it</I> every
 sabbath.
 &nbsp; 33  And these <I>are</I> the singers, chief of the fathers of the
 Levites, <I>who remaining</I> in the chambers <I>were</I> free: for they
 were employed in <I>that</I> work day and night.
 &nbsp; 34  These chief fathers of the Levites <I>were</I> chief throughout
 their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further account of the good posture which the affairs of 
 religion were put into immediately upon the return of the people out of 
 Babylon. They had smarted for their former neglect of ordinances and 
 under the late want of ordinances. Both these considerations made them
 very zealous and forward in setting up the worship of God among them; 
 so they began their worship of God at the right end. Instances hereof 
 we have here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Before the house of the Lord was built they had the house of the 
 tabernacle, a plain and movable tent, which they made use of in the 
 mean time. Those that cannot yet reach to have a temple must not be 
 without a tabernacle, but be thankful for that and make the best of it. 
 Never let God's work be left undone for want of a place to do it 
 in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In allotting to the priests and Levites their respective 
 employments, they had an eye to the model that was drawn up by David, 
 and Samuel the seer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Samuel, in his time, had drawn the scheme of it, and laid the
 foundation, though the ark was then in obscurity, and David afterwards 
 finished it, and both acted by immediate direction from God. Or David, 
 as soon as he was anointed had this matter in his mind and consulted 
 Samuel about it, though he was then in his troubles, and the plan was 
 formed in concert between them. This perhaps had been little regarded 
 for many ages; but now, after a long interruption, it was revived. In 
 dividing the work, they observed these ancient land-marks.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The most of them dwelt at Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 yet there were some that dwelt in the villages

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:16,22"><I>v.</I> 16, 22</A>),

 because, it may be, there was not yet room for them in Jerusalem.
 However they were employed in the service of the tabernacle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>They were to come after seven days from time to time.</I> They had
 their week's attendance in their turns.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Many of the Levites were employed as porters at the gates of the 
 house of God, four chief porters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 and, under them, others, to the number of 212, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 They had the oversight of the gates

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 were keepers of the <I>thresholds,</I> as in the margin
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and keepers of the entry. This seemed a mean office; and yet David
 would rather have it than <I>dwell in the tents of wickedness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:10">Ps. lxxxiv. 10</A>.
 
 Their office was,

 1. To open the doors of God's house every morning

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>)

 and shut them at night. 

 2. To keep off the unclean, and hinder those from thrusting in that
 were forbidden by the law. 

 3. To direct and introduce into the courts of the Lord those that came
 thither to worship, and to show them where to go and what to do, that 
 they might not incur punishment. This required care, and diligence, and 
 constant attendance. Ministers have work to do of this kind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Here is one Phinehas, a son of Eleazar, that is said to be a 
 <I>ruler over them in time past</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 not the famous high priest of that name, but (as is supposed) an
 eminent Levite, of whom it is here said that <I>the Lord was with 
 him,</I> or (as the Chaldee reads it) <I>the Word of the Lord was his 
 helper</I>--the eternal Word, who is <I>Jehovah, the mighty one on whom 
 help is laid.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. It is said of some of them that, because the charge was upon them, 
 <I>they lodged round about the house of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 It is good for ministers to be near their work, that they may give
 themselves wholly to it. The Levites pitched about the tabernacle when 
 they marched through the wilderness. Then they were porters in one 
 sense, bearing the burdens of the sanctuary, now porters in another 
 sense, attending the gates and the doors--in both instances keeping the 
 charge of the sanctuary.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Every one knew his charge. Some were entrusted with the plate, the 
 ministering vessels, to bring them in and out by tale, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Others were appointed to prepare the fine flour, wine, oil, &c., 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.
 
 Others, that were priests, made up the holy anointing oil, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 
 Others took care of the meat-offerings,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Others of the show-bread, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 As in other great houses, so in God's house, the work is likely to be
 done well when every one knows the duty of his place and makes a 
 business of it. God is the God of order: but that which is every body's 
 work will be nobody's work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. The singers <I>were employed in that work day and night,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 They were the <I>chief fathers of the Levites</I> that made a business
 of it, not mean singing-men, that made a trade of it. They remained in 
 the chambers of the temple, that they might closely and constantly 
 attend it, and were therefore excused from all other services. It 
 should seem, some companies were continually singing, at least at 
 stated hours, both day and night. Thus was God continually praised, as 
 it is fit he should be who is continually doing good. Thus devout 
 people might, at any hour, have assistance in their devotion.  Thus was 
 the temple a figure of the heavenly one, where they <I>rest not day nor 
 night</I> from praising God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:8">Rev. iv. 8</A>.

 <I>Blessed are those that dwell in thy house; they will be still
 praising thee.</I></P>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:35-44">These verses</A>

 are the very same with
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+8-29-38"><I>ch.</I> viii. 29-38</A>,

 giving an account of the ancestors of Saul and the posterity of
 Jonathan. <I>There</I> it is the conclusion of the genealogy of 
 Benjamin; <I>here</I> it is an introduction to the story of Saul. We 
 take the repetition as we find it; but if we admit that there are in 
 the originals, especially in these books, some errors of the 
 transcribers, I should be tempted to think this repetition arose from a 
 blunder. Some one, in copying out these genealogies, having written 
 those words, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+9:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>

 (<I>These dwelt in Jerusalem</I>), cast his eye on the same words,

 (<I>These dwelt in Jerusalem</I>), and so went on with what followed
 there, instead of going on with what followed here; and, when he 
 perceived his mistake, was loth to make a blot in his book, and so let
