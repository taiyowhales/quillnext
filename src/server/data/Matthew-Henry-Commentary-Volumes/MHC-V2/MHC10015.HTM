 Absalom's name signifies "the peace of his father," yet he proves his 
 greatest trouble; so often are we disappointed in our expectations from 
 the creature. The sword entailed upon David's house had hitherto been 
 among his children, but now it begins to be drawn against himself, with 
 this aggravation, that he may thank himself for it, for, had he done 
 justice upon the murderer, he would have prevented the traitor. The 
 story of Absalom's rebellion begins with this chapter, but we must go 
 over three or four more before we see the end of it. In this chapter we 
 have, 
 
 I. The arts Absalom used to insinuate himself into the people's
 affections, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. His open avowal of his pretensions to the crown at Hebron, whither
 he went under colour of a vow, and the strong party that appeared for 
 him there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:7-12">ver. 7-12</A>.

 III. The notice brought of this to David, and his flight from Jerusalem
 thereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:13-18">ver. 13-18</A>.

 In his flight we are told, 

 1. What passed between him and Ittai, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:19-22">ver. 19-22</A>.

 2. The concern of the country for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:23">ver. 23</A>.

 3. His conference with Zadok, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:24-29">ver. 24-29</A>.

 4.  His tears and prayers upon this occasion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:30-31">ver. 30-31</A>.

 5. Matters concerted by him with Hushai,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:32-37">ver. 32-37</A>.

 Now the word of God was fulfilled, that he would "raise up evil against
 him out of his own house,"

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him
 chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
 &nbsp; 2 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the
 gate: and it was <I>so,</I> that when any man that had a controversy
 came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and
 said, Of what city <I>art</I> thou? And he said, Thy servant <I>is</I> of
 one of the tribes of Israel.
 &nbsp; 3 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters <I>are</I> good and
 right; but <I>there is</I> no man <I>deputed</I> of the king to hear thee.
 &nbsp; 4 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
 that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me,
 and I would do him justice!
 &nbsp; 5 And it was <I>so,</I> that when any man came nigh <I>to him</I> to do
 him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed
 him.
 &nbsp; 6 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the
 king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of
 Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Absalom is no sooner restored to his place at court than he aims to be 
 in the throne. He that was unhumbled under his troubles became 
 insufferably proud when they were over; and he cannot be content with 
 the honour of being the king's son, and the prospect of being his 
 successor, but he must be king now. His mother was a king's daughter; 
 on that perhaps he valued himself, and despised his father, who was but 
 the son of Jesse. She was the daughter of a heathen king, which made 
 him the less concerned for the peace of Israel. David, in this unhappy 
 issue of that marriage, smarted for his being unequally yoked with an 
 unbeliever. When Absalom was restored to the king's favour, if he had 
 had any sense of gratitude, he would have studied how to oblige his 
 father, and make him easy; but, on the contrary, he meditates how to 
 undermine him, by stealing the hearts of the people from him. Two 
 things recommend a man to popular esteem--greatness and goodness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Absalom looks great, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He had learned of the king of Geshur (what was not allowed to the kings
 of Israel) to multiply horses, which made him look desirable, while his 
 father, on his mule, looked despicable. The people desired a king like 
 the nations; and such a one Absalom will be, appearing in pomp and 
 magnificence, above what had been seen in Jerusalem. Samuel had 
 foretold that this would be <I>the manner of the king:</I> He shall 
 <I>have chariots and horsemen, and some shall run before his 
 chariots</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:11">1 Sam. viii. 11</A>);

 and this is Absalom's manner. Fifty footmen (in rich liveries we may
 suppose) running before him, to give notice of his approach, would 
 highly gratify his pride and the people's foolish fancy. David thinks 
 that this parade is designed only to grace his court, and connives at 
 it.  Those parents know not what they do who indulge a proud humour in 
 their children; for I have seen more young people ruined by pride than 
 by any one lust whatsoever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Absalom will seem very good too, but with a very bad design. Had he 
 proved himself a good son and a good subject, and set himself to serve 
 his father's interest, he would have done his present duty, and shown 
 himself worthy of future honours, after his father's death. Those that 
 know how to obey well know how to rule. But to show how good a judge 
 and how good a king he will be is but to deceive himself and others. 
 Those are good indeed that are good in their own place, not that 
 pretend how good they would be in other people's places. But this is 
 all the goodness we find in Absalom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He wishes that he were a judge in Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He had all the pomp and all the pleasure he could wish, lived as great
 and in as much ease as any man could; yet this will not content him, 
 unless he have power too: <I>O that I were a judge in Israel!</I> He 
 that should himself have been judged to death for murder has the 
 impudence to aim at being a judge of others. We read not of Absalom's 
 wisdom, virtue, or learning in the laws, nor had he given any proofs of 
 his love to justice, but the contrary; yet he wishes he were judge. 
 Note, Those are commonly most ambitious of preferment that are least 
 fit for it; the best qualified are the most modest and self-diffident, 
 while it is no better than the spirit of an Absalom that says, <I>O 
 that I were a judge in Israel!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He takes a very bad course for the accomplishing of his wish. Had he 
 humbly petitioned his father to employ him in the administration of 
 justice, and studied to qualify himself for it (according to the rule, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:21">Exod. xviii. 21</A>),

 no doubt he would have been sure of the next judge's place that fell;
 but this is too mean a post for his proud spirit. It is below him to be 
 subordinate, though to the king his father; he must be supreme or 
 nothing. He wants to be such a judge that every man who has any cause 
 shall come to him: in all causes, and over all persons, he must 
 preside, little thinking what a fatigue this would be to have every man 
 come to him. Moses himself could not bear it. Those know not what power 
 is that grasp at so much, so very much. To gain the power he aims at, 
 he endeavours to instil into the people's minds,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A bad opinion of the present administration, as if the affairs of 
 the kingdom were altogether neglected, and no care taken about them. He 
 got round him all he could that had business at the council-board, 
 enquired what their business was; and, 

 [1.] Upon a slight and general enquiry into their cause, he pronounced
 it good: <I>Thy matters are right.</I> A fit man indeed to be a judge, 
 who would give judgment upon hearing one side only! For he has a bad 
 cause indeed that cannot put a good colour upon it, when he himself has 
 the telling of the story. But, 

 [2.] He told them that it was to no purpose to appeal to the throne:
 "<I>There is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.</I> The king is 
 himself old, and past business, or so taken up with his devotions that 
 he never minds business; his sons are so addicted to their pleasures 
 that, though they have the name of chief rulers, they take no care of 
 the affairs committed to them." He further seems to insinuate what a 
 great want there was of him while he was banished and confined, and how 
 much the public suffered by his exile; what his father said truly in 
 Saul's reign

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:3">Ps. lxxv. 3</A>)

 he says falsely: <I>The land and all the inhabitants of it are
 dissolved,</I> all will go to wreck and ruin, unless <I>I bear up the 
 pillars of it.</I> Every appellant shall be made to believe that he 
 will never have justice done him, unless Absalom be viceroy or 
 lord-justice. It is the way of turbulent, factious, aspiring men, to 
 reproach the government they are under.  <I>Presumptuous are they, 
 self-willed, and not afraid to speak evil of dignities,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:10">2 Pet. ii. 10</A>.

 Even David himself, the best of kings, and his administration, could
 not escape the worst of censures. Those that aim to usurp cry out of 
 grievances, and pretend to design nothing but the redress of them: as 
 Absalom here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) A good opinion of his own fitness to rule. That the people might 
 say, "O that Absalom were a judge!" (and they are apt enough to desire 
 changes), he recommends himself to them, 

 [1.] As very diligent. He rose up early, and appeared in public before
 the rest of the king's sons were stirring, and he stood beside the way 
 of the gate, where the courts of judgment sat, as one mightily 
 concerned to see justice done and public business despatched. 

 [2.] As very inquisitive and prying, and desirous to be acquainted with
 every one's case. He would know of what city every one was that came 
 for judgment, that he might inform himself concerning every part of the 
 kingdom and the state of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 [3.] As very familiar and humble.  If any Israelite offered to do
 obeisance to him he took him and embraced him as a friend. No man's 
 conduct could be more condescending, while his heart was as proud as 
 Lucifer's. Ambitious projects are often carried on by <I>a show of 
 humility,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:23">Col. ii. 23</A>.

 He knew what a grace it puts upon greatness to be affable and
 courteous, and how much it wins upon common people: had he been sincere 
 in it, it would have been his praise; but to fawn upon the people that 
 he might betray them was abominable hypocrisy. <I>He croucheth, and 
 humbleth himself, to draw them into his net,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto
 the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have
 vowed unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, in Hebron.
 &nbsp; 8 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
 saying, If the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem,
 then I will serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and
 went to Hebron.
 &nbsp; 10 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
 saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye
 shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
 &nbsp; 11 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem,
 <I>that were</I> called; and they went in their simplicity, and they
 knew not any thing.
 &nbsp; 12 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's
 counsellor, from his city, <I>even</I> from Giloh, while he offered
 sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people
 increased continually with Absalom.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the breaking out of Absalom's rebellion, which he had long 
 been contriving. It is said to be <I>after forty years,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 But whence it is to be dated we are not told; not from David's
 beginning his reign, for then it would fall in the last year of his 
 life, which is not probable; but either from his first anointing by 
 Samuel seven years before, or rather (I think) from the people's 
 desiring a king, and the first change of the government into a 
 monarchy, which might be about ten years before David began to reign; 
 it is fitly dated thence, to show that the same restless spirit was 
 still working, and still they were given to change: as fond now of a 
 new man as then of a new model.  So it fell about the thirtieth year of 
 David's reign.  Absalom's plot being now ripe for execution,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The place he chose for the rendezvous of his party was Hebron, the 
 place where he was born and where his father began his reign and 
 continued it several years, which would give some advantage to his 
 pretensions. Every one knew Hebron to be a royal city; and it lay in 
 the heart of Judah's lot, in which tribe, probably, he thought his 
 interest strong.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The pretence he had both to go thither and to invite his friends to 
 him there was to offer a sacrifice to God, in performance of a vow he 
 had made during his banishment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 We have cause enough to suspect that he had not made any such vow; it
 does not appear that he was so religiously inclined. But he that stuck 
 not at murder and treason would not make conscience of a lie to serve 
 his purpose. If he said he had made such a vow, nobody could disprove 
 him. Under this pretence,

 1. He got leave of his father to go to Hebron. David would be well
 pleased to hear that his son, in his exile, was so desirous to return 
 to Jerusalem, not only his father's city, but the city of the living 
 God,--that he looked up to God, to bring him back,--that he had vowed, 
 if he were brought back, to serve the Lord, whose service he had 
 hitherto neglected,--and that now, being brought back, he remembered 
 his vow, and resolved to perform it. If he think fit to do it in 
 Hebron, rather than in Sion or Gibeon, the good king is so well pleased 
 with the thing itself that he will not object against his choice of the 
 place. See how willing tender parents are to believe the best 
 concerning their children, and, upon the least indication of good, to 
 hope, even concerning those that have been untoward, that they will 
 repent and reform. But how easy is it for children to take advantage of 
 their good parents' credulity, and to impose upon them with the show of 
 religion, while still they are what they were! David was overjoyed to 
 hear that Absalom inclined to <I>serve the Lord,</I> and therefore 
 readily gave him leave to go to Hebron, and to go thither with 
 solemnity. 

 2. He got a good number of sober substantial citizens to go along with
 him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 There went 200 men, probably of the principal men of Jerusalem, whom he
 invited to join with him in his feast upon his sacrifice; and they went 
 in their simplicity, not in the least suspecting that Absalom had any 
 bad design in this journey. He knew that it was to no purpose to tempt 
 them in to his plot: they were inviolably firm to David. But he drew 
 them in to accompany him, that the common people might think that they 
 were in his interest, and that David was deserted by some of his best 
 friends. Note, It is no new thing for very good men, and very good 
 things, to be made use of by designing men to put a colour upon bad 
 practices. When religion is made a stalking-horse, and sacrifice a 
 shoeing-horn, to sedition and usurpation it is not to be wondered at if 
 some that were well affected to religion, as these followers of Absalom 
 here, are imposed upon by the fallacy, and drawn in to give countenance 
 to that, with their names, which in their heart they abhor, not having 
 known the depths of Satan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The project he laid was to get himself proclaimed king throughout 
 all the tribes of Israel upon a signal given, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Spies were sent abroad, to be ready in every country to receive the
 notice with satisfaction and acclamations of joy, and to make the 
 people believe that the news was both very true and very good, and that 
 they were all concerned to take up arms for their new king. Upon the 
 sudden spreading of this proclamation, "<I>Absalom reigns in 
 Hebron,</I>" some would conclude that David was dead, others that he 
 had resigned: and thus those that were in the secret would draw in many 
 to appear for Absalom, and to come into his assistance, who, if they 
 had rightly understood the matter, would have abhorred the thought of 
 it, but, being drawn in, would adhere to him. See what artifices 
 ambitious men use for the compassing of their ends; and in matters of 
 state, as well as in matters of religion, let us not be forward to 
 believe every spirit, but try the spirits.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The person he especially courted and relied upon in this affair was 
 Ahithophel, a politic thinking man, and one that had a clear head and a 
 great compass of thought, that had been David's counsellor, his guide 
 and his acquaintance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:13">Ps. lv. 13</A>),

 his <I>familiar friend, in whom he trusted, who did eat of his
 bread,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:9">Ps. xli. 9</A>.

 But, upon some disgust of David's against him, or his against David, he
 was banished, or retired from public business, and lived privately in 
 the country. How should a man of such good principles as David, and a 
 man of such corrupt principles as Ahithophel, long agree? A fitter tool 
 Absalom could not find in all the kingdom than one that was so great a 
 statesman, and yet was disaffected to the present ministry. While 
 Absalom was offering his sacrifices, in performance of his pretended 
 vow, he sent for this man. So much was his heart on the projects of his 
 ambition that he could not stay to make an end of his devotion, which 
 showed what his eye was upon in all, and that it was but for a pretence 
 that he made long offerings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The party that joined with him proved at last very considerable. The 
 people increased continually with Absalom, which made the conspiracy 
 strong and formidable. Every one whom he had complimented and caressed 
 (pronouncing his matters right and good, especially if afterwards the 
 cause went against him) not only came himself, but made all the 
 interest he could for him, so that he wanted not for numbers. The 
 majority is no certain rule to judge of equity by. <I>All the world 
 wondered after the beast.</I> Whether Absalom formed this design merely 
 in the height of his ambition and fondness to rule, or whether there 
 was not in it also malice against his father and revenge for his 
 banishment and confinement, though this punishment was so much less 
 than he deserved, does not appear. But, generally, that which aims at 
 the crown aims at the head that wears it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of
 the men of Israel are after Absalom.
 &nbsp; 14 And David said unto all his servants that <I>were</I> with him at
 Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not <I>else</I> escape
 from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly,
 and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the
 sword.
 &nbsp; 15 And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy
 servants <I>are ready to do</I> whatsoever my lord the king shall
 appoint.
 &nbsp; 16 And the king went forth, and all his household after him.
 And the king left ten women, <I>which were</I> concubines, to keep the
 house.
 &nbsp; 17 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and
 tarried in a place that was far off.
 &nbsp; 18 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the
 Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six
 hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the
 king.
 &nbsp; 19 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest
 thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king:
 for thou <I>art</I> a stranger, and also an exile.
 &nbsp; 20 Whereas thou camest <I>but</I> yesterday, should I this day make
 thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return
 thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth <I>be</I> with thee.
 &nbsp; 21 And Ittai answered the king, and said, <I>As</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth,
 and <I>as</I> my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord
 the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will
 thy servant be.
 &nbsp; 22 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the
 Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones
 that <I>were</I> with him.
 &nbsp; 23 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the
 people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook
 Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the
 wilderness.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The notice brought to David of Absalom's rebellion,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 The matter was bad enough, and yet it seems to have been made worse to
 him (as such things commonly are) than really it was; for he was told 
 that <I>the hearts of the men of Israel</I> (that is, the generality of 
 them, at least the leading men) were <I>after Absalom.</I> But David 
 was the more apt to believe it because now he could call to mind the 
 arts that Absalom had used to inveigle them, and perhaps reflected upon 
 it with regret that he had not done more to counterwork him, and secure 
 his own interest, which he had been too confident of. Note, It is the 
 wisdom of princes to make sure of their subjects; for, if they have 
 them, they have their purses, and arms, and all, at their service.</P>

 II. The alarm this gave to David, and the resolutions he came to 
 thereupon. We may well imagine him in a manner thunderstruck, when he 
 heard that the son he loved so dearly, and had been so indulgent to, 
 was so unnaturally and ungratefully in arms against him. Well might he 
 say with Caesar, <B><I>Kai su teknon</I></B>--<I>What, thou my son?</I>
 Let not parents raise their hopes too high from their children, lest 
 they be disappointed. David did not call a council, but, consulting 
 only with God and his own heart, determined immediately to quit 
 Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He took up this strange resolve, so disagreeable to his character as a
 man of courage, either,

 1. As a penitent, submitting to the rod, and lying down under God's
 correcting hand. Conscience now reminded him of his sin in the matter 
 of Uriah, and the sentence he was under for it, which was that <I>evil 
 should arise against him out of his own house.</I> "Now," thinks he, 
 "the word of God begins to be fulfilled, and it is not for me to 
 contend with it or fight against it; God is righteous and I submit." 
 Before unrighteous Absalom he could justify himself and stand it out; 
 but before the righteous God he must condemn himself and yield to his 
 judgments. Thus he <I>accepts the punishment of his iniquity.</I> Or, 

 2. As a politician. Jerusalem was a great city, but not tenable; it
 should seem, by David's prayer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:18">Ps. li. 18</A>),

 that the walls of it were not built up, much less was it regularly
 fortified. It was too large to be garrisoned by so small a force as 
 David had now with him, He had reason to fear that the generality of 
 the inhabitants were too well affected to Absalom to be true to him. 
 Should he fortify himself here, he might lose the country, in which, 
 especially among those that lay furthest from Absalom's tampering, he 
 hoped to have the most friends. And he had such a kindness for 
 Jerusalem that he was loth to make it the seat of war, and expose it to 
 the calamities of a siege; he will rather quit it tamely to the rebels. 
 Note, Good men, when they suffer themselves, care not how few are 
 involved with them in suffering.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His hasty flight from Jerusalem. His servants agreed to the 
 measures he took, faithfully adhered to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and assured him of their inviolable allegiance, whereupon, 

 1. He went out of Jerusalem himself on foot, while his son Absalom had
 chariots and horses. It is not always the best man, nor the best cause, 
 that makes the best figure. See here, not only the servant, but the 
 traitor, on horseback, while the prince, the rightful prince, <I>walks 
 as a servant upon the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:7">Eccl. x. 7</A>.

 Thus he chose to do, to abase himself so much the more under God's
 hand, and in condescension to his friends and followers, with whom he 
 would walk, in token that he would live and die with them.

 2. He took his household with him, his wives and children, that he
 might protect them in this day of danger, and that they might be a 
 comfort to him in this day of grief. Masters of families, in their 
 greatest frights, must not neglect their households.  <I>Ten women,</I> 
 that <I>were concubines,</I> he <I>left</I> behind, <I>to keep the 
 house,</I> thinking that the weakness of their sex would secure them 
 from murder, and their age and relation to him would secure them from 
 rape; but God overruled this for the fulfilling of his word.  

 3. He took his life-guard with him, or band of pensioners, the
 Cherethites and Pelethites, who were under the command of Benaiah, and 
 the Gittites, who were under the command of Ittai, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 These Gittites seem to have been, by birth, Philistines of Gath, who
 came, a regiment of them, 600 in all, to enter themselves in David's 
 service, having known him at Gath, and being greatly in love with him 
 for his virtue and piety, and having embraced the Jews' religion. David 
 made them of his <I>garde du corps--his body-guard,</I> and they 
 adhered to him in his distress. The Son of David <I>found not such 
 great faith in Israel</I> as in a Roman centurion and a woman of 
 Canaan.

 4. As many as would, of the people of Jerusalem, he took with him, and
 made a halt at some distance from the city, to draw them up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He compelled none. Those whose hearts were with Absalom, to Absalom let
 them go, and so shall their doom be: they will soon have enough of him.  
 Christ enlists none but volunteers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His discourse with Ittai the Gittite, who commanded the 
 Philistine-proselytes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. David dissuaded him from going along with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 Though he and his men might be greatly serviceable to him yet,

 (1.) He would try whether he was hearty for him, and not inclined to
 Absalom. He therefore bids him return to his post in Jerusalem, and 
 serve the new king. If he was no more than a soldier of fortune (as we 
 say), he would be for that side which would pay and prefer him best; 
 and to that side let him go.

 (2.) If he was faithful to David, yet David would not have him exposed
 to the fatigues and perils he now counted upon. David's tender spirit 
 cannot bear to think that a stranger and an exile, a proselyte and a 
 new convert, who ought, by all means possible, to be encouraged and 
 made easy, should, at his first coming, meet with such hard usage: 
 "<I>Should I make thee go up and down with us?</I> No, return with thy 
 brethren." Generous souls are more concerned at the share others have 
 in their troubles than at their own. Ittai shall therefore be dismissed 
 with a blessing: <I>Mercy and truth be with thee,</I> that is, God's 
 mercy and truth, mercy according to promise, the promise made to those 
 who renounce other gods and put themselves under the wings off the 
 divine Majesty. This is a very proper pious farewell, when we part with 
 a friend, "<I>Mercy and truth be with thee,</I> and then thou art safe, 
 and mayest be easy, wherever thou art." David's dependence was upon the 
 mercy and truth of God for comfort and happiness, both for himself and 
 his friends; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+61:7">Ps. lxi. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Ittai bravely resolved not to leave him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Where David is, <I>whether in life or death,</I> safe or in peril,
 there will this faithful friend of his be; and he confirms this 
 resolution with an oath, that he might not be tempted to break it.  
 Such a value has he for David, not for the sake of his wealth and 
 greatness (for then he would have deserted him now that he saw him thus 
 reduced), but for the sake of his wisdom and goodness, which were still 
 the same, that, whatever comes of it, he will never leave him. Note, 
 That is a friend indeed who loves at all times, and will adhere to us 
 in adversity. Thus should we cleave to the Son of David with full 
 purpose of heart that <I>neither life nor death shall separate us from 
 his love.</I> </P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The common people's sympathy with David in his affliction. When he 
 and his attendants <I>passed over the brook Kidron</I> (the very same 
 brook that Christ passed over when he entered upon his sufferings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:1">John xviii. 1</A>),

 <I>towards the way of the wilderness,</I> which lay between Jerusalem
 and Jericho, <I>all the country wept with a loud voice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 Cause enough there was for weeping,

 1. To see a prince thus reduced, one that had lived so great forced
 from his palace and in fear of his life, with a small retinue seeking 
 shelter in a desert, to see the city of David, which he himself won, 
 built, and fortified, made an unsafe abode for David himself. It would 
 move the compassion even of strangers to see a man fallen thus low from 
 such a height, and this by the wickedness of his own son; a piteous 
 case it was. Parents that are abused and ruined by their own children 
 merit the tender sympathy of their friends as much as any of the sons 
 or daughters of affliction.  Especially, 

 2. To see their own prince thus wronged, who had been so great a
 blessing to their land, and had not done any thing to forfeit the 
 affections of his people; to see him in this distress, and themselves 
 unable to help him, might well draw floods of tears from their 
 eyes.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites <I>were</I> with him,
 bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark
 of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done
 passing out of the city.
 &nbsp; 25 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into
 the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, he will
 bring me again, and shew me <I>both</I> it, and his habitation:
 &nbsp; 26 But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, <I>here
 am</I> I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.
 &nbsp; 27 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, <I>Art not</I> thou a
 seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you,
 Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
 &nbsp; 28 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until
 there come word from you to certify me.
 &nbsp; 29 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to
 Jerusalem: and they tarried there.
 &nbsp; 30 And David went up by the ascent of <I>mount</I> Olivet, and wept
 as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot:
 and all the people that <I>was</I> with him covered every man his
 head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. The fidelity of the priests and Levites and their firm adherence to 
 David and his interest. They knew David's great affection to them and 
 their office, notwithstanding his failings. The method Absalom took to 
 gain people's affections made no impression upon them; he had little 
 religion in him, and therefore they steadily adhered to David. Zadok 
 and Abiathar, and all the Levites, if he go, will accompany him, and 
 take the ark with them, that, by it, they may ask counsel of God for 
 him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Note, Those that are friends to the ark in their prosperity will find
 it a friend to them in their adversity.  Formerly David would not rest 
 till he had found a resting-place for the ark; and now, if the priests 
 may have their mind, the ark shall not rest till David return to his 
 rest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David's dismission of them back into the city,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 Abiathar was high priest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:35">1 Kings ii. 35</A>),

 but Zadok was his assistant, and attended the ark most closely, while
 Abiathar was active in public business, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Therefore David directs his speech to Zadok, and an excellent speech it
 is, and shows him to be in a very good frame under his affliction, and 
 that still he holds fast his integrity.

 1. He is very solicitous for the safety of the ark: "By all means
 <I>carry the ark back into the city,</I> let not that be unsettled and 
 exposed with me, lodge that again in the tent pitched for it; surely 
 Absalom, bad as he is, will do that no harm." David's heart, like Eli's 
 trembles for the ark of God. Note, It argues a good principle to be 
 more concerned for the church's prosperity than for our own, to 
 <I>prefer Jerusalem</I> before our <I>chief joy</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:6">Ps. cxxxvii. 6</A>),

 the success of the gospel, and the flourishing of the church, above our
 own wealth, credit, ease, and safety, even when they are most in 
 hazard. 

 2. He is very desirous to return to the enjoyment of the privileges of
 God's house. He will reckon it the greatest instance of God's favour to 
 him if he may but once more be brought back to see it and his 
 habitation. This will be more his joy than to be brought back to his 
 own palace and throne again. Note, Gracious souls measure their 
 comforts and conveniences in this world by the opportunity they give 
 them of communion with God.  Hezekiah wished for the recovery of his 
 health for this reason, that he might <I>go up to the house of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:22">Isa. xxxviii. 22</A>.

 3. He is very submissive to the holy will of God concerning the issue
 of this dark dispensation. He hopes the best

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 and hopes for it from the favour of God, which he looks upon to be the
 fountain of all good: "If God favour me so far, I shall be settled 
 again as formerly." But he provides for the worst: "If he deny me this 
 favour--if he thus say, <I>I have no delight in thee</I>--I know I 
 deserve the continuance of his displeasure; his holy will be done." See 
 him here patiently awaiting the event: "<I>Behold, here am I,</I> as a 
 servant expecting orders;" and see him willing to commit himself to God 
 concerning it: "<I>Let him do to me as seemeth good to him.</I> I have 
 nothing to object.  All is well that God does." Observe with what 
 satisfaction and holy complacency he speaks of the divine disposal: not 
 only, "He can do what he will," subscribing to his power

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:12">Job ix. 12</A>),
 
 or, "He has a right to do what he will," subscribing to his sovereignty
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:13">Job xxxiii. 13</A>),

 or, "He will do what he will," subscribing to his unchangeableness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:13,15">Job xxiii. 13, 15</A>),

 but, "<I>Let him to what he will,</I>" subscribing to his wisdom and
 goodness. Note, It is our interest, as well as duty, cheerfully to 
 acquiesce in the will of God, whatever befals us. That we may not 
 complain of what is, let us see God's hand in all events; and, that we 
 may not be afraid of what shall be, let us see all events in God's 
 hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The confidence David put in the priests that they would serve his 
 interest to the utmost of their power in his absence. He calls Zadok a 
 <I>seer</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 that is, a wise man, a man that can see into business and discern time
 and judgment: "Thou hast thy <I>eyes in thy head</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:14">Eccl. ii. 14</A>),

 and therefore art capable of doing me service, especially by sending me
 intelligence of the enemy's motions and resolutions." One friend that 
 is a seer, in such an exigency as this, was worth twenty that were not 
 so quick-sighted. For the settling of a private correspondence with the 
 priests in his absence, he appoints, 

 1.  Whom they should send to him--their two sons, Ahimaaz and Jonathan,
 whose coat, it might be hoped, would be their protection, and of whose 
 prudence and faithfulness he had probably had experience. 

 2. Whither they should send. He would encamp <I>in the plain of the
 wilderness</I> till he heard from them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 and then would move according to the information and advice they should
 send him. Hereupon they returned to the city, to await the event. It 
 was a pity that any disturbance should be given to a state so happy as 
 this was, when the prince and the priests had such an entire affection 
 for the confidence in each other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The melancholy posture that David and his men put themselves into, 
 when, at the beginning of their march, they went up the <I>mount of 
 Olives,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. David himself, as a deep mourner, covered his head and face for 
 shame and blushing, went bare-foot, as a prisoner or a slave, for 
 mortification, and went weeping. Did it become a man of his reputation 
 for courage and greatness of spirit thus to cry like a child, only for 
 fear of an enemy at a distance, against whom he might easily have made 
 head, and perhaps with one bold stroke have routed him? Yes, it did not 
 ill become him, considering how much there was in this trouble, 

 (1.) Of the unkindness of his son. He could not but weep to think that
 one who came out of his bowels, and had so often lain in his arms, 
 should thus lift up the heel against him. God himself is said to be 
 grieved with the rebellions of his own children

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:10">Ps. xcv. 10</A>)

 and even <I>broken with their whorish heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:9">Ezek. vi. 9</A>.

 (2.) There was much of the displeasure of his God in it. This infused
 the wormwood and gall into the <I>affliction and misery,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:19">Lam. iii. 19</A>.
 
 His sin was <I>ever before him</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:3">Ps. li. 3</A>),

 but never so plain nor ever appearing so black as now. He never wept
 thus when Saul hunted him: but a wounded conscience makes troubles lie 
 heavily, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:4">Ps. xxxviii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When David wept all his company wept likewise, being much affected 
 with his grief and willing to share in it. It is our duty to <I>weep 
 with those that weep,</I> especially our superiors, and those that are 
 better than we; for, <I>if this be done in the green tree, what will be 
 done in the dry?</I> We must weep with those that weep for sin. When 
 Hezekiah humbled himself for his sin all Jerusalem joined with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:26">2 Chron. xxxii. 26</A>.

 To prevent suffering with sinners, let us sorrow with them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  And <I>one</I> told David, saying, Ahithophel <I>is</I> among the
 conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I pray thee,
 turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.
 &nbsp; 32 And it came to pass, that <I>when</I> David was come to the top
 <I>of the mount,</I> where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the
 Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his
 head:
 &nbsp; 33 Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou
 shalt be a burden unto me:
 &nbsp; 34 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will
 be thy servant, O king; <I>as</I> I <I>have been</I> thy father's servant
 hitherto, so <I>will</I> I now also <I>be</I> thy servant: then mayest thou
 for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
 &nbsp; 35 And <I>hast thou</I> not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the
 priests? therefore it shall be, <I>that</I> what thing soever thou
 shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell <I>it</I> to Zadok
 and Abiathar the priests.
 &nbsp; 36 Behold, <I>they have</I> there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz
 Zadok's <I>son,</I> and Jonathan Abiathar's <I>son;</I> and by them ye
 shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.
 &nbsp; 37 So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom
 came into Jerusalem.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Nothing, it seems, appeared to David more threatening in Absalom's plot 
 than that Ahithophel was in it; for one good head, in such a design, is 
 worth a thousand good hands. Absalom was himself no politician, but he 
 had got one entirely in his interest that was, and would be the more 
 dangerous because he had been all along acquainted with David's 
 counsels and affairs; if therefore he can be baffled, Absalom is as 
 good as routed and the head of the conspiracy cut off. This David 
 endeavours to do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By prayer. When he heard that Ahithophel was in the plot he lifted 
 up his heart to God in this short prayer: <I>Lord, turn the counsel of 
 Ahithophel into foolishness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 He had not opportunity for a long prayer, but he was not one of those
 that thought he should be heard for his much speaking. It was a fervent 
 prayer: "<I>Lord, I pray thee,</I> do this." God is well pleased with 
 the importunity of those that come to him with their petitions. David 
 is particular in this prayer; he names the person whose counsels he 
 prays against. God gives us leave, in prayer, to be humbly and 
 reverently free with him, and to mention the particular care, and fear, 
 and grief, that lies heavily upon us. David prayed not against 
 Ahithophel's person, but against his counsel, that God would <I>turn it 
 into foolishness,</I> that, though he was a wise man, he might at this 
 time give foolish counsel, or, if he gave wise counsel, that it might 
 be rejected as foolish, or, if it were followed, that by some 
 providence or other it might be defeated, and not attain the end. David 
 prayed this in a firm belief that God has all hearts in his hand, and 
 tongues too, that, when he pleases, he can <I>take away the 
 understanding of the aged and make the judges fools,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:7,Isa+3:2,3">Job xii. 17; Isa. iii. 2, 3</A>),

 and in hope that God would own and plead his just and injured cause.
 Note, We may pray in faith, and should pray with fervency, that God 
 will turn that counsel into foolishness which is taken against his 
 people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. By policy. We must second our prayer with our endeavours, else we 
 tempt God. It is good service to countermine the policy of the church's 
 enemies. When David came to the top of the mount, he <I>worshipped 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Note, Weeping must not hinder worshipping, but quicken it rather. Now
 he penned the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:1-8">third Psalm</A>,

 as appears by the title; and some think that his singing this was the
 worship he now paid to God.  Just now Providence brought Hushai to him. 
 While he was yet speaking, God heard, and sent him the person that 
 should be instrumental to befool Ahithophel. He came to condole with 
 David on his present trouble, with his coat rent and earth upon his 
 head; but David, having a great deal of confidence in his conduct and 
 faithfulness, resolved to employ him as a spy upon Absalom. He would 
 not take him with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 for he had now more need of soldiers than counsellors, but sent him
 back to Jerusalem, to wait for Absalom's arrival, as a deserter from 
 David, and to offer him his service, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Thus he might insinuate himself into his counsels, and defeat
 Ahithophel, either by dissuading Absalom from following his advice or 
 by discovering it to David, that he might know where to stand upon his 
 guard. How this gross dissimulation, which David put Hushai upon, can 
 be justified, as a stratagem in war, I do not see. The best that can be 
 made of it is that Absalom, if he rebel against his father, must stand 
 upon his guard against all mankind, and, if he will be deceived, let 
 him be deceived.  David recommended Hushai to Zadok and Abiathar, as 
 persons proper to be consulted with

 and to their two sons, as trusty men to be sent on errands to David,

 Hushai, thus instructed, came to Jerusalem

 whither also Absalom soon after came with his forces. How soon do royal
 palaces and royal cities change their masters! But we look for a 
 kingdom which cannot be thus shaken and in the possession of which we 
 cannot be disturbed.</P>
