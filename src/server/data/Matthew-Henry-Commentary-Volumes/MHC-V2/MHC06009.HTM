 Here is in this chapter, 

 I. The impolite confederacy of the kings of Canaan against Israel,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The polite confederacy of the inhabitants of Gibeon with Israel, 

 1.  How it was subtly proposed and petitioned for by the Gibeonites
 pretending to come from a far country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:3-13">ver. 3-13</A>.

 2. How it was unwarily consented to by Joshua and the Israelites, to
 the disgust of the congregation when the fraud was discovered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:14-18">ver. 14-18</A>.

 3. How the matter was adjusted to the satisfaction of all sides, by
 giving these Gibeonites their lives because they had covenanted with 
 them, yet depriving them of their liberties because the covenant was 
 not fairly obtained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:19-27">ver.  19-27</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass, when all the kings which <I>were</I> on this
 side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the
 coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and
 the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the
 Jebusite, heard <I>thereof;</I>
 &nbsp; 2 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua
 and with Israel, with one accord.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hitherto the Canaanites had acted defensively; the Israelites were the 
 aggressors upon Jericho and Ai. But here the kings of Canaan are in
 consultation to attack Israel, and concert matters for a vigorous 
 effort of their united forces to check the progress of their victorious 
 arms. Now, 

 1. It was strange they did not do this sooner. They had notice long
 since of their approach; Israel's design upon Canaan was no secret; one 
 would have expected that a prudent concern for their common safety 
 would put them upon taking some measures to oppose their coming over 
 Jordan, and maintain that pass against them, or to give them a warm 
 reception as soon as they were over. It was strange they did not 
 attempt to raise the siege of Jericho, or at least fall in with the men 
 of Ai, when they had given them a defeat. But they were, either through 
 presumption or despair, wonderfully infatuated and at their wits' end.  
 Many know not the things that belong to their peace till they are 
 hidden from their eyes. 

 2. It was more strange that they did it now.  Now that the conquest of
 Jericho had given such a pregnant proof of God's power, and that of Ai 
 of Israel's policy, one would have thought the end of their 
 consultation should be, not to fight with Israel, but to make peace 
 with them, and to gain the best terms they could for themselves. This 
 would have been their wisdom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:32">Luke xiv. 32</A>),

 but their minds were blinded, and their hearts hardened to their 
 destruction.  Observe, 

 (1.) What induced them now at last to enter upon this consultation. 
 When they <I>heard thereof</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 not only of the conquest of Jericho and Ai, but of the convention of 
 the states of Mount Ebal, of which we have an account immediately 
 before,--when they heard that Joshua, as if he thought himself already 
 completely master of the country, had had all his people together, and 
 had read the laws to them by which they must be governed, and taken 
 their promises to submit to those laws,--then they perceived the 
 Israelites were in good earnest, and thought it was high time for them 
 to bestir themselves.  The pious devotion of God's people sometimes 
 provokes and exasperates their enemies more than any thing else. 

 (2.) How unanimous they were in their resolves. Though they were many 
 kings of different nations, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, &c., 
 doubtless of different interests, and that had often been at variance 
 one with another, yet they determined, <I>nemine 
 contradicente</I>--<I>unanimously,</I> to unite against Israel. O that 
 Israel would learn this of Canaanites, to sacrifice private interests 
 to the public welfare, and to lay aside all animosities among 
 themselves, that they may cordially unite against the common enemies of 
 God's kingdom among men!</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
 unto Jericho and to Ai,
 &nbsp; 4 They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been
 ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine
 bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;
 &nbsp; 5 And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments
 upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry <I>and</I>
 mouldy.
 &nbsp; 6 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said
 unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far
 country: now therefore make ye a league with us.
 &nbsp; 7 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye
 dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?
 &nbsp; 8 And they said unto Joshua, We <I>are</I> thy servants. And Joshua
 said unto them, Who <I>are</I> ye? and from whence come ye?
 &nbsp; 9 And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants
 are come because of the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God: for we have
 heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
 &nbsp; 10 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that
 <I>were</I> beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of
 Bashan, which <I>was</I> at Ashtaroth.
 &nbsp; 11 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country
 spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and
 go to meet them, and say unto them, We <I>are</I> your servants:
 therefore now make ye a league with us.
 &nbsp; 12 This our bread we took hot <I>for</I> our provision out of our
 houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold,
 it is dry, and it is mouldy:
 &nbsp; 13 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, <I>were</I> new; and,
 behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are
 become old by reason of the very long journey.
 &nbsp; 14 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not <I>counsel</I>
 at the mouth of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The Gibeonites desire to make peace with Israel, being alarmed by
 the tidings they heard of the destruction of Jericho,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Other people heard those tidings, and were irritated thereby to make 
 war upon Israel; but the Gibeonites heard them and were induced to make 
 peace with them. Thus the discovery of the glory and grace of God in 
 the gospel is to some a <I>savour of life unto life, but to others a 
 savour of death unto death,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:16">2 Cor. ii. 16</A>.

 The same sun softens wax and hardens clay. I do not remember that we
 read any where of a king of Gibeon. Had their government been at this 
 time in a single person, perhaps his heart would have been too high to 
 yield to Israel, and he would have joined with the rest of the kings 
 against Israel. But these four united cities (mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 seem to have been governed by elders, or senators

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 who consulted the common safety more than their own personal dignity. 
 The inhabitants of Gibeon did well for themselves. We have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The method they took to compass it. They knew that all the 
 inhabitants of the land of Canaan were to be cut off; perhaps they had 
 some spies in the congregation at Ebal, when the law was read, who 
 observed and brought them notice of the command given to Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:1-3">Deut. vii. 1-3</A>),

 that they should <I>show no mercy</I> to the Canaanites, give them no
 quarter in battle, which made them afraid of fighting them, and that 
 they should <I>make no covenant with them,</I> which made them despair 
 of gaining any advantage by treating with them; and therefore there was 
 no way of saving their lives from the sword of Israel unless they 
 could, by disguising themselves, make Joshua believe that they came 
 from some very country, which the Israelites were not commanded to make 
 war upon nor forbidden to <I>make peace with,</I> but were particularly 
 appointed to <I>offer peace to,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:10,15">Deut. xx. 10, 15</A>.

 Unless they could be admitted under this notion, they saw there was but
 one way with them: they must submit to the fate of Jericho and Ai. 
 Though the neighbouring princes <I>knew that all the men thereof were 
 mighty</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:2"><I>ch.</I> x. 2</A>),

 and they knew it themselves, yet they durst not contend with Israel,
 who had an Almighty God on their side. This therefore is the only game 
 they have to play, and observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They play it very artfully and successfully. Never was any such 
 thing more craftily managed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They come under the character of ambassadors from a foreign state, 
 which they thought would please the princes of Israel, and make them 
 proud of the honour of being courted by distant countries: we find 
 Hezekiah fond of those that came to him from a far country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+39:3">Isa. xxxix. 3</A>);
 
 they were not used to be thus courted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They pretended to have undergone the fatigues of a very long 
 journey, and produced what passed for an ocular demonstration of it. It 
 should seem it was then usual for those that undertook long journeys to 
 take with them, as we do now for long voyages, all manner of provision 
 in kind, the country not being furnished as ours is now with houses of 
 entertainment, for the convenience of which, when we have occasion to 
 make use of them, we have reason to be very thankful. Now they here 
 pretended that their provision, when they brought it from home, was 
 fresh and new, but now it appeared to be old and dry, whereas it might 
 well be presumed they had not loitered, but made the best of their way; 
 so that hence it must be inferred that they came, as they said they 
 did, from a very far country: their sacks or portmanteaus were old; the 
 wine was all drunk, and the bottles in which it had been were broken; 
 their shoes and clothes were worse than those of the Israelites in 
 forty years, and their bread was mouldy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>,
 
 and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 Thus God's Israel have often been deceived and imposed upon with a show
 of antiquity. But (as bishop Hall expresses it) <I>errors are never the 
 older for being patched,</I> and so seeming old; but those that will be 
 caught with this Gibeonitish stratagem prove they have not consulted 
 with God. And thus there are those who make themselves poor with the 
 badges of want and distress and yet have great riches 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+13:7">Prov. xiii. 7</A>),

 or at least have no need of relief, by which fraud charity is misplaced
 and diverted from those that are real objects of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) When they were suspected, and more strictly examined as to whence
 they came, they industriously declined telling the name of their 
 country, till the agreement was settled. 

 [1.] The men of Israel suspected a fraud 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Peradventure you dwell among us,</I> and then we may not, we must 
 not, make any league with you." This might have discouraged the 
 Gibeonites from urging the matter any further, concluding that if the 
 peace were made the Israelites would not think themselves obliged to 
 keep it, having thus solemnly protested against it in case they 
 <I>dwelt among them;</I> but, knowing that there was no hope at all if 
 they stood it out, they bravely ventured a submission.  "Who knows but 
 the people of Israel may save us alive, though thus inveigled into a 
 promise; and if we tell them at last we shall but die."

 [2.] Joshua put the questions to them, <I>Who are you? and whence come 
 you?</I> He finds himself concerned to stand upon his guard against 
 secret fraud as well as against open force.  We in our spiritual 
 warfare must <I>stand against the wiles of the devil,</I> remembering 
 he is a subtle serpent as well as a roaring lion. In all leagues of 
 relation and friendship we must first try and then trust, lest we 
 repent at leisure agreements made in haste. 

 [3.] They would not tell whence they came; but still repeat the same 
 thing: <I>We have come from a very far country,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 They will have it thought that it is a country Joshua knows nothing of 
 nor ever heard of, and therefore would be never the wiser if they 
 should tell him the name of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) They profess a respect for the God of Israel, the more to 
 ingratiate themselves with Joshua, and we charitably believe they were 
 sincere in this profession: "<I>We have come because of the name of the 
 Lord thy God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 because of what we have heard of that name, which has convinced us that 
 it is <I>above every name,</I> and because we have a desire towards 
 that name and the remembrance of it, and would gladly come under its 
 protection."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) They fetch their inducements from what had been done some time 
 before in Moses's reign, the tidings whereof might easily be supposed 
 ere this to have reached distant regions, the plagues of Egypt and the 
 destruction of Sihon and Og 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>),

 but prudently say nothing of the destruction of Jericho and Ai (though 
 this was the true inducement, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 because they will have it supposed that they came from home long before 
 those conquests were made. We need not be long to seek for reasons why 
 we should submit to the God of Israel; we may be furnished either with 
 new or old, which we will.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) They make a general submission--<I>We are our servants;</I> and
 humbly sue for a general agreement--<I>Make a league with us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 They insist not upon terms, but will be glad of peace upon any terms; 
 nor will the case admit of delays, lest the fraud be discovered; they 
 would fain have the bargain struck up immediately; if Joshua will but 
 <I>make a league</I> with them, they have all they come for, and they 
 hope their ragged clothes and clouted shoes will be no exception 
 against them. God and Israel reject none for their poverty. But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There is a mixture of good and evil in their conduct. 

 (1.) Their falsehood cannot be justified, nor ought it to be drawn into 
 a precedent. We must not do evil that good may come. Had they owned 
 their country but renounced the idolatries of it, resigning the 
 possession of it to Israel and themselves to the God of Israel, we have 
 reason to think Joshua would have been directed by the oracle of God to 
 spare their lives, and they needed not to have made these pretensions. 
 It is observable that when they had once said, <I>We have come from a 
 far country</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 they found themselves necessitated to say it again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 and to say what was utterly false concerning their bread, their 
 bottles, and their clothes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>),

 for one lie is an inlet to another, and that to a third, and so on. The 
 way of that sin is down-hill. But, 

 (2.) Their faith and prudence are to be greatly commended. Our Lord 
 commended even the unjust steward, because he had done wisely and well 
 for himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:8">Luke xvi. 8</A>.

 In submitting to Israel, they submitted to the God of Israel, which
 implied a renunciation of the god they had served, a resignation to the 
 laws of true religion.  They had heard enough to convince them of the 
 infinite power of the God of Israel, and thence might infer his other 
 perfections of wisdom and goodness; and how can we do better for 
 ourselves than surrender at discretion to infinite wisdom, and cast 
 ourselves upon the mercy of a God of infinite goodness. The submission 
 of these Gibeonites was the more laudable because it was, 

 [1.] Singular. Their neighbours took another course, and expected they 
 should join with them. 

 [2.] Speedy.  They did not stay till Israel had besieged their cities; 
 then it would have been too late to capitulate; but when they were at 
 some distance they desired conditions of peace.  Thy way to avoid a 
 judgment is to meet it by repentance. Let us imitate these Gibeonites, 
 and make our peace with God in the rags of humiliation, godly sorrow, 
 and mortification, so our iniquity shall not be our ruin. Let us be 
 servants to Jesus, our blessed Joshua, and make a league with him and 
 the Israel of God, and we shall live.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with
 them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware
 unto them.
 &nbsp; 16 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had
 made a league with them, that they heard that they <I>were</I> their
 neighbours, and <I>that</I> they dwelt among them.
 &nbsp; 17 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their
 cities on the third day. Now their cities <I>were</I> Gibeon, and
 Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.
 &nbsp; 18 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the
 princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God
 of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.
 &nbsp; 19 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have
 sworn unto them by the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel: now therefore we may
 not touch them.
 &nbsp; 20 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest
 wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.
 &nbsp; 21 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them
 be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation;
 as the princes had promised them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The treaty soon concluded with the Gibeonites,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The thing was not done with much formality, but in short, 

 1. They agreed to let them live, and more the Gibeonites did not ask.
 In a common war this would have been but a small matter to be granted; 
 but in the wars of Canaan, which were to make a general destruction, it 
 was a great favour to a Canaanite to have his <I>life given him for a 
 prey,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+45:5">Jer. xlv. 5</A>.

 2. This agreement was made not by Joshua only, but by the princes of
 the congregation in conjunction with him. Though Joshua had an 
 extraordinary call to the government, and extraordinary qualifications 
 for it, yet he would not act in an affair of this nature without the 
 counsel and concurrence of the princes, who were neither kept in the 
 dark nor kept under foot, but were treated by him as sharers in the 
 government. 

 3. It was ratified by an oath; they swore unto them, not by any of the
 gods of Canaan, but by the God of Israel only,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Those that mean honestly do not startle at assurances, but satisfy 
 those with whom they treat, and glorify God by calling him to witness 
 to the sincerity of their intentions. 

 4. Nothing appears to have been culpable in all this but that it was
 done rashly; they took of their victuals, by which they satisfied 
 themselves that it was indeed old and dry, but did not consider that 
 his was no proof of their bringing it fresh from home; so that, making 
 use of their senses only, but not their reason, <I>they received the 
 men</I> (as the margin reads it) <I>because of their victuals,</I> 
 perceiving perhaps, upon the view and taste of their bread, not only 
 that now it was old, but that it had been fine and very good at first, 
 whence they inferred that they were persons of some quality, and 
 therefore the friendship of their country was not to be despised. But 
 <I>they asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord.</I> They had the 
 Urim and Thummim with them, which they might have advised with in this 
 difficult case, and which would have told them no lie, would have led 
 them into no error; but they relied so much on their own politics that 
 they thought it needless to bring the matter to the oracle. Joshua 
 himself was not altogether without blame herein.  Note, We make more 
 haste than good speed in any business when we stay not to take God 
 along with us, and by the word and prayer to consult him. Many a time 
 we see cause to reflect upon it with regret that such and such an 
 affair miscarried, because we <I>asked not counsel at the mouth of the 
 Lord;</I> would we acknowledge him in all our ways, we should find them 
 more safe, easy, and successful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The fraud soon discovered, by which this league was procured. <I>A 
 lying tongue is but for a moment,</I> and truth will be the daughter of 
 time. Within three days they found, to their great surprise, that the 
 cities which these ambassadors had treated for were very near them, but 
 one night's foot-march from the camp at Gilgal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:9"><I>ch.</I> x. 9</A>.

 Either their own scouts or the parties that sallied out to acquaint
 themselves with the country, or perhaps some deserters that came over 
 to them from the enemy, informed them of the truth in this matter. 
 Those that suffer themselves to be deceived by the wiles of Satan will 
 soon be undeceived to their confusion, and will find that near, even at 
 the door, which they imagined was very far off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The disgust of the congregation at this. They did indeed submit to 
 the restraints which this league laid upon them, and smote not the 
 cities of the Gibeonites, neither slew the persons nor seized the prey; 
 but it vexed them to have their hands thus tied, and they <I>murmured 
 against the princes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 it is to be feared, more from a jealousy for their own profit than from 
 a zeal for the fulfilling of God's command, though some of them perhaps 
 had a regard to that. Many are forward to arraign and censure the 
 actions of princes while they are ignorant of the springs of those 
 actions and are incompetent judges of the reasons of state that govern 
 them. While therefore we are satisfied in general that those who are 
 over us aim at nothing but the public good, and sincerely seek the 
 welfare of their people, we ought to make the best of what they do and 
 not exercise ourselves in things above us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The prudent endeavour of the princes to pacify the discontented 
 congregation, and to accommodate the matter; herein all the princes 
 concurred and were unanimous, which doubtless disposed the people to 
 acquiesce.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They resolved to spare the lives of the Gibeonites, for so they had 
 expressly sworn to do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 to let them live.

 (1.) The oath was lawful, else it had not bound them any more than 
 Herod's oath bound him to cut off John Baptist's head; it is true God 
 had appointed them to destroy all the Canaanites, but the law must be 
 construed, <I>in favorem vit&aelig;--with some tender allowance,</I> to mean 
 those only that stood it out and would not surrender their country to 
 them, and not to bind them so far to put off the sense of honour and 
 humanity as to slay those who had never lifted up a hand against them 
 nor ever would, but before they were reduced to any extremity, or ever 
 attempted any act of hostility, with one consent humbled themselves; 
 the <I>kings of Israel were certainly more merciful kings than to do 
 so</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:31">1 Kings xx. 31</A>),

 and the God of Israel a more merciful God than to order it so. <I>Satis
 est prostrasse leoni--It is enough to have laid the lion prostrate.</I> 
 And besides, the reason of the law is the law; the mischief designed to 
 be prevented by that law was the infecting of the Israelites with their 
 idolatry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:4">Deut. vii. 4</A>.

 But if the Gibeonites renounce their idolatry, and become friends and
 servants to the house of God, the danger is effectually prevented, the 
 reason of the law ceases, and consequently the obligation of it, 
 especially to a thing of this nature. The conversion of sinners shall 
 prevent their ruin. 

 (2.) The oath being lawful, both the princes and the people for whom 
 they transacted were bound by it, bound in conscience, bound in honour 
 to the God of Israel, by whom they had sworn, and whose name would have 
 been blasphemed by the Canaanites if they had violated this oath. They 
 speak as those that <I>feared an oath</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:2">Eccl. ix. 2</A>),

 when they argued thus: <I>We will let them live, lest wrath be upon us,
 because of the oath which we swore,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 He that ratifies a promise with an oath imprecates the divine vengeance
 if he wilfully break his promise, and has reason to expect that divine 
 justice will take him at his word. God is not mocked, and therefore 
 oaths are not to be jested with. The princes would keep their word, 
 
 [1.] Though they lost by it. A citizen of Zion <I>swears to his own
 hurt and changes not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+15:4">Ps. xv. 4</A>.

 Joshua and the princes, when they found it was to their prejudice that
 they had thus bound themselves, did not apply to Eleazar for a 
 dispensation, much less did they pretend that no faith is to be kept 
 with heretics, with Canaanites; no, they were strangers to the modern 
 artifices of the Romish church to elude the most sacred bonds, and even 
 to sanctify perjuries

 [2.] Though the people were uneasy at it, and their discontent might 
 have ended in a mutiny, yet the princes would not violate their 
 engagement to the Gibeonites; we must never be over-awed, either by 
 majesty or multitude, to do a sinful thing, and go against our 
 consciences. 

 [3.] Though they were drawn into this league by a wile, and might have 
 had a very plausible pretence to declare it null and void, yet they 
 adhered to it.  They might have pleaded that though those were the men 
 with whom they exchanged the ratifications, yet these were not the 
 cities intended in the league; they had promised to spare certain 
 cities, without names, that were very far off, and upon the express 
 consideration of their being so; but these were very near, and 
 therefore not the cities that they covenanted with. And many learned 
 men have thought that they were so grossly imposed upon by the 
 Gibeonites that it would have been lawful for them to have recalled 
 their promise, but to preserve their reputation, and to keep up in 
 Israel a veneration of an oath, they would stand to it; but it is plain 
 that they thought themselves indispensably obliged by it, and were 
 apprehensive that the wrath of God would fall upon them if they broke 
 it. And, however their adherence to it might be displeasing to the 
 congregation, it is plain that it was acceptable to God; for when, in 
 pursuance of this league, they undertook the protection of the 
 Gibeonites, God gave them the most glorious victory that ever they had 
 in all their wars

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:1-43"><I>ch.</I> x.</A>),

 and long afterwards severely avenged the wrong Saul did to the
 Gibeonites in violation of this league, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:1">2 Sam.  xxi. 1</A>.

 Let this convince us all how religiously we ought to perform our
 promises, and make good our bargains; and what conscience we ought to 
 make of our words when they are once given. If a covenant obtained by 
 so many lies and deceits might not be broken, shall we think to evade 
 the obligation of those that have been made with all possible honesty 
 and fairness? If the fraud of others will not justify or excuse our 
 falsehood, certainly the honesty of others in dealing with us will 
 aggravate and condemn our dishonesty in dealing with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Though they spared their lives, yet they seized their liberties, and 
 sentenced them to be <I>hewers of wood and drawers of water to the 
 congregation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 By this proposal the discontented congregation was pacified; for,

 (1.) Those who were angry that the Gibeonites lived might be content 
 when they saw them condemned to that which, in the general 
 apprehension, is worse than death, perpetual servitude. 

 (2.) Those who were angry that they were not spoiled might be content 
 when their serving the congregation would be more to the public 
 advantage than their best effects could be; and, in short, the 
 Israelites would be not losers either in honour or profit by this peace 
 with the Gibeonites; convince them of this, and they will be 
 satisfied.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,
 Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We <I>are</I> very far from
 you; when ye dwell among us?
 &nbsp; 23 Now therefore ye <I>are</I> cursed, and there shall none of you
 be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of
 water for the house of my God.
 &nbsp; 24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly
 told thy servants, how that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God commanded his
 servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the
 inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore
 afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.
 &nbsp; 25 And now, behold, we <I>are</I> in thine hand: as it seemeth good
 and right unto thee to do unto us, do.
 &nbsp; 26 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand
 of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.
 &nbsp; 27 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of
 water for the congregation, and for the altar of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, even
 unto this day, in the place which he should choose.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The matter is here settled between Joshua and the Gibeonites, and an 
 explanation of the league agreed upon. We may suppose that now, not the 
 messengers who were first sent, but the elders of Gibeon, and of the 
 cities that were dependent upon it, were themselves present and treated 
 with, that the matter might be fully compromised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Joshua reproves them for their fraud, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 And they excuse it as well as they can, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 1. Joshua gives the reproof very mildly: <I>Wherefore have you beguiled 
 us?</I> He does not load them with any ill names, does not give them 
 any harsh provoking language, does not call them, as they deserved to 
 be called, <I>base liars,</I> but only asks them, <I>Why have you 
 beguiled us?</I> Under the greatest provocations, it is our wisdom and 
 duty to keep our temper, and to bridle our passion; a just cause needs 
 not anger to defend it, and a bad one is made never the better by it. 

 2. They make the best excuse for themselves, that the thing would bear,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 They found by the word of God that sentence of death was passed upon 
 them (the command was to <I>destroy all the inhabitants of the 
 land,</I> without exception), and they found by the works of God 
 already wrought that there was no opposing the execution of this 
 sentence; they considered that God's sovereignty is incontestable, his 
 justice inflexible, his power irresistible, and therefore resolved to 
 try what his mercy was, and found it was not in vain to cast themselves 
 upon it.  They do not go about to justify their lie, but in effect beg 
 pardon for it, pleading it was purely to save their lives that they did 
 it, which every man that finds in himself the force of the law of 
 self-preservation will therefore make great allowances for, especially 
 in such a case as this, where the fear was not merely of the power of 
 man (if that were all, one might flee from that to the divine 
 protection), but of the power of God himself, which they saw engaged 
 against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Joshua condemns them to servitude, as a punishment of their fraud 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 and they submit to the sentence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 and for aught that appears both sides are pleased.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Joshua pronounces them perpetual bondmen. They had purchased their 
 lives with a lie, but, that being no good consideration, he obliges 
 them to hold their lives under the rent and reservation of their 
 continual labours, in hewing wood and drawing water, the meanest and 
 most toilsome employments. Thus their lie was punished; had they dealt 
 fairly and plainly with Israel, perhaps they would have had more 
 honourable conditions granted them, but now, since they gain their 
 lives with ragged clothes and clouted shoes, the badges of servitude, 
 they are condemned for ever to wear such, so must their doom be. And 
 thus the ransom of their lives is paid; dominion is acquired by the 
 preservation of a life that lies at mercy (<I>servus dicitur a
 servando--a servant is so called from the act of saving</I>); they owe
 their service to those to whom they owe their lives. Observe how the 
 judgment is given against them. 

 (1.) Their servitude is made a curse to them. "Now you are cursed with 
 the ancient curse of Canaan," from whom these Hivites descended, <I>a 
 servant of servants shalt thou be,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:25">Gen. ix. 25</A>.

 What shall be done to the false tongue but this? Cursed shall it be.

 (2.) Yet this curse is turned into a blessing; they must be servants, 
 but it shall be for <I>the house of my God.</I> The princes would have 
 them slaves <I>unto all the congregation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:21"><I>v.</I>  21</A>),

 at least they chose to express themselves so, for the pacifying of the 
 people that were discontented; but Joshua mitigates the sentence, both 
 in honour to God and in favour to the Gibeonites: it would be too hard 
 upon them to make them every man's drudge; if they must be <I>hewers of 
 wood and drawers of water,</I> than which there cannot be a greater 
 disparagement, especially to those who are citizens of a royal city, 
 and <I>all mighty men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:2"><I>ch.</I> x. 2</A>),

 yet they shall be so to <I>the house of my God,</I> than which there
 cannot be a greater preferment: David himself could have wished to be a 
 door-keeper there.  Even servile work becomes honourable when it is 
 done for the house of our God and the offices thereof. 

 [1.] They were hereby excluded from the liberties and privileges of 
 true-born Israelites, and a remaining mark of distinction was put upon 
 their posterity throughout all their generations. 

 [2.] They were hereby employed in such services as required their 
 personal attendance upon <I>the altar of God in the place which he 
 should choose</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 which would bring them to the knowledge of the law of God, keep them 
 strictly to that holy religion to which they were proselyted, and 
 prevent their revolt to the idolatries of their fathers.

 [3.] This would be a great advantage to the priests and Levites to have 
 so many, and those mighty men, constant attendants upon them, and 
 engaged by office to do all the drudgery of the tabernacle. A great 
 deal of wood must be hewed for fuel for God's house, not only to keep 
 the fire burning continually upon the altar, but to boil the flesh of 
 the peace-offerings, &c. And a great deal of water must be drawn for 
 the divers washings which the law prescribed.  These and other such 
 servile works, such as washing the vessels, carrying out ashes, 
 sweeping the courts, &c., which otherwise the Levites must have done 
 themselves, these Gibeonites were appointed to do.

 [4.] They were herein servants to the congregation too; for whatever
 promotes and helps forward the worship of God is real service to the 
 commonwealth. It is the interest of every Israelite that the altar of 
 God be well attended. Hereby also the congregation was excused from 
 much of that servile work which perhaps would otherwise have been 
 expected from some of them. God had made a law that the Israelites 
 should never make any of their brethren bondmen; if they had slaves, 
 they must be of the heathen that were round about them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:44">Lev. xxv. 44</A>.

 Now in honour of this law, and of Israel that was honoured by it, God
 would not have the drudgery, no, not of the tabernacle itself, to be 
 done by Israelites, but by Gibeonites, who were afterwards called 
 <I>Nethinim,</I> men given to the Levites, as the Levites were to the 
 priests

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+3:9">Num. iii. 9</A>),
 
 to minister to them in the service of God.

 [5.] This may be looked upon as typifying the admission of the Gentiles
 into the gospel church. Now they were taken in upon their submission to 
 be under-officers, but afterwards God promises that he will <I>take of 
 them for priests and Levites,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:21">Isa.  lxvi. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They submit to this condition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Conscious of a fault in framing a lie whereby to deceive the 
 Israelites, and sensible also how narrowly they escaped with their 
 lives and what a kindness it was to have them spared, they acquiesce in 
 the proposal: <I>Do as it seemeth right unto thee.</I> Better live in 
 servitude, especially such servitude, than not live at all. Those of 
 the very meanest and most despicable condition are described to be 
 <I>hewers of wood and drawers of water,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:11">Deut. xxix. 11</A>.

 But skin for skin, liberty, and labour, and <I>all that a man has, will
 he give for his life,</I> and no ill bargain. Accordingly the matter 
 was determined. 

 (1.) Joshua delivered them out of the hands of the Israelites that they 
 should not be slain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 It seems there were those who would have fallen upon them with the 
 sword if Joshua had not interposed with his authority; but wise 
 generals know when to sheathe the sword, as well as when to draw it.  
 
 (2.) He then delivered them again into the hands of the Israelites to
 be enslaved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 They were not to keep possession of their cities, for we find 
 afterwards that three of them fell to the lot of Benjamin and one to 
 that of Judah; nor were they themselves to be at their own disposal, 
 but, as bishop Patrick thinks, were dispersed into the cities of the 
 priests and Levites, and came up with them in their courses to serve at 
 the altar, out of the profits of which, it is probable, they were 
 maintained. And thus Israel's bondmen became the Lord's freemen, for 
 his service in the meanest office is liberty, and his work is its own 
 wages. And this they got by their early submission.  Let us, in like 
 manner, submit to our Lord Jesus, and refer our lives to him, saying, 
 "<I>We are in thy hand, do unto us as seemeth good and right unto 
 thee;</I> only save our souls, and we shall not repent it:" if he 
 appoint us to bear his cross, and draw in his yoke, and serve at his 
 altar, this shall be afterwards neither shame nor grief to us, while 
 the meanest office in God's service will entitle us to a <I>dwelling in 
 the house of the Lord all the days of our life.</I></P>
