 We have in this chapter an account of the conquest of the kings and 
 kingdoms of the southern part of the land of Canaan, as, in the next 
 chapter, of the reduction of the northern parts, which together 
 completed the glorious successes of the wars of Canaan. In this chapter 
 we have an account, 

 I. Of the routing of their forces in the field, in which observe,

 1. Their confederacy against the Gibeonites,

 2.  The Gibeonites' request to Joshua to assist them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:6">ver. 6</A>.

 3.  Joshua's speeds march under divine encouragement for their relief,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem had
 heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as
 he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her
 king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with
 Israel, and were among them;
 &nbsp; 2 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon <I>was</I> a great city,
 as one of the royal cities, and because it <I>was</I> greater than Ai,
 and all the men thereof <I>were</I> mighty.
 &nbsp; 3 Wherefore Adoni-zedec king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king
 of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king
 of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,
 &nbsp; 4 Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for
 it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 5 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of
 Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of
 Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and
 went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon,
 and made war against it.
 &nbsp; 6 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
 saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us
 quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the
 Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together
 against us.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Joshua and the hosts of Israel had now been a good while in the land of 
 Canaan, and no great matters were effected; they were made masters of 
 Jericho by a miracle, of Ai by stratagem, and of Gibeon by surrender, 
 and that was all; hitherto the progress of their victories had not 
 seemed proportionable to the magnificence of their entry and the glory 
 of their beginnings. Those among them that were impatient of delays, it 
 is probable, complained of Joshua's slowness, and asked why they did 
 not immediately penetrate into the heart of the country, before the 
 enemy could rally their forces to make head against them, why they 
 stood trifling, while they were so confident both of their title and of 
 their success. Thus Joshua's prudence, perhaps, was censured as 
 slothfulness, cowardice, and want of spirit. But, 

 1. Canaan was not to be conquered in a day. God had said that <I>by
 little and little</I> he would drive out the Canaanites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:30">Exod. xxiii. 30</A>.

 He that believeth will not make haste, or conclude that the promise
 will never be performed because it is not performed so soon as he 
 expected. 

 2. Joshua waited for the Canaanites to be the aggressors; let them 
 first make an onset upon Israel, or the allies of Israel, and then 
 their destruction will be, or at least will appear to be, the more just 
 and more justifiable.  Joshua had warrant sufficient to set upon them, 
 yet he stays till they strike the first stroke, that he might provide 
 for honest things in the sight, not only of God, but of men; and they 
 would be the more inexcusable in their resistance, now that they had 
 seen what favour the Gibeonites found with Israel. 

 3. It was for the advantage of Israel to sit still awhile, that the
 forces of these little kings might unite in one body, and so might the 
 more easily be cut off at one blow. This God had in his eye when he put 
 it into their hearts to combine against Israel; though they designed 
 thereby to strengthen one another, that which he intended was to gather 
 them as sheaves into the floor, to fall together under the flail,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:12">Mic. iv. 12</A>.
 
 Thus oftentimes that seeming paradox proves wholesome counsel, <I>Stay
 awhile, and we shall have done the sooner.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After Israel had waited awhile for an occasion to make war upon the 
 Canaanites, a fair one offers itself. 

 1. Five kings combine against the Gibeonites. Adoni-zedec king of
 Jerusalem was the first mover and ring-leader of this confederacy. He 
 had a good name (it signifies <I>lord of righteousness</I>), being a 
 descendant perhaps from Melchizedek, <I>king of righteousness;</I> but, 
 notwithstanding the goodness of his name and family, it seems he was a 
 bad man, and an implacable enemy to the posterity of that Abraham to 
 whom his predecessor, Melchizedek, was such a faithful friend. He 
 called upon his neighbours to join against Israel either because he was 
 the most honourable prince, and had the precedency among these kings 
 (perhaps they had some dependence upon him, at least they paid a 
 deference to him, as the most public, powerful, and active man they had 
 among them), or because he was first or most apprehensive of the danger 
 his country was in, not only by the conquest of Jericho and Ai, but the 
 surrender of Gibeon, which, it seems, was the chief thing that alarmed 
 him, it being one of the most considerable frontier towns they had. 
 Against Gibeon therefore all the force he would raise must be leveled.  
 <I>Come,</I> says he, <I>and help me, that we may smite Gibeon.</I> 
 This he resolves to do, either,

 (1.) In policy, that he might retake the city, because it was a strong 
 city, and of great consequence to this country in whose hands it was; 
 or, 

 (2.) In passion, that he might chastise the citizens for making peace 
 with Joshua, pretending that they had perfidiously betrayed their 
 country and strengthened the common enemy, whereas they had really done 
 the greatest kindness imaginable to their country, by setting them a 
 good example, if they would have followed it. Thus Satan and his 
 instruments make war upon those that make peace with God. <I>Marvel not 
 if the world hate you,</I> and treat those as deserters who are 
 converts to Christ. 

 2.  The Gibeonites send notice to Joshua of the distress and danger
 they are in,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Now they expect benefit from the league they had made with Israel, 
 because, though it was obtained by deceit, it was afterwards confirmed 
 when the truth came out. They think Joshua obliged to help them,

 (1.) In conscience, because they were his servants; not in compliment, 
 as they had said in their first address

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:8"><I>ch.</I> ix. 8</A>),

 <I>We are thy servants,</I> but in reality made servants to the
 congregation; and it is the duty of masters to take care of the poorest 
 and meanest of their servants, and not to see them wronged when it is 
 in the power of their hand to right them. Those that pay allegiance may 
 reasonably expect protection. Thus David pleads with God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:94">Ps. cxix. 94</A>),
 
 <I>I am thine, save me;</I> and so may we, if indeed we be his.

 (2.) In honour, because the ground of their enemies' quarrel with them 
 was the respect they had shown to Israel, and the confidence they had 
 in a covenant with them. Joshua cannot refuse to help them when it is 
 for their affection to him, and to the name of his God, that they are 
 attacked.  David thinks it a good plea with God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:7">Ps. lxix. 7</A>),

 <I>For thy sake I have borne reproach.</I> When our spiritual enemies
 set themselves in array against us, and threaten to swallow us up, let 
 us, by faith and prayer, apply to Christ, our Joshua, for strength and 
 succour, as Paul did, and we shall receive the same answer of peace, 
 <I>My grace is sufficient for thee,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
 with him, and all the mighty men of valour.
 &nbsp; 8 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have
 delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them
 stand before thee.
 &nbsp; 9 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, <I>and</I> went up from
 Gilgal all night.
 &nbsp; 10 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> discomfited them before Israel, and slew them
 with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way
 that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto
 Makkedah.
 &nbsp; 11 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, <I>and</I>
 were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> cast down
 great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died:
 <I>they were</I> more which died with hailstones than <I>they</I> whom the
 children of Israel slew with the sword.
 &nbsp; 12 Then spake Joshua to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the day when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he
 said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon;
 and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.
 &nbsp; 13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the
 people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. <I>Is</I> not this
 written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the
 midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.
 &nbsp; 14 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> fought
 for Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Joshua resolves to assist the Gibeonites, and God encourages him in
 this resolve.

 1. He ascended from Gilgal
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 that is, he designed, determined, and prepared for, this expedition to 
 relieve Gibeon, for it is probable it was before he stirred a step that 
 God spoke to him to encourage him. It was generous and just in Joshua 
 to help his new allies, though perhaps the king of Jerusalem, when he 
 attacked them, little thought that Joshua would be so ready to help 
 them, but expected he would abandon them as Canaanites, the rather 
 because they had obtained their league with him by fraud; therefore he 
 speaks with assurance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 of smiting Gibeon. But Joshua knew that his promise to let them live 
 obliged him, not only not to slay them himself, but not to stand by and 
 see them slain when it was in the power of his hand to prevent it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:11,12">Prov. xxiv. 11, 12</A>.

 He knew that when they embraced the faith and worship of the God of
 Israel they came to trust under the shadow of his wings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:12">Ruth ii. 12</A>),

 and therefore, as his servants, he was bound to protect them. 

 2. God animated him for his undertaking,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Fear not,</I> that is,

 (1.) "Doubt not of the goodness of thy cause and the clearness of thy 
 call; though it be to assist Gibeonites, thou art in the way of duty, 
 and God is with thee of a truth." 

 (2.) "Dread not the power of the enemy; though so many kings are 
 confederate against thee, and are resolved to make their utmost efforts 
 for the reduction of Gibeon, and it may be will fight desperately in a 
 desperate cause, yet let not this discourage thee, <I>I have delivered 
 them into thy hand;</I>" and those can make neither resistance nor 
 escape whom God has marked for destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Joshua applies himself to execute this resolve, and God assists him 
 in the execution. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The great industry of Joshua, and the power of God working with it 
 for the defeat of the enemy. In this action, 

 (1.) Joshua showed his good-will in the haste he made for the relief of 
 Gibeon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>He came unto them suddenly,</I> for the extremity was such as would 
 not admit delay. If one of the tribes of Israel had been in danger, he 
 could not have shown more care or zeal for its relief than here for 
 Gibeon, remembering in this, as in other cases, there must be one law 
 for the stranger that was proselyted and for him that was born in the 
 land. Scarcely had the confederate princes got their forces together, 
 and sat down before Gibeon, when Joshua was upon them, the surprise of 
 which would put them into the greatest confusion. Now that the enemy 
 were actually drawn up into a body, which had all as it were but one 
 neck, despatch was as serviceable to his cause as before delay was, 
 while he waited for this general rendezvous; and now that things were 
 ripe for execution no man more expeditious than Joshua, who before had 
 seemed slow. Now it shall never be said, <I>He left that to be done 
 to-morrow which he could do to-day.</I> When Joshua found he could not 
 reach Gibeon in a day, lest he should lose any real advantages against 
 the enemy, or so much as seem to come short or to neglect his new 
 allies, he marched all night, resolving not to give sleep to his eyes, 
 nor slumber to his eye-lids, till he had accomplished this enterprise.  
 It was well the forces he took with him were mighty men of valour, not 
 only able-bodied men, but men of spirit and resolution, and hearty in 
 the cause, else they neither could nor would have borne this fatigue, 
 but would have murmured at their leader and would have asked, "Is this 
 the rest we were promised in Canaan?" But they well considered that the 
 present toil was in order to a happy settlement, and therefore were 
 reconciled to it. Let the <I>good soldiers of Jesus Christ</I> learn 
 hence to <I>endure hardness, in following the Lamb whithersoever he 
 goes,</I> and not think themselves undone if their religion lose them 
 now and then a night's sleep; it will be enough to rest when we come to 
 heaven. But why needed Joshua to put himself and his men so much to the 
 stretch? Had not God promised him that without fail he would <I>deliver 
 the enemies into his hand?</I> It is true he had; but God's promises 
 are intended, not to slacken and supersede, but to quicken and 
 encourage our endeavours. He that believeth doth not make haste to 
 anticipate providence, but doth make haste to attend it, with a 
 diligent, not a distrustful, speed.  

 (2.) God showed his great power in defeating the enemies whom Joshua so
 vigorously attacked,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.
 
 Joshua had a very numerous and powerful army with him, hands enough to 
 despatch a dispirited enemy, so that the enemy might have been 
 scattered by the ordinary fate of war; but God himself would appear in 
 this great and decisive battle, and draw up the artillery of heaven 
 against the Canaanites, to demonstrate to this people that they <I>got 
 not this land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own 
 arm save them, but God's right hand and his arm,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:3">Ps. xliv. 3</A>.

 <I>The Lord discomfited them before Israel.</I> Israel did what they
 could, and yet God did all.

 [1.] It must needs be a very great terror and confusion to the enemy to 
 perceive that heaven itself fought against them; for who can contest 
 with, flee from, or fence against, the powers of heaven? They had 
 affronted the true God and robbed him of his honour by worshipping the 
 host of heaven, giving that worship to the creature which is due to the 
 Creator only; and now the host of heaven fights against them, and even 
 that part of the creation which they had idolized is at war with them, 
 and even triumphs in their ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:2">Jer.  viii. 2</A>.

 There is no way of making any creature propitious to us, no, not by
 sacrifice nor offering, but only by making our peace with God and 
 keeping ourselves in his love.  This had been enough to make them an 
 easy prey to the victorious Israelites, yet this was not all.

 [2.] Besides the terror struck upon them, there was a great slaughter 
 made of them by hail-stones, which were so large, and came down with 
 such a force, that more were killed by the hail-stones than by the 
 sword of the Israelites, though no doubt they were busy. God himself 
 speaks to Job of treasures, or magazines, of snow and hail, which he 
 has <I>reserved for the day of battle and war</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:22,23">Job xxxviii. 22, 23</A>),

 and here they are made use of to destroy the Canaanites. Here was hail,
 shot from God's great ordnance, that, against whomsoever it was 
 directed, was sure to hit (and never glanced upon the Israelites mixed 
 with them), and wherever it hit was sure to kill. See here how 
 miserable those are that have God for their enemy, and how sure to 
 perish; it is a fearful thing to fall into his hands, for there is no 
 fleeing out of them. Some observe that Beth-horon lay north of Gibeon, 
 Azekah and Makkedah lay south, so that they fled each way but, which 
 way soever they fled, the hail-stones pursued them, and met them at 
 every turn.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The great faith of Joshua, and the power of God crowning it with the 
 miraculous arrest of the sun, that the day of Israel's victories might 
 be prolonged, and so the enemy totally defeated. The hail-stones had 
 their rise no higher than the clouds, but, to show that Israel's help 
 came from above the clouds, the sun itself, who by his constant motion 
 serves the whole earth, by halting when there was occasion served the 
 Israelites, and did them a kindness. <I>The sun and moon stood still in 
 their habitation, at the light of thy arrows</I> which gave the signal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:11">Hab.  iii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is the prayer of Joshua that the sun might stand still. I 
 call it his prayer, because it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 <I>he spoke to the Lord;</I> as Elijah, though we read

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:1">1 Kings xvii. 1</A>)

 only of his prophesying of the drought, yet is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:17">James v. 17</A>)

 to pray for it.  Observe,

 [1.] An instance of Joshua's unwearied activity in the service of God 
 and Israel, that though he had marched all night and fought all day, 
 and, one might expect, would be inclined to repose himself and get a 
 little sleep, and give his army some time to rest--that, like the 
 hireling, he would earnestly desire the shadow, and bid the night 
 welcome, when he had done such a good day's work--yet, instead of this, 
 he wishes for nothing so much as the prolonging of the day. Note, Those 
 that <I>wait on the Lord</I> and work for him <I>shall renew their 
 strength, shall run and not be weary, shall walk and not faint,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:31">Isa. xl. 31</A>.

 [2.] An instance of his great faith in the almighty power of God, as 
 above the power of nature, and able to control and alter the usual 
 course of it. No doubt Joshua had an extraordinary impulse or 
 impression upon his spirit, which he knew to be of divine origin, 
 prompting him to desire that this miracle might be wrought upon this 
 occasion, else it would have been presumption in him to desire or 
 expect; the prayer would not have been granted by the divine power, if 
 it had not been dictated by the divine grace. God wrought this faith in 
 him, and then said, "<I>According to thy faith,</I> and thy prayer of 
 faith, <I>be it unto thee.</I>" It cannot be imagined, however, that 
 such a thing as this should have entered into his mind if God had not 
 put it there; a man would have had a thousand projects in his head for 
 the completing of the victory before he would have thought of desiring 
 the sun to stand still; but even in the Old-Testament saints <I>the 
 Spirit made intercession according to the will of God.</I> What God 
 will give he inclines the hearts of his praying people to ask, and for 
 what he will do he will be enquired of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:37">Ezek. xxxvi. 37</A>.

 Now, <I>First,</I> It looked great for Joshua to say, <I>Sun, stand
 thou still.</I> His ancestor Joseph had indeed dreamed that the sun and 
 moon did homage to him; but who would have thought that, after it had 
 been fulfilled in the figure, it should be again fulfilled in the 
 letter to one of his posterity? The prayer is thus expressed with 
 authority, because it was not an ordinary prayer, such as is directed 
 and supported only by God's common providence or promise, but the 
 prayer of a prophet at this time divinely inspired for this purpose; 
 and yet it intimates to us the prevalency of prayer in general, so far 
 as it is regulated by the word of God, and may remind us of that honour 
 put upon prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:11">Isa. xlv. 11</A>),

 <I>Concerning the work of my hands command you me.</I> He bids the sun
 stand still upon Gibeon, the place of action and the seat of war, 
 intimating that what he designed in this request was the advantage of 
 Israel against their enemies; it is probable that the sun was now 
 declining, and that he did not call for the lengthening out of the day 
 until he observed it hastening towards it period. He does likewise, in 
 the name of the King of kings, arrest the moon, perhaps because it was 
 requisite for the preserving of the harmony and good order of the 
 spheres that the course of the rest of the heavenly bodies should be 
 stayed likewise, otherwise, while the sun shone, he needed not the 
 moon; and here he mentions the valley of Ajalon, which was near to 
 Gibeon, because there he was at that time.  <I>Secondly,</I> It was 
 bold indeed to say so before Israel, and argues a very strong assurance 
 of faith. If the event had not answered the demand, nothing could have 
 been a greater slur upon him; the Israelites would have concluded he 
 was certainly going mad, or he would never have talked so 
 extravagantly. But he knew very well God would own and answer a 
 petition which he himself directed to be drawn up and presented, and 
 therefore was not afraid to say before all Israel, calling them to 
 observe this work of wonder, <I>Sun, stand thou still,</I> for he was 
 confident in him whom he had trusted. He believed the almighty power of 
 God, else he could not have expected that the sun, going on in its 
 strength, driving in a full career, and <I>rejoicing as a strong man to 
 run a race,</I> should be stopped in an instant. He believed the 
 sovereignty of God in the kingdom of nature, else he could not have 
 expected that the established law and course of nature should be 
 changed and interrupted, the ordinances of heaven, and the constant 
 usage according to these ordinances, broken in upon. And he believed 
 God's particular favour to Israel above all people under the sun, else 
 he could not have expected that, to favour them upon an emergency with 
 a double day, he should (which must follow of course) amaze and terrify 
 so great a part of the terrestrial globe with a double night at the 
 same time. It is true, he <I>causeth the sun to shine upon the just and 
 the unjust;</I> but for this once the unjust shall wait for it beyond 
 the usual time, while, in favour to righteous Israel, it stands 
 still.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The wonderful answer to this prayer. No sooner said than done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>The sun stood still, and the moon staid.</I> Notwithstanding the 
 vast distance between the earth and the sun, at the word of Joshua the 
 sun stopped immediately; for the same God that rules in heaven above 
 rules at the same time on this earth, and, when he pleases, even <I>the 
 heavens shall hear the earth,</I> as here. Concerning this great 
 miracle it is here said,

 [1.] <I>That it continued a whole day,</I> that is, the sun continued 
 as long again above the horizon as otherwise it would have done. It is 
 commonly supposed to have been about the middle of summer that this 
 happened, when, in that country, it was about fourteen hours between 
 sun and sun, so that this day was about twenty-eight hours long; yet, 
 if we suppose it to have been at that time of the year when the days 
 are at the shortest, it will be the more probable that Joshua should 
 desire and pray for the prolonging of the day. 

 [2.] That hereby the people had full time to avenge themselves of their 
 enemies, and to give them a total defeat. We often read in history of 
 battles which the night put an end to, the shadows of which favoured 
 the retreat of the conquered; to prevent this advantage to the enemy in 
 their flight, the day was doubled, that the hand of Israel might 
 <I>find out all their enemies;</I> but the eye and hand of God can find 
 them out without the help of the sun's light, for to him <I>the night 
 shineth as the day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:12">Ps. cxxxix. 12</A>.

 Note, Sometimes God completes a great salvation in a little time, and
 makes but one day's work of it.  Perhaps this miracle is alluded to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:6,7">Zech. xiv. 6, 7</A>,

 where the day of God's fighting against the nations is said to be
 <I>one day,</I> and that <I>at evening time it shall be light,</I> as 
 here. And, 

 [3.] That there was <I>never any day like it,</I> before or since, in 
 which God put such an honour upon faith and prayer, and upon Israel's 
 cause; never did he so wonderfully comply with the request of a man, 
 nor so wonderfully fight for his people. 

 [4.] This is said to be written <I>in the book of Jasher,</I> a 
 collection of state-poems, in which the poem made upon this occasion 
 was preserved among the rest; probably the same with that <I>book of 
 the wars of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:14">Num.  xxi. 14</A>),

 which afterwards was continued and carried on by one Jasher.  Those
 words, <I>Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou moon in the 
 valley of Ajalon,</I> sounding metrical, are supposed to be taken from 
 the narrative of this event as it was found in the book of Jasher. Not 
 that the divine testimony of the book of Joshua needed confirmation 
 from the book of Jasher, a human composition; but to those who had that 
 book in their hands it would be of use to compare this history with it, 
 which warrants the appeals the learned make to profane history for 
 corroborating the proofs of the truth of sacred history.

 [5.] But surely this stupendous miracle of the standing still of the 
 sun was intended for something more than merely to give Israel so much 
 the more time to find out and kill their enemies, which, without this, 
 might have been done the next day.  <I>First,</I> God would hereby 
 magnify Joshua

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:7"><I>ch.</I> iii. 7</A>),

 as a particular favourite, and one whom he did delight to honour, being
 a type of him who has all power both in heaven and in earth and whom 
 the winds and the seas obey. <I>Secondly,</I> He would hereby notify to 
 all the world what he was doing for his people Israel here in Canaan; 
 the sun, the eye of the world, must be fixed for some hours upon Gibeon 
 and the valley of Ajalon, as if to contemplate the great works of God 
 there for Israel, and so to engage the children of men to look that 
 way, and to <I>enquire of this wonder done in the land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:31">2 Chron. xxxii. 31</A>.

 Proclamation was hereby made to all the neighbouring nations.  <I>Come,
 behold the works of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:8">Ps.  xlvi. 8</A>),

 and say, <I>What nation is there so great as Israel is, who has God so
 nigh unto them?</I> One would have supposed that this would bring such 
 real ambassadors as the Gibeonites pretended to be from a very far 
 country, to court the friendship of Israel because of the name of the 
 Lord their God.  <I>Thirdly,</I> He would hereby convince and confound 
 those idolaters that worshipped the sun and moon and gave divine 
 honours to them, by demonstrating that they were subject to the command 
 of the God of Israel, and that, as high as they were, he was above 
 them; and thus he would fortify his people against temptations to this 
 idolatry, which he foresaw they would be addicted to

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:19">Deut. iv. 19</A>),

 and which, notwithstanding this, they afterwards corrupted themselves
 with.  <I>Fourthly,</I> This miracle signified (it is the learned 
 bishop Pierson's notion) that in the latter days, when the light of the 
 world was tending towards a light of darkness, the <I>Sun of 
 righteousness,</I> even our Joshua, should arise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:2">Mal. iv. 2</A>),

 give check to the approaching night, and be the true light. To which
 let me add that when Christ conquered our spiritual enemies upon the 
 cross the miracle wrought on the sun was the reverse of this; it was 
 then darkened as if it had gone down at noon, for Christ needed not the 
 light of the sun to carry on his victories: he then made darkness his 
 pavilion. And, <I>Lastly,</I> The arresting of the sun and moon in this 
 day of battle prefigured the turning of the sun into darkness, and the 
 moon into blood, in the last great and terrible day of the Lord.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp
 to Gilgal.
 &nbsp; 16 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at
 Makkedah.
 &nbsp; 17 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid
 in a cave at Makkedah.
 &nbsp; 18 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the
 cave, and set men by it for to keep them:
 &nbsp; 19 And stay ye not, <I>but</I> pursue after your enemies, and smite
 the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities:
 for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God hath delivered them into your hand.
 &nbsp; 20 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel
 had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till
 they were consumed, that the rest <I>which</I> remained of them
 entered into fenced cities.
 &nbsp; 21 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at
 Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the
 children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 22 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out
 those five kings unto me out of the cave.
 &nbsp; 23 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him
 out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the
 king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, <I>and</I> the king of Eglon.
 &nbsp; 24 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto
 Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said
 unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come
 near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came
 near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.
 &nbsp; 25 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be
 strong and of good courage: for thus shall the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> do to all
 your enemies against whom ye fight.
 &nbsp; 26 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged
 them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until
 the evening.
 &nbsp; 27 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the
 sun, <I>that</I> Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the
 trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and
 laid great stones in the cave's mouth, <I>which remain</I> until this
 very day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was a brave appearance, no doubt, which the five kings made when 
 they took the field for the reducing of Gibeon, and a brave army they 
 had following them; but they were all routed, put into disorder first, 
 and then brought to destruction by the hail-stones. And now Joshua 
 thought, his work being done, he might go with his army into quarters 
 of refreshment. Accordingly it was resolved, perhaps in a council of 
 war, that they should presently return <I>to the camp at Gilgal</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 till they should receive orders from God to take possession of the 
 country they had now conquered; but he soon finds he has more work cut 
 out for him. The victory must be pursued, that the spoils might be 
 divided. Accordingly he applies himself to it with renewed vigour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The forces that had dispersed themselves must be followed and 
 smitten. When tidings were brought to Joshua where the kings were he 
 ordered a guard to be set upon them for the present 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 <I>reserving them</I> for another <I>day of destruction,</I> and to be 
 <I>brought forth to a day of wrath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:30">Job xxi. 30</A>.

 He directs his men to pursue the common soldiers, as much as might be,
 to prevent their escaping to the garrisons, which would strengthen 
 them, and make the reduction of them the more difficult,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Like a prudent general, he does that first which is most needful, and 
 defers his triumphs till he has completed his conquests; nor was he in 
 such haste to insult over the captive kings but that he would first 
 prevent the rallying again of their scattered forces. The result of 
 this vigorous pursuit was, 

 1.  That a very great slaughter was made of the enemies of God and
 Israel.  And, 

 2. The field was cleared of them, so that none remained but such as got
 into fenced cities, where they would not long be safe themselves, nor 
 were they capable of doing any service to the cities that sheltered 
 them, unless they could have left their fears behind them. 

 3. <I>None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 This expression intimates,

 (1.) Their perfect safety and tranquillity; some think it should be 
 read (from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+11:7">Exod. xi. 7</A>),
 
 <I>Against any of the children of Israel did not a dog move his
 tongue;</I> no, not against any one man of them. They were not 
 threatened by any danger at all after their victory, no, not so much as 
 the barking of a dog. Not one single Israelite (for the original makes 
 it so particular) was brought into any distress, either in the battle 
 or in the pursuit. 

 (2.) Their honour and reputation; no man had any reproach to cast upon 
 them, nor an ill word to give them. God not only tied the hands, but 
 stopped the mouths, of their enraged enemies, and put lying lips to 
 silence.

 (3.) The Chaldee paraphrase makes it an expression of their unalloyed 
 joy for this victory, reading it, <I>There was no hurt nor loss to the 
 children of Israel, for which any man should afflict his soul.</I> When 
 the army came to be reviewed after the battle, there was none slain, 
 none wounded, none missing. Not one Israelite had occasion to lament 
 either the loss of a friend or the loss of a limb, so cheap, so easy, 
 so glorious, was this victory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The kings that had hidden themselves must now be called to an 
 account, as rebels against the Israel of God, to whom, by the divine 
 promise and grant, this land did of right belong and should have been 
 surrendered upon demand. See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How they were secured. The cave which they fled to, and trusted in 
 for a refuge, became their prison, in which they were clapped up, till 
 Joshua sat in judgment on them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 It seems they all escaped both the hail-stones and the sword, God so 
 ordering it, not in kindness to them, but that they might be reserved 
 for a more solemn and terrible execution; as, for this cause, Pharaoh 
 survived the plagues of Egypt, and was made to stand, that God might in 
 him <I>show his power,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:16">Exod. ix. 16</A>.

 They all fled, and met at the same place, Providence directing them;
 and now those who were lately consulting against Israel were put upon 
 new counsels to preserve themselves and agreed to take shelter in the 
 same cave. The information brought to Joshua of this is an evidence 
 that there were those of the country, who knew the holes and fastnesses 
 of it, that were in his interests. And the care Joshua took to keep 
 them there when they were there, as it is an instance of his policy and 
 presence of mind, even in the heat of action, so, in the result of 
 their project, it shows how those not only deceive themselves, but 
 destroy themselves, who think to hide themselves from God. Their refuge 
 of lies will but bind them over to God's judgment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How they were triumphed over. Joshua ordered them to be brought 
 forth out of the cave, set before him as at the bar, and their names 
 called over, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 And when they either were bound and cast upon the ground unable to help 
 themselves, or threw themselves upon the ground, humbly to beg for 
 their lives, he called for the general officers and great men, and 
 commanded them to trample upon these kings, and set their feet upon 
 their necks, not in sport and to make themselves and the company merry, 
 but with the gravity and decorum that became the ministers of the 
 divine justice who were not herein to gratify any pride or passion of 
 their own, but to give glory to the God of Israel as higher than the 
 highest, who <I>treads upon princes as mortar</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:25">Isa. xli. 25</A>),

 and <I>is terrible to the kings of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:12">Ps. lxxvi. 12</A>.

 The thing does indeed look barbarous, thus to insult over men in
 misery, who had suddenly fallen from the highest pitch of honour into 
 this disgrace. It was hard for crowned heads to be thus trodden upon, 
 not by Joshua himself (that might better have been borne), at least not 
 by him only, but by all the captains of the army.  Certainly it ought 
 not to be drawn into a precedent, for the case was extraordinary, and 
 we have reason to think it was by divine direction and impulse that 
 Joshua did this.

 (1.) God would hereby punish the abominable wickedness of these kings, 
 the measure of whose iniquity was now full. And, by this public act of 
 justice done upon these ringleaders of the Canaanites in sin, he would 
 possess his people with the greater dread and detestation of those sins 
 of <I>the nations that God cast out from before them,</I> which they 
 would be tempted to imitate. 

 (2.) He would hereby have the promise by Moses made good

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:29">Deut. xxxiii. 29</A>),

 <I>Thou shalt tread upon their high places,</I> that is, their great
 men, which should the rather be speedily fulfilled in the letter 
 because they are the very last words of Moses that we find upon record.  
 
 (3.) He would hereby encourage the faith and hope of his people Israel 
 in reference to the wars that were yet before them. Therefore Joshua 
 said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):
 
 <I>Fear not, nor be dismayed.</I>

 [1.] "Fear not these kings, nor any of theirs, as if there were any 
 danger of having this affront now put upon them in after-time revenged 
 upon yourselves, a consideration which keeps many from being insolent 
 towards those they have at their mercy, because they know not how soon 
 the uncertain fate of war may turn the same wheel upon themselves; but 
 you need not fear that any should rise up ever to revenge this 
 quarrel." 

 [2.] "Fear not any other kings, who may at any time be in confederacy 
 against you, for you see these brought down, whom you thought 
 formidable. <I>Thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies;</I> now that 
 they begin to fall, to fall so low that you may set your feet on their 
 necks, you may be confident that they shall not prevail, but shall 
 <I>surely fall before you,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:13">Esth. vi. 13</A>.

 (4.) He would hereby give a type and figure of Christ's victories over 
 the powers of darkness, and believers' victories through him. All the 
 enemies of the Redeemer shall be <I>made his footstool,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:1">Ps. cx. 1</A>.
 
 And see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:40">Ps.  xviii. 40</A>.

 The <I>kings of the earth set themselves</I> against him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:2">Ps.  ii. 2</A>),

 but sooner or later we shall see all things put under Him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:8">Heb.  ii. 8</A>),

 and <I>principalities and powers</I> made a show of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col. ii. 15</A>.

 And in these triumphs we are more than conquerors, may <I>tread upon
 the lion and adder</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:13">Ps.  xci. 13</A>),

 may <I>ride on the high places of the earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:14">Isa. lviii. 14</A>),

 and may be confident that <I>the God of peace shall tread Satan under
 our feet,</I> shall do it shortly and do it effectually,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How they were put to death. Perhaps, when they had undergone that 
 terrible mortification of being trodden upon by the captains of Israel, 
 they were ready to say, as Agag, <I>Surely the bitterness of death is 
 past,</I> and that <I>sufficient unto them was this punishment which 
 was inflicted by many;</I> but their honours cannot excuse their lives, 
 their forfeited devoted lives. Joshua smote them with the sword, and 
 then hanged up their bodies till evening, when they were taken down, 
 and thrown <I>into the cave in which they had hidden themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 That which they thought would have been their shelter was made their 
 prison first and then their grave; so shall we be disappointed in that 
 which we flee to from God: yet to good people the grave is still <I>a 
 hiding-place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:13">Job xiv. 13</A>.

 If these five kings had humbled themselves in time, and had begged
 peace instead of waging war, they might have saved their lives; but now 
 the decree had gone forth, and they <I>found no place for 
 repentance,</I> or the reversal of the judgment; it was too late to 
 expect it, though perhaps <I>they sought it carefully with 
 tears.</I></P>

 &nbsp; 34 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel
 with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:
 &nbsp; 35 And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of
 the sword, and all the souls that <I>were</I> therein he utterly
 destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
 &nbsp; 36 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto
 Hebron; and they fought against it:
 &nbsp; 37 And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword,
 and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the
 souls that <I>were</I> therein; he left none remaining, according to
 all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all
 the souls that <I>were</I> therein.
 &nbsp; 38 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and
 fought against it:
 &nbsp; 39 And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities
 thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and
 utterly destroyed all the souls that <I>were</I> therein; he left none
 remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to
 the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.
 &nbsp; 40 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the
 south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings:
 he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed,
 as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel commanded.
 &nbsp; 41 And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and
 all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.
 &nbsp; 42 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one
 time, because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel fought for Israel.
 &nbsp; 43 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp
 to Gilgal.

 We are here informed how Joshua improved the late glorious victory he 
 had obtained and the advantages he had gained by it, and to do this 
 well is a general's praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is a particular account of the several cities which he 
 immediately made himself master of. 

 1. The cities of three of the kings whom he had conquered in the field
 he went and took possession of, Lachish

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>),
 
 Eglon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>),
 
 and Hebron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>.

 The other two, Jerusalem and Jarmuth, were not taken at this time; 
 perhaps his forces were either so much fatigued with what they had done 
 or so well content with what they had got that they had no mind to 
 attack those places, and so they let slip the fairest opportunity they 
 could ever expect of reducing them with ease, which afterwards was not 
 done without difficulty,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:8,2Sa+5:6">Judg. i. 8; 2 Sam. v. 6</A>.

 2. Three other cities, and royal cities too, he took: Makkedah, into
 the neighbourhood of which the five kings had fled, which brought 
 Joshua and his forces thither in pursuit of them, and so hastened its 
 ruin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),
 
 Libnah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>),
 
 and Debir, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:38,39"><I>v.</I> 38, 39</A>.

 3. One king that brought in his forces for the relief of Lachish, that 
 had lost its king, proved to meddle to his own hurt; it was Horam king 
 of Gezer, who, either in friendship to his neighbours or for his own 
 security, offered to stop the progress of Joshua's arms, and was cut 
 off with all his forces, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Thus wicked men are often snared in their counsels, and, by opposing 
 God in the way of his judgments, bring them the sooner on their own 
 heads.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A general account of the country which was hereby reduced and 
 brought into Israel's hands 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:40-42"><I>v.</I> 40-42</A>),

 that part of the land of Canaan of which they first got possession, 
 which lay south of Jerusalem, and afterwards fell, for the most part, 
 to the lot of the tribe of Judah.  Observe in this narrative,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The great speed Joshua made in taking these cities, which, some 
 think, is intimated in the manner of relating it, which is quick and 
 concise. He flew like lightning from place to place; and though they 
 all stood it out to the last extremity, and none of these cities opened 
 their gates to him, yet in a little time he got them all into his 
 hands, summoned them, and seized them, the same day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 or in two days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Now that they were struck with fear, by the defeat of their armies and 
 the death of their kings, Joshua prudently followed his blow. See what 
 a great deal of work may be done in a little time, if we will but be 
 busy and improve our opportunities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The great severity Joshua used towards those he conquered. He gave 
 no quarter to man, woman, nor child, put to the sword <I>all the 
 souls</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:28,30,32,35"><I>v.</I> 28, 30, 32, 35</A>,

 &c.), <I>utterly destroyed all that breathed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 and <I>left none remaining.</I> Nothing could justify this military 
 execution but that herein they did <I>as the Lord God of Israel 
 commanded</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 which was sufficient not only to bear them out, and save them for the 
 imputation of cruelty, but to sanctify what they did, and make it an 
 acceptable piece of service to his justice. God would hereby,

 (1.) Manifest his hatred of the idolatries and other abominations which 
 the Canaanites had been guilty of, and leave us to judge how great the 
 provocation was which they had given him by the greatness of the 
 destruction which was brought upon them when the measure of their 
 iniquity was full. 

 (2.) He would hereby magnify his love to his people Israel, in giving 
 so many men for them, and <I>people for their life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:4">Isa. xliii. 4</A>.

 When the <I>heathen are to be cast out to make room for this vine</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:8">Ps. lxxx. 8</A>)

 divine justice appears more prodigal than ever of human blood, that the
 Israelites might find themselves for ever obliged to spend their lives 
 to the glory of that God who had sacrificed so many of the lives of his 
 creatures to their interest.

 (3.) Hereby was typified the final and eternal destruction of all the 
 impenitent implacable enemies of the Lord Jesus, who, having slighted 
 the riches of his grace, must for ever feel the weight of his wrath, 
 and shall <I>have judgment without mercy.  Nations that forget God 
 shall be turned into hell,</I> and no reproach at all to God's infinite 
 goodness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The great success of this expedition. The spoil of these cities was 
 now divided among the men of war that plundered them; and the cities 
 themselves, with the land about them, were shortly to be divided among
 the tribes, for the Lord <I>fought for Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 They could not have gotten the victory if God had not undertaken the 
 battle; then we conquer when God fights for us; and, <I>if he be for 
 us, who can be against us?</I></P>
