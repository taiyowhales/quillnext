 This chapter concludes that great affair of the settlement of the ark
 in the royal city, and with it the settlement of the public worship of
 God during the reign of David. Here is, 

 I. The solemnity with which the ark was fixed,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of
 the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt
 sacrifices and peace offerings before God.
 &nbsp; 2  And when David had made an end of offering the burnt
 offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the
 name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 3  And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to
 every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a
 flagon <I>of wine.</I>
 &nbsp; 4  And he appointed <I>certain</I> of the Levites to minister before
 the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and to record, and to thank and praise the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel:
 &nbsp; 5  Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and
 Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah,
 and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph
 made a sound with cymbals;
 &nbsp; 6  Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets
 continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was a glorious day when the ark of God was safely lodged in the tent 
 David had pitched for it. That good man had his heart much upon it, 
 could not sleep contentedly till it was done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:4,5">Ps. cxxxii. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The circumstances of the ark were now, 

 1. Better than what they had been. It had been obscure in a country
 town, in the fields of the wood; now it was removed to a public place, 
 to the royal city, where all might resort to it. It had been neglected, 
 as a despised broken vessel; now it was attended with veneration, and 
 God was enquired of by it. It had borrowed a room in a private house, 
 which it enjoyed by courtesy; now it had a habitation of its own 
 entirely to itself, was set in the midst of it, and not crowded into a 
 corner. Note, Though God's word and ordinances may be clouded and 
 eclipsed for a time, they shall at length shine out of obscurity. Yet, 
 
 2. They were much short of what was intended in the next reign, when
 the temple was to be built.  This was but a tent, a poor mean dwelling; 
 yet this was the tabernacle, the temple which David in his psalms often 
 speaks of with so much affection. David, who pitched a tent for the ark 
 and continued steadfast to it, did far better than Solomon, who built a 
 temple for it and yet in his latter end turned his back upon it. The 
 church's poorest times were its purest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Now David was easy in his mind, the ark was fixed, and fixed near 
 him. Now see how he takes care, 

 1. That God shall have the glory of it.  Two ways he gives him honour
 upon this occasion:--

 (1.) By sacrifices
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 burnt-offerings in adoration of his perfections, peace-offerings in
 acknowledgment of his favours.

 (2.) By songs: he appointed Levites to record this story in a song for
 the benefit of others, or to celebrate it themselves by <I>thanking and 
 praising the God of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 All our rejoicings must express themselves in thanksgivings to him from
 whom all our comforts are received.

 2. That the people shall have the joy of it. They shall fare the better
 for this day's solemnity; for he gives them all what is worth coming 
 for, not only a royal treat in honour of the day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 in which David showed himself generous to his subjects, as he had found
 God gracious to him (those whose hearts are enlarged with holy joy 
 should show it by being open-handed); but (which is far better) he 
 gives them also a <I>blessing in the name of the Lord,</I> as a father, 
 as a prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He prayed to God for them, and commended them to his grace. <I>In the
 name of the Word of the Lord</I> (so the Targum), the essential eternal 
 Word, who is Jehovah, and through whom all blessings come to us.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Then on that day David delivered first <I>this psalm</I> to thank
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
 &nbsp; 8  Give thanks unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, call upon his name, make known his
 deeds among the people.
 &nbsp; 9  Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his
 wondrous works.
 &nbsp; 10  Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice
 that seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 11  Seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> and his strength, seek his face continually.
 &nbsp; 12  Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his
 wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
 &nbsp; 13  O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his
 chosen ones.
 &nbsp; 14  He <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God; his judgments <I>are</I> in all the
 earth.
 &nbsp; 15  Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word <I>which</I> he
 commanded to a thousand generations;
 &nbsp; 16  <I>Even of the covenant</I> which he made with Abraham, and of
 his oath unto Isaac;
 &nbsp; 17  And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, <I>and</I> to
 Israel <I>for</I> an everlasting covenant,
 &nbsp; 18  Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
 your inheritance;
 &nbsp; 19  When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.
 &nbsp; 20  And <I>when</I> they went from nation to nation, and from <I>one</I>
 kingdom to another people;
 &nbsp; 21  He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings
 for their sakes,
 &nbsp; 22  <I>Saying,</I> Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no
 harm.
 &nbsp; 23  Sing unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, all the earth; shew forth from day to
 day his salvation.
 &nbsp; 24  Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works
 among all nations.
 &nbsp; 25  For great <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and greatly to be praised: he also
 <I>is</I> to be feared above all gods.
 &nbsp; 26  For all the gods of the people <I>are</I> idols: but the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 made the heavens.
 &nbsp; 27  Glory and honour <I>are</I> in his presence; strength and
 gladness <I>are</I> in his place.
 &nbsp; 28  Give unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> glory and strength.
 &nbsp; 29  Give unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> the glory <I>due</I> unto his name: bring an
 offering, and come before him: worship the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the beauty of
 holiness.
 &nbsp; 30  Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be
 stable, that it be not moved.
 &nbsp; 31  Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let
 <I>men</I> say among the nations, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> reigneth.
 &nbsp; 32  Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields
 rejoice, and all that <I>is</I> therein.
 &nbsp; 33  Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, because he cometh to judge the earth.
 &nbsp; 34  O give thanks unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for <I>he is</I> good; for his mercy
 <I>endureth</I> for ever.
 &nbsp; 35  And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us
 together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give
 thanks to thy holy name, <I>and</I> glory in thy praise.
 &nbsp; 36  Blessed <I>be</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel for ever and ever. And
 all the people said, Amen, and praised the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 We have here the thanksgiving psalm which David, by the Spirit, 
 composed, and delivered to the chief musician, to be sung upon occasion 
 of the public entry the ark made into the tent prepared for it. Some 
 think he appointed this hymn to be daily used in the temple service, as 
 duly as the day came; whatever other psalms they sung, they must not 
 omit this. David had penned many psalms before this, some in the time 
 of his trouble by Saul. This was composed before, but was now first 
 delivered into the hand of Asaph, for the use of the church. It is 
 gathered out of several psalms (from the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:7-23">beginning to <I>v.</I> 23</A>

 is taken from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:1-15">Ps. cv. 1</A>,

 &c.; and then 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:23-34"><I>v.</I> 23 to <I>v.</I> 34</A>

 is the whole 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:1-13">
 96th psalm</A>,

 with little variation; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>

 is taken from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:1">Ps. cxxxvi. 1</A>

 and divers others; and then
 the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:35,36">
 last two verses</A>

 are taken from the close of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:47,48">Ps. cvi.</A>),

 which some think warrants us to do likewise, and make up hymns out of
 David's psalms, a part of one and a part of another put together so as 
 may be most proper to express and excite the devotion of Christians.  
 These psalms will be best expounded in their proper places (if the Lord 
 will); here we take them as they are put together, with a design to 
 <I>thank the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 a great duty, to which we need to be excited and in which we need to be
 assisted. 

 1. Let God be glorified in our praises; let his honour be the centre in
 which all the lines meet.  Let us glorify him by our thanksgivings 
 (<I>Give thanks to the Lord</I>), by our prayers (<I>Call on his
 name,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 by our songs <I>(Sing psalms unto him</I>), by our discourse--<I>Talk
 of all his wondrous works,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Let us glorify him as <I>a great God, and greatly to be praised</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 as supreme God (above all gods), as sole God, for all others are idols,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Let us glorify him as most bright and blessed in himself (<I>Glory and
 honour are in his presence,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 as creator (<I>The Lord made the heavens</I>), as the ruler of the
 whole creation (<I>His judgments are in all the earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and as ours--<I>He is the Lord our God.</I> Thus must we <I>give unto
 the Lord the glory due to his name</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:28,29"><I>v.</I> 28, 29</A>),

 and own it, and much more, his due. 

 2. Let other be edified and instructed: <I>Make known his deeds among
 the people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 <I>declare his glory among the heathen</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 that those who are strangers to him may be led into acquaintance with
 him, allegiance to him, and the adoration of him. Thus must we serve 
 the interests of his kingdom among men, that all the earth may <I>fear 
 before him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 3. Let us be ourselves encouraged to triumph and trust in God.  Those
 that give glory to God's name are allowed to <I>glory in it</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 to value themselves upon their relation to God and venture themselves
 upon his promise to them. <I>Let the heart of those rejoice that seek 
 the Lord,</I> much more of those that have found him. <I>Seek him, and 
 his strength, and his face:</I> that is, seek him by the ark of his 
 strength, in which he manifests himself. 

 4. Let the everlasting covenant be the great matter of our joy and
 praise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Be mindful of his covenant.</I> In the parallel place it is, <I>He
 will be ever mindful of it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:8">Ps. cv. 8</A>.

 Seeing God never will forget it, we never must. The covenant is said to
 be <I>commanded,</I> because God has obliged us to obey the conditions 
 of it, and because he has both authority to make the promise and 
 ability to make it good. This covenant was ancient, yet never to be 
 forgotten. It was made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were long 
 since dead

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:16-18"><I>v.</I> 16-18</A>),

 yet still sure to the spiritual seed, and the promises of it pleadable.
 
 5.  Let God's former mercies to his people of old, to our ancestors and
 our predecessors in profession, be commemorated by us now with 
 thankfulness to his praise. Let it be remembered how God protected the 
 patriarchs in their unsettled condition. When they came strangers to 
 Canaan and were sojourners in it, when they were few and might easily 
 have been swallowed up, when they were continually upon the remove and 
 so exposed, when there were many that bore them ill-will and sought to 
 do them mischief, yet no man was suffered to do them wrong--not the 
 Canaanites, Philistines, Egyptians. Kings were reproved and plagued for 
 their sakes. Pharaoh was so, and Abimelech. They were the <I>anointed 
 of the Lord,</I> sanctified by his grace, sanctified by his glory, and 
 had received the unction of the Spirit. They were his prophets, 
 instructed in the things of God themselves and commissioned to instruct 
 others (and prophets are said to be <I>anointed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:16,Isa+61:1">1 Kings xix. 16; Isa. lxi. 1</A>);

 therefore, if any touch them, they touch the apple of God's eye; if any
 harm them, it is at their peril, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:19-22"><I>v.</I> 19-22</A>.

 6. Let the great salvation of the Lord be especially the subject of our
 praises

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Show forth from day to day his salvation,</I> that is (says bishop
 Patrick), his promised salvation by Christ. We have reason to celebrate 
 that from day to day; for we daily receive the benefits of it, and it 
 is a subject that can never be exhausted. 

 7. Let God be praised by a due and constant attendance upon him in the
 ordinances he has appointed: <I>Bring an offering,</I> then the fruit 
 of the <I>ground,</I> now the fruit of the <I>lips,</I> of the 
 <I>heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:15">Heb. xiii. 15</A>),

 and <I>worship him in the beauty of holiness,</I> in the holy places
 and in a holy manner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Holiness is the beauty of the Lord, the beauty of all sanctified souls
 and all religious performances.

 8. Let God's universal monarchy be the fear and joy of all people. Let
 us reverence it: <I>Fear before him, all the earth.</I> And let us 
 rejoice in it: <I>Let the heavens be glad and rejoice,</I> because 
 <I>the Lord reigns,</I> and by his providence establishes the world, so 
 that, though it be moved, it cannot be removed, nor the measures broken 
 which Infinite Wisdom has taken in the government of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>.

 9. Let the prospect of the judgment to come inspire us with an awful
 pleasure, Let earth and sea, fields and woods, though in the great day 
 of the Lord they will all be consumed, yet rejoice that he will come, 
 doth come, to <I>judge the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.

 10. In the midst of our praises we must not forget to pray for the
 succour and relief of those saints and servants of God that are in 
 distress

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>Save us, gather us, deliver us from the heathen,</I> those of us
 that are scattered and oppressed. When we are rejoicing in God's 
 favours to us we must remember our afflicted brethren, and pray for 
 their salvation and deliverance as our own. We are members one of 
 another; and therefore when we mean, "Lord, save <I>them,</I>" it is 
 not improper to say, "Lord, save <I>us.</I>" <I>Lastly,</I> Let us make 
 God the Alpha and Omega of our praises. David begins with

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 <I>Give thanks to the Lord;</I> he concludes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 <I>Blessed be the Lord.</I> And whereas in the place whence this
 doxology is taken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:48">Ps. cvi. 48</A>)

 it is added, <I>Let all the people say, Amen, Hallelujah,</I> here we
 find they did according to that directory: <I>All the people said, 
 Amen, and praised the Lord.</I> When the Levites had finished this 
 psalm or prayer and praise, then, and not till then, the people that 
 attended signified their consent and concurrence by saying, 
 <I>Amen,</I> And so they praised the Lord, much affected no doubt with 
 this newly instituted way of devotion, which had been hitherto used in 
 the schools of the prophets only,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:5">1 Sam. x. 5</A>.

 And, if this way of praising God <I>please the Lord better than an ox
 or a bullock that has horns and hoofs, the humble shall see it and be 
 glad,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>37  So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually,
 as every day's work required:
 &nbsp; 38  And Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight;

 &nbsp; 39  And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before
 the tabernacle of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the high place that <I>was</I> at
 Gibeon,
 &nbsp; 40  To offer burnt offerings unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> upon the altar of the
 burnt offering continually morning and evening, and <I>to do</I>
 according to all that is written in the law of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which he
 commanded Israel;
 &nbsp; 41  And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were
 chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 because his mercy <I>endureth</I> for ever;
 &nbsp; 42  And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals
 for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments
 of God. And the sons of Jeduthun <I>were</I> porters.
 &nbsp; 43  And all the people departed every man to his house: and
 David returned to bless his house.

 The worship of God is not only to be the work of a solemn day now and 
 then, brought in to grace a triumph; but it ought to be the work of 
 every day. David therefore settles it here for a constancy, puts it 
 into a method, which he obliged those that officiated to observe in 
 their respective posts. In the tabernacle of Moses, and afterwards in 
 the temple of Solomon, the ark and the altar were together; but, ever 
 since Eli's time, they had been separated, and still continued so till 
 the temple was built.  I cannot conceive what reason there was why 
 David, who knew the law and was zealous for it, did not either bring 
 the ark to Gibeon, where the tabernacle and the altar were, or bring 
 them to Mount Zion, where the ark was. Perhaps the curtains and 
 hangings of Moses's tabernacle were so worn with time and weather that 
 they were not fit to be removed, nor fit to be a shelter for the ark; 
 and yet he would not make all new, but only a tent for the ark, because 
 the time was at hand when the temple should be built. Whatever was the 
 reason, all David's time they were asunder, but he took care that 
 neither of them should be neglected. 

 1. At Jerusalem, where the ark was, Asaph and his brethren were
 appointed to attend, to <I>minister before the ark continually,</I> 
 with songs of praise, <I>as every day's work required,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 No sacrifices were offered there, nor incense burnt, because the altars
 were not there: but David's prayers were <I>directed as incense, and 
 the lifting up of his hands as the evening sacrifice</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:2">Ps. cxli. 2</A>),

 so early did spiritual worship take place of ceremonial. 

 2. Yet the ceremonial worship, being of divine institution, must by no
 means be omitted; and therefore at Gibeon were the altars where the 
 priests attended, for their work was to sacrifice and burn incense, 
 which they did <I>continually, morning and evening, according to the 
 law of Moses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:39,40"><I>v.</I> 39, 40</A>.

 These must be kept up because, however in their own nature they were
 inferior to the moral services of prayer and praise, yet, as they were 
 types of the mediation of Christ, they had a great deal of honour put 
 upon them, and the observance of them was of great consequence. Here 
 Zadok attended, to preside in the service of the altar; as (it is 
 probable) Abiathar settled at Jerusalem, to attend the ark, because he 
 had the breast-plate of judgment, which must be consulted before the 
 ark: this is the reason why we read in David's time both Zadok and 
 Abiathar were the priests

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:17,20:25">2 Sam. viii. 17; xx. 25</A>),

 one where the altar was and the other where the ark was. At Gibeon,
 where the altars were, David also appointed <I>singers to give thanks 
 to the Lord,</I> and the burden of all their songs must be, <I>For his 
 mercy endureth for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 They did it <I>with musical instruments of God,</I> such instruments as
 were appointed and appropriated to this service, not such as they used 
 on other occasions.  Between common mirth and holy joy there is a vast 
 difference, and the limits and distances between them must be carefully 
 observed and kept up. Matters being thus settled, and the affairs of 
 religion put into a happy channel,

 (1.) The people were satisfied, and went home pleased.
 
 (2.) David returned to bless his house, resolving to keep up family
 worship still, which public worship must not supersede.</P>
