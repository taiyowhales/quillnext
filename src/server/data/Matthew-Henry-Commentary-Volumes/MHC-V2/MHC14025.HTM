 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Amaziah's reign, recorded in this chapter, was not one of the worse and 
 yet for from good. Most of the passages in this chapter we had before 
 more briefly related, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:1-22">2 Kings xiv.</A>

 Here we find Amaziah, 

 I. A just revenger of his father's death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II.  An obedient observer of the command of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:5-10">ver. 5-10</A>.

 III.  A cruel conqueror of the Edomites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>.

 IV. A foolish worshipper of the gods of Edom and impatient of reproof
 for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:14-16">ver. 14-16</A>.

 V.  Rashly challenging the king of Israel, and smarting for his
 rashness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:17-24">ver. 17-24</A>.

 And, lastly, ending his days ingloriously,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Amaziah <I>was</I> twenty and five years old <I>when</I> he began to
 reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his
 mother's name <I>was</I> Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 2  And he did <I>that which was</I> right in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 but not with a perfect heart.
 &nbsp; 3  Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him,
 that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.
 &nbsp; 4  But he slew not their children, but <I>did</I> as <I>it is</I> written
 in the law in the book of Moses, where the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded,
 saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall
 the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his
 own sin.
 &nbsp; 5  Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them
 captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to
 the houses of <I>their</I> fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin:
 and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found
 them three hundred thousand choice <I>men, able</I> to go forth to
 war, that could handle spear and shield.
 &nbsp; 6  He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of
 Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
 &nbsp; 7  But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not
 the army of Israel go with thee; for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> not with
 Israel, <I>to wit, with</I> all the children of Ephraim.
 &nbsp; 8  But if thou wilt go, do <I>it,</I> be strong for the battle: God
 shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to
 help, and to cast down.
 &nbsp; 9  And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for
 the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And
 the man of God answered, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> is able to give thee much more
 than this.
 &nbsp; 10  Then Amaziah separated them, <I>to wit,</I> the army that was
 come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their
 anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home
 in great anger.
 &nbsp; 11  And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people,
 and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir
 ten thousand.
 &nbsp; 12  And <I>other</I> ten thousand <I>left</I> alive did the children of
 Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the
 rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all
 were broken in pieces.
 &nbsp; 13  But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that
 they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of
 Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote three thousand
 of them, and took much spoil.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The general character of Amaziah: <I>He did that which was right in
 the eyes of the Lord,</I> worshipped the true God, kept the temple 
 service a going, and countenanced religion in his kingdom; but he did 
 not do it <I>with a perfect heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that is, he was not a man of serious piety or devotion himself, nor had
 he any zeal for the exercises of religion. He was no enemy to it, but a 
 cool and indifferent friend. Such is the character of too many in this 
 Laodicean age: they do that which is good, but not with the heart, not 
 with a perfect heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A necessary piece of justice which he did upon the traitors that 
 murdered his father: he put them to death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Though we should suppose they intended to avenge on their king the
 death of the prophet (as was intimated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:25"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 25</A>),

 yet this would by no means justify their wickedness; for <I>they</I>
 were not the avengers, but presumptuously took God's work out of his 
 hands: and therefore Amaziah did what became him in calling them to an 
 account for it, but forbade the putting of the children to death for 
 the parents' sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. An expedition of his against the Edomites, who, some time ago, had 
 revolted from under the dominion of Judah, to which he attempted to 
 reduce them.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The great preparation he made for this expedition. 

 (1.) He mustered his own forces, and marshalled them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and found Judah and Benjamin in all but 300,000 men that were fit for
 war, whereas, in Jehoshaphat's time, fifty or sixty years before, they 
 were four times as many. Sin weakens a people, diminishes them, 
 dispirits them, and lessens their number and figure.

 (2.) He hired auxiliary troops out of the kingdom of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Finding his own kingdom defective in men, he thought to make up the
 deficiency with his money, and therefore took into his pay 100,000 
 Israelites. If he had advised with any of his prophets before he did 
 this, or had but considered how little any of his ancestors got by 
 their alliances with Israel, he would not have had this to undo again. 
 But rashness makes work for repentance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The command which God sent him by a prophet to dismiss out of his 
 service the forces of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 He would not have him call in any assistance at all: it looked like
 distrust of God. If he made sure of God's presence, the army he had of 
 his own was sufficient. But particularly he must not take in 
 <I>their</I> assistance: <I>For the Lord is not with the children of 
 Ephraim, because they are not with him,</I> but worship the calves. 
 This was a good reason why he should not make use of them, because he 
 could not depend upon them to do him any service. What good could be 
 expected from those that had not God with them, nor his blessings upon 
 their undertakings? It is comfortable to employ those who, we have 
 reason to hope, have an interest in heaven, and dangerous to associate 
 with those from whom the Lord has departed. The prophet assured him 
 that if he persisted in his resolution to take these idolatrous 
 apostate Israelites with him, in hopes thereby to make himself strong 
 for the battle, it was at his peril; they would prove a dead weight to 
 his army, would sink and betray it: "<I>God shall make thee fall before 
 the enemy,</I> and these Israelites will be the ruin of thy cause; for 
 God has power to help thee without them, and to cast thee down though 
 thou hast them with thee."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The objection which Amaziah made against this command, and the 
 satisfactory answer which the prophet gave to that objection, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The king had remitted 100 talents to the men of Israel for
 advance-money.  "Now," says he, "if I send them back, I shall lose 
 that: <I>But what shall we do for the 100 talents?</I>" This is an 
 objection men often make against their duty: they are afraid of losing 
 by it. "Regard not that," says the prophet: "<I>The Lord is able to 
 give thee much more than this;</I> and, thou mayest depend upon it, he 
 will not see thee lose by him. What are 100 talents between thee and 
 him? He has ways enough to make up the loss to thee; it is below thee 
 to speak of it." Note, A firm belief of God's all-sufficiency to bear 
 us out in our duty, and to make up all the loss and damage we sustain 
 in his service abundantly to our advantage, will make his yoke very 
 easy and his burden very light. What is it to trust in God, but to be 
 willing to venture the loss of any thing for him, in confidence of the 
 goodness of the security he gives us that we shall not lose by him, but 
 that whatever we part with for his sake shall be made up to us in kind 
 or kindness. When we grudge to part with any thing for God and our 
 religion, this should satisfy us, that God is able to give us much more 
 than this. He is just, and he is good, and he is solvent. The king lost 
 100 talents by his obedience; and we find just that sum given to his 
 grandson Jotham as a present

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+27:5"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 5</A>);

 then the principal was repaid, and, for interest, 10,000 measures of
 wheat and as many of barley.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. His obedience to the command of God, which is upon record to his 
 honour. He would rather lose his money, disoblige his allies, and 
 dismiss a fourth part of his army just as they were going to take the 
 field, than offend God: <I>He separated the army of Ephraim, to go home 
 again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 And they went home in great anger, taking it as a great affront thus to
 be made fools of, and to be cashiered as men not fit to be employed, 
 and being perhaps disappointed of the advantages they promised 
 themselves in spoil and plunder by joining with Judah against Edom. Men 
 are apt to resent that which touches them in their profit or 
 reputation, though it frees them from trouble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. His triumphs over the Edomites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 He left dead upon the spot, in the field of battle, 10,000 men; 10,000
 more he took prisoners, and barbarously killed them all by throwing 
 them down some steep and craggy precipice. What provocation he had to 
 exercise this cruelty towards them we are not told; but it was 
 certainly very severe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The mischief which the disbanded soldiers of Israel did to the 
 cities of Judah, either in their return or soon after, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 They were so enraged at being sent home that, if they might not go to
 share with Judah in the spoil of Edom, they would make a prey of Judah. 
 Several cities that lay upon the borders they plundered, killing 3000 
 men that made resistance. But why should God suffer this to be done? 
 Was it not in obedience to him that they were sent home, and yet shall 
 the country thus suffer by it? Surely God's way is in the sea! Did not 
 the prophet say that God was not with the children of Ephraim, and yet 
 they are suffered to prevail against Judah? Doubtless God intended 
 hereby to chastise those cities of Judah for their idolatries, which 
 were found most in those parts that lay next to Israel. The men of 
 Israel had corrupted them, and now they were made a plague to them. 
 Satan both tempts and torments.</P>

 <TR><TD COLSPAN=2><HR SIZE=1></TD></TR>
 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the
 slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the
 children of Seir, and set them up <I>to be</I> his gods, and bowed
 down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.
 &nbsp; 15  Wherefore the anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was kindled against Amaziah,
 and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast
 thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver
 their own people out of thine hand?
 &nbsp; 16  And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that <I>the king</I>
 said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why
 shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I
 know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast
 done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The revolt of Amaziah from the God of Israel to the gods of the
 Edomites. Egregious folly! Ahaz worshipped the gods of those that had 
 conquered him, for which he had some little colour,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:23"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 23</A>.

 But to worship the gods of those whom he had conquered, who could not
 protect their own worshippers, was the greatest absurdity that could 
 be. What did he see in the gods of the children of Seir that could 
 tempt him to set them up for <I>his gods</I> and <I>bow himself down 
 before them?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 If he had cast the idols down from the rock and broken them to pieces,
 instead of the prisoners, he would have manifested more of the piety as 
 well as more of the pity of an Israelite; but perhaps for that 
 barbarous inhumanity he was given up to this ridiculous idolatry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reproof which God sent to him, by a prophet, for this sin. 
 <I>The anger of the Lord was kindled against him,</I> and justly; yet, 
 before he sent to destroy him, he sent to convince and reclaim him, and 
 so to prevent his destruction. The prophet reasoned with him very 
 fairly and very mildly: <I>Why hast thou sought</I> the favour of those 
 gods <I>which could not deliver their own people?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 If men would but duly consider the inability of all those things to
 help them to which they have recourse when they forsake God, they would 
 not be such enemies to themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The check he gave to the reprover, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He could say nothing in excuse of his own folly; the reproof was too
 just to be answered. But he fell into a passion with the reprover.

 1. He taunted him as saucy and impertinent, and meddling with that
 which did not belong to him: <I>Art thou made of the king's 
 counsel?</I> Could not a man speak reasonably to him, but he must be 
 upbraided as usurping the place of a privy-counsellor? But, as a 
 prophet, he really was made of the king's counsel by the King of kings, 
 in duty to whom the king was bound not only to hear, but to ask and 
 take his counsel. 

 2. He silenced him, bade him forbear and say not a word more to him. He
 <I>said to the seer, See not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:10">Isa. xxx. 10</A>.

 Men would gladly have their prophets thus under their girdles, as we
 say, to speak just when and what they would have them speak, and not 
 otherwise.

 3. He threatened him: "<I>Why shouldst thou be smitten?</I> It is at
 thy peril if thou sayest a word more of this matter." He seems to 
 remind him of Zechariah's fate in the last reign, who was put to death 
 for making bold with the king; and bids him take warning by him.  Thus 
 he justifies the killing of that prophet by menacing this, and so, in 
 effect, makes himself guilty of the blood of both. He had hearkened to 
 the prophet who ordered him to send back the army of Israel, and was 
 ruled by him, though he contradicted his politics and lost him 100 
 talents, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 But this prophet, who dissuaded him from worshipping the gods of the
 Edomites, he ran upon with an unaccountable rage, which must be 
 attributed to the witchcraft of idolatry. He was easily persuaded to 
 part with his talents of silver, but by no means with his gods of 
 silver.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The doom which the prophet passed upon him for this. He had more to 
 say to him by way of instruction and advice; but, finding him obstinate 
 in his iniquity, he forbore. He is <I>joined to idols; let him 
 alone,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:17">Hos. iv. 17</A>.

 Miserable is the condition of that man with whom the blessed Spirit, by
 ministers and conscience, <I>forbears to strive,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:3">Gen. vi. 3</A>.

 And both the reprovers in the gate and that in the bosom, if long
 brow-beaten and baffled, will at length forbear. So I <I>gave them up 
 to their own hearts' lusts.</I> The secure sinner perhaps values 
 himself upon it as a noble and happy achievement to have silenced his 
 reprovers and monitors, and to get clear of them; but what comes of it? 
 "<I>I know that God has determined to destroy thee;</I> it is a plain 
 indication that thou art marked for ruin <I>that thou hast done this, 
 and hast not hearkened to my counsel.</I>" Those that are deaf to 
 reproof are ripening apace for destruction,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash,
 the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying,
 Come, let us see one another in the face.
 &nbsp; 18  And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
 saying, The thistle that <I>was</I> in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
 <I>was</I> in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife:
 and there passed by a wild beast that <I>was</I> in Lebanon, and trode
 down the thistle.
 &nbsp; 19  Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine
 heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest
 thou meddle to <I>thine</I> hurt, that thou shouldest fall, <I>even</I>
 thou, and Judah with thee?
 &nbsp; 20  But Amaziah would not hear; for it <I>came</I> of God, that he
 might deliver them into the hand <I>of their enemies,</I> because they
 sought after the gods of Edom.
 &nbsp; 21  So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one
 another in the face, <I>both</I> he and Amaziah king of Judah, at
 Beth-shemesh, which <I>belongeth</I> to Judah.
 &nbsp; 22  And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled
 every man to his tent.
 &nbsp; 23  And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the
 son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought
 him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the
 gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
 &nbsp; 24  And <I>he took</I> all the gold and the silver, and all the
 vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and
 the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and
 returned to Samaria.
 &nbsp; 25  And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the
 death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
 &nbsp; 26  Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold,
 <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and
 Israel?
 &nbsp; 27  Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he
 fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him
 there.
 &nbsp; 28  And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his
 fathers in the city of Judah.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 and the calamity he brought upon himself and his city thereby

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>),--

 verifies two of Solomon's proverbs:--

 (1.) That <I>a man's pride will bring him low,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:23">Prov. xxix. 23</A>.

 It goes before his destruction; not only procures it meritoriously, but
 is often the immediate occasion of it. <I>He that exalteth himself 
 shall be abased.</I>

 (2.) That he that <I>goes forth hastily to strive</I> will probably not
 know what to do in the end thereof, <I>when his neighbour has put him 
 to shame,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:8">Prov. xxv. 8</A>.

 He that is fond of contention may have enough of it sooner than he
 thinks of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But there are two passages in this story which we had not before in 
 the <I>Kings.</I> 

 (1.) That <I>Amaziah took advice</I> before he challenged the king of
 Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 But of whom? Not of the prophet--he was <I>not made of the king's
 counsel;</I> but of his statesmen that would flatter him and bid him go 
 up and prosper. It is good to take advice, but then it must be of those 
 that are fit to advise us. Those that will not take advice from the 
 word of God, which would guide them aright, will justly be left to the 
 bad advice of those that will counsel them to their destruction. Let 
 those be made fools that will not be made wise.

 (2.) Amaziah's imprudence is here made the punishment of his impiety

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>It was of the Lord;</I> he left him to himself to act thus
 foolishly, that he and his people might be <I>delivered into the hands 
 of their enemies, because</I> they had forsaken God and <I>sought after 
 the gods of Edom.</I> Those that will not persuaded to do well for 
 their souls will justly be given up to their own counsels to do ill for 
 themselves even in their outward affairs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Never was poor prince more violently pursued by his own subjects. 
 <I>From the time</I> that he departed from the Lord (so it may be read, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>)

 the hearts of his subjects departed from him, and they began to form a
 design against him in Jerusalem.  It is probable they were exasperated 
 against him more for his rashly engaging in a war against Israel than 
 for his worshipping the gods of Edom. But at length the ferment grew so 
 high, and he perceived the plot to be laid so deeply, that he thought 
 fit to quit his royal city and flee to Lachish, either as a private 
 place where he might be hid or as a strong place where he might be 
 guarded; but they sent after him thither, and slew him there.  By this 
 the putting of him to death seems to have been done deliberately, and 
 to have been the act, not of a disgusted servant or two, but of a 
 considerable body that durst avow it. How unrighteous soever they were 
 herein, God was righteous.</P>
