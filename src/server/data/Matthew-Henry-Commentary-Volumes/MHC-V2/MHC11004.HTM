 An instance of the wisdom God granted to Solomon we had in the close of 
 the foregoing chapter. In this we have an account of his wealth and 
 prosperity, the other branch of the promise there made him. We have 
 here, 
 
 I. The magnificence of his court, his ministers of state

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>),

 and the purveyors of his household

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:7-19">ver. 7-19</A>),

 and their office,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:27,28">ver. 27, 28</A>.

 II. The provisions for his table, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:22,23">ver. 22, 23</A>.

 III. The extent of his dominion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:21-24">ver. 21-24</A>.

 IV. The numbers, case, and peace, of his subjects, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:20-25">ver. 20-25</A>.

 V. His stables, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:26">ver. 26</A>.

 VI. His great reputation for wisdom and learning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:29-34">ver. 29-34</A>.

 Thus great was Solomon, but our Lord Jesus was greater than he

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:42">Matt. xii. 42</A>),

 though he took upon him the form of a servant; for divinity, in its
 lowest humiliation, infinitely transcends royalty in its highest
 elevation.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 So king Solomon was king over all Israel.
 &nbsp; 2 And these <I>were</I> the princes which he had; Azariah the son of
 Zadok the priest,
 &nbsp; 3 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat
 the son of Ahilud, the recorder.
 &nbsp; 4 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <I>was</I> over the host: and
 Zadok and Abiathar <I>were</I> the priests:
 &nbsp; 5 And Azariah the son of Nathan <I>was</I> over the officers: and
 Zabud the son of Nathan <I>was</I> principal officer, <I>and</I> the king's
 friend:
 &nbsp; 6 And Ahishar <I>was</I> over the household: and Adoniram the son of
 Abda <I>was</I> over the tribute.
 &nbsp; 7 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which
 provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his
 month in a year made provision.
 &nbsp; 8 And these <I>are</I> their names: The son of Hur, in mount
 Ephraim:
 &nbsp; 9 The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh,
 and Elon-beth-hanan:
 &nbsp; 10 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him <I>pertained</I> Sochoh, and
 all the land of Hepher:
 &nbsp; 11 The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had
 Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
 &nbsp; 12 Baana the son of Ahilud; <I>to him pertained</I> Taanach and
 Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which <I>is</I> by Zartanah beneath
 Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, <I>even</I> unto <I>the place
 that is</I> beyond Jokneam:
 &nbsp; 13 The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him <I>pertained</I> the
 towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which <I>are</I> in Gilead; to him
 <I>also pertained</I> the region of Argob, which <I>is</I> in Bashan,
 threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars:
 &nbsp; 14 Ahinadab the son of Iddo <I>had</I> Mahanaim:
 &nbsp; 15 Ahimaaz <I>was</I> in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter
 of Solomon to wife:
 &nbsp; 16 Baanah the son of Hushai <I>was</I> in Asher and in Aloth:
 &nbsp; 17 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:
 &nbsp; 18 Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:
 &nbsp; 19 Geber the son of Uri <I>was</I> in the country of Gilead, <I>in</I>
 the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of
 Bashan; and <I>he was</I> the only officer which <I>was</I> in the land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Solomon upon his throne 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>So king Solomon was king,</I> that is, he was confirmed and
 established king <I>over all Israel,</I> and not, as his successors, 
 only over two tribes. He was a king, that is, he did the work and duty 
 of a king, with the wisdom God had given him. Those preserve the name 
 and honour of their place that mind the business of it and make 
 conscience of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great officers of his court, in the choice of whom, no doubt, 
 his wisdom much appeared. It is observable, 

 1. That several of them are the same that were in his father's time.
 Zadok and Abiathar were then priests

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:25">2 Sam. xx. 25</A>),

 so they were now; only then Abiathar had the precedency, now Zadok.
 Jehoshaphat was then recorder, or keeper of the great seal, so he was 
 now. Benaiah, in his father's time, was a principal man in military 
 affairs, and so he was now. Shisha was his father's scribe, and his 
 sons were his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Solomon, though a wise man, would not affect to be wiser than his
 father in this matter. When sons come to inherit their father's wealth, 
 honour, and power, it is a piece of respect to their memory, 
 <I>c&aelig;teris paribus--where it can properly be done,</I> to employ those 
 whom they employed, and trust those whom they trusted.  Many pride 
 themselves in being the reverse of their good parents.

 2.  The rest were priests' sons. His prime-minister of state was
 <I>Azariah the son of Zadok the priest.</I> Two others of the first 
 rank were the sons of Nathan the prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 In preferring them he testified the grateful respect he had for their
 good father, whom he loved <I>in the name of a prophet.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The purveyors for his household, whose business it was to send in 
 provisions from several parts of the country, for the king's tables and 
 cellars 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)
 
 and for his stables
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>),

 that thus, 

 1. His house might always be well furnished at the best hand. Let great
 men learn hence good house-keeping, to be generous in spending 
 according to their ability, but prudent in providing. It is the 
 character of the virtuous woman that she <I>bringeth her food from 
 afar</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:14">Prov. xxxi. 14</A>),

 not far-fetched and dear-bought, but the contrary, every thing bought
 where it is cheapest. 

 2. That thus he himself, and those who immediately attended him, might
 be eased of a great deal of care, and the more closely apply themselves
 to the business of the state, not troubled about much serving,
 provision for that being got ready to their hand.  

 3. That thus all the parts of the kingdom might be equally benefited by
 the taking off of the commodities that were the productions of their 
 country and the circulating of the coin. Industry would hereby be 
 encouraged, and consequently wealth increased, even in those tribes 
 that lay most remote from the court. The providence of God extends 
 itself to all <I>places of his dominions</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:22">Ps. ciii. 22</A>);

 so should the prudence and care of princes. 

 4. The dividing of this trust into so many hands was prudent, that no
 man might be continually burdened with the care of it nor grow 
 exorbitantly rich with the profit of it, but that Solomon might have 
 those, in every district, who, having a dependence upon the court, 
 would be serviceable to him and his interest as there was occasion. 
 These commissioners of the victualling-office, not for the army or navy 
 (Solomon was engaged in no war), but for the household, are here named, 
 several of them only by their surnames, as great men commonly call 
 their servants: <I>Ben-hur, Ben-dekar, &c.,</I> though several of them 
 have also their proper names prefixed. Two of them married Solomon's 
 daughters, Ben-Abinadab

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)
 
 and Ahimaaz
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and no disparagement to them to marry men of business. Better match
 with the officers of their father's court that were Israelites than 
 with the sons of princes that were <I>strangers to the covenant of 
 promise.</I> The son of Geber was in Ramoth-Gilead

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and Geber himself was in the country of Sihon and Og, which included
 that and Mahanaim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He is therefore said to be <I>the only officer in that land,</I>
 because the other two, mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>,

 depended on him, and were subordinate to him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20 Judah and Israel <I>were</I> many, as the sand which <I>is</I> by the
 sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.
 &nbsp; 21 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto
 the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they
 brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
 &nbsp; 22 And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of
 fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,
 &nbsp; 23 Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an
 hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and
 fatted fowl.
 &nbsp; 24 For he had dominion over all <I>the region</I> on this side the
 river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this
 side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.
 &nbsp; 25 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine
 and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days
 of Solomon.
 &nbsp; 26 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his
 chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.
 &nbsp; 27 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and
 for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his
 month: they lacked nothing.
 &nbsp; 28 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought
 they unto the place where <I>the officers</I> were, every man
 according to his charge.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Such a kingdom, and such a court, surely never any prince had, as 
 Solomon's are here described to be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Such a kingdom. Never did the crown of Israel shine so brightly as 
 it did when Solomon wore it, never in his father's days, never in the 
 days of any of his successors; nor was that kingdom ever so glorious a 
 type of the kingdom of the Messiah as it was then. The account here 
 given of it is such as fully answers the prophecies which we have 
 concerning it in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:1-20">Ps. lxxii.</A>,

 which is a psalm for Solomon, but with reference to Christ.

 1. The territories of his kingdom were large and its tributaries many;
 so it was foretold that he should <I>have dominion from sea to sea,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:8-11">Ps. lxxii. 8-11</A>.

 Solomon reigned not only over all Israel, who were his subjects by
 choice, but over all the neighbouring kingdoms, who were his subjects 
 by constraint. All the princes from the river Euphrates, north-east to 
 the border of Egypt south-west, not only added to his honour by doing 
 him homage and holding their crowns from him, but added to his wealth 
 by serving him, and bringing him presents,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 David, by his successful wars, compelled them to this subjection, and
 Solomon, by his admirable wisdom, made it easy and reasonable; for it 
 is fit that the fool should be <I>servant to the wise in heart.</I> If 
 they gave him presents, he gave them instructions, and still <I>taught 
 the people knowledge,</I> not only his own people, but those of other 
 nations: and <I>wisdom is better than gold.</I> He had <I>peace on all 
 sides,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 None of all the nations that were subject to him offered to shake off
 his yoke, or to give him any disturbance, but rather thought themselves 
 happy in their dependence upon him. Herein his kingdom typified the 
 Messiah's; for to him it is promised that he shall have the <I>heathen 
 for his inheritance</I> and that <I>princes shall worship him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:6,7,53:12">Isa. xlix. 6, 7; liii. 12</A>.

 2. The subjects of his kingdom and its inhabitants, were many and
 cheerful.

 (1.) They were numerous and country was exceedingly populous

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Judah and Israel were many,</I> and that good land was sufficient to
 maintain them all.  <I>They were as the sand of the sea in 
 multitude.</I> Now was fulfilled the promise made to Abraham concerning 
 the increase of his seed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:17">Gen. xxii. 17</A>),

 as well as that concerning the extent of their dominion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:18">Gen. xv. 18</A>.
 
 This was their strength and beauty, the honour of their prince, the
 terror of their enemies, and an advancement of the wealth of the 
 nation. If they grew so numerous that the place was any where too 
 strait for them, they might remove with advantage into the countries 
 that were subject to them.  God's spiritual Israel are many, at least 
 they will be so when they come all together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9">Rev. vii. 9</A>.

 (2.) They were easy, they dwelt safely, or with confidence and 
 assurance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 not jealous of their king or of his officers, not disaffected either to
 him or one to another, nor under any apprehension or danger from 
 enemies foreign or domestic. They were happy and knew it, safe and 
 willing to think themselves so. They dwelt every man under <I>his vine 
 and fig-tree.</I> Solomon invaded no man's property, took not to 
 himself their vineyards and olive-yards, as sometimes was the manner of 
 the king

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:14">1 Sam. viii. 14</A>),
 
 but what they had they could call their own: he protected every man in
 the possession and enjoyment of his property. Those that had vines and 
 fig-trees ate the fruit of them themselves; and so great was the peace 
 of the country that they might, if they pleased, dwell as safely under 
 the shadow of them as within the walls of a city. Or, because it was 
 usual to have <I>vines by the sides of their houses</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:3">Ps. cxxviii. 3</A>),
 
 they are said to <I>dwell under their vines.</I>

 (3.) They were cheerful in the use of their plenty, <I>eating and
 drinking, and making merry,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Solomon did not only keep a good table himself, but enabled all his
 subjects, according to their rank, to do so too, and taught them that 
 God gave them their abundance that they might use it soberly and 
 pleasantly, not that they might hoard it up. <I>There is nothing 
 better</I> than for a man to <I>eat the labour of his hands</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:24">Eccl. ii. 24</A>),

 and that <I>with a merry heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:7">Eccl. ix. 7</A>.

 His father, in the Psalms, had led his people into the comforts of
 communion with God, and now he led them into the comfortable use of the 
 good things of this life. This pleasant posture of Israel's affairs 
 extended, in place, from Dan to Beer-sheba--no part of the country was 
 exposed nor upon any account uneasy; and it continued a long time, 
 <I>all the days of Solomon,</I> without any material interruption. Go 
 where you would, you might see all the marks of plenty, peace, and 
 satisfaction. The spiritual peace, and joy, and holy security, of all 
 the faithful subjects of the Lord Jesus were typified by this. <I>The 
 kingdom of God is not,</I> as Solomon's was, <I>meat and drink,</I> 
 but, what is infinitely better, <I>righteousness, and peace, and joy in 
 the Holy Ghost.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Such a court Solomon kept as can scarcely be paralleled. We may 
 guess at the vast number of his attendants, and the great resort there 
 was to him, by the provision that was made daily for his table. Of 
 bread there were so many measures of flour and meal as, it is computed, 
 would richly serve 3000 men (Carellus computes above 4800 men), and the 
 provision of flesh 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)

 was rather more in proportion. What vast quantities were here of beef,
 mutton, and venison, and the choicest of all <I>fatted things,</I> as 
 some read that which we translate <I>fatted fowl!</I> Ahasuerus, once 
 in his reign, made a <I>great feast,</I> to <I>show the riches of his 
 kingdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:3,4">Esth. i. 3, 4</A>.

 But it was much more the honour of Solomon that he kept a constant
 table and a very noble one, not of dainties or deceitful meats (he 
 himself witnessed against them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:3">Prov. xxiii. 3</A>),

 but substantial food, for the entertainment of those who came to hear
 his wisdom. Thus Christ fed those whom he taught, 5000 at a time, more 
 than ever Solomon's table would entertain at once: and all believers 
 have in him a continual feast. Herein he far outdoes Solomon, that he 
 feeds all his subjects, not with the bread that perishes, but <I>with 
 that which endures to eternal life.</I> It added much both to the 
 strength and glory of Solomon's kingdom that he had such abundance of 
 horses, 40,000 for chariots and 12,000 for his troops, 1000 horse, 
 perhaps, in every tribe, for the preserving of the public peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.
 
 God had commanded that their king should not multiply horses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:16">Deut. xvii. 16</A>),

 nor, according to the account here given, considering the extent and
 wealth of Solomon's kingdom, did he multiply horses in proportion to 
 his neighbours; for we find even the Philistines bringing into the 
 field 30,000 chariots

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:5">1 Sam. xiii. 5</A>)
 
 and the Syrians at least 40,000 horse,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+10:18">2 Sam. x. 18</A>.

 The same officers that provided for his house provided also for his
 stable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.

 Every one knew his place, and work, and time; and so this great court
 was kept without confusion. Solomon, that had vast incomes, lived at a 
 vast expense, and perhaps wrote that with application to himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:11">Eccl. v. 11</A>.

 <I>When goods increase those are increased that eat them; and what good
 is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their 
 eyes,</I> unless withal they have the satisfaction of doing good with 
 them?</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>29 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding
 much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that <I>is</I> on the
 sea shore.
 &nbsp; 30 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children
 of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 31 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
 Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame
 was in all nations round about.
 &nbsp; 32 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a
 thousand and five.
 &nbsp; 33 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that <I>is</I> in
 Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he
 spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of
 fishes.
 &nbsp; 34 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
 from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon's wisdom was more his glory than his wealth, and here we have a 
 general account of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The fountain of his wisdom: <I>God gave it him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 He owns it himself. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:6">Prov. ii. 6</A>,

 <I>The Lord giveth wisdom.</I> He gives the powers of reason

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:36">Job xxxviii. 36</A>),

 preserves and improves them. The ordinary advances of them are owing to
 his providence, the sanctification of them to his grace, and this 
 extraordinary pitch at which they arrived in Solomon to a special grant 
 of his favour to him in answer to prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The fulness of it: <I>He had wisdom and understanding, exceeding 
 much,</I> great knowledge of distant countries and the histories of 
 former times, a quickness of thought, strength of memory, and clearness 
 of judgment, such as never any man had. It is called <I>largeness of 
 heart;</I> for the heart is often put for the intellectual powers. He 
 had a vast compass of knowledge, could take things entire, and had an 
 admirable faculty of laying things together. Some, by his <I>largeness 
 of heart,</I> understand his courage and boldness, and that great 
 assurance with which he delivered his dictates and determinations. Or 
 it may be meant of his disposition to do good with his knowledge. He 
 was very free and communicative, had the gift of utterance as well as 
 wisdom, was as free of his learning as he was of his meat, and grudged 
 neither to any that were about him. Note, It is very desirable that 
 those who have large gifts of any kind should have large hearts to use 
 them for the good of others; and this is <I>from the hand of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:24">Eccl. ii. 24</A>.
 
 He shall <I>enlarge the heart,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:32">Ps. cxix. 32</A>.

 The greatness of Solomon's wisdom is illustrated by comparison. Chaldea
 and Egypt were nations famous for learning; thence the Greeks borrowed 
 theirs; but the greatest scholars of these nations came short of 
 Solomon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 If nature excels art, much more does grace. The knowledge which God
 gives by special favour goes beyond that which man gets by his own 
 labour. Some wise men there were in Solomon's time, who were in great 
 repute, particularly Heman, and others who were Levites, and employed 
 by David in the temple-music,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:19">1 Chron. xv. 19</A>.

 Heman was <I>his seer in the word of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+25:5">1 Chron. xxv. 5</A>.

 Chalcol and Darda were own brothers, and they also were noted for
 learning and wisdom. But <I>Solomon excelled them all</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 he out-did them and confounded them; his counsel was much more
 valuable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The fame of it. It was talked of <I>in all nations round 
 about.</I> His great wealth and glory made his wisdom much more 
 illustrious, and have him those opportunities of showing it which those 
 cannot have that live in poverty and obscurity. The jewel of wisdom may 
 receive great advantage by the setting of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The fruits of it; by these the tree is known: he did not bury his 
 talent, but showed his wisdom,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In his compositions. Those in divinity, written by divine 
 inspiration, are not mentioned here, for they are extant, and will 
 remain to the world's end monuments of his wisdom, and are, as other 
 parts of scripture, of use to make us <I>wise unto salvation.</I> But, 
 besides these, it appears by what he spoke, or dictated to be written 
 from him, 

 (1.) That he was a moralist, and a man of great prudence, for he spoke 
 3000 <I>proverbs,</I> wise sayings, apophthegms, of admirable use for 
 the conduct of human life. The world is much governed by proverbs, and 
 was never better furnished with useful ones than by Solomon. Whether 
 those proverbs of Solomon that we have were any part of the 3000 is 
 uncertain.

 (2.) That he was a poet and a man of great wit: <I>His songs were</I> 
 1005, of which one only is extant, because that only was divinely 
 inspired, which is therefore called his <I>Song of songs.</I> His wise 
 instructions were communicated by proverbs, that they might be familiar 
 to those whom he designed to teach and ready on all occasions, and by 
 <I>songs,</I> that they might be pleasant and move the affections.

 (3.) That he was a natural philosopher, and a man of great learning and 
 insight into the mysteries of nature. From his own and others' 
 observations and experience, he wrote both of plants and animals

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 descriptions of their natures and qualities, and (some think) of the
 medicinal use of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In his conversation. There came persons from all parts, who were 
 more inquisitive after knowledge than their neighbours, to <I>hear the 
 wisdom of Solomon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Kings that had heard of it sent their ambassadors to hear it and to
 bring them instructions from it.  Solomon's court was the staple of 
 learning, and the rendezvous of philosophers, that is, the lovers of 
 wisdom, who all came to light their candle at his lamp and to borrow 
 from him. Let those who magnify the modern learning above that of the 
 ancients produce such a treasure of knowledge any where in these latter 
 ages as that was which Solomon was master of; yet this puts an honour 
 upon human learning, that Solomon was praised for it, and recommends it 
 to the great men of the earth, as well worthy their diligent search.  
 But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Solomon was, herein, a type of Christ, <I>in whom are 
 hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,</I> and hidden for
 use; for he is <I>made of God to us wisdom.</I></P>
