 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet
 Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not
 live.
 &nbsp; 2 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying,
 &nbsp; 3 I beseech thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, remember now how I have walked before
 thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done <I>that which
 is</I> good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
 &nbsp; 4 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the
 middle court, that the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came to him, saying,
 &nbsp; 5 Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus
 saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy
 prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the
 third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 6 And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will
 deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of
 Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for
 my servant David's sake.
 &nbsp; 7 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid
 <I>it</I> on the boil, and he recovered.
 &nbsp; 8 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What <I>shall be</I> the sign that
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> the third day?
 &nbsp; 9 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow
 go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?
 &nbsp; 10 And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to
 go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten
 degrees.
 &nbsp; 11 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and he brought
 the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the
 dial of Ahaz.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The historian, having shown us blaspheming Sennacherib destroyed in the 
 midst of the prospects of life, here shows us praying Hezekiah 
 delivered in the midst of the prospects of death--the days of the former
 shortened, of the latter prolonged.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is Hezekiah's sickness. <I>In those days,</I> that is, in the 
 same year in which the king of Assyria besieged Jerusalem; for he 
 reigning <I>reigned?</I> in all twenty-nine years, and surviving this 
 fifteen years, this must be in his fourteenth year, and so was that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:13"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 13</A>.

 Some think it was at the time that the Assyrian army was besieging the
 city or preparing for it, because God promises 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>I will defend the city,</I> which promise was afterwards repeated,
 when the danger came to be most imminent,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+19:34"><I>ch.</I> xix. 34</A>.

 Others think it was soon after the defeat of Sennacherib; and then it 
 shows us the uncertainty of all our comforts in this world. Hezekiah, 
 in the midst of his triumphs in the favour of God, and over the forces 
 of his enemies, is seized with sickness, and under the arrest of death. 
 We must therefore always rejoice with trembling. It should seem he was 
 sick of the plague, for we read of the boil or plague-sore, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The same disease which was killing to the Assyrians was trying to him;
 God took it from him, and put it upon his enemies. Neither greatness 
 nor goodness can exempt us from sickness, from sore and mortal 
 sicknesses.  Hezekiah, lately favoured of heaven above most men, yet is 
 sick unto death--in the midst of his days (under forty) and yet sick 
 and dying; and perhaps he was the more apprehensive of its being fatal 
 to him because his father died when he was about his age, two or three 
 years younger. "In the midst of life we are in death."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Warning brought him to prepare for death. It is brought by Isaiah, 
 who had been twice, as stated in the former chapter, a messenger of 
 good tidings to him. We cannot expect to receive from God's prophets 
 any other than what they have received from the Lord, and we must 
 welcome that, be it pleasing or unpleasing. The prophet tells him, 

 1.  That his disease is mortal, and, if he be not recovered by a
 miracle of mercy, will certainly be fatal: <I>Thou shalt die, and not 
 live.</I> 

 2.  That therefore he must, with all speed, get ready for death: <I>Set
 thy house in order.</I> This we should feel highly concerned to do when 
 we are in health, but are most loudly called to do when we come to be 
 sick. Set the heart in order by renewed acts of repentance, and faith, 
 and resignation to God, with cheerful farewells to this world and 
 welcomes to another; and, if not done before (which is the best and 
 wisest course), set the house in order, make thy will, settle thy
 estate, put thy affairs in the best posture thou canst, for the ease of 
 those that shall come after thee. Isaiah speaks not to Hezekiah of his 
 <I>kingdom,</I> only of his <I>house.</I> David, being a prophet, had 
 authority to appoint who should reign after him, but other kings did 
 not pretend to bequeath their crowns as part of their goods and 
 chattels.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His prayer hereupon: <I>He prayed unto the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Is any sick? Let him be prayed for, let him be prayed with, and let him
 pray.  Hezekiah had found, as recorded in the foregoing chapter, that 
 it was not in vain to wait upon God, but that the prayers of faith 
 bring in answers of peace; therefore will he <I>call upon God as long 
 as he lives.</I> Happy experiences of the prevalency of prayer are 
 engagements and encouragements to continue instant in prayer. He had 
 now received the sentence of death within himself, and, if it was 
 reversible, it must be reversed by prayer. When God purposes mercy he 
 will, <I>for this, be enquired of,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:37">Ezek. xxxvi. 37</A>.

 We have not if we ask not, or ask amiss. If the sentence was
 irreversible, yet prayer is one of the best preparations for death, 
 because by it we fetch in strength and grace from God to enable us to 
 finish well.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The circumstances of this prayer. 

 (1.) He <I>turned his face to the wall,</I> probably as he lay in his
 bed. This he did perhaps for privacy; he could not retire to his closet 
 as he used to do, but he retired as well as he could, turned from the 
 company that were about him, to converse with God. When we cannot be so 
 private as we would be in our devotions, nor perform them with the 
 usual outward expressions of reverence and solemnity, yet we must not 
 therefore omit them, but compose ourselves to them as well as we can. 
 Or, as some think, he turned his face towards the temple, to show how 
 willingly he would have gone up thither, to pray this prayer (as he 
 did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+19:1,14"><I>ch.</I> xix. 1, 14</A>),

 if he had been able, and remembering what encouragements were given to 
 all the prayers that should be made in or towards that house. Christ is 
 our temple; to him we must have an eye in all our prayers, for no man, 
 no service, <I>comes to the Father but by him.</I> 

 (2.) He <I>wept sorely.</I> Some gather from this that he was unwilling
 to die. It is in the nature of man to have some dread of the separation 
 of soul and body, and it was not strange if the Old-Testament saints, 
 to whom another world was but darkly revealed, were not so willing to 
 leave this as Paul and other New-Testament saints were. There was also 
 something peculiar in Hezekiah's case: he was now in the midst of his 
 usefulness, had begun a good work of reformation, which he feared 
 would, through the corruption of the people, fall to the ground, if he 
 should die.  If this was before the defeat of the Assyrian army, as 
 some think, he might therefore be loth to die, because his kingdom was 
 in imminent danger of being ruined. However, it does not appear that he 
 had now any son: Manasseh, that succeeded him, was not born till three 
 years after; and, if he should die childless, both the peace of his 
 kingdom and the promise to David would be in danger. But perhaps these 
 were only tears of importunity, and expressions of a lively affection 
 in prayer. Jacob wept and made supplication; and our blessed Saviour, 
 though most willing to die, yet offered up strong cries, with tears, to 
 him whom he knew to be <I>able to save him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>.

 Let Hezekiah's prayer interpret his tears, and in <I>that</I> we find
 nothing that intimates him to have been under any of that fear of death 
 which has either bondage or torment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The prayer itself: "<I>Remember now, O Lord! how I have walked 
 before thee in truth;</I> and either spare me to live, that I may 
 continue thus to walk, if, if my work be done, receive me to that glory 
 which thou hast prepared for those that have thus walked." Observe 
 here, 

 (1.) The description of Hezekiah's piety. He had had his conversation
 in the world with right intentions ("I have walked before thee, as 
 under thy eye and with an eye ever towards thee"), from a right 
 principle ("<I>in truth, and with an upright heart</I>"), and by a
 right rule--"<I>I have done that which is good in thy sight.</I>"

 (2.) The comfort he now had in reflecting upon it; it made his sick-bed
 easy. Note, The testimony of conscience for us that we have walked with 
 God in our integrity will be much our support and rejoicing when we 
 come to look death in the face,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:12">2 Cor. i. 12</A>.

 (3.) The humble mention he makes of it to God. <I>Lord, remember it
 now;</I> not as if God needed to be put in mind of any thing by us (he 
 is greater than our hearts, and knows all things), or as if the reward 
 were of debt, and might be demanded as due (it is Christ's 
 righteousness only that is the purchase of mercy and grace); but our 
 own sincerity may be pleaded as the condition of the covenant which God 
 has wrought in us: "It is the work of thy own hands. Lord, own it." 
 Hezekiah does not pray, "Lord, spare me," or, "Lord, take me; God's 
 will be done;" but, <I>Lord, remember me; whether I live or die, let me 
 be thine.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The answer which God immediately gave to this prayer of Hezekiah. 
 The prophet had got but to the middle court when he was sent back with 
 another message to Hezekiah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>),

 to tell him that he should recover; not that there is with God yea and
 nay, or that he ever says and unsays; but upon Hezekiah's prayer, which 
 he foresaw and which his Spirit inclined him to, God did that for him 
 which otherwise he would not have done. God here calls Hezekiah <I>the 
 captain of his people,</I> to intimate that he would reprieve him for 
 his people's sake, because, in this time of war, they could ill spare 
 such a captain: he calls himself <I>the God of David,</I> to intimate 
 that he would reprieve him out of a regard to the covenant made with 
 David and the promise that he would always ordain a lamp for him. In 
 this answer, 

 1. God honours his prayers by the notice he takes of them and the
 reference he has to them in this message: <I>I have heard thy prayers, 
 I have seen thy tears.</I> Prayers that have much life and affection in 
 them are in a special manner pleasing to God. 

 2. God exceeds his prayers; he only begged that God would remember his
 integrity, but God here promises

 (1.) To restore him from his illness: <I>I will heal thee.</I> Diseases
 are his servants; as they go where he sends them, so they come when he 
 remands them.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:8,9">Matt. viii. 8, 9</A>.

 <I>I am the Lord that healeth thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:26">Exod. xv. 26</A>.

 (2.) To restore him to such a degree of health that <I>on the third day
 he should go up to the house of the Lord,</I> to return thanks. God 
 knew Hezekiah's heart, how dearly he loved the habitation of God's 
 house and the place where his honour dwelt, and that as soon as he was 
 well he would go to attend on public ordinances; thitherward he turned 
 his face when he was sick, and thitherward he would turn his feet when 
 he was recovered; and therefore, because nothing would please him 
 better, he promises him this, <I>Let my soul live, and it shall praise 
 thee.</I> The man whom Christ healed was soon after <I>found in the 
 temple,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:14">John v. 14</A>.

 (3.) To add fifteen years to his life. This would not bring him to be
 an old man; it would reach but to fifty-four or fifty-five; yet that 
 was longer than he had lately expected to live. His lease was renewed, 
 which he thought was expiring.  We have not the instance of any other 
 that was told before-hand just how long he should live; that good man 
 no doubt made a good use of it; but God has wisely kept us at 
 uncertainties, that we may be always ready. 

 (4.) To deliver Jerusalem from the king of Assyria, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 This was the thing which Hezekiah's heart was upon a much as his own
 recovery, and therefore the promise of this is here repeated. If this 
 was after the raising of the siege, yet there was cause to fear 
 Sennacherib's rallying again.  "No," says God, "<I>I will defend this 
 city.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The means which were to be used for his recovery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Isaiah was his physician. He ordered an outward application, a very
 cheap and common thing: "Lay a <I>lump of figs to the boil,</I> to 
 ripen it and bring it to a head, that the matter of the disease may be 
 discharged that way." This might contribute something to the cure, and 
 yet, considering to what a height the disease had come, and how 
 suddenly it was checked, the cure was no less than miraculous. Note,

 1. It is our duty, when we are sick, to make use of such means as are
 proper to help nature, else we do not trust God, but tempt him. 

 2.  Plain and ordinary medicines must not be despised, for many such
 God has graciously made serviceable to man, in consideration of the 
 poor.  

 3. What God appoints he will bless and make effectual.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The sign which was given for the encouragement of his faith. 

 1. He begged it, not in any distrust of the power or promise of God, or
 as if he staggered at that, but because he looked upon the things 
 promised to be very great things and worthy to be so confirmed, and 
 because it had been usual with God thus to glorify himself and favour 
 his people; and he remembered how much God was displeased with his 
 father for refusing to ask a sign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:10-12">Isa. vii. 10-12</A>.

 Observe, Hezekiah asked <I>What is the sign,</I> not that I shall go up
 to the thrones of judgment or up to the gate, but <I>up to the house of 
 the Lord?</I> He desired to recover that he might glorify God <I>in the 
 gates of the daughter of Zion.</I> It is not worth while to live for 
 any other purpose than to serve God.  

 2. It was put to his choice whether the sun should go back or go
 forward; for it was equal to Omnipotence, and it would be the more 
 likely to confirm his faith if he chose that which he thought the more 
 difficult of the two. Perhaps to this that of this prophet may refer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:11">Isa. xlv. 11</A>),

 <I>Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work
 of my hands command you me.</I> It is supposed that the degrees were 
 half hours, and that it was just noon when the proposal was made, and 
 the question is, "Shall the sun go back to its place at seven in the 
 morning or forward to its place at five in the evening?" 

 3. He humbly desired the sun might go back ten degrees, because, though
 either would be a great miracle, yet, it being the natural course of 
 the sun to go forward, its going back would seem more strange, and 
 would be more significant of Hezekiah's <I>returning to the days of his 
 youth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:25">Job xxxiii. 25</A>)

 and the lengthening out of the day of his life. It was accordingly
 done, upon the prayer of Isaiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 He <I>cried unto the Lord</I> by special warrant and direction, and God
 brought the sun back ten degrees, which appeared to Hezekiah (for the 
 sign was intended for him) by the going back of the shadow upon the 
 dial of Ahaz, which, it is likely, he could see through his 
 chamber-window; and the same was observed upon all other dials, even in 
 Babylon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:31">2 Chron. xxxii. 31</A>.

 Whether this retrograde motion of the sun was gradual or <I>per
 saltum--suddenly</I>--whether it went back at the same pace that it 
 used to go forward, which would make the day ten hours longer than 
 usual--or whether it darted back on a sudden, and, after continuing a 
 little while, was restored again to its usual place, so that no change 
 was made in the state of the heavenly bodies (as the learned bishop 
 Patrick thinks)--we are not told; but this work of wonder shows the 
 power of God in heaven as well as on earth, the great notice he takes 
 of prayer, and the great favour he bears to his chosen. The most 
 plausible idolatry of the heathen was theirs that worshipped the sun; 
 yet that was hereby convicted of the most egregious folly and 
 absurdity, for by this it appeared that their god was under the check 
 of the God of Israel. Dr. Lightfoot suggests that the fifteen songs of 
 degrees

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:1-134:3">Ps. cxx.</A>,

 &c.) might perhaps be so called because selected by
 Hezekiah to be sung to his stringed instruments 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:20">Isa. xxxviii. 20</A>)

 in remembrance of the degrees on the dial which the sun went back and
 the fifteen years added to his life; and he observes how much of these 
 psalms is applicable to Jerusalem's distress and deliverance and 
 Hezekiah's sickness and recovery.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 At that time Berodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of
 Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had
 heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
 &nbsp; 13 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and showed them all the
 house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the
 spices, and the precious ointment, and <I>all</I> the house of his
 armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was
 nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah
 showed them not.
 &nbsp; 14 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said
 unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto
 thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, <I>even</I>
 from Babylon.
 &nbsp; 15 And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And
 Hezekiah answered, All <I>the things</I> that <I>are</I> in mine house have
 they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not
 showed them.
 &nbsp; 16 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 17 Behold, the days come, that all that <I>is</I> in thine house,
 and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day,
 shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 18 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
 beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the
 palace of the king of Babylon.
 &nbsp; 19 Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good <I>is</I> the word of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> which thou hast spoken. And he said, <I>Is it</I> not <I>good,</I> if
 peace and truth be in my days?
 &nbsp; 20 And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and
 how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the
 city, <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
 kings of Judah?
 &nbsp; 21 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son
 reigned in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. An embassy sent to Hezekiah by the king of Babylon, to congratulate 
 him on his recovery,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The kings of Babylon had hitherto been only deputies and tributaries to
 the kings of Assyria, and Nineveh was the royal city. We find Babylon 
 subject to the king of Assyria,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:24"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 24</A>.

 But this king of Babylon began to set up for himself, and by degrees
 things were so changed that Assyria became subject to the kings of 
 Babylon. This king of Babylon sent to compliment Hezekiah, and 
 ingratiate himself with him upon a double account. 

 1. Upon the account of religion. The Babylonians worshipped the sun,
 and, perceiving what honour their god had done to Hezekiah, in going 
 back for his sake, they thought themselves obliged to do honour to him 
 likewise.  It is good having those our friends whom we perceive to be 
 the favourites of heaven. 

 2. Upon the account of civil interest.  If the king of Babylon was now
 mediating a revolt from the king of Assyria, it was policy to get 
 Hezekiah into his interest, in answer to whose prayers, and for whose 
 protection, heaven had given that fatal blow to the king of Assyria. He 
 found himself obliged to Hezekiah, and his God, for the weakening of 
 the Assyrian forces, and had reason to think he could not have a more 
 powerful and valuable ally than one that had so good an interest in the 
 upper world. He therefore made his court to him with all possible 
 respect by ambassadors, letters, and a present.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The kind entertainment Hezekiah gave to these ambassadors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 It was his duty to be civil to them, and receive them with the respect
 due to ambassadors; but he exceeded, and was courteous to a fault.

 1.  He was too fond of them. He <I>hearkened unto them.</I> Though they
 were idolaters, yet he became intimate with them, was forward to come 
 into a confederacy with the king their master, and granted them all 
 they came for. He was more open and free than he should have been, and 
 stood not so much upon his guard. What reason had he that was in 
 covenant with God so eagerly to catch at an alliance with a heathen 
 prince, or to value himself at all upon his respectful notice? What 
 honour could this embassy add to one whom God had so highly favoured, 
 that he should please himself so much with it? 

 2. He was too fond of showing them his palace, his treasures, and his
 magazines, that they might see, and might report to their master, what 
 a great king he was, and how well worthy of the honour their master did 
 him. It is not said that he showed them the temple, the book of the 
 law, and the manner of his worship, that he might proselyte them to the 
 true religion, which he had now a fair opportunity of doing; but in 
 compliment to them, lest he should affront them, he waived that, and 
 showed them the rich furniture of his closet, that house of his 
 precious things, the wealth he had heaped up since the king of Assyria 
 had emptied his coffers, his <I>silver, and gold, and spices.</I> All 
 the valuable things he had he showed them, either himself or by his 
 officers. And what harm was there in this? What is more commonly, and 
 (as we think) more innocently, done, than to show strangers the riches 
 and rarities of a country--to show our friends our houses and their 
 furniture, our gardens, stables, and libraries? But if we do this in 
 the pride of our hearts, as Hezekiah did, to gain applause from men, 
 and not giving praise to God, it turns into sin to us, as it did to 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The examination of Hezekiah concerning this matter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 Isaiah, who had often been his comforter, is now his reprover. The
 blessed Spirit is both,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:7,8">John xvi. 7, 8</A>.

 Ministers must be both, as there is occasion. Isaiah spoke in God's
 name, and therefore called him to account as one having authority: "Who 
 are these? Whence come they? What is their business? What have they 
 seen?" Hezekiah not only submitted to the examination (did not ask him, 
 "Why should you concern yourself and question me about this affair?"), 
 but made an ingenuous confession: <I>There is nothing among my 
 treasures that I have not shown them.</I> Why then did he not bring 
 them to Isaiah, and show him to them who was without doubt the best 
 treasure he had in his dominions, and who by his prayers and prophecies 
 had been instrumental in all those wonders which these ambassadors came 
 to enquire into? I hope Hezekiah had the same value for Isaiah now that 
 he had in his distress; but it would have become him to show it by 
 bringing these ambassadors to him in the first place, which might have 
 prevented the false step he took.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The sentence passed upon him for his pride and vanity, and the too 
 great relish he had of the things of the world, after that intimate 
 acquaintance he had so lately been admitted into with divine things. 
 The sentence is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>),

 1. That the treasures he was so proud of should hereafter become a
 prey, and his family should be robbed of them all. It is just with God 
 to take that from us which we make the matter of our pride and in which 
 we put our confidence. 

 2. That the king of Babylon, with whom he was so fond of an alliance,
 should be the enemy that should make a prey of them. Not that it was 
 for this sin that that judgment should be brought upon them: the sins 
 of Manasseh, his idolatries and murders, were the cause of that 
 calamity; but it is now foretold to Hezekiah, to convince him of the 
 folly of his pride and of the value he had for the king of Babylon, and 
 to make him ashamed of it. Hezekiah was fond of assisting the king of 
 Babylon to rise, and to reduce the exorbitant power of the kings of 
 Assyria; but he is told that the snake he is cherishing will ere long 
 sting the bosom that cherishes it, and that his royal seed shall become 
 the king of Babylon's slave (which was fulfilled,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:1-7">Dan. i. 1</A>,

 &c.), than which there could not be any thing more mortifying to
 Hezekiah to think of. Babylon will be the ruin of those that are fond 
 of Babylon. Wise therefore and happy are those that <I>come out from 
 her,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:4">Rev. xviii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Hezekiah's humble and patient submission to this sentence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 Observe how he argues himself into this submission.

 1. He lays it down for a truth that "<I>good is the word of the
 Lord,</I> even this word, though a threatening; for every word of his 
 is so. It is not only just, but good; for, as he does no wrong to any, 
 so he means no hurt to good men. It is good; for he will bring good out 
 of it, and do me good by the foresight of it." We should believe this 
 concerning every providence, that it is good, is working for good. 

 2.  He takes notice of that in this word which was good, that he should
 not live to see this evil, much less to share in it. He makes the best 
 of the bad: "Is it not good? Yes, certainly it is, and better than I 
 deserve." Note,

 (1.) True penitents, when they are under divine rebukes, call them not
 only just, but good; not only submit to the punishment of their 
 iniquity, but accept of it. So Hezekiah did, and by this it appeared 
 that he was indeed <I>humbled for the pride of his heart.</I>

 (2.) When at any time we are under dark dispensations, or have dark
 prospects, public or personal, we must take notice of what is 
 <I>for</I> us as well as what is <I>against</I> us, that we may by 
 thanksgiving honour God, and may in our patience possess our own souls.

 (3.) As to public affairs, it is good, and we are bound to think it
 <I>so, if peace and truth be in our days.</I> That is, 

 [1.] Whatever else we want, it is good if we have peace and truth, if
 we have the true religion professed and protected, Bibles and
 ministers, and enjoy these in peace, not terrified with the alarms of
 war or persecution.  

 [2.] Whatever trouble may come when we are gone, it is good if all be
 well in our days. Not that we should be unconcerned for posterity; it 
 is a grief to foresee evils: but we should own that the deferring of 
 judgments is a great favour in general, and to have them deferred so 
 long as what we may die in peace is a particular favour to us, for 
 charity begins at home. We know not how we shall bear the trial, and 
 therefore have reason to think it well if we may but get safely to 
 heaven before it comes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is the conclusion of Hezekiah's life and story, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.
 
 In
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:1-32:33">2 Chron. <I>ch.</I> xxix.-xxxii.</A>

 much more is recorded of Hezekiah's work of reformation than in this
 book of Kings; and it seems that in the civil chronicles, not now 
 extant, there were many things recorded of his might and the good 
 offices he did for Jerusalem, particularly his bringing water by pipes 
 into the city. To have water in plenty, without striving for it and 
 without being terrified with the noise of archers in the drawing of it, 
 to have it at hand and convenient for us, is to be reckoned a great 
 mercy; for the want of water would be a great calamity. But here this 
 historian leaves him <I>asleep with his fathers,</I> and a son in his 
 throne that proved very untoward; for parents cannot give grace to 
 their children. Wicked Ahaz was the son of a godly father and the 
 father of a godly son; holy Hezekiah was the son of a wicked father and 
 the father of a wicked son. When the land was not reformed, as it 
 should have been, by a good reign, it was plagued and ripened for ruin 
 by a bad one; yet then tried again with a good one, that it might 
 appear how loth God was to cut off his people.</P>
