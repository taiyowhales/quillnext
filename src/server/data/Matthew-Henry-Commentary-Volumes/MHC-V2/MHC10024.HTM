 The last words of David, which we read in the chapter before, were
 admirably good, but in this chapter we read of some of his last works,
 which were none of the best; yet he repented, and did his first works
 again, and so he finished well. We have here,

 I. His sin, which was numbering the people in the pride of his heart,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. His conviction of the sin, and repentance for it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:10">ver. 10</A>.

 III. The judgment inflicted upon him for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:11-15">ver. 11-15</A>.

 IV. The staying of the judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>.

 V.  The erecting of an altar in token of God's reconciliation to him
 and his people,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And again the anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was kindled against Israel,
 and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and
 Judah.
 &nbsp; 2 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which
 <I>was</I> with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan
 even to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the
 number of the people.
 &nbsp; 3 And Joab said unto the king, Now the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God add unto
 the people, how many soever they be, a hundredfold, and that the
 eyes of my lord the king may see <I>it:</I> but why doth my lord the
 king delight in this thing?
 &nbsp; 4 Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and
 against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of
 the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the
 people of Israel.
 &nbsp; 5 And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the
 right side of the city that <I>lieth</I> in the midst of the river of
 Gad, and toward Jazer:
 &nbsp; 6 Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi;
 and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon,
 &nbsp; 7 And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of
 the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the
 south of Judah, <I>even</I> to Beer-sheba.
 &nbsp; 8 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to
 Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
 &nbsp; 9 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the
 king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men
 that drew the sword; and the men of Judah <I>were</I> five hundred
 thousand men.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The orders which David gave to Joab to number the people of Israel 
 and Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 
 Two things here seem strange:--

 1. The sinfulness of this. What harm was there in it? Did not Moses
 twice number the people without any crime? Does not political 
 arithmetic come in among the other policies of a prince? Should not the 
 shepherd know the number of his sheep? Does not the Son of David know 
 all his own by name? Might not he make good use of this calculation? 
 What evil has he done, if he do this?  <I>Answer,</I> It is certain 
 that it was a sin, and a great sin; but where the evil of it lay is not 
 so certain.

 (1.) Some think the fault was that he numbered those that were under
 twenty years old if they were but of stature and strength able to bear 
 arms, and that this was the reason why this account was not enrolled, 
 because it was illegal,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:23,24">1 Chron. xxvii. 23, 24</A>.

 (2.) Others think the fault was that he did not require the
 half-shekel, which was to be paid for the service of the sanctuary 
 whenever the people were numbered, as a <I>ransom for their souls,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+30:12">Exod. xxx. 12</A>.

 (3.) Others think that he did it with a design to impose a tribute upon
 them for himself, to be put into his treasury, and this by way of poll, 
 so that when he knew their numbers he could tell what it would amount 
 to. But nothing of this appears, nor was David ever a raiser of taxes. 
 
 (4.) This was the fault, that he had no orders from God to do it, nor
 was there any occasion for the doing of it. It was a needless trouble 
 both to himself and to his people.  

 (5.) Some think that it was an affront to the ancient promise which God
 made to Abraham, that his seed should be innumerable as the dust of the 
 earth; it savoured of distrust of that promise, or a design to show 
 that it was not fulfilled in the letter of it. He would number those of 
 whom God had said that they could not be numbered. Those know not what 
 they do that go about to disprove the word of God.

 (6.) That which was the worst thing in numbering the people was that
 David did it in the pride of his heart, which was Hezekiah's sin in 
 showing his treasures to the ambassadors.  

 [1.] It was a proud conceit of his own greatness in having the command 
 of so numerous a people, as if their increase, which was to be ascribed 
 purely to the blessing of God, had been owing to any conduct of his 
 own. 

 [2.] It was a proud confidence in his own strength.  By publishing 
 among the nations the number of his people, he thought to appear the 
 more formidable, and doubted not that, if he should have any war, he 
 should overpower his enemies with the multitude of his forces, trusting 
 in God only. God judges not of sin as we do. What appears to us 
 harmless, or at least but a small offence, may be a great sin in the 
 eye of God, who sees men's principles, and is a discerner of the 
 thoughts and intents of the heart. But his judgment, we are sure, is 
 according to truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The spring from which it is here said to arise is yet more strange, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It is not strange that <I>the anger of the Lord should be kindled
 against Israel.</I> There was cause enough for it. They were unthankful 
 for the blessings of David's government, and strangely drawn in to take 
 part with Absalom first and afterwards with Sheba. We have reason to 
 think that their peace and plenty made them secure and sensual, and 
 that God was therefore displeased with them. But that, in this 
 displeasure, he should move David to number the people is very strange.  
 We are sure that God is not the author of sin; he tempts no man: we are 
 told

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:1">1 Chron. xxi. 1</A>)

 that <I>Satan provoked David to number Israel.</I> Satan, as an enemy,
 suggested it for a sin, as he put it into the heart of Judas to betray 
 Christ. God, as righteous Judge, permitted it, with a design, from this 
 sin of David, to take an occasion to punish Israel for other sins, for 
 which he might justly have punished them without this. But, as before 
 he brought a famine upon them for the sin of Saul, so now a pestilence 
 for the sin of David, that princes may from these instances learn, when 
 the judgments of God are abroad, to suspect that their sins are the 
 ground of the controversy, and may therefore repent and reform 
 themselves, which should have a great influence upon national 
 repentance and reformation, and that people may learn to pray for those 
 in authority, that God would keep them from sin, because, if they sin, 
 the kingdom smarts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The opposition which Joab made to these orders. Even he was aware 
 of David's folly and vain-glory in this design. He observed that David 
 gave no reason for it, only, <I>Number the people, that I may know the 
 number of the people;</I> and therefore he endeavored to divert his 
 pride, and in a much more respectful manner than he had before 
 endeavoured to divert his passion upon the death of Absalom; then he 
 spoke rudely and insolently 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:5-7"><I>ch.</I> xix. 5-7</A>),

 but now as became him: <I>Now the Lord thy God add unto the people a
 hundred fold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 There was no occasion to tax them, nor to enlist them, nor to make any
 distribution of them. They were all easy and happy; and Joab wished 
 both that their number might increase and that the king, though old, 
 might live to see their increase, and have the satisfaction of it.  
 "<I>But why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</I> What need 
 is there of doing it?" <I>Pauperis est numerare pecus--Leave it to the 
 poor to count their flocks.</I> Especially why should David, who speaks 
 so much of delighting in God and the exercises of devotion, and who, 
 being old, one would think, should have put away childish things, take 
 a pleasure (so he calls it modestly, but he means taking pride) in a 
 thing of this nature?  Note, Many things, not in themselves sinful, 
 turn into sin to us by our inordinately delighting in them. Joab was 
 aware of David's vanity herein, but he himself was not. It would be 
 good for us to have a friend that would faithfully admonish us when we 
 say or do any thing proud or vain-glorious, for we often do so and are 
 not ourselves aware of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The orders executed notwithstanding. <I>The king's word 
 prevailed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He would have it done; Joab must not gainsay it, lest he be thought to
 grudge his time and pains in the king's service.  It is an unhappiness 
 to great men to have those about them that will aid them and serve them 
 in that which is evil. Joab, according to order, applied himself with 
 some reluctancy to this unpleasing task, and took the captains of the 
 host to help him. They began in the most distant places, in the east 
 first, on the other side Jordan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 
 then they went towards Dan in the north
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 so to Tyre on the east, and thence to Beer-sheba in the south, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Above nine months were spent in taking this account, a great deal of
 trouble and amazement were occasioned by it in the country

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and the sum total was, at length, brought to the king at Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Whether the numbers answered David's expectation or no we are not told,
 nor whether the account fed his pride or mortified it. The people were 
 very many, but, it may be, not so many as he thought they were.  They 
 had not increased in Canaan as they had in Egypt, nor were much more 
 than double to what they were when they came into Canaan under Joshua, 
 about 400 years before; yet it is an evidence that Canaan was a very 
 fruitful land that so many thousands were maintained within so narrow a 
 compass.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the
 people. And David said unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I have sinned greatly in
 that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, take away the
 iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
 &nbsp; 11 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,
 &nbsp; 12 Go and say unto David, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I offer thee
 three <I>things;</I> choose thee one of them, that I may <I>do it</I> unto
 thee.
 &nbsp; 13 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall
 seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou
 flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee?
 or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise,
 and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
 &nbsp; 14 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall
 now into the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for his mercies <I>are</I> great: and
 let me not fall into the hand of man.
 &nbsp; 15 So the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning
 even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan
 even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.
 &nbsp; 16 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to
 destroy it, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> repented him of the evil, and said to the
 angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine
 hand. And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was by the threshingplace of
 Araunah the Jebusite.
 &nbsp; 17 And David spake unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> when he saw the angel that
 smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done
 wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I
 pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here David repenting of the sin and yet punished for it, God 
 repenting of the judgment and David thereby made more penitent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is David's penitent reflection upon and confession of his sin 
 in numbering the people. While the thing was in doing, during all those 
 nine months, we do not find that David was sensible of his sin, for had 
 he been so he would have countermanded the orders he had given; but, 
 when the account was finished and laid before him, that very night his 
 conscience was awakened, and he felt the pain of it just then when he 
 promised himself the pleasure of it. When he was about to feast on the 
 satisfaction of the number of his people, it was turned into the gall 
 of asps within him; sense of the sin cast a damp upon the joy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 1. He was convinced of his sin: <I>His heart smote him</I> before the
 prophet came to him (I think it should not be read <I>for,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>,

 but <I>and, when David was up,</I> so it is in the original), his 
 conscience showed him the evil of what he had done; now that appeared 
 sin, and exceedingly sinful, which before he saw no harm in. He 
 reflected upon it with great regret and his heart reproached him for 
 it. Note, It is a good thing, when a man has sinned, to have a heart 
 within him to smite him for it; it is a good sign of a principle of 
 grace in the heart, and a good step towards repentance and reformation. 
 
 2. He confessed it to God and begged earnestly for the forgiveness of
 it. 

 (1.) He owned that he had sinned, sinned greatly, though to others it
 might seem no sin at all, or a very little one. True penitents, whose 
 consciences are tender and well informed, see that evil in sin which 
 others do not see.

 (2.) He owned that he had <I>done foolishly, very foolishly,</I>
 because he had done it in the pride of his heart; and it was folly for 
 him to be proud of the numbers of his people, when they were God's 
 people, not his, and, as many as they were, God could soon make them 
 fewer.

 (3.) He cried to God for pardon: <I>I beseech thee, O Lord! take away
 the iniquity of thy servant. If we confess our sins,</I> we may pray in 
 faith that God <I>will forgive them,</I> and take away, by pardoning 
 mercy, that iniquity which we cast away by sincere repentance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The just and necessary correction which he suffered for this sin. 
 David had been full of tossings to and fro all night under the sense of 
 his sin, having no rest in his bones because of it, <I>and he arose in 
 the morning</I> expecting to hear of God's displeasure against him for 
 what he had done, or designing to speak with Gad his seer concerning 
 it. Gad is called his <I>seer</I> because he had him always at hand to 
 advise with in the things of God, and made use of him as his confessor 
 and counsellor; but God prevented him, and directed the prophet Gad 
 what to say to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 and,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Three things are taken for granted, 

 (1.) That David must be corrected for his fault. It is too great a
 crime, and reflects too much dishonour upon God, to go unpunished, even 
 in David himself. Of the seven things that God hates, pride is the 
 first, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:17">Prov. vi. 17</A>.

 Note, Those who truly repent of their sins, and have them pardoned are
 yet often made to smart for them in this world.

 (2.) The punishment must answer to the sin. He was proud of the
 judgment he must be chastised with for this sin must be such as will 
 make them fewer. Note, What we make the matter of our pride it is just 
 with God to take from us, or embitter to us, and, some way or other, to 
 make the matter of our punishment.

 (3.) It must be such a punishment as the people must have a large share
 in, <I>for God's anger was kindled against Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Though it was David's sin that immediately opened the sluice, the sins
 of the people all contributed to the deluge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As to the punishment that must be inflicted,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) David is told to choose what rod he will be beaten with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 His heavenly Father must correct him, but, to show that he does not do
 it willingly, he gives David leave to make choice whether it shall be 
 by war, famine, or pestilence, three sore judgments, which greatly 
 weaken and diminish a people. God, by putting him thus to his choice, 
 designed,

 [1.] To humble him the more for his sin, which we would see to be 
 exceedingly sinful when he came to consider each of these judgments as 
 exceedingly dreadful. Or, 

 [2.] To upbraid him with the proud conceit he had of his own 
 sovereignty over Israel. He that is so great a prince begins to think 
 he may have what he will. "Come then," says God, "which wilt thou have 
 of these three things?" Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:17">Jer. xxxiv. 17</A>,

 <I>I proclaim a liberty for you,</I> but it is such a liberty as this
 of David's <I>to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine;</I> 
 and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:2">Jer. xv. 2</A>,

 <I>Such as are for death to death.</I> Or

 [3.] To give him some encouragement under the correction, letting him 
 know that God did not cast him out of communion with himself, but that 
 still his secret was with him, and in afflicting him he considered his 
 frame and what he could best bear. Or 

 [4.] That he might the more patiently bear the rod when it was a rod of 
 his own choosing. The prophet bids him advise with himself, and then 
 tell him what answer he should <I>return to him that sent him.</I> 
 Note, Ministers are sent of God to us, and they must give an account of 
 the success of their embassy. It concerns us therefore to consider what 
 answer they shall return from us, that they may give up their account 
 of us with joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He objects only against the judgments of the sword, and, for the 
 other two, he refers the matter to God, but intimates his choice of the 
 pestilence rather 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I am in a great strait;</I> and well he might be <I>when fear, and
 the pit, and the snare, were before him,</I> and if he escape one, he 
 must inevitably fall into the other, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48"43,44">Jer. xlviii. 43, 44</A>.

 Note, Sin brings men into straits; wise and good men often distress
 themselves by their own folly.

 [1.] He begs that he may <I>not fall into the hand of man.</I> 
 "Whatever comes, <I>let us not flee three months before our 
 enemies;</I>" this would sully all the glory of David's triumphs and 
 give occasion to the enemies of God and Israel to <I>behave themselves 
 proudly.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:26,27">Deut. xxxii. 26, 27</A>.

 "Their tender mercies are cruel; and in three months they will do that
 damage to the nation which many years will not repair." But, 

 [2.] He casts himself upon God: <I>Let us fall now into the hand of the 
 Lord, for his mercies are great.</I> Men are <I>God's hand</I> (so they 
 are called,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>,

 the sword of his sending), yet there are some judgments which come more
 immediately from his hand than others, as famine and pestilence, and 
 David refers it to God which of these shall be the scourge, and God 
 chooses the shortest, that he may the sooner testify his being 
 reconciled. But some think that David, by these words, intimates his 
 choice of the pestilence. The land had not yet recovered the famine 
 under which it smarted three years upon the Gibeonites' account, and 
 therefore, "Let us not be corrected with that rod, for that also will 
 be the triumph of our neighbours," hence we read of <I>the reproach of 
 famine</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:30">Ezek. xxxvi. 30</A>);

 "but if Israel must be diminished, let it be by the pestilence, for
 that is <I>falling into the hands of the Lord,</I>" who usually 
 inflicted that judgment by the hand of his own immediate servants, the 
 angels, as in the death of the first-born of Egypt. That is a judgment 
 to which David himself, and his own family, lie as open as the meanest 
 subject, but not so either to famine or sword, and therefore David, 
 tenderly conscious of his guilt, chooses that. Sword and famine will 
 devour one as well as another, but, it may be thought, the destroying 
 angel will draw his sword against those who are known to God to be most 
 guilty. This will be of the shortest continuance, and he dreads the 
 thought of lying long under the tokens of God's displeasure. <I>It is a 
 dreadful thing,</I> the apostle says, <I>to fall into the hands of the 
 living God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:31">Heb. x. 31</A>),

 a fearful thing indeed for sinners that have, by their impenitency,
 shut themselves out from all hope of his mercy. But David, a penitent, 
 dares cast himself into God's hand, knowing he shall find that <I>his 
 mercies are great.</I> Good men, even when they are under God's frowns, 
 yet will entertain no other than good thoughts of him. <I>Though he 
 slay me, yet will I trust in him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) A pestilence is accordingly sent 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 which, for the extent of it, spread from Dan to Beer-sheba, from one end
 of the kingdom to the other, which showed it to come immediately from 
 God's hand and not from any natural causes. David has his choice; he 
 suffers by miracle, and not by ordinary means. For the continuance of 
 it, it lasted from morning (this very morning on which it was put to 
 David's choice) to the time appointed that is, to the third day (so Mr. 
 Poole), or only to the evening of the first day, the time appointed for 
 the evening sacrifice, so bishop Patrick and others, who reckon that 
 the pestilence lasted but nine hours, and that, in compassion to David, 
 God shortened the time he had first mentioned. The execution the 
 pestilence did was very severe. <I>There died</I> 70,000 <I>men,</I> 
 that were all well, and sick, and dead, in a few hours. What a great 
 cry, may we suppose, was there now throughout all the land of Israel, 
 as there was in Egypt when the first-born were slain! but that was at 
 midnight, this in the daytime, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:6">Ps. xci. 6</A>.

 See the power of the angels, when God gives them commission, either to
 save or to destroy. Joab is nine months in passing with his pen, the 
 angel but nine hours in passing with his sword, through all the coasts 
 and corners of the land of Israel. See how easily God can bring down 
 the proudest sinners, and how much we owe daily to the divine patience. 
 David's adultery is punished, for the present, only with the death of 
 one infant, his pride with the death of all those thousands, so much 
 does God hate pride. The number slain amounted to almost half a 
 decimation, 70,000 being about one in twenty.  Now, we may suppose, 
 David's flesh <I>trembled for fear of God and he was afraid of his 
 judgments,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:120">Ps. cxix. 120</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God's gracious relaxation of the judgment, when it began to be 
 inflicted upon Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>The angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem,</I> as if he
 intended to do greater execution there than any where else, even <I>to 
 destroy it.</I> The country had drunk of the bitter cup, but Jerusalem 
 must drink the dregs. It should seem that was last numbered, and 
 therefore was reserved to be last plagued; perhaps there was more 
 wickedness, especially more pride (and that was the sin now chastised), 
 in Jerusalem than elsewhere, therefore the hand of the destroyer is 
 stretched out upon that; but then <I>the Lord repented him of the 
 evil,</I> changed not his mind, but his way; and said to the destroying 
 angel, <I>It is enough; stay now thy hand,</I> and <I>let mercy rejoice 
 against judgment.</I> Jerusalem shall be spared for the ark's sake, for 
 it is the place God hath chosen to put his name there. See here how 
 ready God is to forgive and how little pleasure he takes in punishing; 
 and let it encourage us to meet him by repentance in the way of his 
 judgments. This was on Mount Moriah. Dr.  Lightfoot observes that in 
 the very place where Abraham, by a countermand from heaven, was stayed 
 from slaying his son, this angel, by a like countermand, was stayed 
 from destroying Jerusalem. It is for the sake of the great sacrifice 
 that our forfeited lives are preserved from the destroying angel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. David's renewed repentance for his sin upon this occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 He saw the angel (God opening his eyes for that purpose), saw his sword
 stretched out to destroy, a flaming sword, saw him ready to sheath it 
 upon the orders given him to stay proceedings; seeing all this, he 
 spoke, not to the angel (he knew better than to address himself to the 
 servant in the presence of the Master, or to give that honour to the 
 creature which is the Creator's due), but <I>to the Lord, and said, Lo, 
 I have sinned.</I> Note, True penitents, the more they perceive of 
 God's sparing pardoning mercy the more humbled they are for sin and the 
 more resolved against it. They shall be ashamed <I>when I am pacified 
 towards them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:63">Ezek. xvi. 63</A>.

 Observe, 

 1. How he criminates himself, as if he could never speak ill enough of
 his own fault: "<I>I have sinned, and I have done wickedly;</I> mine is 
 the crime, and therefore on me be the cross.  <I>Let thy hand be 
 against me, and my father's house.</I> I am the sinner, let me be the 
 sufferer;" so willing was he to accept the punishment of his iniquity, 
 though he was worth 10,000 of them. 

 2. How he intercedes for the people, whose bitter lamentations made his
 heart to ache, and his ears to tingle: <I>These sheep, what have they 
 done?</I> Done! Why they had done much amiss; it was their sin that 
 provoked God to leave David to himself to do as he did; yet, as becomes 
 a penitent, he is severe upon his own faults, while he extenuates 
 theirs. Most people, when God's judgments are abroad, charge others 
 with being the cause of them, and care not who falls by them, so they 
 can escape. But David's penitent and public spirit was otherwise 
 affected. Let this remind us of the grace of our Lord Jesus, who gave 
 himself for our sins and was willing that God's hand should be against 
 him, that we might escape. The shepherd was smitten that the sheep 
 might be spared.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up,
 rear an altar unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the threshingfloor of Araunah the
 Jebusite.
 &nbsp; 19 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded.
 &nbsp; 20 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming
 on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the
 king on his face upon the ground.
 &nbsp; 21 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his
 servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to
 build an altar unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that the plague may be stayed from
 the people.
 &nbsp; 22 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and
 offer up what <I>seemeth</I> good unto him: behold, <I>here be</I> oxen for
 burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and <I>other</I>
 instruments of the oxen for wood.
 &nbsp; 23 All these <I>things</I> did Araunah, <I>as</I> a king, give unto the
 king. And Araunah said unto the king, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God accept
 thee.
 &nbsp; 24 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy
 <I>it</I> of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings
 unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David
 bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of
 silver.
 &nbsp; 25 And David built there an altar unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and offered
 burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was intreated
 for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A command sent to David to erect an altar in the place where he saw 
 the angel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 This was to intimate to David,

 1. That, upon his repeated submission and humiliation, God was now
 thoroughly reconciled to him; <I>for, if the Lord had been pleased to 
 kill him, he would not have accepted an offering,</I> and therefore 
 would not have ordered him to <I>build an altar.</I> God's encouraging 
 us to offer to him spiritual sacrifices is a comfortable evidence of 
 his reconciling us to himself.  

 2.  That peace is made between God and sinners by sacrifice, and not
 otherwise, even by Christ the great propitiation, of whom all the legal 
 sacrifices were types. It is for his sake that the destroying angel is 
 told to stay his hand. 

 3. That when God's judgments are graciously stayed we ought to
 acknowledge it with thankfulness to his praise. This altar was to be 
 for thank-offerings. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+12:1">Isa. xii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The purchase which David made of the ground in order hereunto. It 
 seems the owner was a Jebusite, Araunah by name, proselyted no doubt to 
 the Jewish religion, though by birth a Gentile, and therefore allowed, 
 not only to dwell among the Israelites, but to have a possession of his 
 own in a city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:29,30">Lev. xxv. 29, 30</A>.

 The piece of ground was a threshing-floor, a mean place, <I>yet</I>
 thus dignified--a place of labour, <I>therefore</I> thus dignified.  
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. David went in person to the owner, to treat with him. See his 
 justice, that he would not so much as use this place in the present 
 exigence, though the proprietor was an alien, though he himself was a 
 king, and though he had express orders from God to rear an altar there, 
 till he had bought it and paid for it. God <I>hates robbery for 
 burnt-offering.</I> See his humility, how far he was from taking state; 
 though a king, he was now a penitent, and therefore, in token of his 
 self-abasement, he neither sent for Araunah to come to him nor sent 
 another to deal with him, but went himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and, though it looked like a diminution of himself, he lost no honour
 by it. Araunah, when he saw him, went and <I>bowed himself to the 
 ground before him</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Great men will never be the less respected for their humility, but the
 more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Araunah, when he understood his business 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 generously offered him, not only the ground to build his altar on, but
 <I>oxen for sacrifices,</I> and other things that might be of use to 
 him in the service

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 and all this <I>gratis,</I> and a good prayer into the bargain: <I>The
 Lord thy God accept thee!</I> This he did,

 (1.) Because he had a generous spirit with a great estate. <I>He gave
 as a king</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 though an ordinary subject, he had the spirit of a prince. In the
 Hebrew it is, <I>He gave, even the king to the king,</I> whence it is 
 supposed that Araunah had been king of the Jebusites in that place, or 
 was descended from their royal family, though now a tributary to David.

 (2.) Because he highly esteemed David, though his conqueror, upon the
 score of his personal merits, and never thought he could do too much to 
 oblige him.

 (3.) Because he had an affection for Israel, and earnestly desired that
 <I>the plague might be stayed;</I> and the honour of its being stayed 
 at <I>his threshing-floor,</I> he would account a valuable 
 consideration for all he now tendered to David. 

 3.  David resolved to pay the full value of it, and did so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Here were two generous souls well met. Araunah is very willing to give;
 but David is determined to buy, and for a good reason: he will not 
 offer that to God which costs him nothing. He would not take advantage 
 of the pious Jebusite's generosity. He thanked him, no doubt, for his 
 kind offer, but paid him <I>fifty shekels of silver</I> for the floor 
 and the oxen for the present service, and afterwards 600 shekels of 
 gold for the ground adjoining, to build the temple on. Note, Those know 
 not what religion is whose chief care it is to make it cheap and easy 
 to themselves, and who are best pleased with that which costs them 
 least pains or money. What have we our substance for but to honour God 
 with it? and how can it be better bestowed?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The building of the altar, and the offering of the proper 
 sacrifices upon it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 burnt-offerings to the glory of God's justice in the execution that had
 been done, and peace-offerings to the glory of his mercy in the 
 seasonable staying of the process. Hereupon God showed (it is supposed 
 by fire from heaven consuming the sacrifices) that <I>he was entreated 
 for the land,</I> and that it was in mercy that the plague was removed 
 and in token of God's being reconciled both to prince and people.  
 Christ is our altar, our sacrifice; in him alone we may expect to find 
 favour with God, to escape his wrath, and the sword, the flaming sword, 
 of the cherubim who <I>keep the way of the tree of life.</I></P>
