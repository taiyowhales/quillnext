 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
 reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.
 &nbsp; 2 He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
 reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
 <I>was</I> Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 3 And he did <I>that which was</I> right in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as
 Joash his father did.
 &nbsp; 4 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the
 people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.
 &nbsp; 5 And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in
 his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his
 father.
 &nbsp; 6 But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto
 that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death
 for the children, nor the children be put to death for the
 fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
 &nbsp; 7 He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took
 Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Amaziah, the son and successor of Joash, is the king whom here we have 
 an account of. Let us take a view of him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In the temple; and there he acted, in some measure, well, like 
 Joash, but not like David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He began well, but did not persevere: He <I>did that which was right in
 the sight of the Lord,</I> kept up his attendance on God's altars and 
 his attention to God's word, yet not like David. It is not enough to do 
 that which our pious predecessors did, merely to keep up the usage, but 
 we must do it <I>as</I> they did it, from the same principle of faith 
 and devotion and with the same sincerity and resolution. It is here 
 taken notice of, as before, that <I>the high places were not taken 
 away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 It is hard to get clear of those corruptions which, by long usage, have 
 gained both prescription and a favourable opinion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. On the bench; and there we have him doing justice on the traitors 
 that murdered his father, not as soon as ever he came to the crown, 
 lest it should occasion some disturbance, but he prudently deferred it 
 till <I>the kingdom was confirmed in his hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 To weaken a factious party gradually, when it is not safe to provoke,
 often proves the way to ruin it effectually. Justice strikes surely by 
 striking slowly, and is often executed most prudently when it is not 
 executed presently. Wisdom here is profitable to direct. Amaziah did 
 thus,

 1.  According to the rule of the law, that ancient rule, that <I>he
 that sheds man's blood by man shall his blood be shed.</I> Never let 
 traitors or murderers expect to come to their graves like other men.  
 <I>Let them flee to the pit, and let no man stay them.</I> 

 2. Under the limitation of the law: <I>The children of the murderers he 
 slew not,</I> because the law of Moses had expressly provided that 
 <I>the children should not be put to death for the fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It is probable that this is taken notice of because there were those
 about him that advised him to that rigour, both in revenge (because the 
 crime was extraordinary--the murder of a king) and in policy, that the 
 children might not plot against him, in revenge of their father's 
 death. But against these insinuations he opposed the express law of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+24:16">Deut. xxiv. 16</A>),

 which he was to judge by, and which he resolved to adhere to and trust
 God with the issue. God visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the 
 children, because every man is guilty before him and owes him a death; 
 so that, if he require the life for the father's sin, he does not 
 wrong, the sinner having forfeited it already by his own. But he does 
 not allow earthly princes to do thus: the children, before them, are 
 innocent, and therefore must not suffer as guilty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In the field; and there we find him triumphing over the Edomites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Edom had <I>revolted from under the hand of Judah</I> in Joram's time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:22"><I>ch.</I> viii. 22</A>.

 Now he makes war upon them to bring them back to their allegiance,
 kills 10,000 and takes the chief city of Arabia the stony (called 
 <I>Selah</I>--<I>a rock</I>), and gave it a new name. We shall find a
 larger account of this expedition,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:5-13">2 Chron. xxv. 5</A>,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz
 son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one
 another in the face.
 &nbsp; 9 And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
 saying, The thistle that <I>was</I> in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
 <I>was</I> in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife:
 and there passed by a wild beast that <I>was</I> in Lebanon, and trode
 down the thistle.
 &nbsp; 10 Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted
 thee up: glory <I>of this,</I> and tarry at home: for why shouldest
 thou meddle to <I>thy</I> hurt, that thou shouldest fall, <I>even</I> thou,
 and Judah with thee?
 &nbsp; 11 But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel
 went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in
 the face at Beth-shemesh, which <I>belongeth</I> to Judah.
 &nbsp; 12 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled
 every man to their tents.
 &nbsp; 13 And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the
 son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to
 Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of
 Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
 &nbsp; 14 And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels
 that were found in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and in the treasures of
 the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 For several successions after the division of the kingdoms that of 
 Judah suffered much by the <I>enmity</I> of Israel. After Asa's time, 
 for several successions, it suffered more by the <I>friendship</I> of 
 Israel, and by the alliance and affinity made with them. But now we 
 meet with hostility between them again, which had not been for some 
 ages before.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Amaziah, upon no provocation, and without showing any cause of 
 quarrel, challenged Joash into the field 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Come, let us look one another in the face;</I> let us try our 
 strength in battle." Had he challenged him to a personal duel only, the 
 error would have remained with himself, but each must bring all their 
 forces into the field, and thousands of lives on both sides must be 
 sacrificed to his capricious humour. Hereby he showed himself proud, 
 presumptuous, and prodigal of blood. Some think that he intended to 
 avenge the injury which the dismissed disgusted Israelites had lately 
 done to his country, in their return

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:13">2 Chron. xxv. 13</A>),

 and that he had also the vanity to think of subduing the kingdom of
 Israel, and reuniting it to Judah. A <I>fool's lips thus enter into 
 contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.</I> Those that challenge 
 are chargeable with that beginning of strife, which is as the letting 
 forth of water. He that is eager either to fight or to go to law may 
 perhaps have enough of it quickly, and be the first that repents 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Joash sent him a grave rebuke for his challenge, with advice to 
 withdraw it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 1. He mortifies his pride, by comparing himself to a cedar, a stately
 tree, and Amaziah to a thistle, a sorry weed, telling him he was so far 
 from fearing him that he despised him, and scorned as much to have any 
 thing to do with him, or make any alliance with him, as the cedar would 
 to match his daughter to a thistle. The ancient house of David he 
 thinks not worthy to be named the same day with the house of Jehu, 
 though an upstart. How may a humble man smile to hear two proud and 
 scornful men set their wits on work to vilify and undervalue one 
 another! 

 2. He foretels his fall: <I>A wild beast trode down the thistle,</I> 
 and so put an end to his treaty with the cedar; so easily does Joash 
 think his forces can crush Amaziah, and so unable does he think him to 
 make any resistance. 

 3. He shows him the folly of his challenge: "<I>Thou hast indeed
 smitten Edom,</I> a weak, unarmed, undisciplined body of men, and 
 therefore thinkest thou canst carry all before thee and subdue the 
 regular forces of Israel with as much ease.  <I>Thy heart has lifted 
 thee up.</I>" See where the root of all sin lies; it is in the heart, 
 thence it flows, and that must bear the blame. It is not Providence, 
 the event, the occasion (whatever it is), that makes men proud, or 
 secure, or discontented, or the like, but it is their own heart that 
 does it. "Thou art proud of the blow thou hast given to Edom, as if 
 that had made thee formidable to all mankind." Those wretchedly deceive 
 themselves that magnify their own performances, and, because they have 
 been blessed with some little success and reputation, conclude 
 themselves fit for any thing and no less sure of it. 

 4. He counsels him to be content with the honour he has won, and not to 
 hazard that, by grasping at more that was out of his reach: <I>Why 
 shouldst thou meddle to thy hurt,</I> as fools often do, that will be 
 meddling? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:3">Prov. xx. 3</A>.

 Many would have had wealth and honour enough if they had but known when
 they had enough. He warns him of the consequence, that it would be 
 fatal not to himself only, but to his kingdom, which he ought to 
 protect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Amaziah persisted in his resolution, and the issue was bad; he had 
 better have tarried at home, for Joash gave him such a look in the face 
 as put him to confusion. Challengers commonly prove to be on the losing 
 side. 

 1. His army was routed and dispersed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Josephus says, When they were to engage they were struck with such
 terror that they did not strike a stroke, but every one made the best 
 of his way.

 2. He himself was taken prisoner by the king of Israel, and then had 
 enough of <I>looking him in the face.</I> Amaziah's pedigree comes in 
 here somewhat abruptly (<I>the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah</I>),
 because perhaps he had gloried in the dignity of his ancestors, or 
 because he now smarted for their iniquity. 

 3. The conqueror entered Jerusalem, which tamely opened to him, and yet
 he broke down their wall (and, as Josephus says, drove his chariot in 
 triumph through the breach), in reproach to them, and that he might, 
 when he pleased, take possession of the royal city. 

 4. He plundered Jerusalem, took away all that was valuable, and 
 returned to Samaria, laden with spoils, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It was said of Joash that he did that which was <I>evil in the sight of
 the Lord,</I> and of Amaziah that he did <I>that which was right;</I> 
 and yet Joash triumphs thus over Amaziah, and why so? Because God would 
 show, in Amaziah's fate, that he resists the proud, or because, 
 whatever they were otherwise, Joash had lately been respectful to one 
 of God's prophets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:14"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 14</A>),

 but Amaziah had been abusive to another 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:16">2 Chron. xxv. 16</A>),

 and God will honour those who honour him in his prophets, but those who
 despise them, and him in them, shall be lightly esteemed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his
 might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, <I>are</I> they
 not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
 &nbsp; 16 And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in
 Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in
 his stead.
 &nbsp; 17 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the
 death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.
 &nbsp; 18 And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, <I>are</I> they not written
 in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
 &nbsp; 19 Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he
 fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him
 there.
 &nbsp; 20 And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at
 Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
 &nbsp; 21 And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which <I>was</I>
 sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father
 Amaziah.
 &nbsp; 22 He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the
 king slept with his fathers.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are three kings brought to their graves in these few verses:--

 1.  Joash king of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 We attended his funeral once before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:12,13"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 12, 13</A>.

 But, because the historian had occasion to give a further account of
 his life and actions, he again mentions his death and burial. 

 2.  Amaziah king of Judah. Fifteen years he survived his conqueror the 
 king of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 A man may live a great while after he has been shamed, may be
 thoroughly mortified (as Amaziah no doubt was) and yet not dead.  His 
 acts are said to be found written in his annals

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 but not his might; for his cruelty when he was a conqueror over the 
 Edomites, and his insolence when he challenged the king of Israel,
 showed him void of true courage. He was slain by his own subjects, who 
 hated him for his maladministration 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 and made Jerusalem too hot for him, the ignominious breach made in 
 their walls being occasioned by his folly and presumption. He fled to 
 Lachish. How long he continued concealed or sheltered there we are not 
 told, but, at last, he was there murdered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 No further did the rage of the rebels extend, for they brought him in a
 chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him there among his ancestors.

 3. Azariah succeeded Amaziah, but not till twelve years after his
 father's death, for Amaziah died in the fifteenth year of Jeroboam (as 
 appears by comparing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:23,2Ki+13:2"><I>v.</I> 23 with <I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 but Azariah did not begin his reign till the twenty-seventh of Jeroboam

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:1"><I>ch.</I> xv. 1</A>),

 for he was but four years old at the death of his father, so that, for
 twelve years, till he came to be sixteen, the government was in the 
 hands of protectors. He reigned very long

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:2"><I>ch.</I> xv. 2</A>)

 and yet the account of his reign is here industriously huddled up, and
 broken off abruptly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>He built Elath</I> (which had belonged to the Edomites, but, it is 
 probable, was recovered by his father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>after that the king slept with his fathers,</I> as if that had been
 all he did that was worth mentioning, or rather it is meant of king 
 Amaziah: he built it soon after Amaziah died.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of
 Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in
 Samaria, <I>and reigned</I> forty and one years.
 &nbsp; 24 And he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
 who made Israel to sin.
 &nbsp; 25 He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath
 unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God
 of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the
 son of Amittai, the prophet, which <I>was</I> of Gath-hepher.
 &nbsp; 26 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> saw the affliction of Israel, <I>that it was</I>
 very bitter: for <I>there was</I> not any shut up, nor any left, nor
 any helper for Israel.
 &nbsp; 27 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said not that he would blot out the name of
 Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of
 Jeroboam the son of Joash.
 &nbsp; 28 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did,
 and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and
 Hamath, <I>which belonged</I> to Judah, for Israel, are they not
 written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
 &nbsp; 29 And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, <I>even</I> with the kings
 of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is an account of the reign of Jeroboam the second. I doubt it is 
 an indication of the affection and adherence of the house of Jehu to 
 the sins of <I>Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin,</I> 
 that they called an heir-apparent to the crown by his name, thinking 
 that an honourable name which in the book of God is infamous and 
 stigmatized as much as any.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His reign was long, the longest of all the reigns of the kings of 
 Israel: <I>He reigned forty-one years;</I> yet his contemporary 
 Azariah, the king of Judah, reigned longer, even fifty-two years. This 
 Jeroboam reigned just as long as Asa had done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:10">1 Kings xv. 10</A>),

 yet one did that which was good and the other that which was evil. We
 cannot measure men's characters by the length of their lives or by 
 their outward prosperity. <I>There is one event to the righteous and to 
 the wicked.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His character was the same with that of the rest of those kings: 
 <I>He did that which was evil</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 for <I>he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam;</I> he kept up the 
 worship of the calves, and never left that, thinking there was no harm 
 in it, because it had been the way of all his ancestors and 
 predecessors. But a sin is never the less evil in God's sight, whatever 
 it is in ours, for its being an ancient usage; and a frivolous plea it 
 will be against doing good, that we have been accustomed to do 
 evil.</P>

 III. Yet he prospered more than most of them, for though, in that one 
 thing, he did evil in the sight of the Lord, yet it is likely, in other 
 respects, there was some good found in him and therefore God owned him, 

 1. By prophecy. He raised up Jonah the son of Amittai, a Galilean (so 
 much were those mistaken that said, <I>Out of Galilee ariseth no 
 prophet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:52">John vii. 52</A>),

 and by him intimated the purposes of his favour to Israel,
 notwithstanding their provocations, encouraged him and his kingdom to 
 take up arms for the recovery of their ancient possessions, and (which 
 would contribute not a little to their success) assured them of 
 victory. It is a sign that God has not cast off his people if he 
 continue faithful ministers among them; when Elisha, who strengthened 
 the hands of Joash, was removed, Jonah was sent to encourage his son.  
 Happy is the land that has a succession of prophets running parallel 
 with a succession of princes, that the word of the Lord may endure for 
 ever. Of this Jonah we read much in that little book of scripture that
 bears his name. It is probable that it was when he was a young man, and 
 fit for such an expedition, that God sent him to Nineveh, and that it 
 was when he had yet been but a little conversant with the visions of 
 God that he flew off and fretted as he did; and, if so, this is an 
 undoubted evidence of the forgiveness of his faults and follies, that 
 he was afterwards employed as a messenger of mercy to Israel. A 
 commission amounts to a pardon, and he that had himself found mercy, 
 notwithstanding his provocations, could the better encourage them with 
 the hope of mercy notwithstanding theirs. Some that have been foolish 
 and passionate, and have gone about their work very awkwardly at first, 
 yet afterwards have proved useful and eminent. Men must not be thrown 
 away for every fault. 

 2. By providence. The event was <I>according to the word of the 
 Lord:</I> his arms were successful; he <I>restored the coast of 
 Israel,</I> recovered those frontier-towns and countries that lay from 
 Hamath in the north to the sea of the plain, (that is, the sea of 
 Sodom) in the south, all which the Syrians had possessed themselves of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Two reasons are here given why God blessed them with those victories:--

 (1.) Because their distress was very great, which made them the objects 
 of his compassion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Though he saw not any signs of their repentance and formation, yet
 <I>he saw their affliction, that it was very bitter.</I> Those that 
 lived in those countries which the enemies were masters of were 
 miserably oppressed and enslaved, and could call nothing their own; the 
 rest, we may suppose, were much impoverished by the frequent incursions 
 the enemy made upon them to plunder them, and continually terrified by 
 their threatenings, so that <I>there was none shut up or left,</I> both 
 towns and countries were laid waste and stripped of their wealth, and 
 no helper appeared. To this extremity were they reduced, in many parts 
 of the country, in the beginning of Jeroboam's reign, when God, in mere 
 pity to them, heard the cry of their affliction (for no mention is made 
 here of the cry of their prayers), and wrought this deliverance for 
 them by the hand of Jeroboam. Let those whose case is pitiable take 
 comfort from the divine pity; we read of God's bowels of mercy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:15,Jer+31:20">Isa. lxiii. 15; Jer. xxxi. 20</A>)

 and that he is full of compassion,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:15">Ps. lxxxvi. 15</A>.

 (2.) Because the decree had not yet gone forth for their utter 
 destruction; he had not as yet said <I>he would blot out the name of 
 Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 and because he had not said it he would not do it. If this be 
 understood of the dispersion of the ten tribes, he did say it and do 
 it, for that name still remains under heaven in the <I>gospel 
 Israel,</I> and will to the end of time; and because they, at present, 
 bore that name which was to have this lasting honour, he showed them 
 this favour, as well as for the sake of the ancient honour of that 
 name,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:23"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Here is the conclusion of Jeroboam's reign. We read 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>)

 of his might, and how he warred, but 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>)

 he <I>slept with his fathers;</I> for the mightiest must yield to 
 death, and there is no discharge in that war. Many prophets there had 
 been in Israel, a constant succession of them in every age, but none of 
 the prophets had left any of their prophecies in writing till those of 
 this age began to do it, and their prophecies are part of the canon of 
 scripture. It was in the reign of this Jeroboam that <I>Hosea</I> (who 
 continued very long a prophet) began to prophesy, and he was the first 
 that wrote his prophecies; therefore the word of the Lord by him is 
 called <I>the beginning of the word of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+1:2">Hos. i. 2</A>.

 Then <I>that part of the word of the Lord</I> began to be written. At
 the same time <I>Amos</I> prophesied, and wrote his prophecy, soon 
 afterwards <I>Micah,</I> and then <I>Isaiah,</I> in the days of Ahaz 
 and Hezekiah.  Thus God never left himself without witness, but, in the 
 darkest and most degenerate ages of the church, raised up some to be 
 burning and shining lights in it to their own age by their preaching 
 and living, and a few by their writings to reflect light upon us on 
 whom the ends of the world have come.</P>
