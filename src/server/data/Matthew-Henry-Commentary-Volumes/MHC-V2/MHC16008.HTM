 Ezra came up out of Babylon thirteen years before Nehemiah came, yet we 
 have here a piece of good work which he did, that might have been done 
 before, but was not done till Nehemiah came, who, though he was not 
 such a scholar nor such a divine as Ezra, nor such a scribe in the law 
 of his God, yet was a man of a more lively active spirit. His zeal set 
 Ezra's learning on work, and then great things were done, as we find 
 here, where we have, 

 I. The public and solemn reading and expounding of the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:1-8">ver.  1-8</A>.
 
 II. The joy which the people were ordered to express upon that occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.

 III. The solemn keeping of the feast of tabernacles according to the
 law,

 ver. 13-18</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And all the people gathered themselves together as one man
 into the street that <I>was</I> before the water gate; and they spake
 unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had commanded to Israel.
 &nbsp; 2  And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation
 both of men and women, and all that could hear with
 understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.
 &nbsp; 3  And he read therein before the street that <I>was</I> before the
 water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the
 women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the
 people <I>were attentive</I> unto the book of the law.
 &nbsp; 4  And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they
 had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and
 Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his
 right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and
 Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, <I>and</I> Meshullam.
 &nbsp; 5  And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for
 he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the
 people stood up:
 &nbsp; 6  And Ezra blessed the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the great God. And all the people
 answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed
 their heads, and worshipped the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with <I>their</I> faces to the
 ground.
 &nbsp; 7  Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub,
 Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan,
 Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the
 law: and the people <I>stood</I> in their place.
 &nbsp; 8  So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and
 gave the sense, and caused <I>them</I> to understand the reading.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of a solemn religious assembly, and the good 
 work that was done in that assembly, to the honour of God and the 
 edification of the church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The time of it was the <I>first day of the seventh month,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 That was the day of the <I>feast of trumpets,</I> which is called a
 <I>sabbath,</I> and on which they were to have a <I>holy 
 convocation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:24,Nu+29:1">Lev. xxiii. 24; Num. xxix. 1</A>.

 But that was not all: it was one that day that the altar was set up,
 and they began to offer their burnt-offerings after their return out of 
 captivity, a recent mercy in the memory of many then living; in a 
 thankful remembrance of that, it is likely, they had kept this feast 
 ever since with more than ordinary solemnity. Divine favours which are 
 fresh in mind, and which we ourselves have been witnesses of, should 
 be, and usually are, most affecting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The place was in the <I>street that was before the water-gate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 a spacious broad street, able to contain so great a multitude, which
 the court of the temple was not; for probably it was not now built 
 nearly so large as it had been in Solomon's time. Sacrifices were to be 
 offered only at the door of the temple, but praying, and praising, and 
 preaching, were, and are, services of religion as acceptably performed 
 in one place as in another. When this congregation thus met in the 
 street of the city no doubt God was with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The persons that met were all the people, who were not compelled 
 to come, but voluntarily gathered themselves together by common 
 agreement, as one man: not only men came, but women and children, even 
 as many as were capable of understanding what they heard. Masters of 
 families should bring their families with them to the public worship of 
 God. Women and children have souls to save, and are therefore concerned 
 to acquaint themselves with the word of God and attend on the means of 
 knowledge and grace. Little ones, as they come to the exercise of 
 reason, must be trained up in the exercises of religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The master of this assembly was Ezra the priest; he presided in 
 this service. None so fit to expound and preach as he who was such a 
 ready scribe in the law of his God. 

 1. His call to the service was very clear; for being in office as a
 priest, and qualified as a scribe, the <I>people spoke to him to bring 
 the book of the law</I> and read it to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 God gave him ability and authority, and then the people gave him
 opportunity and invitation. Knowledge is spiritual alms, which those 
 that are able should give to every one that needs, to every one that 
 asks. 

 2. His post was very convenient. He stood in a pulpit or tower of wood,
 <I>which they made for the word</I> (so it is in the original), <I>for 
 the preaching of the word,</I> that what he said might be the more 
 gracefully delivered and the better heard, and that the eyes of the 
 hearers might be upon him, which would engage their attention, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:20">Luke iv. 20</A>.

 3. He had several assistants. Some of these stood with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 six on his right hand and seven on his left: either his pulpit was so
 contrived as to hold them all in a row, as in a gallery (but then it 
 would scarcely have been called a <I>tower</I>), or they had desks a 
 degree lower. Some think, that he appointed them to read when he was 
 weary; at least his taking them as assessors with him put an honour 
 upon them before the people, in order to their being employed in the 
 same service another time. Others who are mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:7"><I>v.</I>  7</A>)

 seem to have been employed at the same time in other places near at
 hand, to read and expound to those who could not come within hearing of 
 Ezra. Of these also there were thirteen priests, whose lips were to 
 keep knowledge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:7">Mal. ii. 7</A>.

 It is a great mercy to a people thus to be furnished with ministers
 that are apt to teach. Happy was Ezra in having such assistants as 
 these, and happy were they in having such a guide as Ezra.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The religious exercises performed in this assembly were not 
 ceremonial, but moral, praying and preaching. Ezra, as president of the 
 assembly, was, 

 1. The people's mouth to God, and they affectionately joined with him,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He blessed the Lord as the great God, gave honour to him by praising
 his perfections and praying for his favour; and the people, in token of 
 their concurrence with him both in prayers and praises, said, <I>Amen, 
 Amen, lifted up their hands</I> in token of their desire being towards 
 God and all their expectations from him, and <I>bowed their heads</I> 
 in token of their reverence of him and subjection to him.  Thus must we 
 adore God, and address ourselves to him, when we are going to read and 
 hear the word of God, as those that see God in his word very great and 
 very good.

 2. God's mouth to the people, and they attentively hearkened to him.
 This was the chief business of the solemnity, and observe,

 (1.) <I>Ezra brought the law before the congregation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He had taken care to provide himself with the best and most correct
 copies of the law; and what he had laid up for his own use and 
 satisfaction he here brought forth, as a good householder out of his 
 treasury, for the benefit of the church.  Observe,

 [1.] The book of the law is not to be confined to the scribes' studies, 
 but to be brought before the congregation and read to them in their own 
 language. 

 [2.] Ministers, when they go to the pulpit, should take their Bibles 
 with them; Ezra did so; thence they must fetch their knowledge, and 
 according to that rule they must speak and must show that they do so. 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+17:9">2 Chron. xvii. 9</A>.

 (2.) He opened the book with great reverence and solemnity, <I>in the
 sight of all the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He brought it forth with a sense of the great mercy of God to them in
 giving them that book; he opened it with a sense of his mercy to them 
 in giving them leave to read it, that it was not a spring shut up and a 
 fountain sealed. The <I>taking of the books, and the opening of the 
 seals,</I> we find celebrated with joy and praise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:9">Rev. v. 9</A>.

 Let us learn to address ourselves to the services of religion with
 solemn stops and pauses, and not to go about them rashly; let us 
 consider what we are doing when we take God's book into our hands, and 
 open it, and so also when we bow our knees in prayer; and what we do 
 let us do deliberately,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:1">Eccl. v. 1</A>.

 (3.) He and others read in the book of the law, <I>from morning till 
 noon</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and they read <I>distinctly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Reading the scriptures in religious assemblies is an ordinance of God,
 whereby he is honoured and his church edified.  And, upon special 
 occasions, we must be willing to attend for many hours together on the 
 reading and expounding of the word of God: those mentioned here were 
 thus employed for six hours. Let those that read and preach the word 
 learn also to deliver themselves distinctly, as those who understand 
 what they say and are affected with it themselves, and who desire that 
 those they speak to may understand it, retain it, and be affected with 
 it likewise. <I>It is a snare for a man to devour that which is 
 holy.</I>

 (4.) What they read they expounded, showed the intent and meaning of 
 it, and what use was to be made of it; they gave the sense in other 
 words, that they might <I>cause the people to understand the 
 reading,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.
 
 Note,

 [1.] It is requisite that those who hear the word should understand it, 
 else it is to them but an empty sound of words,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:15">Matt. xxiv. 15</A>.

 [2.] It is therefore required of those who are teachers by office that
 they explain the word and give the sense of it. <I>Understandest thou 
 what thou readest?</I> and, <I>Have you understood all these 
 things?</I> are good questions to be put to the hearers; but, <I>How 
 should we except someone guide us?</I> is as proper a question for them 
 to put to their teachers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:30,31">Acts viii. 30, 31</A>.

 Reading is good, and preaching good, but expounding brings the reading
 and the preaching together, and thus makes the reading the more 
 intelligible and the preaching the more convincing.

 (5.) The people conducted themselves very properly when the word was
 read and opened to them. 

 [1.] With great reverence. When Ezra opened the book <I>all the people 
 stood up</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 thereby showing respect both to Ezra and to the word he was about to
 read. It becomes servants to stand when their master speaks to them, in 
 honour to their master and to show a readiness to do as they are 
 bidden. 

 [2.] With great fixedness and composedness. They <I>stood in their 
 place</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 several ministers were reading and expounding at some distance from
 each other, and every one of the people kept his post, did not go to 
 hear first one and then another, to make remarks upon them, but stood 
 in his place, that he might neither give disturbance to another nor 
 receive any disturbance himself. 

 [3.] With great attention and a close application of mind: <I>The ears 
 of all the people were unto the book of the law</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 were even chained to it; they heard readily, and minded every word. The
 word of God commands attention and deserves it. If through carelessness 
 we let much slip in hearing, there is danger that through forgetfulness 
 we shall let all slip after hearing.</P>

 <A NAME="Ne8_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  And Nehemiah, which <I>is</I> the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest
 the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all
 the people, This day <I>is</I> holy unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God; mourn not,
 nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of
 the law.
 &nbsp; 10  Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink
 the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is
 prepared: for <I>this</I> day <I>is</I> holy unto our Lord: neither be ye
 sorry; for the joy of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> is your strength.
 &nbsp; 11  So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your
 peace, for the day <I>is</I> holy; neither be ye grieved.
 &nbsp; 12  And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and
 to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had
 understood the words that were declared unto them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the people were wounded with the words of the law that were read 
 to them. The law works death, and speaks terror, shows men their sins, 
 and their misery and danger because of sin, and thunders a curse 
 against every one that continues not in every part of his duty. 
 Therefore when they heard it they <I>all wept</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 it was a good sign that their hearts were tender, like Josiah's when he
 heard the words of the law. They wept to think how they had offended 
 God, and exposed themselves, by their many violations of the law; when 
 some wept all wept, for they all saw themselves guilty before God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How they were healed and comforted with the words of peace that 
 were spoken to them. It was well that they were so much affected with 
 the word of God, and received the impressions of it; but they must not 
 yield unduly to their mourning, especially at this time, because the 
 day was holy to the Lord; it was one of the solemn feasts, on which it 
 was their duty to rejoice; and even sorrow for sin must not hinder our 
 joy in God, but rather lead us to it and prepare us for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The masters of the assembly endeavoured to pacify them and encourage 
 them. Now Nehemiah is brought in, and not before, in this chapter; he 
 took notice of the people's weeping. Ezra was pleased to see them so 
 affected with the word, but Nehemiah observed to him, and Ezra 
 concurred in the thought, that it was now unseasonable. This day was 
 holy (it is called <I>a sabbath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:24">
 Lev. xxiii. 24</A>),

 and therefore was to be celebrated with joy and praise, not as if it
 were <I>a day to afflict their souls.</I>

 (1.) They forbade the people to <I>mourn and weep</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 <I>Be not sorry</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 <I>hold your peace, neither be you grieved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Every thing is beautiful in its season; as we must not be merry when
 <I>God calls to mourning,</I> so we must not frighten and afflict 
 ourselves when God gives us occasion to rejoice. Even sorrow for sin 
 must not grow so excessive as to hinder our joy in God and our 
 cheerfulness in his service.

 (2.) They commanded them to testify their joy, to put <I>on the 
 garments of praise instead of the spirit of heaviness.</I> They allowed 
 them, in token of their joy, to feast themselves, to eat and drink 
 better than on other days, <I>to eat the fat and drink the sweet;</I> 
 but then it must be, 

 [1.] With charity to the poor: "<I>Send portions to those for whom 
 nothing is prepared</I> that your abundance may supply their want, that 
 they may rejoice with you and their loins may bless you." Christ 
 directs those that make feasts to invite their poor neighbours,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:13">Luke xiv. 13</A>.

 But it is especially the duty of a religious feast, as well as of a
 religious fast, to <I>draw out the soul to the hungry,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:7,10">Isa. lviii. 7, 10</A>.

 God's bounty should make us bountiful. Many will eat the fat and drink
 the sweet themselves, even to excess, that will never allow portions, 
 nor scarcely crumbs, to the poor, who may read their own doom in the 
 parable of the rich man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:19-31">Luke xvi. 19</A>,

 &c. But such know not, or consider not, what God gave them their
 estates for. Observe, We must not only give to those that offer 
 themselves, but send to those that are out of sight. <I>The liberal 
 devises liberal things,</I> and seeks objects of charity. 

 [2.] It must be with piety and devotion: <I>The joy of the Lord is your 
 strength.</I> Let it not be a carnal sensual joy, but holy and 
 spiritual, the <I>joy of the Lord,</I> joy in the goodness of God, 
 under the direction and government of the grace of God, joy arising 
 from our interest in the love and favour of God and the tokens of his 
 favour. "This joy will be your strength, therefore encourage it; it 
 will be your strength, <I>First,</I> For the performance of the other 
 duties of the feast." The more cheerful we are in our religious 
 exercises the more we shall abound in them. <I>Secondly,</I> "For all 
 that which you have to do in conformity to the law of God which has 
 been read to you." Holy joy will be oil to the wheels of our obedience.  
 <I>Thirdly,</I> "For the resisting of your enemies that are plotting 
 against you." The joy of the Lord will arm us against the assaults of 
 our spiritual enemies, and put our mouths out of taste for those 
 pleasures with which the tempter baits his hooks.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The assembly complied with the directions that were given them. 
 Their weeping was <I>stilled</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 and they <I>made great mirth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Note, We ought always to have such a command of every passion as that,
 however it may break out, it may soon be restrained and called in again 
 when we are convinced that it is either unreasonable or unseasonable. 
 <I>He that has such a rule as this over his own spirit is better than 
 the mighty.</I> Observe,

 (1.) After they had wept they rejoiced. Holy mourning makes way for 
 holy mirth; those that <I>sow in tears shall reap in joy;</I> those 
 that tremble at the convictions of the word may triumph in the 
 consolations of it.

 (2.) The ground of their joy was very good. They made mirth, not 
 because they had the fat to eat and the sweet to drink, and a great 
 deal of good company, but because they had <I>understood the words that 
 were declared to them.</I> note, 

 [1.] To have the holy scriptures with us, and helps to understand them, 
 is a very great mercy, which we have abundant reason to rejoice in. 
 Bibles and ministers are the joy of God's Israel. 

 [2.] The better we understand the word of God the more comfort we shall 
 find in it; for the darkness of trouble arises from the darkness of 
 ignorance and mistake. When the words were first declared to them they 
 wept; but, when they understood them, they rejoiced, finding at length 
 precious promises made to those who repented and reformed and that 
 therefore there was hope in Israel.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And on the second day were gathered together the chief of
 the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto
 Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.
 &nbsp; 14  And they found written in the law which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had
 commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in
 booths in the feast of the seventh month:
 &nbsp; 15  And that they should publish and proclaim in all their
 cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and
 fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and
 palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as
 <I>it is</I> written.
 &nbsp; 16  So the people went forth, and brought <I>them,</I> and made
 themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in
 their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the
 street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of
 Ephraim.
 &nbsp; 17  And all the congregation of them that were come again out of
 the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since
 the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the
 children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.
 &nbsp; 18  Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he
 read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven
 days; and on the eighth day <I>was</I> a solemn assembly, according
 unto the manner.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The people's renewed attendance upon the word. They had spent the 
 greatest part of one day in praying and hearing, and yet were so far 
 from being weary of that new moon and sabbath that the next day after, 
 though it was no festival, the chief of them came together again to 
 hear Ezra expound 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 which they found more delightful and gainful than any worldly pleasure
 or profit whatsoever. Note, The more we converse with the word of God, 
 if we rightly understand it and be affected with it, the more we shall 
 covet to converse with it, and to increase in our acquaintance with it, 
 saying, <I>How sweet are thy words unto my mouth!</I> Those that 
 understand the scriptures well will still be desirous to understand 
 them better. Now the priests and the Levites themselves came with 
 <I>the chief of the people to Ezra,</I> that prince of expositors, 
 <I>to understand the words of the law,</I> or, as it is in the margin, 
 <I>that they might instruct in the words of the law;</I> they came to 
 be taught themselves, that they might be qualified to teach others. 
 Observe, 

 1. Though, on the first day, Ezra's humility had set them <I>on his
 right hand and on his left, as teachers with him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:4,7"><I>v.</I> 4, 7</A>),

 yet now, they being by trial made more sensible than ever of their own
 deficiencies and his excellencies, on the second day their humility set
 them at Ezra's feet, as learners of him. 

 2.  Those that would teach others must themselves receive instructions.
 Priests and Levites must be taught first and then teach.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The people's ready obedience to the word, in one particular
 instance, as soon as they were made sensible of their duty therein. It
 is probable that Ezra, <I>after the wisdom of his God that was in his
 hand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+7:25">Ezra vii. 25</A>),

 when they applied to him for instruction out of the law on the second
 day of the seventh month, read to them those laws which concerned the 
 feasts of that month, and, among the rest, that of the feast of 
 tabernacles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:34,De+16:13">Lev. xxiii. 34; Deut. xvi. 13</A>.

 Ministers should preach not only that which is true and good, but that
 which is seasonable, directing to the <I>work of the day in its 
 day.</I> Here is, 

 1. The divine appointment of the feast of tabernacles reviewed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 <I>They found written in the law</I> a commandment concerning it.
 Those that diligently search the scriptures will find those things 
 written there which they had forgotten or not duly considered. This 
 feast of tabernacles was a memorial of their dwelling in tents in the 
 wilderness, a representation of our tabernacle state in this world, and 
 a type of the holy joy of the gospel church.  The conversion of the 
 nations to the faith of Christ is foretold under the figure of this 
 feast

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:16">Zech. xiv. 16</A>);

 they shall come to <I>keep the feast of tabernacles,</I> as having here
 no continuing city. This feast was to be proclaimed in all their 
 cities. The people were themselves to fetch boughs of trees (they of
 Jerusalem fetched them from the mount of Olives) and to make booths, or 
 arbours, of them, in which they were to lodge (as much as the weather 
 would permit) and to make merry during the feast. 

 2. This appointment religiously observed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 Then we read and hear the word acceptably and profitably when we do
 according to what is written therein, when what appears to be our duty 
 is revived after it has been neglected.

 (1.) They observed the ceremony: <I>They sat in booths,</I> which the 
 priests and Levites set up in the courts of the temple; those that had 
 houses of their own set up booths on the roofs of them, or in their 
 courts; and those that had not such conveniences set them up in the 
 streets. This feast had usually been observed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:3,Ezr+3:4">2 Chron. v. 3; Ezra iii. 4</A>),

 but never with such solemnity as now since Joshua's time, when they
 were newly settled, as they were now newly re-settled in Canaan.  That 
 man loves his house too well that cannot find in his heart to quit it, 
 awhile, in compliance either with an ordinance or with a providence of 
 God. 

 (2.) They minded the substance, else the ceremony, how significant 
 soever, would have been insignificant. 

 [1.] They did it with gladness, with <I>very great gladness,</I> 
 rejoicing in God and his goodness to them. All their holy feasts, but 
 this especially, were to be celebrated with joy, which would be much 
 for the honour of God, and their own encouragement in his service. 

 [2.] They attended the reading and expounding of the word of God during 
 all the days of the feast, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 They improved their leisure for this good work. Spare hours cannot be
 better spent than in studying the scriptures and conversing with them.  
 At this feast of tabernacles God appointed the law to be read once in 
 seven years.  Whether this was that year of release in which that 
 service was to be performed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:10,11">Deut. xxxi. 10, 11</A>)

 does not appear; however they spent all the days of the feast in that
 good work, and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, as God had 
 appointed, in which they finished the solemnity the twenty-second day 
 of the month, yet did not separate, for the twenty-fourth day was 
 appointed to be spent in fasting and prayer. Holy joy just not 
 indispose us for godly sorrow any more than godly sorrow for holy 
 joy.</P>
