 When Abner was slain David was at a loss for a friend to perfect the 
 reduction of those tribes that were yet in Ish-bosheth's interest. 
 Which way to adopt for the accomplishment of it he could not tell; but 
 here Providence brings it about by the removal of Ish-bosheth. 

 I. Two of his own servants slew him, and brought his head to David,

 II. David, instead of rewarding them, put them to death for what they
 had done,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his
 hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
 &nbsp; 2 And Saul's son had two men <I>that were</I> captains of bands: the
 name of the one <I>was</I> Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab,
 the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin:
 (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin:
 &nbsp; 3 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners
 there until this day.)
 &nbsp; 4 And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son <I>that was</I> lame of <I>his</I>
 feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and
 Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and
 it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and
 became lame. And his name <I>was</I> Mephibosheth.
 &nbsp; 5 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah,
 went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of
 Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.
 &nbsp; 6 And they came thither into the midst of the house, <I>as
 though</I> they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under
 the fifth <I>rib:</I> and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
 &nbsp; 7 For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his
 bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him,
 and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.
 &nbsp; 8 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron,
 and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of
 Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The weakness of Saul's house. Still it grew weaker and weaker.

 1. As for Ishbosheth, who was in possession of the throne, his hands
 were feeble,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 All the strength they ever had was from Abner's support, and now that
 he was dead he had no spirit left in him.  Though Abner had, in a 
 passion, deserted his interest, yet he hoped, by his means, to make 
 good terms with David; but now even this hope fails him, and he sees 
 himself forsaken by his friends and at the mercy of his enemies. All 
 the Israelites that adhered to him were troubled and at a loss what to 
 do, whether to proceed in their treaty with David or no. 

 2. As for Mephibosheth, who in the right of his father Jonathan had a 
 prior title, his feet were lame, and he was unfit for any service, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He was but five years old when his father and grandfather were killed.
 His nurse, hearing of the Philistines' victory, was apprehensive that, 
 in pursuit of it, they would immediately send a party to Saul's house, 
 to cut off all that pertained to it, and would especially aim at her 
 young master, who was now next heir to the crown.  Under the 
 apprehension of this, she fled with the child in her arms, to secure it 
 either in some secret place where he could not be found, or in some 
 strong place where he could not be got at; and, making more haste than 
 good speed, she fell with the child, and by the fall some bone was 
 broken or put out, and not well set, so that he was lame of it as long 
 as he lived, and unfit either for court or camp. See what sad accidents 
 children are liable to in their infancy, the effect of which may be 
 felt by them, to their great uneasiness, all their days. Even the 
 children of princes and great men, the children of good men, for such a 
 one Jonathan was, children that are well tended, and have nurses of 
 their own to take care of them, yet are not always safe. What reason 
 have we to be thankful to God for the preservation of our limbs and 
 senses to us, through the many perils of the weak and helpless state of 
 infancy, and to own his goodness in giving his angels a charge 
 concerning us, to bear us up in their arms, out of which there is no 
 danger of falling,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:12">Ps. xci. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The murder of Saul's son. We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who were the murderers: <I>Baanah and Rechab,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+4:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 They were own brothers, as Simeon and Levi, and partners in iniquity.
 They were or had been Ish-bosheth's own servants, employed under him, 
 so much the more base and treacherous was it in them to do him a 
 mischief. They were Benjamites, of his own tribe. They were of the city 
 of Beeroth; for some reason which we cannot now account for care is 
 here taken to let us know (in a parenthesis) that that city belonged to 
 the lot of Benjamin, so we find

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:25">Josh. xviii. 25</A>),

 but that the inhabitants, upon some occasion or other, perhaps upon the
 death of Saul, retired to Gittaim, another city which lay not far off 
 in the same tribe, and was better fortified by nature, being situate 
 (if we may depend upon Mr.  Fuller's map) between the two rocks Bozez 
 and Seneh. There the Beerothites were when this was written, and 
 probably took root there, and never returned to Beeroth again, which 
 made Beeroth, that had been one of the cities of the Gibeonites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+9:17">Josh. ix. 17</A>),

 to be forgotten, and Gittaim to be famous long after, as we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+11:33">Neh. xi. 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How the murder was committed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+4:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.
 
 See here,

 (1.) The slothfulness of Ish-bosheth. He lay upon his bed at noon. It 
 does not appear that the country was at any time of the year so hot as 
 to oblige the inhabitants to retire at noon, as we are told they do in 
 Spain in the heat of summer; but Ishbosheth was a sluggish man, loved 
 his ease and hated business: and when he should have been, at this 
 critical juncture, at the head of his forces in the field, or at the 
 head of his counsels in a treaty with David, he was lying upon his bed 
 and sleeping, for his hands were feeble 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and so were his head and heart. When those difficulties dispirit us
 which should rather invigorate us and sharpen our endeavours we betray 
 both our crowns and lives. <I>Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty 
 and ruin.</I> The idle soul is an easy prey to the destroyer.

 (2.) The treachery of Baanah and Rechab. They came into the house, 
 under pretence of fetching wheat for the victualling of their 
 regiments; and such was the plainness of those times that the king's 
 corn-chamber and his bed-chamber lay near together, which gave them an 
 opportunity, when they were fetching wheat, to murder him as he lay on 
 the bed. We know not when and where death will meet us. When we lie 
 down to sleep we are not sure but that we may sleep the sleep of death 
 before we awake; nor do we know from what unsuspected hand a fatal 
 stroke may come.  Ish-bosheth's own men, who should have protected his 
 life, took it away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The murderers triumphed in what they had done. As if they had 
 performed some very glorious action, and the doing of it for David's 
 advantage was enough not only to justify it, but to sanctify it, they 
 made a present of Ish-bosheth's head to David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Behold the head of thy enemy,</I> than which they thought nothing
 could be more acceptable to him; yea, and they made themselves 
 instruments of God's justice, ministers to bear his sword, though they 
 had no commission: <I>The Lord hath avenged thee this day of Saul and 
 of his seed.</I> Not that they had any regard either to God or to 
 David's honour; they aimed at nothing but to make their own fortunes 
 (as we say) and to get preferment in David's court; but, to ingratiate 
 themselves with him, they pretended a concern for his life, a 
 conviction of his title, and a zealous desire to see him in full 
 possession of the throne. Jehu pretended <I>zeal for the Lord of 
 hosts</I> when an ambition to set up himself and his own family was the 
 spring of his actions.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of
 Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, <I>As</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth,
 who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,
 &nbsp; 10 When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to
 have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in
 Ziklag, who <I>thought</I> that I would have given him a reward for
 his tidings:
 &nbsp; 11 How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person
 in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require
 his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
 &nbsp; 12 And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and
 cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged <I>them</I> up over the
 pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried
 <I>it</I> in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here justice done upon the murderers of Ish-bosheth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Sentence passed upon them. There needed no evidence, their own 
 tongues witnessed against them; they were so far from denying the fact 
 that they gloried in it. David therefore shows them the heinousness of 
 the crime, and that blood called for blood from his hand, who was now 
 the chief magistrate, and was by office the avenger of blood. And, 
 perhaps, he was the more vigorous in the prosecution because for 
 reasons of state he had spared Joab: "<I>Shall I not require the blood 
 of the slain at the hand of the slayers,</I> and, since they cannot 
 make restitution, take theirs instead of it?" Observe, 

 1. How he aggravates the crime,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Ish-bosheth was a righteous person, he had done them no wrong, nor
 designed them any. As to himself, David was satisfied that what 
 opposition he gave him was not from malice, but mistake, from an idea 
 he had of his own title to the crown, and the influence of others upon 
 him, who urged him to put in for it. Note, Charity teaches us to make 
 the best, not only of our friends, but of our enemies, and to think 
 those may be righteous persons who yet, in some instances, do us wrong. 
 I must not presently judge a man a bad man because I think him so to 
 me. David owns Ish-bosheth an honest man, though he had created him a 
 great deal of trouble unjustly. The manner of it much aggravated the 
 crime. To slay him in his own house, which should have been his castle, 
 and upon his bed, when he was in no capacity of making any opposition, 
 this is treacherous and barbarous, and all that is base, and that which 
 the heart of every man who is not perfectly lost to all honour and 
 humanity will rise with indignation at the thought of. Assassinating is 
 confessedly the most odious and villainous way of murdering. <I>Cursed 
 is he that smiteth his neighbour secretly.</I> 
 
 2. He quotes a precedent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 he had put him to death who had brought him the tidings of the death of
 Saul, because he thought it would be good tidings to David. Nothing is 
 here said of that Amalekite's helping Saul to kill himself, only of his 
 bringing the tidings of his death, by which it should seem that the 
 story he told was upon enquiry found to be false, and that he lied 
 against his own head. "Now" (says David) "did I treat him as a 
 criminal, and not a favourite" (as he expected), "who brought me Saul's 
 crown, and shall those be held guiltless that bring me Ish-bosheth's 
 head?" 
 
 3. He ratifies the sentence with an oath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>As the Lord liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all
 adversity.</I> He expresses himself thus resolutely, to prevent the 
 making of any intercession for the criminals by those about him, and 
 thus piously to intimate that his dependence was upon God for the 
 putting of him in possession of the promised throne, and that he would 
 not be beholden to any man to help him to it by any indirect or 
 unlawful practices. God had redeemed him from all adversity hitherto, 
 helped him over many a difficulty and through many a danger, and 
 therefore he would depend upon him to crown and complete his own work.  
 He speaks of his redemption from all adversity as a thing done, though 
 he had many a storm yet before him, because he knew that he who had 
 delivered would deliver. 

 4. Hereupon he signs a warrant for the execution of these men,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This may seem severe, when they intended him a kindness in what they
 did; but,

 (1.) He would thus show his detestation of the villany. When he heard 
 that <I>the Lord smote Nabal, he gave thanks</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:38,39">1 Sam. xxv. 38, 39</A>),

 <I>for he is the God to whom vengeance belongeth;</I> but, if wicked
 men smite Ish-bosheth, they deserve to die for taking God's work out of 
 his hand.  

 (2.) He would thus show his resentment of the great affront they put 
 upon him in expecting that he should patronize and reward it; they 
 could scarcely have done him a greater injury than thus to think him 
 altogether such a one as themselves, one that cared not what blood he 
 waded through to the crown.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Execution done. The murderers were put to death according to law, 
 and their hands and feet were hung up; not their whole bodies, the law 
 forbade that; but only their hands and feet, <I>in terrorem--to frighten
 others,</I> to be monuments of David's justice, and to make that to be 
 taken notice of which would recommend him to the esteem of the people, 
 as a man fit to rule, and that aimed not at his own preferment, nor had 
 any enmity to the house of Saul, but only and sincerely designed the
 public welfare. But what a confusion was this to the two murderers! 
 What a horrid disappointment! And such those will meet with who think 
 to serve the interests of the Son of David by any immoral practices, by 
 war and persecution, fraud and rapine, who, under colour of religion, 
 murder princes, break solemn contracts, lay countries waste, <I>hate 
 their brethren, and cast them out, and say, Let the Lord be glorified, 
 kill them, and think they do God good service.</I> However men may 
 canonize such methods of serving the church and the catholic cause, 
 Christ will let them know, another day, that Christianity was not 
 intended to destroy humanity; and those who thus think to merit heaven 
 shall not escape the damnation of hell.</P>
