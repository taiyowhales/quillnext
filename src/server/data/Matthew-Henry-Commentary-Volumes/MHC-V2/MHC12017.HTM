 This chapter gives us an account of the captivity of the ten tribes, 
 and so finishes the history of that kingdom, after it had continued 
 about 265 years, from the setting up of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. In 
 it we have, 
 
 I. A short narrative of this destruction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II.  Remarks upon it, and the causes of it, for the justifying of God
 in it and for warning to others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:7-23">ver. 7-23</A>.

 III. An account of the nations which succeeded them in the possession 
 of their land, and the mongrel religion set up among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:24-41">ver. 24-41</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the
 son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.
 &nbsp; 2 And he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
 &nbsp; 3 Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea
 became his servant, and gave him presents.
 &nbsp; 4 And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he
 had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present
 to the king of Assyria, as <I>he had done</I> year by year: therefore
 the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
 &nbsp; 5 Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and
 went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.
 &nbsp; 6 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria,
 and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah
 and in Habor <I>by</I> the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the
 Medes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the reign and ruin of Hoshea, the last of the kings of 
 Israel, concerning whom observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That, though he forced his way to the crown by treason and murder 
 (as we read 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:30"><I>ch.</I> xv. 30</A>),

 yet he gained not the possession of it till seven or eight years after;
 for it was in the fourth year of Ahaz that he slew Pekah, but did not 
 himself begin to reign till the twelfth year of Ahaz, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Whether by the king of Assyria, or by the king of Judah, or by some of 
 his own people, does not appear, but it seems so long he was kept out 
 of the throne he aimed at. Justly were his bad practices thus 
 chastised, and the word of the prophet was thus fulfilled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:3">Hos. x. 3</A>),

 <I>Now they shall say We have no king, because we feared not the
 Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That, though he was bad, yet not so bad as the kings of Israel had 
 been before him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 not so devoted to the calves as they had been.  One of them (that at
 Dan), the Jews say, had been, before this, carried away by the king of 
 Assyria in the expedition recorded

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:29"><I>ch.</I> xv. 29</A>,

 (to which perhaps the prophet refers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:5">Hos. viii. 5</A>,

 <I>Thy calf, O Samaria!  has cast thee off</I>), which made him put the
 less confidence in the other. And some say that this Hoshea took off 
 the embargo which the former kings had put their subjects under, 
 forbidding them to go up to Jerusalem to worship, which he permitted 
 those to do that had a mind to it. But what shall we think of this 
 dispensation of providence, that the destruction of the kingdom of 
 Israel should come in the reign of one of the best of its kings? <I>Thy 
 judgments,</I> O God! <I>are a great deep.</I> God would hereby show 
 that in bringing this ruin upon them he designed to punish, 

 1. Not only the sins of that generation, but of the foregoing ages, and 
 to reckon for the iniquities of their fathers, who had been long in 
 filing the measure and treasuring up wrath against this day of wrath. 
 
 2. Not only the sins of their kings, but the sins of the people. If 
 Hoshea was not so bad as the former kings, yet the people were as bad 
 as those that went before them, and it was an aggravation of their 
 badness, and brought ruin the sooner, that their king did not set them 
 so bad an example as the former kings had done, nor hinder them from 
 reforming; he gave them leave to do better, but they did as bad as 
 ever, which laid the blame of their sin and ruin wholly upon 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That the destruction came gradually. They were for some time made 
 tributaries before they were made captives to the king of Assyria 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and, if that less judgment had prevailed to humble and reform them, the
 greater would have been prevented.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That they brought it upon themselves by the indirect course they
 took to shake off the yoke of the king of Assyria, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Had the king and people of Israel applied to God, made their peace with 
 him and their prayers to him, they might have recovered their liberty, 
 ease, and honour; but they withheld their tribute, and trusted to the 
 king of Egypt to assist them in their revolt, which, if it had taken 
 effect, would have been but to change their oppressors. But Egypt 
 became to them the staff of a broken reed. This provoked the king of 
 Assyria to proceed against them with the more severity. Men get nothing 
 by struggling with the net, but entangle themselves the more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That it was an utter destruction that came upon them. 

 1. The king of Israel was made a prisoner; he was shut up and bound, 
 being, it is probable, taken by surprise, before Samaria was besieged. 
 
 2. The land of Israel was made a prey. The army of the king of Assyria 
 came up throughout all the land, made themselves master of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and treated the people as traitors to be punished with the sword of
 justice rather than as fair enemies.

 3. The royal city of Israel was besieged, and at length taken.  Three 
 years it held out after the country was conquered, and no doubt a great 
 deal of misery was endured at that time which is not particularly 
 recorded; but the brevity of the story, and the passing of this matter 
 over lightly, methinks, intimate that they were abandoned of God and he 
 did not now regard the affliction of Israel, as sometimes as he had 
 done. 

 4. The people of Israel were carried captives into Assyria, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The generality of the people, those that were of any note, were forced
 away into the conqueror's country, to be slaves and beggars there.

 (1.) Thus he was pleased to exercise a dominion over them, and to show 
 that they were entirely at his disposal. 

 (2.) By depriving them of their possessions and estates, real and 
 personal, and exposing them to all the hardships and reproaches of a 
 removal to a strange country, under the power of an imperious army, he 
 chastised them for their rebellion and their endeavour to shake off his 
 yoke. 

 (3.) Thus he effectually prevented all such attempts for the future and 
 secured their country to himself. 

 (4.) Thus he got the benefit of their service in his own country, as 
 Pharaoh did that of their fathers; and so this unworthy people were 
 lost as they were found, and ended as they began, in servitude and 
 under oppression. 

 (5.) Thus he made room for those of his own country that had little, 
 and little to do, at home, to settle in a good land, a land flowing 
 with milk and honey. In all these several ways he served himself by 
 this captivity of the ten tribes. We are here told in what places of 
 his kingdom he disposed of them--in <I>Halah</I> and <I>Habor,</I> in 
 places, we may suppose, far distant from each other, lest they should 
 keep up a correspondence, incorporate again, and become formidable.  
 There, we have reason to think, after some time they were so mingled 
 with the nations that they were lost, and <I>the name of Israel was no 
 more in remembrance.</I> Those that forgot God were themselves 
 forgotten; those that studied to be like the nations were buried among 
 them; and those that would not serve God in their own land were made to 
 serve their enemies in a strange land. It is probable that they were 
 the men of honour and estates who were carried captive, and that many 
 of the meaner sort of people were left behind, many of every tribe, who 
 either went over to Judah or became subject to the Assyrian colonies, 
 and their posterity were <I>Galileans</I> or <I>Samaritans.</I> But 
 thus ended Israel as a nation; now they became <I>Lo-ammi--not a 
 people,</I> and <I>Lo-ruhamah--unpitied.</I> Now Canaan spued them out.  
 When we read of their entry under Hoshea the son of Nun who would have 
 thought that such as this should be their exit under Hoshea the son of 
 Elah? Thus Rome's glory in Augustus sunk, many ages after, in 
 Augustulus.  Providence so ordered the eclipsing of the honour of the 
 ten tribes that the honour of Judah (the royal tribe) and Levi (the
 holy tribe), which yet remained, might shine the brighter. Yet we find
 a number sealed of every one of the twelve tribes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:1-8">Rev. vii.</A>)

 except Dan.  James writes to the twelve tribes scattered abroad 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:1">Jam. i. 1</A>)

 and Paul speaks of the twelve tribes which <I>instantly served God day
 and night</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:7">Acts xxvi. 7</A>);

 so that though we never read of those that were carried captive, nor
 have any reason to credit the conjecture of some (that they yet remain 
 a distinct body in some remote corner of the world), yet a remnant of 
 them did escape, to keep up the name of Israel, till it came to be worn 
 by the gospel church, the spiritual Israel, in which it will ever 
 remain,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 For <I>so</I> it was, that the children of Israel had sinned
 against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God, which had brought them up out of the
 land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
 had feared other gods,
 &nbsp; 8 And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> cast
 out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of
 Israel, which they had made.
 &nbsp; 9 And the children of Israel did secretly <I>those</I> things that
 <I>were</I> not right against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God, and they built them
 high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen
 to the fenced city.
 &nbsp; 10 And they set them up images and groves in every high hill,
 and under every green tree:
 &nbsp; 11 And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as
 <I>did</I> the heathen whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> carried away before them; and
 wrought wicked things to provoke the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to anger:
 &nbsp; 12 For they served idols, whereof the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had said unto them,
 Ye shall not do this thing.
 &nbsp; 13 Yet the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> testified against Israel, and against Judah, by
 all the prophets, <I>and by</I> all the seers, saying, Turn ye from
 your evil ways, and keep my commandments <I>and</I> my statutes,
 according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and
 which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.
 &nbsp; 14 Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their
 necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God.
 &nbsp; 15 And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he
 made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified
 against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went
 after the heathen that <I>were</I> round about them, <I>concerning</I> whom
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had charged them, that they should not do like them.
 &nbsp; 16 And they left all the commandments of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God,
 and made them molten images, <I>even</I> two calves, and made a grove,
 and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.
 &nbsp; 17 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass
 through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold
 themselves to do evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to provoke him to
 anger.
 &nbsp; 18 Therefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was very angry with Israel, and removed
 them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah
 only.
 &nbsp; 19 Also Judah kept not the commandments of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God,
 but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.
 &nbsp; 20 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted
 them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had
 cast them out of his sight.
 &nbsp; 21 For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made
 Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from
 following the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and made them sin a great sin.
 &nbsp; 22 For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of
 Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them;
 &nbsp; 23 Until the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> removed Israel out of his sight, as he had
 said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away
 out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes was but briefly 
 related, it is in these verses largely commented upon by our historian, 
 and the reasons of it assigned, not taken from the second causes--the
 weakness of Israel, their impolitic management, and the strength and 
 growing greatness of the Assyrian monarch (these things are 
 overlooked)--but only from the First Cause. Observe, 

 1. It was <I>the Lord that removed Israel out of his sight;</I> whoever 
 were the instruments, he was the author of this calamity. It was 
 <I>destruction from the Almighty;</I> the Assyrian was but the <I>rod 
 of his anger,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:5">Isa. x. 5</A>.

 It was <I>the Lord that rejected the seed of Israel,</I> else their
 enemies could not have seized upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 <I>Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? Did not the
 Lord?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:24">Isa. xliii. 24</A>.

 We lose the benefit of national judgments if we do not eye the hand of 
 God in them, and the fulfilling of the scripture, for that also is 
 taken notice of here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>The Lord removed Israel</I> out of his favour, and out of their own
 land, <I>as he had said by all his servants the prophets.</I> Rather 
 shall heaven and earth pass than one tittle of God's word fall to the 
 ground. When God's word and his works are compared, it will be found 
 not only that they agree, but that they illustrate each other. But why 
 would God ruin a people that were raised and incorporated, as Israel 
 was, by miracles and oracles? Why would he undo that which he himself 
 had done at so vast an expense?  Was it purely an act of sovereignty? 
 No, it was an act of necessary justice.  For,

 2. They provoked him to do this by their wickedness. Was it God's 
 doing? Nay, it was their own; by their <I>way and their doings</I> they 
 <I>procured all this to themselves,</I> and it was their own wickedness 
 that did correct them. This the sacred historian shows here at large, 
 that it might appear that God did them no wrong and that others might 
 hear and fear. Come and see what it was that did all this mischief, 
 that broke their power and laid their honour in the dust; it was sin; 
 that, and nothing else, separated between them and God. This is here 
 very movingly laid open as the cause of all the desolations of Israel. 
 He here shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What God had done for Israel, to engage them to serve him. 

 1. He gave them their liberty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 He <I>brought them from under the hand of Pharaoh</I> who oppressed
 them, asserted their freedom (<I>Israel is my son</I>), and effected
 their freedom with a high hand.  Thus they were bound in duty and 
 gratitude to be his servants, for he had loosed their bonds; nor would 
 he that rescued them out of the hand of the king of Egypt have 
 contradicted himself so far as to deliver them into the hand of the 
 king of Assyria, as he did, if they had not, by their iniquity, 
 betrayed their liberty and sold themselves.

 2. He gave them their law, and was himself their king. They were 
 immediately under a divine regimen. They could not plead ignorance of 
 good and evil, sin and duty, for God had particularly charged them 
 against those very things which here he charges them with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 <I>That they should not do like the heathen.</I> Nor could they be in
 any doubt concerning their obligation to observe the laws which they 
 are here charged with rejecting, for they were <I>the commandments and 
 statutes</I> of the Lord their God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 so that no room was left to dispute whether they should keep them or
 no. He had not <I>dealt so with other nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:19,20">Ps. cxlvii. 19, 20</A>.

 3. He gave them <I>their land,</I> for he <I>cast out the heathen from 
 before them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 to make room for them; and the casting out of them for their idolatries
 was as fair a warning as could be given to Israel not to do like 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What they had done against God, notwithstanding these engagements 
 which he had laid upon them. 

 1. In general. They <I>sinned against the Lord their God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 they <I>did those things that were not right</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 but <I>secretly.</I> So wedded were they to their evil practices that
 when they could not do them publicly, could not for shame or could not 
 for fear, they would do them secretly--an evidence of their atheism, 
 that they thought what was done in secret was from under the eye of God 
 himself and would not be required. Again, they wrought wicked things in 
 such a direct contradiction to the divine law that they seemed as if 
 they were done on purpose to <I>provoke the Lord to anger</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 in contempt of his authority and defiance of his justice. They
 <I>rejected God's statutes and his covenant</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 would not be bound up either by his command or the consent they
 themselves had given to the covenant, but threw off the obligations of 
 both, and therefore God justly rejected them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:6">Hos. iv. 6</A>.

 They <I>left all the commandments of the Lord their God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 left the way, left the work, which those commandments prescribed them
 and directed them in.  Nay, lastly, they <I>sold themselves to do evil 
 in the sight of the Lord,</I> that is, they wholly addicted themselves 
 to sin, as slaves to the service of those to whom they are sold, and, 
 by their obstinately persisting in sin, so hardened their own hearts 
 that at length it had become morally impossible for them to recover 
 themselves, as one that has sold himself has put his liberty past 
 recall.

 2. In particular.  Though they were guilty (no doubt) of many 
 immoralities, and violated all the commands of the second table, yet 
 nothing is here specified, but their idolatry.  <I>This</I> was the sin 
 that did most easily beset them; this was, of all sins, most provoking 
 to God: it was the spiritual adultery that broke the marriage-covenant, 
 and was the inlet of all other wickedness. Hence it is again and again 
 mentioned here as the sin that ruined them.

 (1.) They feared other gods 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 that is, worshipped them and paid their homage to them, as if they
 feared their displeasure.

 (2.) They <I>walked in the statutes of the heathen,</I> which were 
 contrary to God's statutes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 did <I>as did the heathen</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>went after the heathen that were round about them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 so prostituting the honour of their peculiarity, and defeating God's
 design concerning them, which was that they should be distinguished 
 from the heathen. Must those that were taught of God go to school to 
 the heathen--those that were appropriated to God take their measures 
 from the nations that were abandoned by him?

 (3.) They <I>walked in the statutes of the</I> idolatrous <I>kings of 
 Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 <I>in all the sins of Jeroboam,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 When their kings assumed a power to alter and add to the divine 
 institutions they submitted to them, and thought the command of their 
 kings would bear them out in disobedience to the command of their God.

 (4.) They <I>built themselves high places in all their cities,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 If in any place there was but the tower of the watchmen (a country
 tower that had no walls, but only a tower to shelter the watch in time 
 of danger), or but a lodge for shepherds, it must be honoured with a 
 high place, and that with an altar. If there was a fenced city, it must 
 be further fortified with a high place. Having forsaken God's only 
 place, they knew no end of high places, in which every man followed his 
 own fancy and directed his devotion to what god he pleased. Sacred 
 things were hereby profaned and laid common, when their altars were 
 <I>as heaps in the furrows of the field,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:11">Hos. xii. 11</A>.

 (5.) They <I>set them up images and groves--Asherim</I> (even <I>wooden 
 images,</I> so some think the term, which we translate <I>groves,</I> 
 should be rendered) or <I>Ashtaroth</I> (so others)--directed contrary
 to the second commandment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 They served idols
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 the works of their own hands and creatures of their own fancy, though
 God had warned them particularly not to do this thing.

 (6.) They <I>burnt incense in all the high places,</I> to the honour of
 strange gods, for it was to the dishonour of the true God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 (7.) They followed vanity. Idols are called so, because they could do
 neither good nor evil, but were the most insignificant things that
 could be; those that worshipped them were like unto them, and so they
 became vain and good for nothing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 vain in their devotions, which were brutish and ridiculous, and so
 became vain in their whole conversation.

 (8.) Besides the molten images, even the two calves, they <I>worshipped
 all the host of heaven</I>--the sun, moon, and stars: for it is not
 meant of the heavenly host of angels; they could not rise so far above
 sensible things as to think of them. And, withal, they served Baal, the
 deified heroes of the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 (9.) <I>They caused their children to pass through the fire,</I> in
 token of their dedicating them to their idols. 

 (10.) They used divinations and enchantments, that they might receive 
 directions from the gods to whom they paid their devotions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What means God used with them, to bring them off from their 
 idolatries, and to how little purpose. He testified against them, 
 showed them their sins and warned them of the fatal consequences of 
 them by all the prophets and all the <I>seers</I> (for so the prophets 
 had been formerly called), and pressed them to <I>turn from their evil 
 ways,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 We have read of prophets, more or less, in every reign. Though they had
 forsaken God's family of priests, he did not leave them without a 
 succession of prophets, who made it their business to teach them the 
 good knowledge of the Lord, but all in vain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 they would not hear, but hardened their necks, persisted in their
 idolatries, and were like their fathers, that would not bow their necks 
 to God's yoke, because they <I>did not believe in him,</I> did not 
 receive his truths, nor would venture upon his promises: it seems to 
 refer to their fathers in the wilderness; the same sin that kept them 
 out of Canaan turned these out, and that was unbelief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How God punished them for their sins. He <I>was very angry with 
 them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 for, in the matter of his worship, he is a jealous God, and resents
 nothing more deeply than giving that honour to any creature which is 
 due to himself only. He afflicted them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 and <I>delivered them into the hand of spoilers,</I> in the days of the
 judges and of Saul, and afterwards in the days of most of their kings, 
 to see if they would be awakened by the judgments of God to consider 
 and amend their ways; but, when all these corrections did not prevail 
 to drive out the folly, God first <I>rent Israel from the house of 
 David,</I> under which they might have been happy. As Judah was hereby 
 weakened, so Israel was hereby corrupted; for they made a man king who 
 <I>drove them from following the Lord and caused them to sin a great 
 sin,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 This was a national judgment, and the punishment of their former 
 idolatries; and, at length, he <I>removed them quite out of his 
 sight</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:18,23"><I>v.</I> 18, 23</A>),

 without giving them any hopes of a return out of their captivity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is a complaint against Judah in the midst of all 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Also Judah kept not the commandments of God;</I> though they were
 not as yet quite so bad as Israel, yet they <I>walked in the statutes 
 of Israel;</I> and this aggravated the sin of Israel, that they 
 communicated the infection of it to Judah; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:11">Ezek. xxiii. 11</A>.

 Those that bring sin into a country or family bring a plague into it
 and will have to answer for all the mischief that follows.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24 And the king of Assyria brought <I>men</I> from Babylon, and from
 Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and
 placed <I>them</I> in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of
 Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities
 thereof.
 &nbsp; 25 And <I>so</I> it was at the beginning of their dwelling there,
 <I>that</I> they feared not the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: therefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sent lions
 among them, which slew <I>some</I> of them.
 &nbsp; 26 Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The
 nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of
 Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he
 hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because
 they know not the manner of the God of the land.
 &nbsp; 27 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither
 one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go
 and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of
 the land.
 &nbsp; 28 Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from
 Samaria came and dwelt in Beth-el, and taught them how they should
 fear the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 29 Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put <I>them</I>
 in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made,
 every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.
 &nbsp; 30 And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of
 Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
 &nbsp; 31 And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites
 burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the
 gods of Sepharvaim.
 &nbsp; 32 So they feared the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and made unto themselves of the
 lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for
 them in the houses of the high places.
 &nbsp; 33 They feared the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and served their own gods, after the
 manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.
 &nbsp; 34 Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear
 not the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, neither do they after their statutes, or after
 their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;
 &nbsp; 35 With whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had made a covenant, and charged them,
 saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them,
 nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:
 &nbsp; 36 But the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt
 with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and
 him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.
 &nbsp; 37 And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the
 commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for
 evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.
 &nbsp; 38 And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not
 forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.
 &nbsp; 39 But the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver
 you out of the hand of all your enemies.
 &nbsp; 40 Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their
 former manner.
 &nbsp; 41 So these nations feared the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and served their graven
 images, both their children, and their children's children: as
 did their fathers, so do they unto this day.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Never was land lost, we say, for want of an heir. When the children of 
 Israel were dispossessed, and turned out of Canaan, the king of Assyria 
 soon transplanted thither the supernumeraries of his own country, such 
 as it could well spare, who should be servants to him and masters to 
 the Israelites that remained; and here we have an account of these new 
 inhabitants, whose story is related here that we may take our leave of 
 Samaria, as also of the Israelites that were carried captive into 
 Assyria.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning the Assyrians that were brought into the land of Israel 
 we are here told, 

 1. That they possessed Samaria and <I>dwelt in the cities thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 It is common for lands to change their owners, but sad that the holy 
 land should become a heathen land again.  See what work sin makes.

 2. That at their first coming God <I>sent lions among them.</I> They 
 were probably insufficient to people the country, which occasioned 
 <I>the beasts of the field to multiply against them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:29">Exod. xxiii. 29</A>);

 yet, besides the natural cause, there was a manifest hand of God in it,
 who is Lord of hosts, of all the creatures, and can serve his own 
 purposes by which he pleases, small or great, lice or lions. God 
 ordered them this rough welcome to check their pride and insolence, and 
 to let them know that though they had conquered Israel the God of 
 Israel had power enough to deal with them--that he could have prevented 
 their settling here, by ordering lions into the service of Israel, and 
 that he permitted it, not for their righteousness, but the wickedness 
 of his own people--and that they were now under his visitation. They 
 had lived without God in their own land, and were not plagued with 
 lions; but, if they do so in this land, it is at their peril. 

 3. That they sent a remonstrance of this grievance to the king their 
 master, setting forth, it is likely, the loss their infant colony had 
 sustained by the lions and the continual fear they were in of them, and 
 stating that they looked upon it to be a judgment upon them for not 
 worshipping the God of the land, which they could not, because they 
 knew not how, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 The God of Israel was the God of the whole world, but they ignorantly
 call him the <I>God of the land,</I> apprehending themselves therefore 
 within his reach, and concerned to be upon good terms with him. Herein 
 they shamed the Israelites, who were not so ready to hear the voice of 
 God's judgments as they were, and who had not served the <I>God of that 
 land,</I> though he was the God of their fathers and their great 
 benefactor, and though they were well instructed in the manner of his 
 worship.  Assyrians begged to be taught that which Israelites hated to 
 be taught.

 4. That the king of Assyria took care to have them taught <I>the manner 
 of the God of the land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>),

 not out of any affection to that God, but to save his subjects from the
 lions. On this errand he sent back one of the priests whom he had 
 carried away captive. A prophet would have done them more good, for 
 this was but one of the priests of the calves, and therefore chose to 
 dwell at Bethel for old acquaintance' sake, and, though he might teach 
 them to do better than they did, he was not likely to teach them to do 
 well, unless he had taught his own people better. However, he came and 
 dwelt among them, to teach them how they should <I>fear the Lord.</I> 
 Whether he taught them out of the book of the law, or only by word of 
 mouth, is uncertain.

 5.  That, being thus taught, they made a mongrel religion of it, 
 worshipped the God of Israel for fear and their own idols for love 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>They feared the Lord,</I> but they <I>served their own gods.</I>
 They all agreed to worship the God of the land according to the manner, 
 to serve the Jewish festivals and rites of sacrificing, but every 
 nation made gods of their own besides, not only for their private use 
 in their own families, but to be put <I>in the houses of their high 
 places,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 The idols of each country are here named,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>.

 The learned are at a loss for the signification of several of these 
 names, and cannot agree by what representations these gods were 
 worshipped. If we may credit the traditions of the Jewish doctors, they 
 tell us that Succoth-Benoth was worshipped in a hen and chickens, 
 Nergal in a cock, Ashima in a smooth goat, Nibhaz in a dog, Tartak in 
 an ass, Adrammelech in a peacock, Anammelech in a pheasant. Our own 
 tell us, more probably, that Succoth-Benoth (signifying <I>the tents of 
 the daughters</I>) was Venus. Nergal, being worshipped by the Cuthites, 
 or Persians, was <I>the fire,</I> Adrammelech and Anammelech were only 
 distinctions of Moloch. See how vain idolaters were in their 
 imaginations, and wonder at their sottishness. Our very ignorance 
 concerning these idols teaches us the accomplishment of that word which 
 God has spoken, that these false gods should all perish 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:11">Jer. x. 11</A>);
 
 they are all buried in oblivion, while the name of the true God shall
 continue for ever. 

 6. This medley superstition is here said to <I>continue unto this 
 day</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 till the time when this book was written and long after, above 300
 years in all, till the time of Alexander the Great, when Manasse, 
 brother to Jaddus the high priest of the Jews, having married the 
 daughter of Sanballat, governor of the Samaritans, went over to them, 
 got leave of Alexander to build a temple in Mount Gerizim, drew over 
 many of the Jews to him, and prevailed with the Samaritans to cast away 
 all their idols and to worship the God of Israel only; yet their 
 worship was mixed with so much superstition that our Saviour told them 
 they knew not what they worshipped,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:22">John iv. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning the Israelites that were carried into the land of 
 Assyria. This historian has occasion to speak of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 showing that their successors in the land did as they had done
 (<I>after the manner of the nations whom they carried away</I>), they
 worshipped both the God of Israel and those other gods; but what did 
 the captives do in the land of their affliction? Were they reformed, 
 and brought to repentance, by their troubles? No, they did after the 
 former manner,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 When the two tribes were afterwards carried into Babylon, they were 
 cured by it of their idolatry, and therefore, after seventy years, they 
 were brought back with joy; but the ten tribes were hardened in the 
 furnace, and therefore were justly lost in it and left to perish. This 
 obstinacy of theirs is here aggravated by the consideration,

 1. Of the honour God had put upon them, as the seed of Jacob, <I>whom 
 he named Israel,</I> and from him they were so named, but were a 
 reproach to <I>that worthy name by which they were called.</I> 

 2. Of the covenant he made with them, and the charge he gave them upon 
 that covenant, which is here very fully recited, that they should 
 <I>fear and serve the Lord Jehovah</I> only, who had <I>brought them up 
 out of Egypt</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 that, having received his statutes and ordinances in writing, they
 should <I>observe to do them for evermore</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 and never forget that covenant which God had made with them, the
 promises and conditions of that covenant, especially that great article 
 of it which is here thrice repeated, because it had been so often 
 inculcated and so much insisted on, that they <I>should not fear other 
 gods.</I> He had told them that, if they kept close to him, he would 
 <I>deliver them out of the hand of all their enemies</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>);

 yet when they were in the hand of their enemies, and stood in need of
 deliverance, they were so stupid, and had so little sense of their own 
 interest, that they did after the former manner

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 they served both the true God and false gods, as if they knew no
 difference.  <I>Ephraim is joined to idols, let him alone.</I> So they 
 did, and so did the nations that succeeded them. Well might the apostle 
 ask, <I>What then, Are we better than they? No, in no wise, for both 
 Jews and Gentiles are all under sin,</I>
