 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The predictions in the foregoing chapters concerning the ruin of Eli's 
 house here begin to be fulfilled; how long after does not appear, but 
 certainly not long. Such sinners God often makes quick work with. Here 
 is, 

 I. The disgrace and loss Israel sustained in an encounter with the
 Philistines, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Their foolish project to fortify themselves by bringing the ark of
 God into their camp upon the shoulders of Hophni and Phinehas 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>),

 which made them secure 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:5">ver.  5</A>)

 and struck a fear into the Philistines, but such a fear as roused them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.

 III. The fatal consequences of it: Israel was beaten, and the ark taken
 prisoner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:10,11">ver.  10, 11</A>.

 IV. The tidings of this brought to Shiloh, and the sad reception of
 those tidings. 
 
 1. The city was put into confusion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:12,13">ver. 12, 13</A>.

 2. Eli fainted away, fell, and broke his neck, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:14-18">ver. 14-18</A>.

 3. Upon hearing what had occurred his daughter-in-law fell in labour,
 bore a son, but died immediately, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:19-22">ver. 19-22</A>.

 These were the things which would make the ears of those that heard
 them to tingle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went
 out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside
 Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
 &nbsp; 2 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel:
 and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the
 Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four
 thousand men.
 &nbsp; 3 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of
 Israel said, Wherefore hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> smitten us to day before the
 Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> out
 of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us
 out of the hand of our enemies.
 &nbsp; 4 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from
 thence the ark of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, which
 dwelleth <I>between</I> the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni
 and Phinehas, <I>were</I> there with the ark of the covenant of God.
 &nbsp; 5 And when the ark of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came into the
 camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth
 rang again.
 &nbsp; 6 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they
 said, What <I>meaneth</I> the noise of this great shout in the camp of
 the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was
 come into the camp.
 &nbsp; 7 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come
 into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not
 been such a thing heretofore.
 &nbsp; 8 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these
 mighty Gods? these <I>are</I> the Gods that smote the Egyptians with
 all the plagues in the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 9 Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines,
 that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to
 you: quit yourselves like men, and fight.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first words of this paragraph, which relate to Samuel, that <I>his 
 word came to all Israel,</I> seem not to have any reference to the 
 following story, as if it was by any direction of his that the 
 Israelites went out against the Philistines. Had they consulted him, 
 though but newly initiated as a prophet, his counsel might have stood 
 them in more stead than the presence of the ark did; but perhaps the 
 princes of Israel despised his youth, and would not have recourse to 
 him as an oracle, and he did not as yet interpose in public affairs; 
 nor do we find any mention of his name henceforward till some years 
 after 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:3"><I>ch.</I> vii. 3</A>),

 only <I>his word came to all Israel,</I> that is, people from all parts
 that were piously disposed had recourse to him as a prophet and 
 consulted him. Perhaps it is meant of his prophecy against the house of 
 Eli. This was generally known and talked of, and all that were serious 
 and observing compared the events here related, when they came to pass, 
 with the prophecy, and saw it accomplished in them. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A war entered into with the Philistines, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It was an attempt to throw off the yoke of their oppression, and would
 have succeeded better if they had first repented and reformed, and so 
 begun their work at the right end. It is computed that this was about 
 the middle of the forty years' dominion that the Philistines had over 
 Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:1">Judg. xiii. 1</A>)

 and soon after the death of Samson; so bishop Patrick, who thinks the
 slaughter he made at his death might encourage this attempt; but Dr.  
 Lightfoot reckons it forty years after Samson's death, for so long Eli 
 judged, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The defeat of Israel in that war, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Israel, who were the aggressors, were smitten, and had 4000 men killed
 upon the spot. God had promised that one of them should chase a 
 thousand; but now, on the contrary, <I>Israel is smitten before the 
 Philistines.</I> Sin, the accursed thing, was in the camp, and gave 
 their enemies all the advantage against them they could wish for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The measures they concerted for another engagement. A council of 
 war was called, and, instead of resolving to fast and pray and amend 
 their lives, so ill taught were they (and no wonder when they had such 
 teachers) that, 

 1. They quarrelled with God for appearing against them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>Wherefore has the Lord smitten us?</I> If they meant this as an
 enquiry into the cause of God's displeasure, they needed not go far to 
 find that out. It was plain enough; Israel had sinned, though they were 
 not willing to see it and own it. But it rather seems that they 
 expostulate boldly with God about it, are displeased at what God has 
 done, and dispute the matter with him. They own the hand of God in 
 their trouble (so far was right): "It is the Lord that has smitten us;" 
 but, instead of submitting to it, they quarrel with it, and speak as 
 those that are angry at him and his providence, and not aware of any 
 just provocation they have given him: "Wherefore shall we, that are 
 Israelites, be smitten before the Philistines? How absurd and unjust is 
 it!" Note, The foolishness of man perverts his way, and then his heart 
 <I>frets against the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:3">Prov. xix. 3</A>)
 
 and finds fault with him.

 2.  They imagined that they could oblige him to appear for them the
 next time by bringing the ark into their camp. The elders of Israel 
 were so ignorant and foolish as to make the proposal 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and the people soon put it in execution,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They sent to Shiloh for the ark, and Eli had not courage enough to
 detain it, but sent his ungodly sons, Hophni and Phinehas, along with 
 it, at least permitted them to go, though he knew that wherever they 
 went the curse of God went along with them. Now see here,

 (1.) The profound veneration the people had for the ark. "O send for
 that, and it will do wonders for us." The ark was, by institution, a 
 visible token of God's presence. God had said that he would dwell 
 <I>between the cherubim,</I> which were over the ark and were carried 
 along with it; now they thought that, by paying a great respect to this 
 sacred chest, they should prove themselves to be Israelites indeed, and 
 effectually engage God Almighty to appear in their favour. Note, It is 
 common for those that have estranged themselves from the vitals of 
 religion to discover a great fondness for the rituals and external 
 observances of it, for those that even deny the power of godliness not 
 only to have, but to have in admiration, the form of it. The temple of 
 the Lord is cried up, and the ark of the Lord stickled for with a great 
 deal of seeming zeal by multitudes that have no regard at all for the 
 Lord of the temple and the God of the ark, as if a fiery concern for 
 the name of Christianity would atone for a profane contempt of the 
 thing. And yet indeed they did but make an idol of the ark, and looked 
 upon it to be as much an image of the God of Israel as those idols 
 which the heathen worshipped were of their gods.  To worship the true 
 God, and not to worship him as God, is in effect not to worship him at 
 all. 

 (2.) Their egregious folly in thinking that the ark, if they had it in
 their camp, would certainly <I>save them out of the hand of their 
 enemies,</I> and bring victory back to their side.  For,

 [1.] When the ark set forward Moses prayed, <I>Rise up, Lord, and let
 thy enemies be scattered,</I> well knowing that it was not the ark 
 moving with them, but God appearing for them, that must give them 
 success; and here were no proper means used to engage God to favour 
 them with his presence; what good then would the ark do them, the shell 
 without the kernel? 

 [2.] They were so far from having God's leave to remove his ark that he
 had plainly enough intimated to them in his law that when they were 
 settled in Canaan his ark should be settled in the place that he should 
 choose

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:5,11">Deut. xii. 5, 11</A>),

 and that they must come to it, not it to them. How then could they
 expect any advantage by it when they had not a just and legal 
 possession of it, nor any warrant to remove it from its place? Instead 
 of honouring God by what they did, they really affronted him. Nay, 

 [3.] If there had been nothing else to invalidate their expectations
 from the ark, how could they expect it should bring a blessing when 
 Hophni and Phinehas were the men that carried it? It would have given 
 too much countenance to their villany if the ark had done any kindness 
 to Israel while it was in the hands of those graceless priests.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The great joy there was in the camp of Israel when the ark was 
 brought into it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>They shouted, so that the earth rang again.</I> Now they thought
 themselves sure of victory, and therefore gave a triumphant shout 
 before the battle, as if the day was without fail their own, intending, 
 by this mighty shout, to animate themselves and their own forces, and 
 to intimidate their adversaries. Note, Carnal people triumph much in 
 the external privileges and performances of religion, and build much 
 upon them, as if these would infallibly save them, and as if the ark, 
 God's throne, in the camp, would bring them to heaven, though the world 
 and the flesh should be upon the throne in the heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The consternation into which the bringing of the ark into the camp 
 of Israel put the Philistines. The two armies lay so near encamped that 
 the Philistines heard the shout the Israelites gave on this great 
 occasion. They soon understood what it was they triumphed in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 and were afraid of the consequences. For,

 1. It had never been done before in their days: <I>God has come into
 their camp,</I> and therefore <I>woe unto us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and again, <I>woe unto us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The name of the God of Israel was formidable even to those that
 worshipped other gods, and some apprehensions even the infidels had of 
 the danger of contending with them. Natural conscience suggests this, 
 that those are in a woeful condition who have God against them. Yet see 
 what gross notions they had of the divine presence, as if the God of 
 Israel were not as much in the camp before the ark came thither, which 
 may very well be excused in them, since the notions the Israelites 
 themselves had of that presence were no better.  "O," say they, "this 
 is a new design upon us, more frightful than all their stratagems, for 
 <I>there has not been such a thing heretofore;</I> this was the most 
 effectual course they could take to dispirit our men and weaken their 
 hands."

 2. When it had been done in the days of old, it had wrought wonders: 
 <I>These are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in 
 the wilderness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Here they were as much out in their history as in their divinity: the
 plagues of Egypt were inflicted before the ark was made and before 
 Israel came into the wilderness; but some confused traditions they had 
 of wonders wrought by or for Israel when this ark was carried before 
 them, which they attributed, not to Jehovah, but to the ark. Now, say 
 they, <I>Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods?</I> 
 taking the ark for God, as well they might when the Israelites 
 themselves idolized it. Yet, it should seem, they scarcely believed 
 themselves when they spoke thus formidably of <I>these mighty gods,</I> 
 but only bantered; for instead of retreating, or proposing conditions 
 of peace, which they would have done had they been really convinced of 
 the power of Israel's God, they stirred up one another to fight so much 
 the more stoutly; this surprising difficulty did but sharpen their 
 resolution 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Be strong, and quit yourselves like men.</I> The commanders inspired
 bold and generous thoughts into the minds of their soldiers when they 
 bade them remember how they had lorded it over Israel, and what an 
 intolerable grief and shame it would be if they flinched now, and 
 suffered Israel to lord it over them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they
 fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great
 slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.
 &nbsp; 11 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli,
 Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a short account of the issue of this battle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Israel was smitten, the army dispersed and totally routed, not 
 retiring into the camp, as before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 when they hoped to rally again, but returning to their tents, every man
 shifting for his own safety and making the best of his way home, 
 despairing to make head any more; and 30,000 were slain in the field of 
 battle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Israel was put to the worse,

 1. Though they had the better cause, were the people of God and the
 Philistines were uncircumcised; they stood up in necessary defence of 
 their just rights and liberties against invaders, and yet they failed 
 of success, for <I>their rock had sold them.</I> A good cause often 
 suffers for the sake of the bad men that undertake it.  

 2. Though they had the greater confidence, and were the more 
 courageous. They shouted, while the Philistines trembled, and yet, when 
 God pleased so to order it, the Philistines' terrors were turned into 
 triumphs, and Israel's shouts into lamentations. 

 3. Though they had the ark of God with them.  External privileges will
 secure none that abuse them and do not live up to them. The ark in the 
 camp will add nothing to its strength when there is an Achan in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The ark itself was taken by the Philistines; and Hophni and 
 Phinehas, who it is likely kept close to it, and when it was in danger 
 ventured far in the defense of it, because by it they got their living, 
 were <I>both slain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 To this sad even the Psalmist refers,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:61,64">Ps. lxxviii. 61, 64</A>,

 <I>He delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the
 enemy's hands. Their priests fell by the sword.</I>

 1.  The slaughter of the priests, considering their bad character, was
 no great loss to Israel, but it was a dreadful judgment upon the house 
 of Eli. The word which God had spoken was fulfilled in it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:34"><I>ch.</I> ii. 34</A>):

 <I>This shall be a sign unto thee,</I> an earnest of the judgments
 threatened, <I>thy two sons shall die both in one day,</I> and so shall
 all <I>the increase of thy house die in the flower of their age,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 If Eli had done his duty, and <I>put them, as polluted, from the
 priesthood</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+7:64">Neh. vii. 64</A>),

 they might have lived, though in disgrace; but now God takes the work
 into his own hands, and chases them out of the world by the sword of 
 the uncircumcised. <I>The Lord is known by those judgments which he 
 executeth.</I> It is true the sword devours one as well as another, but 
 these were waited for of the sword, marked for vengeance. They were out 
 of the place; what had they to do in the camp? When men leave the way 
 of their duty they shut themselves out of God's protection. But this 
 was not all; they had betrayed the ark, by bringing it into danger, 
 without a warrant from God, and this filled the measure of their 
 iniquities. But,

 2. The taking of the ark was a very great judgment upon Israel, and a 
 certain token of God's hot displeasure against them. Now they are made 
 to see their folly in trusting to their external privileges which they 
 had by their wickedness forfeited them, and fancying that the ark would 
 save them when God had departed from them. Now they are made to 
 reflect, with the utmost regret, upon their own rashness and 
 presumption in bringing the ark into the camp and so exposing it, and 
 wish a thousand times they had left it where God had fixed it. Now they 
 are convinced that God will not be prescribed to by vain and foolish 
 men, and that though he has bound us to his ark he has not bound 
 himself to it, but will rather deliver it into the hands of his sworn 
 enemies than suffer it to be profaned by his false friends, and 
 countenance their superstition. Let none think to shelter themselves 
 from the wrath of God under the cloak of a visible profession, for 
 there will be those cast into outer darkness that have <I>eaten and 
 drunk in Christ's presence.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to
 Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon
 his head.
 &nbsp; 13 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
 watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the
 man came into the city, and told <I>it,</I> all the city cried out.
 &nbsp; 14 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What
 <I>meaneth</I> the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily,
 and told Eli.
 &nbsp; 15 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were
 dim, that he could not see.
 &nbsp; 16 And the man said unto Eli, I <I>am</I> he that came out of the
 army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is
 there done, my son?
 &nbsp; 17 And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before
 the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among
 the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead,
 and the ark of God is taken.
 &nbsp; 18 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God,
 that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate,
 and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and
 heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Tidings are here brought to Shiloh of the fatal issue of their battle 
 with the Philistines. Bad news flies fast. This soon spread through all 
 Israel; every man that fled to his tent brought it, with too plain a 
 proof of it, to his neighbours. But no place was so nearly concerned as 
 Shiloh. Thither therefore an express posted away immediately; it was a 
 man of Benjamin; the Jews fancy it was Saul. <I>He rent his clothes, 
 and put earth upon his head,</I> by these signs to proclaim the 
 sorrowful news to all that saw him as he ran, and to show how much he 
 himself was affected with it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He went straight to Shiloh with it; and here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the city received it. <I>Eli sat in the gate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:13,18"><I>v.</I> 13, 18</A>),
 
 but the messenger was loth to tell him first, and therefore passed him
 by, and told it in the city, with all the aggravating circumstances; 
 and now <I>both the ears of every one that heard it tingled,</I> as was 
 foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:11"><I>ch.</I> iii. 11</A>.

 Their hearts trembled, and every face gathered blackness. <I>All the
 city cried out</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and well they might, for, besides that this was a calamity to all
 Israel, it was a particular loss to Shiloh, and the ruin of that place; 
 for, though the ark was soon rescued out of the hands of the 
 Philistines, yet it never returned to Shiloh again; their candlestick 
 was removed out of its place, because they had <I>left their first 
 love,</I> and their city dwindled, and sunk, and came to nothing. Now 
 God <I>forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,</I> they having driven him 
 from them; and the tribe of Ephraim, which had for 340 years been 
 blessed with the presence of the ark in it, lost the honour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:60,67">Ps. lxxviii. 60, 67</A>),

 and, some time after, it was transferred to the tribe of Judah, the
 <I>Mount Sion which he loved,</I> as it follows there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:68"><I>v.</I> 68</A>),

 because the men of Shiloh knew not <I>the day of their visitation.</I>
 This abandoning of Shiloh Jerusalem is long afterwards reminded of, and 
 told to take warning by. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:12">Jer. vii. 12</A>,

 "<I>Go see what I did to Shiloh.</I> From this day, this fatal day, let
 the desolations of Shiloh be dated." They had therefore reason enough 
 to cry out when they heard that the ark was taken.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What a fatal blow it was to old Eli. Let us see, 

 1. With what fear he expected the tidings. Though old, and blind, and
 heavy, yet he could not keep his chamber when he was sensible the glory 
 of Israel lay at stake, but placed himself by the way-side, to receive 
 the first intelligence; for <I>his heart trembled for the ark of 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 His careful thoughts represented to him what a dishonour it would be to
 God, and what an irreparable loss to Israel, if the ark should fall 
 into the Philistines' hands, with what profane triumphs the tidings 
 would be told in Gath and published in the streets of Ashkelon. He also 
 apprehended what imminent danger there was of it.  Israel had forfeited 
 the ark (his own sons especially) and the Philistines would aim at it; 
 and now the threatening comes to his mind, that he should <I>see an 
 enemy in God's habitation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:32"><I>ch.</I> ii. 32</A>);

 and perhaps his own heart reproached him for not using his authority to
 prevent the carrying of the ark into the camp. All these things made 
 him tremble. Note, All good men lay the interests of God's church 
 nearer their hearts than any secular interest or concern of their own, 
 and cannot but be in pain and fear for them if at any time they are in 
 peril. How can we be easy if the ark be not safe? 

 2. With what grief he received the tidings. Though he could not see, he
 could hear the <I>tumult</I> and <I>crying of the city,</I> and 
 perceived it to be the voice of lamentation, and mourning, and woe; 
 like a careful magistrate, he asks, <I>What means the noise of this 
 tumult?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He is told there is an express come from the army, who relates the
 story to him very distinctly, and with great confidence, having himself 
 been an eye-witness of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 The account of the defeat of the army, and the slaughter of a great
 number of the soldiers, was very grievous to him as a judge; the 
 tidings of the death of his two sons, of whom he had been so indulgent, 
 and who, he had reason to fear, died impenitent, touched him in a 
 tender part as a father; yet it was not for these that his heart 
 trembled: there is a greater concern upon his spirit, which swallows up 
 the less; he does not interrupt the narrative with any passionate 
 lamentations for his sons, like David for Absalom, but waits for the 
 end of the story, not doubting but that the messenger, being an 
 Israelite, would, without being asked, say something of the ark; and if 
 he could but have said, "Yet the ark of God is safe, and we are 
 bringing that home," his joy for that would have overcome his grief for 
 all the other disasters, and have made him easy; but, when the 
 messenger concludes his story with, <I>The ark of God is taken,</I> he 
 is struck to the heart, his spirits fail, and, it should seem, he 
 swooned away, fell off his seat, and partly with the fainting, and 
 partly with the fall, he died immediately, and never spoke a word more.  
 His heart was broken first, and then his neck. So fell the high priest 
 and judge of Israel, so fell his heavy head when he had lived within 
 two of 100 years, so fell the crown from his head when he had judged 
 Israel about forty years: thus did his sun set under a cloud, thus were 
 the folly and wickedness of those sons of his, whom he had indulged, 
 his ruin at last. Thus does God sometimes set marks of his displeasure 
 in this life upon good men who have misconducted themselves, that 
 others may hear, and fear, and take warning. A man may die miserably 
 and yet not die eternally, may come to an untimely end and yet the end 
 be peace. Dr. Lightfoot observes that Eli died the death of an 
 unredeemed ass, whose neck was to be broken,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+13:13">Exod. xiii. 13</A>.

 Yet we must observe, to Eli's praise, that it was the loss of the ark
 that was his death, not the slaughter of his sons. He does, in effect, 
 say, "Let me fall with the ark, for what pious Israelite can live with 
 any comfort when God's ordinances are removed?" Farewell all in this 
 world, even life itself, if the ark be gone.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child,
 <I>near</I> to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the
 ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband
 were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came
 upon her.
 &nbsp; 20 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her
 said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she
 answered not, neither did she regard <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 21 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is
 departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and
 because of her father in law and her husband.
 &nbsp; 22 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark
 of God is taken.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here another melancholy story, that carries on the desolations 
 of Eli's house, and the sorrowful feeling which the tidings of the 
 ark's captivity excited. It is concerning the wife of Phinehas, one of 
 those ungracious sons of Eli that had brought all this mischief on 
 Israel. It cost her her life, though young, as well as that of her 
 father-in-law, that was old; for many a green head, as well as many a 
 hoary head, has been brought by sorrow to the grave: it worketh death. 
 By what is here related of her it appears,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That she was a woman of a very tender spirit. Providence so ordered 
 it that, just at this time, she was near her time; and our Saviour hath 
 said, <I>Woe to those that are with child,</I> or <I>give suck,</I> in 
 such days as these, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:19">Matt. xxiv. 19</A>.

 So little joy will there then be in the birth, even of a man-child,
 that it will be said, <I>Blessed are the wombs that bear not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:29">Luke xxiii. 29</A>.

 The amazing news coming at this unhappy juncture, it put her into
 labour, as great frights or other strong passions sometimes do.  When 
 she heard of the death of her father-in-law whom she reverenced, and 
 her husband whom, bad as he was, she loved, but especially of the loss 
 of the ark, <I>she travailed, for her pains came</I> thickly <I>upon 
 her</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and the tidings so seized her spirits, at a time when they needed all
 possible supports, that, though she had strength to bear the child, 
 she, soon after, fainted and died away, being very willing to let life 
 go when she had lost the greatest comforts of her life.  Those who are 
 drawing near to that trying hour have need to treasure up for 
 themselves comforts from the covenant of grace, to balance, not only 
 the usual sorrows, but any thing extraordinary that may add to the 
 grief which they do not foresee.  Faith, at such a time, will keep from 
 fainting,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:13">Ps. xxvii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That she was a woman of a very gracious spirit though matched to a 
 wicked husband. Her concern for the death of her husband and 
 father-in-law was an evidence of her natural affection; but her much 
 greater concern for the loss of the ark was an evidence of her pious 
 and devout affection to God and sacred things. The former helped to 
 hasten her travail, but it appears by her dying words that the latter 
 lay nearer her heart 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>She said, The glory has departed from Israel,</I> not lamenting so
 much the sinking of that particular family to which she was related as 
 the general calamity of Israel in the captivity of the ark. This, this 
 was it that was her grief, that was her death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This made her regardless of her child. The women that attended her, 
 who it is likely were some of the first rank in the city, encouraged 
 her, and, thinking that he concern was mostly about the issue of her 
 pains, when the child was born, <I>said unto her, Fear not,</I> now the 
 worst is past, <I>for thou has borne a son</I> (and perhaps it was her 
 first-born), <I>but she answered not, neither did she regard it.</I> 
 The sorrows of her travail, if she had no other, would have been 
 <I>forgotten, for joy that a man-child was born into the world.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:21">John xvi. 21</A>.

 But what is that joy, 

 (1.) To one that feels herself dying? No joy but that which is
 spiritual and divine will stand us in any stead then.  Death is too 
 serious a thing to admit the relish of any earthly joy; it is all flat 
 and sapless then. 

 (2.) What is it to one that is lamenting the loss of the ark? Small
 comfort could she have of a child born in Israel, in Shiloh, when the 
 ark is lost, and is a prisoner in the land of the Philistines. What 
 pleasure can we take in our creature-comforts and enjoyments if we want 
 God's word and ordinances, especially if we want the comfort of his 
 gracious presence and the light of his countenance?  <I>As vinegar upon 
 nitre, so is he that sings songs</I> so such <I>heavy hearts.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This made her give her child a name which should perpetuate the 
 remembrance of the calamity and her sense of it. She has nothing to say 
 to the child, only it being her province, now that her husband was 
 dead, to name the child, she orders them to call it <I>I-chabod,</I> 
 that is, <I>Where is the glory?</I> Or, <I>Alas for the glory!</I> or, 
 <I>There is no glory</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 which she thus explains with her dying lips

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>The glory has departed from Israel; for the ark of God is
 taken.</I> Call the child inglorious, for so he is; the beauty of 
 Israel is lost, and there appears no hope of ever retrieving it; never 
 let the name of an Israelite, must less a priest, carry glory in it any 
 more, now that the ark is taken." Note,

 (1.) The purity and plenty of God's ordinances, and the tokens of his
 presence in them, are the glory of any people, much more so than their 
 wealth, and trade, and interest, among the nations. 

 2. Nothing is more cutting, more killing, to a faithful Israelite, than
 the want and loss of these. If God go, the glory goes, and all good 
 goes. Woe unto us if he depart!</P>
