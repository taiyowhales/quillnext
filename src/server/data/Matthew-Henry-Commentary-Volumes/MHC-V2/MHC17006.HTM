 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is a very surprising scene that opens in this chapter. Haman, when 
 he hoped to be Mordecai's judge, was made his page, to his great 
 confusion and mortification; and thus way was made for the defeat of 
 Haman's plot and the deliverance of the Jews.  

 I. The providence of God recommends Mordecai in the night to the king's
 favour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II.  Haman, who came to incense the king against him, is employed as an
 instrument of the king's favour to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:4-11">ver. 4-11</A>.

 III. From this his friends read him his doom, which is executed in the
 next chapter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.

 And now it appears that Esther's intercession for her people was
 happily adjourned, <I>De die in diem--from day to day.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to
 bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read
 before the king.
 &nbsp; 2  And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana
 and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the
 door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.
 &nbsp; 3  And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to
 Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered
 unto him, There is nothing done for him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now Satan put it into the heart of Haman to contrive Mordecai's death 
 we read in the foregoing chapter; how God put it into the heart of the 
 king to contrive Mordecai's honour we are here told. Now, if the king's 
 word will prevail above Haman's (for, though Haman be a great man, the 
 king in the throne must be above him), much more will the <I>counsel of 
 God stand,</I> whatever <I>devices there are in men's hearts.</I> It is 
 to no purpose therefore for Haman to oppose it, when both God and the 
 king will have Mordecai honoured, and in this juncture too, when his 
 preferment, and Haman's disappointment, would help to ripen the great 
 affair of the Jewish deliverance for the effort that Esther was to make 
 towards it the next day. Sometimes delay may prove to have been good 
 conduct. Stay awhile, and we may have done the sooner. <I>Cunctando 
 restituit rem--He conquered by delay.</I> Let us trace the steps which
 Providence took towards the advancement of Mordecai.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. <I>On that night could not the king sleep.</I> His <I>sleep fled 
 away</I> (so the word is); and perhaps, like a shadow, the more 
 carefully he pursued it the further it went from him. Sometimes we 
 cannot sleep because we fain would sleep. Even after a banquet of wine 
 he could not sleep when Providence had a design to serve in keeping him 
 waking. We read of no bodily indisposition he was under, that might 
 break his sleep; but God, <I>whose gift sleep is,</I> withheld it from 
 him. Those that are ever so much resolved to cast away care cannot 
 always do it; they find it in their pillows when they neither expect 
 nor welcome it. He that commanded 127 provinces could not command one 
 hour's sleep. Perhaps the charms of Esther's conversation the day 
 before gave occasion to his heart to reproach him for neglecting her, 
 and banishing her from his presence, though she was the wife of his 
 bosom, for above thirty days; and that might keep him waking. An 
 offended conscience can find a time to speak when it will be heard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. When he could not sleep he called to have the book of records, the 
 Journals of his reign, read to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Surely he did not design that that should lull him asleep; it would
 rather fill his head with cares, and drive away sleep. But God put it 
 into his heart to call for it, rather than for music or songs, which 
 the Persian kings used to be attended with

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:18">Dan. vi. 18</A>)

 and which would have been more likely to compose him to rest. When men
 do that which is unaccountable we know not what God intends by it. 
 Perhaps he would have this book of business read to him that he might 
 improve time and be forming some useful projects. Had it been king 
 David's case, he would have found some other entertainment for his 
 thoughts; when he could not sleep he would have remembered God and 
 meditated upon him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:6">Ps. lxiv. 6</A>),

 and, if he would have had any book read to him, it would have been his
 Bible; for <I>in that law did he meditate day and night.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The servant that read to him either lighted first on that article 
 which concerned Mordecai, or, reading long, came to it at length. Among 
 other things it was found written that Mordecai had discovered a plot 
 against the life of the king which prevented the execution of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Mordecai was not in such favour at court that the reader should
 designedly pitch upon that place; but Providence directed him to it; 
 nay, if we may believe the Jews' tradition (as bishop Patrick relates 
 it), opening the book at this place he turned over the leaves, and 
 would have read another part of the book, but the leaves flew back 
 again to the same place where he opened it; so that he was forced to 
 read that paragraph. How Mordecai's good service was recorded we read 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:23"><I>ch.</I> ii. 23</A>,

 and here it is found upon record.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The king enquired <I>what honour and dignity had been done to 
 Mordecai</I> for this, suspecting that this good service had gone 
 unrewarded, and, like Pharaoh's butler, remembering it as <I>his fault 
 this day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:9">Gen. xli. 9</A>.

 Note, The law of gratitude is a law of nature.  We ought particularly
 to be grateful to our inferiors, and not to think all their services 
 such debts to us but that they make us indebted to them. Two rules of 
 gratitude may be gathered from the king's enquiry here:--

 1. Better honour than nothing. If we cannot, or need not, make
 recompence to those who have been kind to us, yet let us do them honour
 by acknowledging their kindnesses and owning our obligations to them.
 
 2. Better late than never. If we have long neglected to make grateful
 returns for good offices done us, let us at length bethink ourselves of 
 our debts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The servants informed him that nothing had been done to Mordecai for 
 that eminent service; in the king's gate he sat before, and there he 
 still sat. Note, 

 1. It is common for great men to take little notice of their inferiors.
 The king knew not whether Mordecai was preferred or no till his 
 servants informed him. High spirits take a pride in being careless and 
 unconcerned about those that are below them and ignorant of their 
 state. The great God takes cognizance of the meanest of his servants, 
 knows what dignity is done them and what disgrace. 

 2.  Humility, modesty, and self-denial, though in God's account of
 great price, yet commonly hinder men's preferment in the world. 
 Mordecai rises no higher than the king's gate, while proud ambitious 
 Haman gets the king's ear and heart; but, though the aspiring rise 
 fast, the humble stand fast.  Honour makes proud men giddy, but 
 <I>upholds the humble in spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:23">Prov. xxix. 23</A>.

 3. Honour and dignity are rated high in the king's books.  He does not
 ask, What reward has been given Mordecai? what money? what estate? but 
 only, What honour?--a poor thing, and which, if he had not wherewith to 
 support it, would be but a burden. 

 4. The greatest merits and the best services are often overlooked and
 go unrewarded among men.  Little honour is done to those who best 
 deserve it, and fittest for it, and would do most good with it. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:14-16">Eccl. ix. 14-16</A>.

 The acquisition of wealth and honour is usually a perfect lottery, in
 which those that venture least commonly carry off the best prize. Nay,

 5. Good services are sometimes so far from being a man's preferment
 that they will not be his protection. Mordecai is at this time, by the 
 king's edict, doomed to destruction, with all the Jews, though it is 
 owned that he deserved dignity.  Those that faithfully serve God need 
 not fear being thus ill paid.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  And the king said, Who <I>is</I> in the court? Now Haman was come
 into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the
 king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for
 him.
 &nbsp; 5  And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth
 in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
 &nbsp; 6  So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be
 done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman
 thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour
 more than to myself?
 &nbsp; 7  And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king
 delighteth to honour,
 &nbsp; 8  Let the royal apparel be brought which the king <I>useth</I> to
 wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown
 royal which is set upon his head:
 &nbsp; 9  And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of
 one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man
 <I>withal</I> whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on
 horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before
 him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to
 honour.
 &nbsp; 10  Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, <I>and</I> take the
 apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to
 Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing
 fail of all that thou hast spoken.
 &nbsp; 11  Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed
 Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the
 city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the
 man whom the king delighteth to honour.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is now morning, and people begin to stir.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Haman is so impatient to get Mordecai hanged that he comes early to 
 court, to be ready at the king's levee, before any other business is 
 brought before him, to get a warrant for his execution 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 which he makes sure that he shall have at the first word. The king
 would gratify him in a greater thing than that; and he could tell the 
 king that he was so confident of the justice of his request, and the 
 king's favour to him in it, that he had got the gallows ready: one word 
 from the king would complete his satisfaction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The king is so impatient to have Mordecai honoured that he sends to 
 know who is in the court that is fit to be employed in it. Word is 
 brought him that Haman is in the court, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 <I>Let him come in,</I> says the king, the fittest man to be made use
 of both in directing and in dispensing the king's favour; and the king 
 knew nothing of any quarrel he had with Mordecai. Haman is brought in 
 immediately, proud of the honour done him in being admitted into the 
 king's bed-chamber, as it should seem, <I>before he was up;</I> for let 
 the king but give orders for the dignifying of Mordecai, and he will be 
 easy in his mind and try to sleep. Now Haman thinks he has the fairest 
 opportunity he can wish for to solicit against Mordecai; but the king's 
 heart is as full as his, and it is fit he should speak first.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The king asks Haman how he should express his favour to one whom 
 he had marked for a favourite: <I>What shall be done to the man whom 
 the king delights to honour?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Note, It is a good property in kings, and other superiors, to delight
 in bestowing rewards and not to delight in punishing. Parents and 
 masters should take a pleasure in commending and encouraging that which 
 is good in those under their charge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Haman concludes that he himself is the favourite intended, and 
 therefore prescribes the highest expressions of honour that could, for 
 once, be bestowed upon a subject. His proud heart presently suggested, 
 "To whom will the king delight to do honour more than to myself? No one 
 deserves it so well as I," thinks Haman, "nor stands so fair for it." 
 See how men's pride deceives them. 

 1. Haman had a better opinion of his merits than there was cause for:
 he thought none so worthy of honour as himself.  It is a foolish thing 
 for us thus to think ourselves the only deserving persons, or more 
 deserving than any other. The deceitfulness of our own hearts appears 
 in nothing so much as in the good conceit we have of ourselves and our 
 own performances, against which we should therefore constantly watch 
 and pray. 

 2. He had a better opinion of his interest than there was reason for.
 He thought the king loved and valued no one but himself, but he was 
 deceived. We should suspect that the esteem which others profess for us 
 is not so great as it seems to be or as we are sometimes willing to 
 believe it is, that we may not think too well of ourselves nor place 
 too much confidence in others.  Now Haman thinks he is carving out 
 honour for himself, and therefore does it very liberally, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 Nay, he does it presumptuously, prescribing honours too great to be
 conferred upon any subject, that he must be dressed in the royal robes, 
 wear the royal crown, and ride on the king's own horse; in short, he 
 must appear in all the pomp and grandeur of the king himself, only he 
 must not carry the sceptre, the emblem of power. He must be attended by 
 one of <I>the king's most noble princes,</I> who must be his lacquey, 
 and all the people must be made to take notice of him and do him 
 reverence; for he must ride in state through the streets, and it must 
 be <I>proclaimed before him,</I> for his honour, and the encouragement 
 of all to seek the ruler's favour, <I>Thus shall it be done to the man 
 whom the king delights to honour,</I> which had the same intention with 
 that which was proclaimed before Joseph, <I>Bow the knee;</I> for every 
 good subject will honour those whom the king delights to honour. And 
 shall not every good Christian then honour those whom the King of kings 
 delights to honour and call the <I>saints that are on the earth the 
 excellent ones?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The king confounds him with a positive order that he should 
 immediately go himself and put all this honour upon Mordecai the Jew, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 If the king had but said, as Haman expected, <I>Thou art the man,</I>
 what a fair opportunity would he have had to do the errand he came on, 
 and to desire that, to grace the solemnity of his triumphs, Mordecai, 
 his sworn enemy, might be hanged at the same time! But how is he 
 thunderstruck when the king bids him not to order all this to be done, 
 but to do it himself to Mordecai the Jew, the very man he hated above 
 all men and whose ruin he was now designing! Now, it is to no purpose 
 to think of moving any thing to the king against Mordecai when he is 
 <I>the man whom the king delights to honour.</I> Solomon says, <I>The 
 heart of the king is unsearchable</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:3">Prov. xxv. 3</A>),

 but it is not unchangeable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Haman dares not dispute nor so much as seem to dislike the king's 
 order, but, with the greatest regret and reluctance imaginable, brings 
 it to Mordecai, who I suppose did no more cringe to Haman now than he 
 had done, valuing his counterfeit respect no more than he had valued 
 his concealed malice. The apparel is brought, Mordecai is dressed up, 
 and rides in state through the city, recognized as the king's 
 favourite, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 It is hard to say which of the two put a greater force upon himself,
 proud Haman in putting this honour upon Mordecai, or humble Mordecai in 
 accepting it: the king would have it so, and both must submit. Upon 
 <I>this</I> account it was agreeable to Mordecai as it was an 
 indication of the king's favour, and gave hope that Esther would 
 prevail for the reversing of the edict against the Jews.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted
 to his house mourning, and having his head covered.
 &nbsp; 13  And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every
 <I>thing</I> that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh
 his wife unto him, If Mordecai <I>be</I> of the seed of the Jews,
 before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail
 against him, but shalt surely fall before him.
 &nbsp; 14  And while they <I>were</I> yet talking with him, came the king's
 chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that
 Esther had prepared.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How little Mordecai was puffed up with his advancement. He <I>came
 again to the king's gate</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 he returned to his place and the duty of it immediately, and minded his
 business as closely as he had done before. Honour is well bestowed on 
 those that are not made proud and idle by it, and will not think 
 themselves above their business.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How much Haman was cast down with his disappointment. He could not
 bear it. To wait upon any man, especially Mordecai, and at this time, 
 when he hoped to have seen him hanged, was enough to break such a proud 
 heart as he had. He <I>hasted to his house mourning, and having his 
 head covered,</I> as one that looked upon himself as sunk and in a 
 manner condemned. What harm had it done him to stoop thus to Mordecai? 
 Was he ever the worse for it? Was it not what he himself proposed to be 
 done by <I>one of the king's most noble princes?</I> Why then should he 
 grudge to do it himself? But that will break a proud man's heart which 
 would not break a humble man's sleep.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How his doom was, out of this event, read to him by his wife and 
 his friends: "If Mordecai be, as they say he is, <I>of the seed of the 
 Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall,</I> though but in a point of 
 honour, never expect to <I>prevail against him;</I> for thou <I>shalt 
 surely fall before him,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Miserable comforters were they all; they did not advise him to repent,
 and ask Mordecai's pardon for his bad design against him, but foretold 
 his destiny as fatal and unavoidable. Two things they foresaw:--

 1. That Haman would be disappointed in his enterprise against the Jews: 
 "<I>Thou shalt not prevail</I> to root out that people. Heaven plainly 
 fights against thee." 

 2. That he himself would be destroyed: <I>Thou shalt surely fall before
 him.</I> The contest between Michael and the dragon will not be a drawn 
 battle; no, Haman must fall before Mordecai.  Two things they grounded 
 their prognostications upon:--

 (1.) This Mordecai was <I>of the seed of the Jews; feeble Jews</I>
 their enemies sometimes called them, but formidable Jews they sometimes 
 found them. They are a holy seed, a praying seed, in covenant with God, 
 and a seed that the Lord hath all along blessed, and therefore let not 
 their enemies expect to triumph over them.

 (2.) Haman had begun to fall, and therefore he was certainly a gone
 man. It has been observed of great court-favourites that when once they 
 have been frowned upon they have fallen utterly, as fast as they rose; 
 it is true of the church's enemies that when God begins with them he 
 will make an end. As for God his work is perfect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How seasonably he was now sent for to the banquet that Esther had 
 prepared, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He thought it seasonable, in hopes it would revive his drooping spirits
 and save his sinking honour. But really it was seasonable because, his 
 spirits being broken by this sore disappointment, he might the more 
 easily be run down by Esther's complaint against him. The wisdom of God 
 is seen in timing the means of his church's deliverance so as to 
 manifest his own glory.</P>
