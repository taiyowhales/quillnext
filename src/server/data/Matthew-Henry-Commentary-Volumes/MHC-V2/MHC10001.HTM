 In the close of the foregoing book (with which this is connected as a
 continuation of the same history) we had Saul's exit; he went down
 slain to the pit, though we was the terror of the mighty in the land of
 the living. We are now to look towards the rising sun, and to enquire
 where David is, and what he is doing. In this chapter we have, 

 I. Tidings brought him to Ziklag of the death of Saul and Jonathan, by
 an Amalekite, who undertook to give him a particular narrative of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>.
 
 II. David's sorrowful reception of these tidings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.
 
 III. Justice done upon the messenger, who boasted that he had helped
 Saul to dispatch himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>.

 IV. An elegy which David penned upon this occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:17-27">ver. 17-27</A>.

 And in all this David's breast appears very happily free from the
 sparks both of revenge and ambition, and he observes a very suitable
 demeanour.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was
 returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had
 abode two days in Ziklag;
 &nbsp; 2 It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man
 came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth
 upon his head: and <I>so</I> it was, when he came to David, that he
 fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
 &nbsp; 3 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said
 unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
 &nbsp; 4 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee,
 tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the
 battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul
 and Jonathan his son are dead also.
 &nbsp; 5 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest
 thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
 &nbsp; 6 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance
 upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo,
 the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
 &nbsp; 7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.
 And I answered, Here <I>am</I> I.
 &nbsp; 8 And he said unto me, Who <I>art</I> thou? And I answered him, I
 <I>am</I> an Amalekite.
 &nbsp; 9 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay
 me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life <I>is</I> yet whole
 in me.
 &nbsp; 10 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that
 he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown
 that <I>was</I> upon his head, and the bracelet that <I>was</I> on his arm,
 and have brought them hither unto my lord.

 Here is, 

 I. David settling again in Ziklag, his own city, after he had rescued 
 his family and friends out of the hands of the Amalekites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 He <I>abode in Ziklag.</I> Thence he was now sending presents to his
 friends

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+30:26">1 Sam. xxx. 26</A>),

 and there he was ready to receive those that came into his interests;
 not men in distress and debt, as his first followers were, but persons 
 of quality in their country, <I>mighty men, men of war,</I> and 
 <I>captains of thousands</I> (as we find,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:1,8,20">1 Chron. xii. 1, 8, 20</A>);

 such came day by day to him, God stirring up their hearts to do so,
 till he had a <I>great host, like the host of God,</I> as it is said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:22">1 Chron. xii. 22</A>.

 The secret springs of revolutions are unaccountable, and must be
 resolved into that Providence which turns all hearts as the rivers of 
 water.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Intelligence brought him thither of the death of Saul. It was 
 strange that he did not leave some spies about the camp, to bring him 
 early notice of the issue of the engagement, a sign that he desired not 
 Saul's woeful day, nor was impatient to come to the throne, but willing 
 to wait till those tidings were brought to him which many a one would 
 have sent more than half-way to meet. He that believes does not make 
 haste, takes good news when it comes and is not uneasy while it is in 
 the coming. 

 1. The messenger presents himself to David as an express, in the
 posture of a mourner for the deceased prince and a subject to the 
 succeeding one. He came with his clothes rent, and made obeisance to 
 David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 pleasing himself with the fancy that he had the honour to be the first
 that did him homage as his sovereign, but it proved he was the first 
 that received from him sentence of death as his judge. He told David he 
 came from the camp of Israel, and intimated the bad posture it was in 
 when he said he had escaped out of it, having much ado to get away with 
 his life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 2. He gives him a general account of the issue of the battle. David was
 very desirous to know how the matter went, as one that had more reason 
 than any to be concerned for the public; and he told him very 
 distinctly that the army of Israel was routed, many slain, and, among 
 the rest, Saul and Jonathan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He named only Saul and Jonathan, because he knew David would be most
 solicitous to know their fate; for Saul was the man whom he most feared 
 and Jonathan the man whom he most loved.

 3. He gives him a more particular account of the death of Saul. It is
 probable that David had heard, by the report of others, what the issue 
 of the war was, for multitudes resorted to him, it should seem, in 
 consequence; but he was desirous to know the certainty of the report 
 concerning Saul and Jonathan, either because he was not forward to 
 believe it or because he would not proceed upon it to make his own 
 claims till he was fully assured of it. He therefore asks, <I>How 
 knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan are dead?</I> in answer to which 
 the young man tells him a very ready story, putting it past doubt that 
 Saul was dead, for he himself had been not only an eye-witness of his 
 death, but an instrument of it, and therefore David might rely upon his 
 testimony. He says nothing, in his narrative, of the death of Jonathan, 
 knowing how ungrateful that would be to David, but accounts only for 
 Saul, thinking (as David understood it well enough,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+4:10"><I>ch.</I> iv. 10</A>)

 that he should be welcome for that, and rewarded as one that brought
 good tidings. The account he gives of this matter is, 

 (1.) Very particular. That he happened to go to the place where Saul
 was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)
 
 as a passenger, not as a soldier, and therefore an indifferent person,
 that he found Saul endeavouring to run himself through with his own 
 spear, none of his attendants being willing to do it for him; and, it 
 seems, he could not do it dexterously for himself: his hand and heart 
 failed him. The miserable man had not courage enough either to live or 
 die; he therefore called this stranger to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 enquired what countryman he was, for, provided he was not a Philistine,
 he would gladly receive from his hand the <I>coup de grace</I> (as the 
 French call it concerning those that are broken on the wheel)--<I>the 
 merciful stroke,</I> that might dispatch him out of his pain. 
 Understanding that he was an Amalekite (neither one of his subjects nor 
 one of his enemies), he begs this favour from him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Stand upon me, and slay me.</I> He is now sick of his dignity and
 willing to be trampled upon, sick of his life and willing to be slain. 
 Who then would be inordinately fond of life or honour? The case may he 
 such, even with those that have no hope in their death, that yet they 
 may <I>desire to die, and death flee from them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+9:6">Rev. ix. 6</A>.
 
 <I>Anguish has come upon me;</I> so we read it, as a complaint of the
 pain and terror his spirit was seized with. If his conscience now 
 brought to mind the javelin he had cast at David, his pride, malice, 
 and perfidiousness, and especially the murder of the priests, no marvel 
 that anguish came upon him: moles (they say) open their eyes when they 
 are dying. Sense of unpardoned guilt will make death indeed the king of 
 terrors. Those that have baffled their convictions will perhaps, in 
 their dying moments, be overpowered by them. The margin reads it as a 
 complaint of the inconvenience of his clothes; that his coat of mail 
 which he had for defence, or his embroidered coat which he had for 
 ornament, hindered him, that he could not get the spear far enough into 
 his body, or so straitened him, now that his body swelled with anguish, 
 that he could not expire. Let no man's clothes be his pride, for it may 
 so happen that they may be his burden and snare. "Hereupon," saith our 
 young man, "<I>I stood upon him, and slew him</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 at which word, perhaps, he observed David look upon him with some show
 of displeasure, and therefore he excuses himself in the next words: 
 "<I>For I was sure he could not live;</I> his life was whole in him 
 indeed, but he would certainly have fallen into the hands of the 
 Philistines or given himself another thrust."

 (2.) It is doubtful whether this story be true. If it be, the
 righteousness of God is to be observed, that Saul, who spared the 
 Amalekites in contempt of the divine command, received his death's 
 wound from an Amalekite. But most interpreters think that it was false, 
 and that, though he might happen to be present, yet he was not 
 assisting in the death of Saul, but told David so in expectation that 
 he would reward him for it, as having done him a piece of good service. 
 Those who would rejoice at the fall of an enemy are apt to measure 
 others by themselves, and to think that they will do so too. But a man 
 after God's own heart is not to be judged of by common men. I am not 
 clear whether this young man's story was true or no: it may consist 
 with the narrative in the chapter before, and be an addition to it, as 
 Peter's account of the death of Judas

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:18">Acts i. 18</A>)

 is to the narrative,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:5">Matt. xxvii. 5</A>.

 What is there called <I>a sword</I> may here be called <I>a spear,</I>
 or when he fell upon his sword he leaned on his spear. 

 (3.) However he produced that which was proof sufficient of the death
 of Saul, the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on 
 his arm. It should seem Saul was so foolishly fond of these as to wear 
 them in the field of battle, which made him a fair mark for the 
 archers, by distinguishing him from those about him; but as 
 <I>pride</I> (we say) <I>feels no cold,</I> so it fears no danger, from 
 that which gratifies it. These fell into the hands of this Amalekite.
 Saul spared the best of their spoil, and now the best of his came to 
 one of that devoted nation. He brought them to David, as the rightful 
 owner of them now that Saul was dead, not doubting but by his 
 officiousness herein to recommend himself to the best preferments in 
 his court or camp. The tradition of the Jews is that this Amalekite was 
 the son of Doeg (for the Amalekites were descendants from Edom), and 
 that Doeg, who they suppose was Saul's armour-bearer, before he slew 
 himself gave Saul's crown and bracelet (the ensigns of his royalty) to 
 his son, and bade him carry them to David, to curry favour with him.
 But this is a groundless conceit. Doeg's son, it is likely, was so well 
 known to Saul that he needed not ask him as he did this Amalekite

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 <I>Who art thou?</I> David had been long waiting for the crown, and now
 it was brought to him by an Amalekite. See how God can serve his own 
 purposes of kindness to his people, even by designing (ill-designing) 
 men, who aim at nothing but to set up themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and
 likewise all the men that <I>were</I> with him:
 &nbsp; 12 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,
 and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and for
 the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
 &nbsp; 13 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence
 <I>art</I> thou? And he answered, I <I>am</I> the son of a stranger, an
 Amalekite.
 &nbsp; 14 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
 forth thine hand to destroy the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s anointed?
 &nbsp; 15 And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near,
 <I>and</I> fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
 &nbsp; 16 And David said unto him, Thy blood <I>be</I> upon thy head; for
 thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s anointed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. David's reception of these tidings. So far was he from falling into 
 a transport of joy, as the Amalekite expected, that he fell into a 
 passion of weeping, <I>rent his clothes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 <I>mourned and fasted</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 not only for his people Israel and Jonathan his friend but for Saul his
 enemy. This he did, not only as a man of honour, in observance of that 
 decorum which forbids us to insult over those that are fallen, and 
 requires us to attend our relations to the grave with respect, whatever 
 we lost by their life or got by their death, but as a good man and a 
 man of conscience, that had forgiven the injuries Saul had done him and 
 bore him no malice. He knew it, before his son wrote it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:17,18">Prov. xxiv. 17, 18</A>),

 that if we <I>rejoice when our enemy falls the Lord sees it, and it
 displeases him;</I> and that <I>he who is glad at calamities shall not 
 go unpunished,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:5">Prov. xvii. 5</A>.

 By this it appears that those passages in David's psalms which express
 his desire of, and triumph in, the ruin of his enemies, proceeded not 
 from a spirit of revenge, nor any irregular passion, but from a holy 
 zeal for the glory of God and the public good; for by what he did here, 
 when he heard of Saul's death, we may perceive that his natural temper 
 was very tender, and that he was kindly affected even to those that 
 hated him. He was very sincere, no question, in his mourning for Saul, 
 and it was not pretended, or a copy of his countenance only. His 
 passion was so strong, on this occasion, that it moved those about him; 
 <I>all that were with him,</I> at least in complaisance to him, <I>rent 
 their clothes,</I> and they <I>fasted till even,</I> in token of their 
 sorrow; and probably it was a religious fast: they humbled themselves 
 under the hand of God, and prayed for the repairing of the breaches 
 made upon Israel by this defeat.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reward he gave to him that brought him the tidings. Instead of 
 preferring him, he put him to death, judged him out of his own mouth, 
 as a murderer of his prince, and ordered him to be forthwith executed 
 for the same. What a surprise was this to the messenger, who thought he 
 should have favour shown him for his pains. In vain did he plead that 
 he had Saul's order for it, that it was a real kindness to him, that he 
 must inevitably have died; all those pleas are overruled: "<I>Thy mouth 
 has testified against thee, saying, I have slain the Lord's 
 anointed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 
 therefore thou must die." Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. David herein did not do unjustly. For, 

 (1.) The man was an Amalekite. This, lest he should have mistaken it in
 his narrative, he made him own a second time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 That nation, and all that belonged to it, were doomed to destruction,
 so that, in slaying him, David did what his predecessor should have 
 done and was rejected for not doing.

 (2.) He did himself confess the crime, so that the evidence was, by the
 consent of all laws, sufficient to convict him; for every man is 
 presumed to make the best of himself. If he did as he said, he deserved 
 to die for treason 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 doing that which, it is probable, he heard Saul's own armour-bearer
 refuse to do; if not, yet by boasting that he had done it he plainly 
 showed that if there had been occasion he would have done it, and would 
 have made nothing of it; and, by boasting of it to David, he showed 
 what opinion he had of him, that he would rejoice in it, as one 
 altogether like himself, which was an intolerable affront to him who 
 had himself once and again refused to <I>stretch forth his hand against 
 the Lord's anointed.</I> And his lying to David, if indeed it was a 
 lie, was highly criminal, and proved, as sooner or later that sin will 
 prove, lying against his own head.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He did honourably and well. Hereby he demonstrated the sincerity of 
 his grief, discouraged all others from thinking by doing the like to 
 ingratiate themselves with him, and did that which might probably 
 oblige the house of Saul and win upon them, and recommend him to the 
 people as one that was zealous for public justice, without regard to 
 his own private interest. We may learn from it that to give assistance 
 to any in murdering themselves, directly or indirectly, if done 
 wittingly, incurs the guilt of blood, and that the lives of princes 
 ought to be, in a special manner, precious to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
 Jonathan his son:
 &nbsp; 18 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah <I>the use of</I>
 the bow: behold, <I>it is</I> written in the book of Jasher.)
 &nbsp; 19 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are
 the mighty fallen!
 &nbsp; 20 Tell <I>it</I> not in Gath, publish <I>it</I> not in the streets of
 Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the
 daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
 &nbsp; 21 Ye mountains of Gilboa, <I>let there be</I> no dew, neither <I>let
 there be</I> rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the
 shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, <I>as
 though he had</I> not <I>been</I> anointed with oil.
 &nbsp; 22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the
 bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned
 not empty.
 &nbsp; 23 Saul and Jonathan <I>were</I> lovely and pleasant in their lives,
 and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than
 eagles, they were stronger than lions.
 &nbsp; 24 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
 scarlet, with <I>other</I> delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon
 your apparel.
 &nbsp; 25 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O
 Jonathan, <I>thou wast</I> slain in thine high places.
 &nbsp; 26 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant
 hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the
 love of women.
 &nbsp; 27 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When David had rent his clothes, mourned, and wept, and fasted, for the 
 death of Saul, and done justice upon him who made himself guilty of it, 
 one would think he had made full payment of the debt of honour he owed 
 to his memory; yet this is not all: we have here a poem he wrote on 
 that occasion; for he was a great master of his pen as well as of his 
 sword. By this elegy he designed both to express his own sorrow for 
 this great calamity and to impress the like on the minds of others, who 
 ought to lay it to heart. The putting of lamentations into poems made 
 them, 

 1. The more moving and affecting. The passion of the poet, or singer,
 is, by this way, wonderfully communicated to the readers and hearers.
 
 2. The more lasting. Thus they were made, not only to spread far, but
 to continue long, from generation to generation. Those might gain 
 information by poems that would not read history. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The orders David gave with this elegy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>He bade them teach the children of Judah</I> (his own tribe,
 whatever others did) <I>the use of the bow,</I> either. 

 1. The bow used in war. Not but that the children of Judah knew how to
 use the bow (it was so commonly used in war, long before this, that the 
 sword and bow were put for all weapons of war,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:22">Gen. xlviii. 22</A>),

 but perhaps they had of late made more use of slings, as David in
 killing Goliath, because cheaper, and David would have them now to see 
 the inconvenience of these (for it was the archers of the Philistines 
 that bore so hard upon Saul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:3">1 Sam. xxi. 3</A>),

 and to return more generally to the use of the bow, to exercise
 themselves in this weapon, that they might be in a capacity to avenge 
 the death of their prince upon the Philistines, and to outdo them at 
 their own weapon. It was a pity but those that had such good heads and 
 hearts as the children of Judah should be well armed. David hereby 
 showed his authority over and concern for the armies of Israel, and set 
 himself to rectify the errors of the former reign. But we find that the 
 companies which had now come to David to Ziklag were armed with bows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:2">1 Chron. xii. 2</A>);

 therefore, 

 2. Some understand it either of some musical instrument called <I>a
 bow</I> (to which he would have the mournful ditties sung) or of the 
 elegy itself: <I>He bade them teach the children of Judah Kesheth, the 
 bow,</I> that is, this song, which was so entitled for the sake of 
 Jonathan's bow, the achievements of which are here celebrated. Moses
 commanded Israel to learn his song

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:19">Deut. xxxi. 19</A>),

 so David his. Probably he bade the Levites teach them. It is
 <I>written in the book of Jasher,</I> there it was kept upon record, 
 and thence transcribed into this history. That book was probably a 
 collection of state-poems; what is said to be written in that book

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:13">Josh. x. 13</A>)

 is also poetical, a fragment of an historical poem. Even songs would be
 forgotten and lost if they were not committed to writing, that best 
 conservatory of knowledge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The elegy itself. It is not a divine hymn, nor given by inspiration 
 of God to be used in divine service, nor is there any mention of God in 
 it; but it is a human composition, and therefore was inserted, not in 
 the book of Psalms (which, being of divine original, is preserved), but 
 in the book of Jasher, which, being only a collection of common poems, 
 is long since lost. This elegy proves David to have been,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A man of an excellent spirit, in four things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He was very generous to Saul, his sworn enemy. Saul was his 
 father-in-law, his sovereign, and the anointed of the Lord; and 
 therefore, though he had done him a great deal of wrong, David does not 
 wreak his revenge upon his memory when he is in his grave; but like a 
 good man, and a man of honour, 

 [1.] He conceals his faults; and, though there was no preventing their
 appearance in his history, yet they should not appear in this elegy. 
 Charity teaches us to make the best we can of every body and to say 
 nothing of those of whom we can say no good, especially when they are 
 gone. <I>De mortuis nil nisi bonum</I>--<I>Say nothing but good 
 concerning the dead.</I> We ought to deny ourselves the satisfaction of 
 making personal reflections upon those who have been injurious to us, 
 much more drawing their character thence, as if every man must of 
 necessity be a bad man that has done ill by us. Let the corrupt part of 
 the memory be buried with the corrupt part of the man--earth to earth, 
 ashes to ashes; let the blemish be hidden and a veil drawn over the 
 deformity. 

 [2.] He celebrates that which was praiseworthy in him. He does not
 commend him for that which he was not, says nothing of his piety or 
 fidelity. Those funeral commendations which are gathered out of the 
 spoils of truth are not at all to the praise of those on whom they are 
 bestowed, but very much the dispraise of those who unjustly misplace 
 them. But he has this to say in honour of Saul himself, <I>First,</I> 
 That he was <I>anointed with oil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 the sacred oil, which signified his elevation to, and qualification
 for, the government. Whatever he was otherwise, the <I>crown of the 
 anointing oil of his God was upon him,</I> as is said of the high 
 priest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+21:12">Lev. xxi. 12</A>),

 and on that account he was to be honoured, because God, the fountain of
 honour, had honoured him. <I>Secondly,</I> That he was a man of war, a
 <I>mighty man</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:19-21"><I>v.</I> 19-21</A>),

 that he had often been victorious over the enemies of Israel and
 <I>vexed them whithersoever he turned,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:47">1 Sam. xiv. 47</A>.

 His <I>sword returned not empty,</I> but satiated with blood and spoil,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 His disgrace and fall at last must not make his former successes and
 services to be forgotten. Though his sun set under a cloud, time was 
 when it shone brightly. <I>Thirdly,</I> That take him with Jonathan he
 was a man of a very agreeable temper, that recommended himself to the 
 affections of his subjects

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant.</I> Jonathan was always
 so, and Saul was so as long as he concurred with him. Take them 
 together, and in the pursuit of the enemy, never were men more bold, 
 more brave; they were <I>swifter than eagles and stronger than 
 lions.</I> Observe, Those that were most fierce and fiery in the camp 
 were no less sweet and lovely in the court, as amiable to the subject 
 as they were formidable to the foe; a rare combination of softness and 
 sharpness they had, which makes any man's temper very happy. It may be 
 understood of the harmony and affection that for the most part 
 subsisted between Saul and Jonathan: they were lovely and pleasant one 
 to another, Jonathan a dutiful son, Saul an affectionate father; and 
 therefore dear to each other in their lives, and <I>in their death they 
 were not divided,</I> but kept close together in the stand they made 
 against the Philistines, and fell together in the same cause. 
 <I>Fourthly,</I> That he had enriched his country with the spoils of 
 conquered nations, and introduced a more splendid attire. When they had 
 a king like the nations, they must have clothes like the nations; and 
 herein he was, in a particular manner, obliging to his female subjects, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 The <I>daughters of Israel</I> he <I>clothed in scarlet,</I> which was
 their delight.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He was very grateful to Jonathan, his sworn friend. Besides the 
 tears he shed over him, and the encomiums he gives of him in common 
 with Saul, he mentions him with some marks of distinction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>O Jonathan! thou wast slain in thy high places!</I> which (compared
 with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 intimates that he meant him by <I>the beauty of Israel,</I> which, he
 there says, was slain upon the high places. He laments Jonathan as his 
 particular friend

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>My brother, Jonathan;</I> not so much because of what he would have
 been to him if he had lived, very serviceable no doubt in his 
 advancement to the throne and instrumental to prevent those long 
 struggles which, for want of his assistance, he had with the house of 
 Saul (had this been the only ground of his grief it would have been 
 selfish), but he lamented him for what he had been: "<I>Very pleasant 
 hast thou been unto me;</I> but that pleasantness is now over, and <I>I 
 am distressed for thee.</I>" He had reason to say that Jonathan's love 
 to him was wonderful; surely never was the like, for a man to love one 
 who he knew was to take the crown over his head, and to be so faithful 
 to his rival: this far surpassed the highest degree of conjugal 
 affection and constancy. See here, 

 [1.] That nothing is more delightful in this world than a true friend,
 that is wise and good, that kindly receives and returns our affection, 
 and is faithful to us in all our true interests. 

 [2.] That nothing is more distressful than the loss of such a friend;
 it is parting with a piece of one's self. It is the vanity of this 
 world that what is most pleasant to us we are most liable to be 
 distressed in. The more we love the more we grieve.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He was deeply concerned for the honour of God; for this is what he 
 has an eye to when he fears lest <I>the daughters of the 
 uncircumcised,</I> that are out of covenant with God, should triumph 
 over Israel, and the God of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Good men are touched in a very sensible part by the reproaches of those
 that reproach God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He was deeply concerned for the public welfare. It was the beauty 
 of Israel that was slain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 and the honour of the public that was disgraced: The <I>mighty have
 fallen</I> (this is three times lamented,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:19,25,27"><I>v.</I> 19, 25, 27</A>),

 and so the strength of the people is weakened. Public losses are most
 laid to heart by men of public spirit. David hoped God would make him 
 instrumental to repair those losses and yet laments them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A man of a fine imagination, as well as a wise and holy man. The 
 expressions are all excellent, and calculated to work upon the 
 passions. 
 
 (1.) The embargo he would fain lay upon Fame is elegant
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Tell it not in Gath.</I> It grieved him to the heart to think that
 it would be proclaimed in the cities of the Philistines, and that they 
 would insult over Israel upon it, and the more in remembrance of the 
 triumphs of Israel over them formerly, when they sang, <I>Saul has 
 slain his thousands;</I> for this would now be retorted.

 (2.) The curse he entails on the mountains of Gilboa, the theatre on
 which this tragedy was acted: <I>Let there be no dew upon you, nor 
 fields of offerings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 This is a poetical strain, like that of Job, <I>Let the day perish
 wherein I was born.</I> Not as if David wished that any part of the 
 land of Israel might be barren, but, to express his sorrow for the 
 thing, he speaks with a seeming indignation at the place. Observe,

 [1.] How the fruitfulness of the earth depends upon heaven. The worst
 thing he could wish to the mountains of Gilboa was barrenness and 
 unprofitableness to man: those are miserable that are useless. It was 
 the curse Christ pronounced on the fig-tree, <I>Never fruit grow on 
 thee more,</I> and that took effect--the fig-tree withered away: this, 
 on the mountains of Gilboa, did not. But, when he wished them barren, 
 he wished there might be no rain upon them; and, if the heavens be 
 brass, the earth will soon be iron. 

 [2.] How the fruitfulness of the earth must therefore be devoted to
 heaven, which is intimated in his calling the fruitful fields <I>fields 
 of offerings.</I> Those fruits of their land that were offered to God 
 were the crown and glory of it: and therefore the failure of the 
 offerings is the saddest consequent of the failure of the corn. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:9">Joel i. 9</A>.

 To want that wherewith we should honour God is worse than to want that
 wherewith we should sustain ourselves. This is the reproach David 
 fastens upon the mountains of Gilboa, which, having been stained with 
 royal blood, thereby forfeited celestial dews. In this elegy Saul had a 
 more honourable interment than that which the men of Jabesh-Gilead gave 
 him.</P>
