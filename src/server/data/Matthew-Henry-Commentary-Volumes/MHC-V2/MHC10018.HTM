 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And David numbered the people that <I>were</I> with him, and set
 captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
 &nbsp; 2 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the
 hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son
 of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of
 Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will
 surely go forth with you myself also.
 &nbsp; 3 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we
 flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die,
 will they care for us: but now <I>thou art</I> worth ten thousand of
 us: therefore now <I>it is</I> better that thou succour us out of the
 city.
 &nbsp; 4 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.
 And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out
 by hundreds and by thousands.
 &nbsp; 5 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying,
 <I>Deal</I> gently for my sake with the young man, <I>even</I> with
 Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the
 captains charge concerning Absalom.
 &nbsp; 6 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the
 battle was in the wood of Ephraim;
 &nbsp; 7 Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of
 David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty
 thousand <I>men.</I>
 &nbsp; 8 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the
 country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the
 sword devoured.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Which way David raised an army here, and what reinforcements were sent 
 him, we are not told; many, it is likely, from all the coasts of 
 Israel, at least from the neighbouring tribes, came in to his 
 assistance, so that, by degrees, he was able to make head against 
 Absalom, as Ahithophel foresaw. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His army numbered and marshalled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 He had, no doubt, committed his cause to God by prayer, for that was
 his relief in all his afflictions; and then he took an account of his 
 forces. Josephus says they were, in all, but about 4000. These he 
 divided into regiments and companies, to each of which he appointed 
 proper officers, and then disposed them, as is usual, into the right 
 wing, the left wing, and the centre, two of which he committed to his 
 two old experienced generals, Joab and Abishai, and the third to his 
 new friend Ittai. Good order and good conduct may sometimes be as 
 serviceable in an army as great numbers. Wisdom teaches us to make the 
 best of the strength we have, and let it reach to the utmost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Himself over-persuaded not to go in person to the battle. He was 
 Absalom's false friend that persuaded him to go, and served his pride 
 more than his prudence; David's true friends would not let him go, 
 remembering what they had been told of Ahithophel's design to <I>smite 
 the king only.</I> David showed his affection to them by being willing 
 to venture with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and they showed theirs to him by opposing it. We must never reckon it
 an affront to be gain-said for our good, and by those that therein 
 consult our interest. 

 1. They would by no means have him to expose himself, for (say they) 
 <I>thou art worth</I> 10,000 <I>of us.</I> Thus ought princes to be 
 valued by their subjects, who, for their safety, must be willing to 
 expose themselves.  

 2. They would not so far gratify the enemy, who would rejoice more in
 his fall than in the defeat of the whole army. 

 3.  He might be more serviceable to them by tarrying in the city, with
 a reserve of his forces there, whence he might send them recruits.  
 That may be a post of real service which yet is not a post of danger. 
 The king acquiesced in their reasons, and changed his purpose

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>What seemeth to you best I will do.</I> It is no piece of wisdom to
 be stiff in our resolutions, but to be willing to hear reason, even 
 from our inferiors, and to be overruled by their advice when it appears 
 to be for our own good.  Whether the people's prudence had an eye to it 
 or no, God's providence wisely ordered it, that David should not be in 
 the field of battle; for then his tenderness would certainly have 
 interposed to save the life of Absalom, whom God had determined to 
 destroy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The charge he gave concerning Absalom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 When the army was drawn out, rank and file, Josephus says, he
 encouraged them, and prayed for them, but withal bade them all take 
 heed of doing Absalom any hurt.  How does he render good for evil!  
 Absalom would have David only smitten. David would have Absalom only 
 spared. What foils are these to each other! Never was unnatural hatred 
 to a father more strong than in Absalom; nor was ever natural affection 
 to a child more strong than in David. Each did his utmost, and showed 
 what man is capable of doing, how bad it is possible for a child to be 
 to the best of fathers and how good it is possible for a father to be 
 to the worst of children; as if it were designed to be a resemblance of 
 man's wickedness towards God and God's mercy towards man, of which it 
 is hard to say which is more amazing. "<I>Deal gently,</I>" says David, 
 "by all means, <I>with the young man, even with Absalom, for my 
 sake;</I> he is a young man, rash and heady, and his age must excuse 
 him; he is mine, whom I love; if you love me, be not severe with him." 
 This charge supposes David's strong expectation of success. Having a 
 good cause and a good God, he doubts not but Absalom would lie at their 
 mercy, and therefore bids them deal gently with him, spare his life and 
 reserve him for his judgment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Bishop Hall thus descants on this: "What means this ill-placed love? 
 This unjust mercy? Deal gently with a traitor? Of all traitors, with a 
 son? Of all sons, with an Absalom? That graceless darling of so good a 
 father? And all this, for thy sake, whose crown, whose blood, he hunts 
 after? For whose sake must he be pursued, if forborne for thine? Must 
 the cause of the quarrel be the motive of mercy? Even in the holiest 
 parents, nature may be guilty of an injurious tenderness, of a bloody 
 indulgence. But was not this done in type of that immeasurable mercy of 
 the true King and Redeemer of Israel, who prayed for his persecutors, 
 for his murderers, <I>Father, forgive them? Deal gently with them for 
 my sake.</I>" When God sends and affliction to correct his children, it 
 is with this charge, "Deal gently with them for my sake;" for he knows 
 our frame.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A complete victory gained over Absalom's forces. The battle was 
 fought <I>in the wood of Ephraim</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 so called from some memorable action of the Ephraimites there, though
 it lay in the tribe of Gad. David thought fit to meet the enemy with 
 his forces at some distance, before they came up to Mahanaim, lest he 
 should bring that city into trouble which had so kindly sheltered him. 
 The cause shall be decided by a pitched battle. Josephus represents the 
 fight as very obstinate, but the rebels were at length totally routed 
 and 20,000 of them slain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Now they smarted justly for their treason against their lawful prince,
 their uneasiness under so good a government, and their base ingratitude 
 to so good a governor; and they found what it was to take up arms for a 
 usurper, who with his kisses and caresses had wheedled them into their 
 own ruin. Now where are the rewards, the preferments, the golden days, 
 they promised themselves from him? Now they see what it is to take 
 counsel <I>against the Lord and his anointed,</I> and to think of 
 <I>breaking his bands asunder.</I> And that they might see that God 
 fought against them,

 1.  They are conquered by a few, an army, in all probability, much 
 inferior to theirs in number. 

 2. By that flight with which they hoped to save themselves they
 destroyed themselves. <I>The wood,</I> which they sought to for 
 shelter, <I>devoured more than the sword,</I> that they might see how, 
 when they thought themselves safe from David's men, and said, <I>Surely 
 the bitterness of death is past,</I> yet the justice of God pursued 
 them and suffered them not to live. What refuge can rebels find from 
 divine vengeance? The pits and bogs, the stumps and thickets, and, as 
 the Chaldee paraphrase understands it, the wild beasts of the wood, 
 were probably the death of multitudes of the dispersed distracted 
 Israelites, besides the 20,000 that were slain with the sword. God 
 herein fought for David, and yet fought against him; for all these that 
 were slain were his own subjects, and the common interest of his 
 kingdom was weakened by the slaughter. The Romans allowed no triumph 
 for a victory in a civil war.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon
 a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak,
 and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between
 the heaven and the earth; and the mule that <I>was</I> under him went
 away.
 &nbsp; 10 And a certain man saw <I>it,</I> and told Joab, and said, Behold,
 I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.
 &nbsp; 11 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou
 sawest <I>him,</I> and why didst thou not smite him there to the
 ground? and I would have given thee ten <I>shekels</I> of silver, and
 a girdle.
 &nbsp; 12 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a
 thousand <I>shekels</I> of silver in mine hand, <I>yet</I> would I not put
 forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the
 king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none
 <I>touch</I> the young man Absalom.
 &nbsp; 13 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own
 life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself
 wouldest have set thyself against <I>me.</I>
 &nbsp; 14 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took
 three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of
 Absalom, while he <I>was</I> yet alive in the midst of the oak.
 &nbsp; 15 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about
 and smote Absalom, and slew him.
 &nbsp; 16 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from
 pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.
 &nbsp; 17 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the
 wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all
 Israel fled every one to his tent.
 &nbsp; 18 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for
 himself a pillar, which <I>is</I> in the king's dale: for he said, I
 have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the
 pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day,
 Absalom's place.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is Absalom quite at a loss, at his wit's end first, and then at 
 his life's end. He that began the fight, big with the expectation of 
 triumphing over David himself, with whom, if he had had him in his 
 power, he would not have dealt gently, is now in the greatest 
 consternation, when he <I>meets the servants of David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Though they were forbidden to meddle with him, he durst not look them
 in the face; but, finding they were near him, he clapped spurs to his 
 mule and made the best of his way, through thick and thin, and so rode 
 headlong upon his own destruction. Thus <I>he that fleeth from the fear 
 shall fall into the pit, and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be 
 taken in the snare,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:44">Jer. xlviii. 44</A>.

 David is inclined to spare him, but divine justice passes sentence upon
 him as a traitor, and sees it executed--that he hang by the neck, be
 caught alive, be embowelled, and his body dispose of disgracefully.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He is hanged by the neck. Riding furiously, neck or nothing, 
 <I>under the thick boughs of a great oak</I> which hung low and had 
 never been cropped, either the twisted branches, or some one forked 
 bough of the oak, caught hold of his head, either by his neck, or, as 
 some think, by his long hair, which had been so much his pride, and was 
 now justly made a halter for him, and there he hung, so astonished that 
 he could not use his hands to help himself or so entangled that his 
 hands could not help him, but the more he struggled the more he was 
 embarrassed. This set him up for a fair mark to the servants of David, 
 and he had the terror and shame of seeing himself thus exposed, while 
 he could do nothing for his own relief, neither fight nor fly. Observe 
 concerning this, 

 1. That his <I>mule went away</I> from <I>under him,</I> as if glad to 
 get clear of such a burden, and resign it to the ignominious tree. Thus 
 the whole creation groans under the burden of man's corruption, but 
 shall shortly be delivered from its load, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:21,22">Rom. viii. 21, 22</A>.

 2. The he hung <I>between heaven and earth,</I> as unworthy of either,
 as abandoned of both; earth would not keep him, heaven would not take 
 him, hell therefore opens her mouth to receive him. 

 3. That this was a very surprising unusual thing. It was fit that it
 should be so, his crime being so monstrous: if, in his flight, his mule 
 had thrown him, and left him half-dead upon the ground, till the 
 servants of David had come up and dispatched him, the same thing would 
 have been done as effectually; but that would have been too common a 
 fate for so uncommon a criminal. God will here, as in the case of those 
 other rebels, Dathan and Abiram, <I>create a new thing,</I> that it may 
 be understood how much <I>this man has provoked the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:29,30">Num. xvi. 29, 30</A>.

 Absalom is here hung up, <I>in terrorem--to frighten</I> children from
 disobedience <I>to their parents.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30+17">Prov. xxx. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is caught alive by one of the servants of David, who goes 
 directly and tells Joab in what posture he found that archrebel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Thus was he set up for a spectacle, as well as a mark, that the
 righteous might see him and <I>laugh at him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:6">Ps. lii. 6</A>),

 while he had this further vexation in his breast, that of all the
 friends he had courted and confided in, and thought he had sure in his 
 interest, though he hung long enough to have been relieved, yet he had 
 none at hand to disentangle him. Joab chides the man for not 
 dispatching him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 telling him, if he had given that bold stroke, he would have rewarded
 him with ten half-crowns and a girdle, that is, a captain's commission, 
 which perhaps was signified by the delivery of a belt or girdle; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:21">Isa. xxii. 21</A>.

 But the man, though zealous enough against Absalom, justified himself
 in not doing it: "Dispatch him!" says he, "not for all the world: it 
 would have cost my head: and thou thyself wast witness to the king's 
 charge concerning him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and, for all thy talk, wouldst have been my prosecutor if I had done
 it," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Those that love the treason hate the traitor. Joab could not deny this,
 nor blame the man for his caution, and therefore makes him no answer, 
 but breaks off the discourse, under colour of haste

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I may not tarry thus with thee.</I> Superiors should consider a
 reproof before they give it, lest they be ashamed of it afterwards, and 
 find themselves unable to make it good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He is (as I may say) embowelled and quartered, as traitors are, so 
 pitifully mangled is he as he hangs there, and receives his death in 
 such a manner as to see all its terrors and feel all its pain. 

 1. Joab throws three darts into his body, which put him, no doubt, to
 exquisite torment, while he is yet <I>alive in the midst of the 
 oak,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 I know not whether Joab can be justified in this direct disobedience to
 the command of his sovereign; was this to <I>deal gently with the young 
 man?</I> Would David have suffered him to do it if he had been upon the 
 spot? Yet this may be said for him, that, while he broke the order of a 
 too indulgent father, he did real service both to his king and country, 
 and would have endangered welfare of both if he had not done it.  
 <I>Salus populi suprema lex--The safety of the people is the supreme
 law.</I>

 2. Joab's young men, ten of them, smite him, before he is dispatched,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 They surrounded him, made a ring about him in triumph, and then
 <I>smote him and slew him.</I> So <I>let all they enemies perish, O 
 Lord!</I> Joab hereupon sounds a retreat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:16"><I>v.</I>  16</A>.

 The danger is over, now that Absalom is slain; the people will soon
 return to their allegiance to David, and therefore no more blood shall 
 be spilt; no prisoners are taken, to be tried as traitors and made 
 examples; let every man return to his tent; they are all the king's 
 subjects, all his good subjects again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His body is disposed of disgracefully 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>):

 They <I>cast it into a great pit in the wood;</I> they would not bring
 it to his father (for that circumstance would but have added to his 
 grief), nor would they preserve it to be buried, according to his 
 order, but threw it into the next pit with indignation. Now where is 
 the beauty he had been so proud of and for which he had been so much 
 admired? Where are his aspiring projects, and the castles he had built 
 in the air? His thoughts perish, and he with them. And, to signify how 
 heavy <I>his iniquity lay upon his bones,</I> as the prophet speaks

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:27">Ezek. xxxii. 27</A>),
 
 they raised a <I>great heap of stones upon him,</I> to be a monument of
 his villany, and to signify that he ought to have been stoned as a 
 rebellious son, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:21">Deut. xxi. 21</A>.

 Travelers say that the place is taken note of to this day, and that it
 is common for passengers to throw a stone to this heap, with words to 
 this purport: <I>Cursed be the memory of rebellious Absalom, and cursed 
 for ever be all wicked children that rise up in rebellion against their 
 parents.</I> To aggravate the ignominy of Absalom's burial, the 
 historian takes notice of a pillar he had erected in the valley of 
 Kidron, near Jerusalem, to be a monument for himself, and keep his name 
 in remembrance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 at the foot of which, it is probable, he designed to be buried. What
 foolish insignificant projects do proud men fill their heads with! And 
 what care do many people take about the disposal of their bodies, when 
 they are dead, that have no care at all what shall become of their 
 precious souls! Absalom had three sons

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:27"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 27</A>),

 but, it seems, now he had none; God had taken them away by death; and
 justly is a rebellious son written childless. To make up the want, he 
 erects this pillar for a memorial; yet in this also Providence crosses 
 him, and a rude heap of stones shall be his monument, instead of this 
 marble pillar. Thus <I>those that exalt themselves shall be abased.</I> 
 His care was to have his name kept in remembrance, and it is so, to his 
 everlasting dishonour. He could not be content in the obscurity of the 
 rest of David's sons, of whom nothing is recorded but their names, but 
 would be famous, and is therefore justly made for ever infamous. The 
 pillar shall bear his name, but not to his credit; it was designed for 
 Absalom's glory, but proved Absalom's folly.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear
 the king tidings, how that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath avenged him of his
 enemies.
 &nbsp; 20 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this
 day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou
 shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.
 &nbsp; 21 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast
 seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.
 &nbsp; 22 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But
 howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab
 said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no
 tidings ready?
 &nbsp; 23 But howsoever, <I>said he,</I> let me run. And he said unto him,
 Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.
 &nbsp; 24 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went
 up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his
 eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.
 &nbsp; 25 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king
 said, If he <I>be</I> alone, <I>there is</I> tidings in his mouth. And he
 came apace, and drew near.
 &nbsp; 26 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman
 called unto the porter, and said, Behold <I>another</I> man running
 alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.
 &nbsp; 27 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the
 foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the
 king said, He <I>is</I> a good man, and cometh with good tidings.
 &nbsp; 28 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And
 he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and
 said, Blessed <I>be</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, which hath delivered up the
 men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
 &nbsp; 29 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And
 Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and <I>me</I> thy
 servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what <I>it was.</I>
 &nbsp; 30 And the king said <I>unto him,</I> Turn aside, <I>and</I> stand here.
 And he turned aside, and stood still.
 &nbsp; 31 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord
 the king: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath avenged thee this day of all them
 that rose up against thee.
 &nbsp; 32 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe?
 And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that
 rise against thee to do <I>thee</I> hurt, be as <I>that</I> young man <I>is.</I>
 &nbsp; 33 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over
 the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son
 Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O
 Absalom, my son, my son!
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Absalom's business is done; and we are now told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How David was informed of it. He staid behind at the city of 
 Mahanaim, some miles from the wood where the battle was, and in the 
 utmost border of the land. Absalom's scattered forces all made homeward 
 toward Jordan, which was the contrary way from Mahanaim, so that his 
 watchmen could not perceive how the battle went, till an express came 
 on purpose to bring advice of the issue, which the king sat in the gate 
 expecting to hear, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:24"><I>v.</I>  24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Cushi was the man Joab ordered to carry the tidings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 an <I>Ethiopian,</I> so his name signifies, and some think that he was
 so by birth, a black that waited on Joab, probably one of the ten that 
 had helped to dispatch Absalom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 as some think, though it was dangerous for one of those to bring the
 news to David, lest his fate should be the same with theirs that 
 reported to him Saul's death, and Ish-bosheth's.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Ahimaaz, the young priest (one of those who brought David 
 intelligence of Absalom's motions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+17:17"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 17</A>),

 was very forward to be the messenger of these tidings, so transported
 was he with joy that this cloud was blown over; let him go and tell the 
 king that <I>the Lord hath avenged him of his enemies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 This he desired, not so much in hope of a reward (he was above that) as
 that he might have the pleasure and satisfaction of bringing the king, 
 whom he loved, this good news. Joab knew David better than Ahimaaz did, 
 and that the tidings of Absalom's death, which must conclude the story, 
 would spoil the acceptableness of all the rest; and he loves Ahimaaz 
 too well to let him be the messenger of those tidings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 they are fitter to be brought by a footman than by a priest. However,
 when Cushi was gone, Ahimaaz begged hard for leave to run after him, 
 and with great importunity obtained it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 One would wonder why he should be so fond of this office, when another
 was employed in it.

 (1.) Perhaps it was to show his swiftness; observing how heavily Cushi
 ran, and that he took the worse way, though the nearest, he had a mind 
 to show how fast he could run, and that he could go the furthest way 
 about and yet beat Cushi. No great praise for a priest to be swift of 
 foot, yet perhaps Ahimaaz was proud of it.

 (2.) Perhaps it was in prudence and tenderness to the king that he
 desired it. He knew he could get before Cushi, and therefore was 
 willing to prepare the king, by a vague and general report, for the 
 plain truth which Cushi was ordered to tell him. If bad news must come, 
 it is best that it come gradually, and will be the better borne.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They are both discovered by the watchman on the gate of Mahanaim, 
 Ahimaaz first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 for, though Cushi had the lead, Ahimaaz soon outran him; but presently
 after Cushi appeared, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 (1.) When the king hears of one running alone he concludes he is an
 express

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):
 
 <I>If he be alone, there are tidings in his mouth;</I> for if they had
 been beaten, and were flying back from the enemy, there would have been 
 many. 

 (2.) When he hears it is Ahimaaz he concludes he brings good news, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Ahimaaz, it seems, was so famous for running that he was known by it at
 a distance, and so eminently good that it is taken for granted, if he 
 be the messenger, the news must needs be good: <I>He is a good man,</I> 
 zealously affected to the king's interest, and would not bring bad 
 news. It is pity but the good tidings of the gospel should always be 
 brought by good men; and how welcome should the messengers be to us for 
 their message sake!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Ahimaaz is very forward to proclaim the victory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 cries at a distance, "Peace, there is peace;" peace after war, which is
 doubly welcome. "<I>All is well,</I> my lord O king! the danger is 
 over, and we may return, when the king pleases, to Jerusalem." And, 
 when he comes near, he tells him the news more particularly. "They are 
 all cut off <I>that lifted up their hands against the king;</I>" and, 
 as became a priest, while he gives the king the joy of it, he gives God 
 the glory of it, the God of peace and war, the God of salvation and 
 victory: "<I>Blessed be the Lord thy God,</I> that has done this for 
 thee, as thy God, pursuant to the promises made to uphold thy throne,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:16"><I>ch.</I> vii. 16</A>.

 When he said this, <I>he fell down upon his face,</I> not only in
 reverence to the king, but in humble adoration of God, whose name he 
 praised for this success. By directing David thus to give God thanks 
 for his victory, he prepared him for the approaching news of its allay.  
 The more our hearts are fixed and enlarged in thanksgiving to God for 
 our mercies the better disposed we shall be to bear with patience the 
 afflictions mixed with them. Poor David is so much a father that he 
 forgets he is a king, and therefore cannot rejoice in the news of a 
 victory, till he know whether the <I>young man Absalom be safe,</I> for 
 whom his heart seems to tremble, almost as Eli's, in a similar case, 
 for the ark of God. Ahimaaz soon discerned, what Joab intimated to him, 
 that the death of the king's son would make the tidings of the day very 
 unwelcome, and therefore in his report left that matter doubtful; and, 
 though he gave occasion to suspect how it was, yet, that the 
 thunderclap might not come too suddenly upon the poor perplexed king, 
 he refers him to the next messenger, whom they saw coming, for a more 
 particular account of it. "When Joab sent the king's servant (namely, 
 <I>Cushi) and me thy servant,</I> to bring the news, <I>I saw a great 
 tumult,</I> occasioned by something extraordinary, as you will hear by 
 and by; but I have nothing to say about it. I have delivered that which 
 was my message. Cushi is better able to inform you than I am. I will 
 not be the messenger of evil tidings; nor will I pretend to know that 
 which I cannot give a perfect account of." He is therefore told to 
 stand by till Cushi come

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 and now, we may suppose, he gives the king a more particular account of
 the victory, which was the thing he came to bring the news of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Cushi, the slow post, proves the sure one, and besides the 
 confirmation of the news of the victory which Ahimaaz had 
 brought--<I>The Lord has avenged thee of all those that rose up against
 thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>)--he

 satisfied the king's enquiry concerning Absalom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 <I>Is he safe?</I> says David. "Yes," says Cushi, "he is safe in his
 grave;" but he tells the news so discreetly that, how unwelcome soever 
 the message is, the messenger can have no blame. He did not tell him 
 plainly that Absalom was hanged, and run through and buried under a 
 heap of stones; but only that his fate was what he desired might be the 
 fate of all that were traitors against the king, his crown and dignity: 
 "<I>The enemies of my lord the king,</I> whoever they are, <I>and all 
 that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is;</I> I 
 need wish them no worse."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How David received the intelligence. He forgets all the joy of his 
 deliverance, and is quite overwhelmed with the sorrowful tidings of 
 Absalom's death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 As soon as he perceived by Cushi's reply that Absalom was dead, he
 asked no more questions, but fell into a passion of weeping, retired 
 from company, and abandoned himself to sorrow; as he was going up to 
 his chamber he was overheard to say "<I>O my son Absalom! my son, my 
 son Absalom!</I> alas for thee! I lament thee. How hast thou fallen!  
 <I>Would God I had died for thee,</I> and that thou hadst remained 
 alive this day" (so the Chaldee adds) "<I>O Absalom! my son, my 
 son!</I>" I wish I could see reason to think that this arose from a 
 concern about Absalom's everlasting state, and that the reason why he 
 wished he had <I>died for him</I> was because he had good hopes of his 
 own salvation, and of Absalom's repentance if he had lived. It rather 
 seems to have been spoken inconsiderately, and in a passion, and it was 
 his infirmity. He is to be blamed,

 1. For showing so great a fondness for a graceless son only because he
 was handsome and witty, while he was justly abandoned both of God and 
 man. 

 2. For quarrelling, not only with divine providence, in the disposals
 of which he ought silently to have acquiesced, but with divine justice, 
 the judgments of which he ought to have adored and subscribed to. See 
 how Bildad argues

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:3,4">Job viii. 3, 4</A>),

 <I>If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away
 in their transgression,</I> thou shouldst submit, <I>for doth God 
 pervert judgment?</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:3">Lev. x. 3</A>.

 3. For opposing the justice of the nation, which, as king, he was
 entrusted with the administration of, and which, with other public 
 interests, he ought to have preferred before nay natural affection. 

 4.  For despising the mercy of his deliverance, and the deliverance of
 his family and kingdom, from Absalom's wicked designs, as if this were 
 no mercy, nor worth giving thanks for, because it cost the life of 
 Absalom. 

 5. For indulging in a strong passion, and speaking unadvisedly with his
 lips. He now forgot his own reasonings upon the death of another child 
 (<I>Can I bring him back again?</I>) and his own resolution to <I>keep 
 his mouth as with a bridle</I> when <I>his heart was hot within 
 him,</I> as well as his own practice at other times, when he <I>quieted 
 himself as a child that was weaned from his mother.</I> The best men 
 are not always in an equally good frame. What we over-loved we are apt 
 to over-grieve for: in each affection, therefore, it is wisdom to have 
 rule over our own spirits and to keep a strict guard upon ourselves 
 when that is removed from us which was very dear to us. Losers think 
 they may have leave to speak; but little said is soon amended. The 
 penitent patient sufferer <I>sitteth alone and keepeth silence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:28">Lam. iii. 28</A>),

 or rather, with <I>Job,</I> says, <I>Blessed be the name of the
 Lord.</I></P>
