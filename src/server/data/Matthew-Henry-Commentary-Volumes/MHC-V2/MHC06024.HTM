 This chapter concludes the life and reign of Joshua, in which we have, 
 
 I. The great care and pains he took to confirm the people of Israel in 
 the true faith and worship of God, that they might, after his death, 
 persevere therein. In order to this he called another general assembly 
 of the heads of the congregation of Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:1">ver. 1</A>)

 and dealt with them.
 
 1. By way of narrative, recounting the great things God had done for
 them and their fathers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:2-13">ver. 2-13</A>.

 2. By way of charge to them, in consideration thereof, to serve God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:14">ver. 14</A>.

 3. By way of treaty with them, wherein he aims to bring them, 

 (1.) To make religion their deliberate choice; and they did so, with
 reasons for their choice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:15-18">ver.  15-18</A>.

 (2.) To make it their determinate choice, and to resolve to adhere to
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:19-24">ver. 19-24</A>.

 4. By way of covenant upon that treaty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:25-28">ver.  25-28</A>.

 II.  The conclusion of this history, with, 

 1.  The death and burial of Joshua

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:29,30">ver. 29, 30</A>)

 and Eleazar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:33">ver. 33</A>),

 and the mention of the burial of Joseph's bones upon that occasion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:32">ver. 32</A>.

 2.  A general account of the state of Israel at that time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:31">ver.  31</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and
 called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for
 their judges, and for their officers; and they presented
 themselves before God.
 &nbsp; 2 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God
 of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in
 old time, <I>even</I> Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of
 Nachor: and they served other gods.
 &nbsp; 3 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the
 flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and
 multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.
 &nbsp; 4 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau
 mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down
 into Egypt.
 &nbsp; 5 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according
 to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.
 &nbsp; 6 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the
 sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots
 and horsemen unto the Red sea.
 &nbsp; 7 And when they cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, he put darkness between
 you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered
 them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye
 dwelt in the wilderness a long season.
 &nbsp; 8 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt
 on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave
 them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I
 destroyed them from before you.
 &nbsp; 9 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred
 against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to
 curse you:
 &nbsp; 10 But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed
 you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.
 &nbsp; 11 And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men
 of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites,
 and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the
 Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.
 &nbsp; 12 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from
 before you, <I>even</I> the two kings of the Amorites; <I>but</I> not with
 thy sword, nor with thy bow.
 &nbsp; 13 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and
 cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards
 and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.
 &nbsp; 14 Now therefore fear the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and serve him in sincerity and
 in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the
 other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Joshua thought he had taken his last farewell of Israel in the solemn 
 charge he gave them in the foregoing chapter, when he said, <I>I go the 
 way of all the earth;</I> but God graciously continuing his life longer 
 than expected, and renewing his strength, he was desirous to improve it 
 for the good of Israel. He did not say, "I have taken my leave of them 
 once, and let that serve;" but, having yet a longer space given him, he 
 summons them together again, that he might try what more he could do to 
 engage them for God. Note, We must never think our work for God done 
 till our life is done; and, if he lengthen out our days beyond what we 
 thought, we must conclude it is because he has some further service for 
 us to do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The assembly is the same with that in the foregoing chapter, the 
 <I>elders, heads, judges, and officers of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 But it is here made somewhat more solemn than it was there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The place appointed for their meeting is <I>Shechem,</I> not only 
 because that lay nearer to Joshua than Shiloh, and therefore more 
 convenient now that he was infirm and unfit for travelling, but because 
 it was the place where Abraham, the first trustee of God's covenant 
 with this people, settled at his coming to Canaan, and where God 
 appeared to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:6,7">Gen. xii. 6, 7</A>),

 and near which stood mounts Gerizim and Ebal, where the people had
 renewed their covenant with God at their first coming into Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+8:30">Josh. viii. 30</A>.

 Of the promises God had made to their fathers, and of the promises they
 themselves had made to God, this place might serve to put them in 
 mind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They presented themselves not only before Joshua, but before God, 
 in this assembly, that is, they came together in a solemn religious 
 manner, as into the special presence of God, and with an eye to his 
 speaking to them by Joshua; and it is probable the service began with 
 prayer. It is the conjecture of interpreters that upon this great 
 occasion Joshua ordered the ark of God to be brought by the priests to 
 Shechem, which, they say, was about ten miles from Shiloh, and to be 
 set down in the place of their meeting, which is therefore called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>)

 <I>the sanctuary of the Lord,</I> the presence of the ark making it so
 at that time; and this was done to grace the solemnity, and to strike 
 an awe upon the people that attended. We have not now any such sensible 
 tokens of the divine presence, but are to believe that <I>where two or 
 three are gathered together</I> in Christ's name he is as really in the 
 midst of them as God was where the ark was, and they are indeed 
 presenting themselves before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Joshua spoke to them in God's name, and as from him, in the 
 language of a prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>Thus saith the Lord,</I> Jehovah, the great God, and the God of
 Israel, your God in covenant, whom therefore you are bound to hear and 
 give heed to." Note, The word of God is to be received by us as his, 
 whoever is the messenger that brings it, whose greatness cannot add to 
 it, nor his meanness diminish from it. His sermon consists of doctrine 
 and application.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The doctrinal part is a history of the great things God had done for 
 his people, and for their fathers before them. God by Joshua recounts 
 the marvels of old: "I did so and so." They must know and consider, not 
 only that such and such things were done, but that God did them. It is 
 a series of wonders that is here recorded, and perhaps many more were 
 mentioned by Joshua, which for brevity's sake are here omitted. See 
 what God had wrought. 

 (1.) He brought Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 He and his ancestors had served other gods there, for it was the
 country in which, though celebrated for learning, idolatry, as some 
 think, had its rise; there <I>the world by wisdom knew not God.</I> 
 Abraham, who afterwards was the friend of God and the great favourite 
 of heaven, was bred up in idolatry, and lived long in it, till God by 
 his grace snatched him as a brand out of that burning.  Let them 
 remember that rock out of which they were hewn, and not relapse into 
 that sin from which their fathers by a miracle of free grace were 
 delivered. "I took him," says God, "else he had never come out of that 
 sinful state." Hence Abraham's justification is made by the apostle an 
 instance of God's <I>justifying the ungodly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:5">Rom. iv. 5</A>.

 (2.) He brought him to Canaan, and built up his family, led him through
 the land to Shechem, where they now were, multiplied his seed by 
 Ishmael, who begat twelve princes, but at last gave him Isaac the 
 promised son, and in him multiplied his seed. When Isaac had two sons, 
 Jacob and Esau, God provided an inheritance for Esau elsewhere in Mount 
 Seir, that the land of Canaan might be reserved entire for the seed of 
 Jacob, and the posterity of Esau might not pretend to a share in it. 
 
 (3.) He delivered the seed of Jacob out of Egypt with a high hand

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:5,6"><I>v.</I>  5, 6</A>),

 and rescued them out of the hands of Pharaoh and his host at the Red
 Sea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 The same waters were the Israelites' guard and the Egyptians' grave,
 and this in answer to prayer; for, though we find in the story that 
 they in that distress murmured against God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:11,12">Exod. xiv. 11, 12</A>),

 notice is here taken of their <I>crying to God;</I> he graciously
 accepted those that prayed to him, and overlooked the folly of those 
 that quarrelled with him. 

 (4.) He protected them in the wilderness, where they are here said, not
 to <I>wander,</I> but to <I>dwell for a long season,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 So wisely were all their motions directed, and so safely were they
 kept, that even there they had as certain a dwelling-place as if they 
 had been in a walled city.

 (5.) He gave them the land of the Amorites, on the other side Jordan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and there defeated the plot of Balak and Balaam against them, so that
 Balaam could not curse them as he desired, and therefore Balak durst 
 not fight them as he designed, and as, because he designed it, he is 
 here said to have done it. The turning of Balaam's tongue to bless 
 Israel, when he intended to curse them, is often mentioned as an 
 instance of the divine power put forth in Israel's favour as remarkable 
 as any, because in it God proved (and does still, more than we are 
 aware of) his dominion over the powers of darkness, and over the 
 spirits of men.

 (6.) He brought them safely and triumphantly into Canaan, delivered the
 Canaanites into their hand

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>sent hornets before them,</I> when they were actually engaged in
 battle with the enemy, which with their stings tormented them and with 
 their noise terrified them, so that they became a very easy prey to 
 Israel. These dreadful swarms first appeared in their war with Sihon 
 and Og, the two kings of the Amorites, and afterwards in their other 
 battles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 God had promised to do this for them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:27,28">Exod. xxiii. 27, 28</A>.

 And here Joshua takes notice of the fulfilling of that promise. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:27,28,De+7:20">Exod. xxiii. 27, 28; Deut. vii. 20</A>.
 
 These hornets, it should seem, annoyed the enemy more than the
 artillery of Israel, and therefore he adds, <I>not with thy sword nor 
 bow.</I> It was purely the Lord's doing. <I>Lastly,</I> They were now 
 in the peaceable possession of a good land, and lived comfortably upon 
 the fruit of other people's labours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The application of this history of God's mercies to them is by way 
 of exhortation to fear and serve God, in gratitude for his favour, and 
 that it might be continued to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Now therefore, in consideration of all this,

 (1.) "<I>Fear the Lord,</I> the Lord and his goodness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:5">Hos. iii. 5</A>.
 
 Reverence a God of such infinite power, fear to offend him and to
 forfeit his goodness, keep up an awe of his majesty, a deference to his 
 authority, a dread of his displeasure, and a continual regard to his 
 all-seeing eye upon you."

 (2.) "Let your practice be consonant to this principle, and serve him
 both by the outward acts of religious worship and every instance of 
 obedience in your whole conversation, and this <I>in sincerity and 
 truth,</I> with a single eye and an upright heart, and inward 
 impressions answerable to outward expressions." This is the <I>truth in 
 the inward part,</I> which God requires, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:6">Ps. li. 6</A>.

 For what good will it do us to dissemble with a God that searches the
 heart?

 (3.) <I>Put away the strange gods,</I> both Chaldean and Egyptian
 idols, for those they were most in danger of revolting to. It should 
 seem by this charge, which is repeated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 that there were some among them that privately kept in their closets
 the images or pictures of these dunghill-deities, which came to their 
 hands from their ancestors, as heir-looms of their families, though, it 
 may be, they did not worship them; these Joshua earnestly urges them to 
 throw away: "Deface them, destroy them, lest you be tempted to serve 
 them." Jacob pressed his household to do this, and at this very place; 
 for, when they gave him up the little images they had, he buried them 
 <I>under the oak which was by Shechem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:2,4">Gen. xxxv. 2, 4</A>.

 Perhaps the oak mentioned here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>)

 was the same oak, or another in the same place, which might be well
 called the <I>oak of reformation,</I> as there were idolatrous 
 oaks.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, choose you
 this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers
 served that <I>were</I> on the other side of the flood, or the gods of
 the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house,
 we will serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 16 And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should
 forsake the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to serve other gods;
 &nbsp; 17 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God, he <I>it is</I> that brought us up and our
 fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and
 which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all
 the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we
 passed:
 &nbsp; 18 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> drave out from before us all the people, even
 the Amorites which dwelt in the land: <I>therefore</I> will we also
 serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for he <I>is</I> our God.
 &nbsp; 19 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 for he <I>is</I> a holy God; he <I>is</I> a jealous God; he will not
 forgive your transgressions nor your sins.
 &nbsp; 20 If ye forsake the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and serve strange gods, then he will
 turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done
 you good.
 &nbsp; 21 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 22 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye <I>are</I> witnesses against
 yourselves that ye have chosen you the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to serve him. And
 they said, <I>We are</I> witnesses.
 &nbsp; 23 Now therefore put away, <I>said he,</I> the strange gods which
 <I>are</I> among you, and incline your heart unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 24 And the people said unto Joshua, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God will we
 serve, and his voice will we obey.
 &nbsp; 25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
 them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
 &nbsp; 26 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God,
 and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that
 <I>was</I> by the sanctuary of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 27 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone
 shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness
 unto you, lest ye deny your God.
 &nbsp; 28 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his
 inheritance.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Never was any treaty carried on with better management, nor brought to 
 a better issue, than this of Joshua with the people, to engage them to 
 serve God. The manner of his dealing with them shows him to have been 
 in earnest, and that his heart was much upon it, to leave them under 
 all possible obligations to cleave to him, particularly the obligation 
 of a choice and of a covenant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Would it be any obligation upon them if they made the service of God 
 their choice?--he here puts them to their choice, not as if it were
 antecedently indifferent whether they served God or nor, or as if they 
 were at liberty to refuse his service, but because it would have a 
 great influence upon their perseverance in religion if they embraced it 
 with the reason of men and with the resolution of men. These two things 
 he here brings them to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He brings them to embrace their religion rationally and 
 intelligently, for it is a reasonable service. The will of man is apt 
 to glory in its native liberty, and, in a jealousy for the honour of 
 this, adheres with most pleasure to that which is its own choice and is 
 not imposed upon it; therefore it is God's will that this service 
 should be, not our chance, or a force upon us, but our choice.  
 Accordingly,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Joshua fairly puts the matter to their choice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 Here,

 [1.] He proposes the candidates that stand for the election. The Lord,
 Jehovah, on one side, and on the other side either the gods of their 
 ancestors, which would pretend to recommend themselves to those that 
 were fond of antiquity, and that which was received by tradition from 
 their fathers, or the <I>gods of their neighbours,</I> the Amorites, in 
 <I>whose land they dwelt,</I> which would insinuate themselves into the 
 affections of those that were complaisant and fond of good fellowship.  
 
 [2.] He supposes there were those to whom, upon some account or other,
 it would <I>seem evil to serve the Lord.</I> There are prejudices and 
 objections which some people raise against religion, which, with those 
 that are inclined to the world and the flesh, have great force. It 
 seems evil to them, hard and unreasonable, to be obliged to deny 
 themselves, mortify the flesh, take up their cross, &c. But, being in a 
 state of probation, it is fit there should be some difficulties in the 
 way, else there were no trial. 

 [3.] He refers it to themselves: "<I>Choose you whom you will
 serve,</I> choose this day, now that the matter is laid thus plainly 
 before you, speedily bring it to a head, and do not stand hesitating." 
 Elijah, long after this, referred the decision of the controversy 
 between Jehovah and Baal to the consciences of those with whom he was 
 treating,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:21">1 Kings xviii. 21</A>.

 Joshua's putting the matter here to this issue plainly intimates two
 things:--<I>First,</I> That it is the will of God we should every one 
 of us make religion our serious and deliberate choice. Let us state the 
 matter impartially to ourselves, weigh things in an even balance, and 
 then determine for that which we find to be really true and good. Let 
 us resolve upon a life of serious godliness, not merely because we know 
 no other way, but because really, upon search, we find no better. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> That religion has so much self-evident reason and 
 righteousness on its side that it may safely be referred to every man 
 that allows himself a free thought either to choose or refuse it; for 
 the merits of the cause are so plain that no considerate man can do 
 otherwise but choose it. The case is so clear that it determines 
 itself. Perhaps Joshua designed, by putting them to their choice, thus 
 to try if there were any among them who, upon so fair an occasion 
 given, would show a coolness and indifference towards the service of 
 God, whether they would desire time to consider and consult their 
 friends before they gave in an answer, and if any such should appear he 
 might set a mark upon them, and warn the rest to avoid them. 

 [4.] He directs their choice in this matter by an open declaration of
 his own resolutions: "<I>But as for me and my house,</I> whatever you 
 do, <I>we will serve the Lord,</I> and I hope you will all be of the 
 same mind." Here he resolves, <I>First,</I> For himself: <I>As for me, 
 I will serve the Lord.</I> Note, The service of God is nothing below 
 the greatest of men; it is so far from being a diminution and 
 disparagement to princes and those of the first rank to be religious 
 that it is their greatest honour, and adds the brightest crown of glory 
 to them. Observe how positive he is: "I will serve God." It is no 
 abridgment of our liberty to bind ourselves with a bond to God. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> For <I>his house,</I> that is, his family, his 
 children and servants, such as were immediately under his eye and care, 
 his inspection and influence.  Joshua was a ruler, a judge in Israel, 
 yet he did not make his necessary application to public affairs an 
 excuse for the neglect of family religion. Those that have the charge 
 of many families, as magistrates and ministers, must take special care 
 of their own

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:4,5">1 Tim. iii. 4, 5</A>):

 <I>I and my house</I> will serve God. 

 1.  "Not my house, without me." He would not engage them to that work
 which he would not set his own hand to. As some who would have their 
 children and servants good, but will not be so themselves; that is, 
 they would have them go to heaven, but intend to go to hell themselves. 
 
 2. "Not I, without my house." He supposes he might be forsaken by his
 people, but in his house, where his authority was greater and more 
 immediate, there he would over-rule.  Note, When we cannot bring as 
 many as we would to the service of God we must bring as many as we can, 
 and extend our endeavours to the utmost sphere of our activity; if we 
 cannot reform the land, let us put away iniquity far from our own 
 tabernacle. 

 3.  "First I, and then my house." Note, Those that lead and rule in
 other things should be first in the service of God, and go before in 
 the best things. <I>Thirdly,</I> He resolves to do this whatever others 
 did.  Though all the families of Israel should revolt from God, and 
 serve idols, yet Joshua and his family will stedfastly adhere to the 
 God of Israel. Note, Those that resolve to serve God must not mind 
 being singular in it, nor be drawn by the crowd to forsake his service. 
 Those that are bound for heaven must be willing to swim against the 
 stream, and must not do as the most do, but as the best do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The matter being thus put to their choice, they immediately 
 determine it by a free, rational, and intelligent declaration, for the 
 God of Israel, against all competitors whatsoever, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:16-18"><I>v.</I> 16-18</A>.
 
 Here,

 [1.] They concur with Joshua in his resolution, being influenced by the
 example of so great a man, who had been so great a blessing to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>We also will serve the Lord.</I> See how much good great men might
 do, if they were but zealous in religion, by their influence on their 
 inferiors.  
 
 [2.] They startle at the thought of apostatizing from God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>God forbid;</I> the word intimates the greatest dread and
 detestation imaginable. "Far be it, far be it from us, that we or ours 
 should ever <I>forsake the Lord to serve other gods.</I> We must be 
 perfectly lost to all sense of justice, gratitude, and honour, ere we 
 can harbour the least thought of such a thing." Thus must our hearts 
 rise against all temptations to desert the service of God. <I>Get thee 
 behind me, Satan.</I> 

 [3.] They give very substantial reasons for their choice, to show that
 they did not make it purely in compliance to Joshua, but from a full 
 conviction of the reasonableness and equity of it. They make this 
 choice for, and in consideration, <I>First,</I> Of the many great and 
 very kind things God had done for them, bringing them out of Egypt 
 through the wilderness into Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 Thus they repeat to themselves Joshua's sermon, and then express their
 sincere compliance with the intentions of it.  <I>Secondly,</I> Of the 
 relation they stood in to God, and his covenant with them: "We <I>will 
 serve the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 <I>for he is our God,</I> who has graciously engaged himself by promise
 to us, and to whom we have by solemn vow engaged ourselves."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He brings them to embrace their religion resolutely, and to express 
 a full purpose of heart to cleave to the Lord. Now that he has them in 
 a good mind he follows his blow, and drives the nail to the head, that 
 it might, if possible, be a nail in a sure place. Fast bind, fast 
 find.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In order to this he sets before them the difficulties of religion, 
 and that in it which might be thought discouraging 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>):

 <I>You cannot serve the Lord, for he is a holy God,</I> or, as it is in
 the Hebrew, <I>he is the holy Gods,</I> intimating the mystery of the 
 Trinity, three in one; <I>holy, holy, holy,</I> holy Father, holy Son, 
 holy Spirit. <I>He will not forgive.</I> And, <I>if you forsake him, he 
 will do you hurt.</I> Certainly Joshua does not intend hereby to deter 
 them from the service of God as impracticable and dangerous. But, 

 [1.] He perhaps intends to represent here the suggestions of seducers,
 who tempted Israel from their God, and from the service of him; with 
 such insinuations as these, that he was a hard master, his work 
 impossible to be done, and he not to be pleased, and, if displeased, 
 implacable and revengeful,--that he would confine their respects to 
 himself only, and would not suffer them to show the least kindness for 
 any other,--and that herein he was very unlike the gods of the nations, 
 which were easy, and neither holy nor jealous. It is probable that this 
 was then commonly objected against the Jewish religion, as it has all 
 along been the artifice of Satan every since he tempted our first 
 parents thus to misrepresent God and his laws, as harsh and severe; and 
 Joshua by his tone and manner of speaking might make them perceive he 
 intended it as an objection, and would put it to them how they would 
 keep their ground against the force of it. Or, 

 [2.] He thus expresses his godly jealousy over them, and his fear
 concerning them, that, notwithstanding the profession they now made of 
 zeal for God and his service, they would afterwards draw back, and if 
 they did they would find him just and jealous to avenge it. Or, 

 [3.] He resolves to let them know the worst of it, and what strict
 terms they must expect to stand upon with God, that they might sit down 
 and count the cost.  "<I>You cannot serve the Lord,</I> except you put 
 away all other gods for he is holy and jealous, and will by no means 
 admit a rival, and therefore you must be very watchful and careful, for 
 it is at your peril if you desert his service; better you had never 
 known it." Thus, though our Master has assured us that <I>his yoke is 
 easy,</I> yet lest, upon the presumption of this, we should grow remiss 
 and careless, he has also told us that the gate is strait, and the way 
 narrow, that leads to life, that we may therefore strive to enter, and 
 not seek only. "<I>You cannot serve God and Mammon;</I> therefore, if 
 you resolve to serve God, you must renounce all competitors with him.  
 You cannot serve God in your own strength, nor will he forgive your 
 transgressions for any righteousness of your own; but <I>all the seed 
 of Israel must be justified and must glory in the Lord alone as their 
 righteousness</I> and <I>strength,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:24,25">Isa. xlv. 24, 25</A>.

 They must therefore come off from all confidence in their own
 sufficiency, else their purposes would be to no purpose. Or,

 [4.] Joshua thus urges on them the seeming discouragements which lay in
 their way, that he might sharpen their resolutions, and draw from them 
 a promise yet more express and solemn that they would continue faithful 
 to God and their religion. He draws it form them that they might catch 
 at it the more earnestly and hold it the faster.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Notwithstanding this statement of the difficulties of religion, 
 they declare a firm and fixed resolution to continue and persevere 
 therein 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "<I>Nay, but we will serve the Lord.</I> We will think never the worse
 of him for his being a holy and jealous God, nor for his confining his 
 servants to worship himself only. Justly will he consume those that 
 forsake him, but we never will forsake him; not only we have a good 
 mind to serve him, and we hope we shall, but we are at a point, we 
 cannot bear to hear any <I>entreaties to leave him or to turn from 
 following after him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:16">Ruth i. 16</A>);

 in the strength of divine grace we are resolved that we will serve the
 Lord." This resolution they repeat with an explication

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 "<I>The Lord our God will we serve,</I> not only be called his servants
 and wear his livery, but our religion shall rule us in every thing, 
 <I>and his voice will we obey.</I>" And in vain do we <I>call him 
 Master and Lord, if we do not the things which he saith,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+6:46">Luke vi. 46</A>.

 This last promise they make in answer to the charge Joshua gave them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 that, in order to their perseverance, they should, 

 [1.] Put away the images and relics of the strange gods, and not keep
 any of the tokens of those other lovers in their custody, if they 
 resolved their <I>Maker should be their husband;</I> they promise, in 
 this, to obey his voice.  

 [2.] That they should <I>incline their hearts to the God of Israel,</I>
 use their authority over their own hearts to engage them for God, not 
 only to set their affections upon him, but to settle them so. These 
 terms they agree to, and thus, as Joshua explains the bargain, they 
 strike it: <I>The Lord our God will we serve.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The service of God being thus made their deliberate choice, Joshua 
 binds them to it by a solemn covenant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Moses had twice publicly ratified this covenant between God and Israel,
 at Mount Sinai

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:1-33">Exod. xxiv.</A>)

 and in the plains of Moab,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:1">Deut. xxix. 1</A>.

 Joshua had likewise done it once
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+8:31-35"><I>ch.</I> viii. 31</A>,

 &c.) and now the second time. It is here called a
 <I>statute</I> and an <I>ordinance,</I> because of the strength and 
 perpetuity of its obligation, and because even this covenant bound them 
 to no more than what they were antecedently bound to by the divine 
 command. Now, to give it the formalities of a covenant, 

 1. He calls witnesses, no other than themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>You are witnesses that you have chosen the Lord.</I> He promises
 himself that they would never forget the solemnities of this day; but, 
 if hereafter they should break this covenant, he assures them that the 
 professions and promises they had now made would certainly rise up in 
 judgment against them and condemn them; and they agreed to it: "<I>We 
 are witnesses;</I> let us be judged out of our own mouths if ever we be 
 false to our God." 

 2. He put it in writing, and inserted it, as we find it here, in the
 sacred canon: He <I>wrote it in the book of the law</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 in that original which was laid up in the side of the ark, and thence,
 probably, it was transcribed into the several copies which the princes 
 had for the use of each tribe. There it was written, that their 
 obligation to religion by the divine precept, and that by their own 
 promise, might remain on record together. 

 3. He erected a memorandum of it, for the benefit of those who perhaps
 were not conversant with writings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 He <I>set up a great stone under an oak,</I> as a monument of this
 covenant, and perhaps wrote an inscription upon it (by which stones are 
 made to speak) signifying the intention of it. When he says, <I>It hath 
 heard</I> what was past, he tacitly upbraids the people with the 
 hardness of their hearts, as if this stone had heard to as good purpose 
 as some of them; and, if they should forget what was no done, this 
 stone would so far preserve the remembrance of it as to reproach them 
 for their stupidity and carelessness, and be a witness against 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The matter being thus settled, Joshua dismissed this assembly of the 
 grandees of Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 and took his last leave of them, well satisfied in having done his
 part, by which he had delivered his soul; if they perished, their blood 
 would be upon their own heads.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>29 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son
 of Nun, the servant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, died, <I>being</I> a hundred and ten
 years old.
 &nbsp; 30 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
 Timnath-serah, which <I>is</I> in mount Ephraim, on the north side of
 the hill of Gaash.
 &nbsp; 31 And Israel served the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> all the days of Joshua, and all
 the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known
 all the works of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that he had done for Israel.
 &nbsp; 32 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel
 brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of
 ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of
 Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver: and it became the
 inheritance of the children of Joseph.
 &nbsp; 33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a
 hill <I>that pertained to</I> Phinehas his son, which was given him in
 mount Ephraim.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This book, which began with triumphs, here ends with funerals, by which 
 all the glory of man is stained. We have here 

 1. The burial of Joseph, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 He died about 200 years before in Egypt, but <I>gave commandment
 concerning his bones,</I> that they should not rest in their grave 
 until Israel had rest in the land of promise; now therefore the 
 children of Israel, who had brought this coffin full of bones with them 
 out of Egypt, carried it along with them in all their marches through 
 the wilderness (the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, it is probable, 
 taking particular care of it), and kept it in their camp till Canaan 
 was perfectly reduced, now at last they deposited it in that piece of 
 ground which his father gave him near Shechem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:22">Gen. xlviii. 22</A>.

 Probably it was upon this occasion that Joshua called for all Israel to
 meet him at Shechem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 to attend Joseph's coffin to the grave there, so that the sermon in
 this chapter served both for Joseph's funeral sermon and his own 
 farewell sermon; and if it was, as is supposed, in the last year of his 
 life, the occasion might very well remind him of his own death being at 
 hand, for he was not just at the same age that his illustrious ancestor 
 Joseph had arrived at when he died, 110 <I>years old;</I> compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>

 with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:26">Gen. l. 26</A>.

 2. The death and burial of Joshua, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>.

 We are not told how long he lived after the coming of Israel into
 Canaan. Dr.  Lightfoot thinks it was about seventeen years; but the 
 Jewish chronologers generally say it was about twenty-seven or 
 twenty-eight years. He is here called the <I>servant of the Lord,</I> 
 the same title that was given to Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:1"><I>ch.</I> i. 1</A>)

 when mention was made of his death; for, though Joshua was in many
 respects inferior to Moses, yet in this he was equal to him, that, 
 according as his work was, he approved himself a diligent and faithful 
 servant of God. And he that traded with his two talents had the same 
 approbation that he had who traded with his five. <I>Well done, good 
 and faithful servant.</I> Joshua's burying-place is here said to be 
 <I>on the north side of the hill Gaash,</I> or <I>the quaking hill;</I> 
 the Jews say it was so called because it trembled at the burial of 
 Joshua, to upbraid the people of Israel with their stupidity in that 
 they did not lament the death of that great and good man as they ought 
 to have done. Thus at the death of Christ, our Joshua, the earth 
 quaked. The learned bishop Patrick observes that there is no mention of 
 any days of mourning being observed for Joshua, as there were for Moses 
 and Aaron, in which, he says, St. Hierom and others of the fathers 
 think there is a mystery, namely, that under the law, when life and 
 immortality were not brought to so clear a light as they are now, they 
 had reason to mourn and weep for the death of their friends; but now 
 that Jesus, our Joshua, has opened the kingdom of heaven, we may rather 
 rejoice. 

 3. The death and burial of Eleazar the chief priest, who, it is 
 probable, died about the same time that Joshua did, as Aaron in the 
 same year with Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 The Jews say that Eleazar, a little before he died, called the elders
 together, and gave them a charge as Joshua had done.  He was buried in 
 a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which came to him, not by 
 descent, for then it would have pertained to his father first, nor had 
 the priests any cities in Mount Ephraim, but either it fell to him by 
 marriage, as the Jews conjecture, or it was freely bestowed upon him, 
 to build a country seat on, by some pious Israelite that was 
 well-affected to the priesthood, for it is here said to have been 
 <I>given him;</I> and there he buried his dear father. 

 4.  A general idea given us of the state of Israel at this time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 
 While Joshua lived, religion was kept up among them under his care and
 influence; but soon after he and his contemporaries died it went to 
 decay, so much oftentimes does one head hold up: how well is it for the 
 gospel church that Christ, our Joshua, is still with it, by his Spirit, 
 and will be always, even <I>unto the end of the world!</I></P>
