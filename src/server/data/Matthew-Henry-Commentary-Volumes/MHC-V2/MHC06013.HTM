 At this chapter begins the account of the dividing of the land of 
 Canaan among the tribes of Israel by lot, a narrative not so 
 entertaining and instructive as that of the conquest of it, and yet it 
 is thought fit to be inserted in the sacred history, to illustrate the 
 performance of the promise made to the fathers, that this land should 
 be given to the seed of Jacob, to them and not to any other. The 
 preserving of this distribution would be of great use to the Jewish 
 nation, who were obliged by the law to keep up this first distribution, 
 and not to transfer inheritances from tribe to tribe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+36:9">Num. xxxvi. 9</A>.

 It is likewise of use to us for the explaining of other scriptures: the
 learned know how much light the geographical description of a country 
 gives to the history of it. And therefore we are not to skip over these 
 chapters of hard names as useless and not to be regarded; where God has 
 a mouth to speak and a hand to write we should find an ear to hear an 
 eye to read; and God give us a heart to profit! In this chapter, 

 I. God informs Joshua what parts of the country that were intended in
 the grant to Israel yet remained unconquered, and not got in 
 possession,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. He appoints him, notwithstanding, to make a distribution of what
 was conquered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:7">ver.  7</A>.

 III. To complete this account, here is a repetition of the distribution
 Moses had made of the land on the other side Jordan; in general

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:8-14">ver. 8-14</A>), 
 
 in particular, the lot of Reuben
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:15-23">ver.  15-23</A>),

 of Gad

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:24-28">ver. 24-28</A>),

 of the half tribe of Manasseh,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now Joshua was old <I>and</I> stricken in years; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said
 unto him, Thou art old <I>and</I> stricken in years, and there
 remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.
 &nbsp; 2 This <I>is</I> the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the
 Philistines, and all Geshuri,
 &nbsp; 3 From Sihor, which <I>is</I> before Egypt, even unto the borders of
 Ekron northward, <I>which</I> is counted to the Canaanite: five lords
 of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the
 Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:
 &nbsp; 4 From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah
 that <I>is</I> beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the
 Amorites:
 &nbsp; 5 And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the
 sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into
 Hamath.
 &nbsp; 6 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto
 Misrephothmaim, <I>and</I> all the Sidonians, them will I drive out
 from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot
 unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 
 
 I. God puts Joshua in mind of his old age,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 1. It is said that Joshua was <I>old and stricken in years,</I> and he
 and Caleb were at this time the only old men among the thousands of 
 Israel, none except them of all those who were numbered at Mount Sinai 
 being now alive. He had been a man of war from his youth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:10">Exod. xvii. 10</A>);

 but now he yielded to the infirmities of age, with which it is in vain
 for the stoutest to think of contesting. It should seem Joshua had not 
 the same strength and vigour in his old age that Moses had; all that 
 come to old age do not find it alike good; generally, the days of old 
 age are evil days, and such as there is no pleasure in, nor expectation 
 of service from. 

 2. God takes notice of it to him: <I>God said to him, Thou art old.</I>
 Note, It is good for those who are <I>old and stricken in years</I> to 
 be put in remembrance of their being so. Some have <I>gray hairs here 
 and there upon them, and perceive it not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:9">Hos. vii. 9</A>);

 they do not care to think of it, and therefore need to be told of it,
 that they may be quickened to do the work of life, and make preparation 
 for death, which is coming towards them apace. But God mentions 
 Joshua's age and growing infirmities, 

 (1.) As a reason why he should now lay by the thoughts of pursuing the
 war; he cannot expect to see an end of it quickly, for there remained 
 much land, more perhaps than he thought, to be possessed, in several 
 parts remote from each other: and it was not fit that at his age he 
 should be put upon the fatigue of renewing the war, and carrying it to 
 such distant places; no, it was enough for him that he had reduced the 
 body of the country.  "Let him be gathered to rest with honour and the 
 thanks of his people for the good services he had done them, and let 
 the conquering of the skirts of the country be left for those that 
 shall come after." As he had entered into the labours of Moses, so let 
 others enter into his, and bring forth the top-stone, the doing of 
 which was reserved for David long after. Observe, God considers the 
 frame of his people, and would not have them burdened with work above 
 their strength. It cannot be expected that old people should do as they 
 have done for God and their country. 

 (2.) As a reason why he should speedily apply himself to the dividing
 of that which he had conquered.  That work must be done, and done 
 quickly; it was necessary that he should preside in the doing of it, 
 and therefore, he being <I>old and stricken in years,</I> and not 
 likely to continue long, let him make this his concluding piece of 
 service to God and Israel. All people, but especially old people, 
 should set themselves to do that quickly which must be done before they 
 die, lest death prevent them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:10">Eccl. ix. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives him a particular account of the land that yet remained 
 unconquered, which was intended for Israel, and which, in due time, 
 they should be masters of if they did not put a bar in their own door. 
 Divers places are here mentioned, some in the south, as the country of 
 the Philistines, governed by five lords, and the land that lay towards 
 Egypt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>),

 some westward, as that which lay towards the Sidonians 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 some eastward, as all Lebanon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 some towards the north, as that in the entering in of Hamath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Joshua is told this, and he made the people acquainted with it,

 1. That they might be the more affected with God's goodness to them in
 giving them this good land, and might thereby be engaged to love and 
 serve him; for, if this which they had was too little, God would 
 moreover <I>give them such and such things,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:8">2 Sam. xii. 8</A>.

 2. That they might not be tempted to make any league, or contract any
 dangerous familiarity with these their neighbours so as to learn their 
 way, but might rather be jealous of them, as a people that kept them 
 from their right and that they had just cause of quarrel with. 

 3. That they might keep themselves in a posture for war, and not think
 of putting off the harness so long as there remained any land to be 
 possessed. Nor must we lay aside our spiritual armour, nor be off our 
 watch, till our victory be completed in the kingdom of glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He promises that he would make the Israelites masters of all those 
 countries that were yet unsubdued, though Joshua was old and not able 
 to do it, old and not likely to live to see it done. Whatever becomes 
 of us, and however we may be laid aside as despised broken vessels, God 
 will do his own work in his own time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>I will drive them out.</I> The original is emphatic: "<I>It is I
 that will do it,</I> I that can do it when thou are dead and gone, and 
 will do it if Israel be not wanting to themselves." "I will do it by my 
 Word," so the Chaldee here, as in many other places, "by the eternal 
 Word, the captain of the hosts of the Lord." This promise that he would 
 drive them out from before the children of Israel plainly supposes it 
 as the condition of the promise that the children of Israel must 
 themselves attempt their extirpation, must go up against them, else 
 they could not be said to be driven out before them; if afterwards 
 Israel, through sloth, or cowardice, or affection to these idolaters, 
 sit still and let them alone, they must blame themselves, and not God, 
 if they be not driven out. We must work out our salvation, and then God 
 will work in us and work with us; we must resist our spiritual enemies, 
 and then God will tread them under our feet; we must go forth to our 
 Christian work and warfare, and then God will go forth before us.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the
 nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,
 &nbsp; 8 With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their
 inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward,
 <I>even</I> as Moses the servant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> gave them;
 &nbsp; 9 From Aroer, that <I>is</I> upon the bank of the river Arnon, and
 the city that <I>is</I> in the midst of the river, and all the plain
 of Medeba unto Dibon;
 &nbsp; 10 And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which
 reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;
 &nbsp; 11 And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and
 Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;
 &nbsp; 12 All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth
 and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for
 these did Moses smite, and cast them out.
 &nbsp; 13 Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the
 Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the
 Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.
 &nbsp; 14 Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the
 sacrifices of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel made by fire <I>are</I> their
 inheritance, as he said unto them.
 &nbsp; 15 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben
 <I>inheritance</I> according to their families.
 &nbsp; 16 And their coast was from Aroer, that <I>is</I> on the bank of the
 river Arnon, and the city that <I>is</I> in the midst of the river,
 and all the plain by Medeba;
 &nbsp; 17 Heshbon, and all her cities that <I>are</I> in the plain; Dibon,
 and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,
 &nbsp; 18 And Jahazah, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
 &nbsp; 19 And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of
 the valley,
 &nbsp; 20 And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,
 &nbsp; 21 And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of
 Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses
 smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and
 Hur, and Reba, <I>which were</I> dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the
 country.
 &nbsp; 22 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the
 children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain
 by them.
 &nbsp; 23 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the
 border <I>thereof.</I> This <I>was</I> the inheritance of the children of
 Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.
 &nbsp; 24 And Moses gave <I>inheritance</I> unto the tribe of Gad, <I>even</I>
 unto the children of Gad according to their families.
 &nbsp; 25 And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and
 half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that <I>is</I>
 before Rabbah;
 &nbsp; 26 And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from
 Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;
 &nbsp; 27 And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth,
 and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon,
 Jordan and <I>his</I> border, <I>even</I> unto the edge of the sea of
 Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.
 &nbsp; 28 This <I>is</I> the inheritance of the children of Gad after their
 families, the cities, and their villages.
 &nbsp; 29 And Moses gave <I>inheritance</I> unto the half tribe of
 Manasseh: and <I>this</I> was <I>the possession</I> of the half tribe of
 the children of Manasseh by their families.
 &nbsp; 30 And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the
 kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which
 <I>are</I> in Bashan, threescore cities:
 &nbsp; 31 And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the
 kingdom of Og in Bashan, <I>were pertaining</I> unto the children of
 Machir the son of Manasseh, <I>even</I> to the one half of the
 children of Machir by their families.
 &nbsp; 32 These <I>are the countries</I> which Moses did distribute for
 inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by
 Jericho, eastward.
 &nbsp; 33 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not <I>any</I> inheritance:
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel <I>was</I> their inheritance, as he said unto
 them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. Orders given to Joshua to assign to each tribe its portion of this
 land, including that which was yet unsubdued, which must be brought 
 into the lot, in a believing confidence that it should be conquered 
 when Israel was multiplied so as to have occasion for it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Now divide this land.</I> Joshua thought all must be conquered
 before any must be divided. "No," said, God, "there is as much 
 conquered as will serve your turn for the present; divide this, and 
 make your best of it, and wait for the remainder hereafter." Note, We 
 must take the comfort of what we have, though we cannot compass all we 
 would have.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The land must be divided among the several tribes, and they must not 
 always live in common, as now they did. Which way soever a just 
 property is acquired, it is the will of that God who has given the 
 earth to the children of men that there should be such a thing, and 
 that every man should know his own, and not invade that which is 
 another's. The world must be governed, not by force, but right, by the 
 law of equity, not of arms.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That it must be divided for an inheritance, though they got it by 
 conquest. 

 (1.) The promise of it came to them as an inheritance from their
 fathers; the land of promise pertained to the children of promise, who 
 were thus beloved for their fathers' sakes, and in performance of the 
 covenant with them.

 (2.) The possession of it was to be transmitted by them, as an 
 inheritance to their children.  Frequently, what is got by force is 
 soon lost again; but Israel, having an incontestable title to this land 
 by the divine grant, might see it hereby secured as an inheritance to 
 their seed after them, and that God kept this mercy for thousands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That Joshua must not divide it by his own will. Though he was a very 
 wise, just, and good man, it must not be left to him to give what he 
 pleased to each tribe; but he must do it by lot, which referred the 
 matter wholly to God, and to his determination, for he it is that 
 appoints the bounds of our habitation, and every man's judgment must 
 proceed from him. But Joshua must preside in this affair, must manage 
 this solemn appeal to Providence, and see that the lot was drawn fairly 
 and without fraud, and that every tribe did acquiesce in it. The lot 
 indeed <I>causeth contention to cease,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:18">Prov. xviii. 18</A>.

 But, if upon this lot any controversy should arise, Joshua by his
 wisdom and authority must determine it, and prevent any ill 
 consequences of it.  Joshua must have the honour of dividing the land,

 (1.) Because he had undergone the fatigue of conquering it: and when, 
 through his hand, each tribe received its allotment, they would thereby 
 be made the more sensible of their obligations to him. And what a 
 pleasure must it needs be to a man of such a public spirit as Joshua 
 was to see the people that were so dear to him eating of the labour of 
 his hands!

 (2.) That he might be herein a type of Christ, who has not only 
 conquered for us the gates of hell, but has opened to us the gates of 
 heaven, and, having purchased the eternal inheritance for all 
 believers, will in due time put them all in possession of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An account is here given of the distribution of the land on the 
 other side Jordan among the Reubenites, and Gadites, and half the tribe 
 of Manasseh.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How this account is introduced. It comes in, 

 (1.) As the reason why this land within Jordan must be divided only to 
 the nine tribes and a half, because the other two and a half were 
 already provided for.

 (2.) As a pattern to Joshua in the work he had now to do. He had seen 
 Moses distribute that land, which would give him some aid in 
 distributing this, and thence he might take his measure; only this was 
 to be done by lot, but it should seem Moses did that himself, according 
 to the wisdom given unto him.

 (3.) As an inducement to Joshua to hasten the dividing of this land,
 that the nine tribes and a half might not be kept any longer than was 
 necessary out of their possession, since their brethren of the two 
 tribes and a half were so well settled in theirs; and God their common 
 Father would not have such a difference made between his children.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The particulars of this account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Here is a general description of the country that was given to the 
 two tribes and a half, <I>which Moses gave them, even as Moses gave 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The repetition implies a ratification of the grant by Joshua. Moses
 settled this matter, and, as Moses settled it, so shall it rest; Joshua 
 will not, under any pretence whatsoever, go about to alter it. And a 
 reason is intimated why he would not, because Moses was the servant of 
 the Lord, and acted in this matter by secret direction from him and was 
 faithful as a servant. Here we have,

 [1.] The fixing of the boundaries of this country, by which they were
 divided from the neighbouring nations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:9-12"><I>v.</I> 9</A>,

 &c. Israel must know their own and keep to
 it, and may not, under pretence of their being God's peculiar people, 
 encroach upon their neighbours, and invade their rights and properties, 
 to which they had a good and firm title by providence, though not, as 
 Israel, a title by promise. 

 [2.] An exception of one part of this country from Israel's possession,
 though it was in their grant, namely, the Geshurites and the 
 Maachathites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 They had not leisure to reduce all the remote and obscure corners of
 the country in Moses's time, and afterwards they had no mind to it, 
 being easy with what they had. Thus those who are not straitened in 
 God's promises are yet straitened in their own faith, and prayers, and 
 endeavours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) A very particular account of the inheritances of these two tribes 
 and a half, how they were separated from each other, and what cites, 
 with the towns, villages, and fields, commonly known and reputed to be 
 appurtenances to them, belonged to each tribe. This is very fully and 
 exactly set down in order that posterity might, in reading this 
 history, be the more affected with the goodness of God to their 
 ancestors, when they found what a large and fruitful country, and what 
 abundance of great and famous cities, he put them in possession of 
 (God's grants look best when we descend to the particulars); and also 
 that the limits of every tribe being punctually set down in this 
 authentic record disputes might be prevented, and such contests between 
 the tribes as commonly happen where boundaries have not been adjusted 
 nor this matter brought to a certainty. And we have reason to think 
 that the register here prescribed and published of the lot of each 
 tribe was of great use to Israel in after-ages, was often appealed to, 
 and always acquiesced in, for the determining of <I>meum</I> and 
 <I>tuum</I>--<I>mine</I> and <I>thine.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] We have here the lot of the tribe of Reuben, Jacob's first-born, 
 who, though he had lost the dignity and power which pertained to the 
 birthright, yet, it seems, had the advantage of being first served. 
 Perhaps those of that tribe had an eye to this in desiring to be seated 
 on that side Jordan, that, since they could not expect the benefit of 
 the best lot, they might have the credit of the first. Observe, 
 <I>First,</I> In the account of the lot of this tribe mention is made 
 of the slaughter, 

 1.  Of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who reigned in this country, and
 might have kept it and his life if he would have been neighbourly, and 
 have suffered Israel to pass through his territories, but, by 
 attempting to oppose them, justly brought ruin upon himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:21-25">Num. xxi. 21</A>,

 &c. 

 2. Of the princes of Midian, who were slain afterwards in another war

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:8">Num. xxxi. 8</A>),

 and yet are here called <I>dukes of Sihon,</I> and are said to be
 <I>smitten with him,</I> because they were either tributaries to him, 
 or, in his opposition to Israel, confederates with him, and hearty in 
 his interests, and his fall made way for theirs not long after. 

 3. Of Balaam particularly, that would, if he could, have cursed Israel,
 and was soon after recompensed <I>according to the wickedness of his 
 endeavour</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:4">Ps. xxviii. 4</A>),

 for he fell with those that set him on. This was recorded before

 and is here repeated, because the defeating of Balaam's purpose to
 curse Israel was the turning of that curse into a blessing, and was 
 such an instance of the power and goodness of God as was fit to be had 
 in everlasting remembrance. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:5">Mic. vi. 5</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Within the lot of this tribe was that Mount Pisgah
 from the top of which Moses took his view of the earthly Canaan and his 
 flight to the heavenly. And not far off thence Elijah was when he was 
 fetched up to heaven in a chariot of fire. The separation of this tribe 
 from the rest, by the river Jordan, was that which Deborah lamented; 
 and the preference they gave to their private interests above the 
 public was what she censured,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:15,16">Judg. v. 15, 16</A>.

 In this tribe lay Heshbon and Sibmah, famed for their fruitful fields
 and vineyards. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+16:8,9,Jer+47:32">Isa. xvi. 8, 9; Jer. xlvii. 32</A>.

 This tribe, with that of Gad, was sorely shaken by Hazael king of Syria

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:33">2 Kings x. 33</A>),

 and afterwards dislodged and carried into captivity, twenty years
 before the general captivity of the ten tribes by the king of Assyria,

 [2.] The lot of the tribe of Gad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:24-28"><I>v.</I> 24-28</A>.

 This lay north of Reuben's lot; the country of Gilead lay in this
 tribe, so famous for its balm that it is thought strange indeed if 
 there be no balm in Gilead, and the cities of Jabesh-Gilead and 
 Ramoth-Gilead which we often read of in scripture. Succoth and Penuel, 
 which we read of in the story of Gideon, were in this tribe; and that 
 forest which is called the <I>wood of Ephraim</I> (from the slaughter 
 Jephthah made there of the Ephraimites), in which Absalom's rebellious 
 army was beaten, while his father David lay at Mahanaim, one of the 
 frontier-cities of this tribe,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Sharon, famous for roses, was in this tribe. And within the limits of
 this tribe lived those Gadarenes that loved their swine better than 
 their Saviour, fitter to be called <I>Girgashites</I> than 
 <I>Israelites.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] The lot of the half-tribe of Manasseh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:29-31"><I>v.</I> 29-31</A>.

 Bashan, the kingdom of Og, was in this allotment, famous for the best
 timber, witness the oaks of Bashan--and the best breed of cattle, 
 witness the bulls and rams of Bashan. This tribe lay north of Gad, 
 reached to Mount Hermon, and had in it part of Gilead. Mispeh was in 
 this half-tribe, and Jephthah was one of its ornaments; so was Elijah, 
 for in this tribe was Thisbe, whence he is called the Tishbite; and 
 Jair was another. In the edge of the tribe stood Chorazin, honoured 
 with Christ's wondrous works, but ruined by his righteous woe for not 
 improving them.</P>

 [4.] Twice in this chapter it is taken notice of that to the tribe of 
 Levi <I>Moses gave no inheritance</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:14,33"><I>v.</I> 14, 33</A>),

 for so God had appointed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+18:20">Num. xviii. 20</A>.

 If they had been appointed to a lot entire by themselves, Moses would
 have served them first, not because it was his own tribe, but because 
 it was God's; but they must be provided for in another manner; their 
 habitations must be scattered in all the tribes, and their maintenance 
 brought out of all the tribes, and God himself was the portion both of 
 their inheritance and of their cup,
