 Solomon's trading, which we read of in the close of the foregoing 
 chapter, and the encouragement he gave both to merchandise and 
 manufacturers, were very commendable. But building was the work he was 
 designed for, and to that business he is here applying himself. Here 
 is, 

 I. Solomon's determination to build the temple and a royal palace, and
 his appointing labourers to be employed herein, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:1,2,17,18">ver. 1, 2, 17, 18</A>.
 
 II. His request to Huram king of Tyre to furnish him both with artists
 and materials, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:3-10">ver. 3-10</A>.

 III. Huram's obliging answer to, and compliance with, his request, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:11-16">ver. 11-16</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And Solomon determined to build a house for the name of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and a house for his kingdom.
 &nbsp; 2  And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear
 burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three
 thousand and six hundred to oversee them.
 &nbsp; 3  And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou
 didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to
 build him a house to dwell therein, <I>even so deal with me.</I>
 &nbsp; 4  Behold, I build a house to the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God, to
 dedicate <I>it</I> to him, <I>and</I> to burn before him sweet incense, and
 for the continual showbread, and for the burnt offerings morning
 and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the
 solemn feasts of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God. This <I>is an ordinance</I> for
 ever to Israel.
 &nbsp; 5  And the house which I build <I>is</I> great: for great <I>is</I> our
 God above all gods.
 &nbsp; 6  But who is able to build him a house, seeing the heaven and
 heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who <I>am</I> I then, that I
 should build him a house, save only to burn sacrifice before
 him?
 &nbsp; 7  Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in
 silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson,
 and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that
 <I>are</I> with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did
 provide.
 &nbsp; 8  Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of
 Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in
 Lebanon; and, behold, my servants <I>shall be</I> with thy servants,
 &nbsp; 9  Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I
 am about to build <I>shall be</I> wonderful great.
 &nbsp; 10  And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that
 cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty
 thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine,
 and twenty thousand baths of oil.

 Solomon's wisdom was given him, not merely for speculation, to 
 entertain himself (though it is indeed a princely entertainment), nor 
 merely for conversation, to entertain his friends, but for action; and 
 therefore to action he immediately applies himself. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His resolution within himself concerning his business 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>He determined to build,</I> in the first place, a <I>house for the
 name of the Lord.</I> It is fit that he who is the first should be 
 served--first a temple and then a palace, a house not so much for 
 himself, or his own convenience and magnitude, as for the kingdom, for 
 the honour of it among its neighbours and for the decent reception of 
 the people whenever they had occasion to apply to their prince; so that 
 in both he aimed at the public good. Those are the wisest men that lay 
 out themselves most for the honour of the name of the Lord and the 
 welfare of communities. We are not born for ourselves, but for God and 
 our country.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His embassy to Huram, king of Tyre, to engage his assistance in the 
 prosecution of his designs. The purport of his errand to him is much 
 the same here as we had it 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:2-6">1 Kings v. 2</A>,

 &c., only here it is more largely
 set forth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The reasons why he makes this application to Huram are here more 
 fully represented, for information to Huram as well as for inducement. 
 
 (1.) He pleads his father's interest in Huram, and the kindness he had
 received from him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>As thou didst deal with David, so deal with me.</I> As we must show
 kindness to, so we may expect kindness from, our fathers' friends, and 
 with them should cultivate a correspondence.

 (2.) He represents his design in building the temple: he intended it
 for a place of religious worship

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that all the offerings which God had appointed for the honour of his
 name might be offered up there. The house was built that it might be 
 dedicated to God and used in his service. This we should aim at in all 
 our business, that our havings and doings may be all to the glory of 
 God. He mentions various particular services that were there to be 
 performed, for the instruction of Huram. The mysteries of the true 
 religion, unlike those of the Gentile superstition, coveted not 
 concealment.

 (3.) He endeavors to inspire Huram with very great and high thoughts of
 the God of Israel, by expressing the mighty veneration he had for his 
 holy name: <I>Great is our God above all gods,</I> above all idols, 
 above all princes. Idols are nothing, princes are little, and both 
 under the control of the God of Israel; and therefore, 

 [1.] "The house must be great; not in proportion to the greatness of 
 that God to whom it is to be dedicated (for between finite and infinite 
 there can be no proportion), but in some proportion to the great value 
 and esteem we have for this God."

 [2.] "Yet, be it ever so great, it cannot be a habitation for the great 
 God. Let not Huram think that the God of Israel, like the gods of the 
 nations, <I>dwells in temples made with hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:24">Acts xvii. 24</A>.

 No, the <I>heaven of heavens cannot contain him.</I> It is intended
 only for the convenience of his priests and worshippers, that they may 
 have a fit place wherein to burn sacrifice before him."

 [3.] He looked upon himself, though a mighty prince, as unworthy the 
 honour of being employed in this great work: <I>Who am I that I should 
 build him a house?</I> It becomes us to go about every work for God 
 with a due sense of our utter insufficiency for it and our incapacity 
 to do any thing adequate to the divine perfections. It is part of the 
 wisdom wherein we ought to walk towards those that are without 
 carefully to guard against all misapprehension which any thing we say 
 or do may occasion concerning God; so Solomon does here in his treaty 
 with Huram.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The requests he makes to him are more particularly set down here. 
 
 (1.) He desired Huram would furnish him with a good hand to work
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Send me a man.</I> He had <I>cunning men</I> with him in Jerusalem
 and Judah, whom David provided,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:15">1 Chron. xxii. 15</A>.

 Let them not think but that Jews had some among them that were artists.
 But "<I>send me a man</I> to direct them. There are ingenious men in 
 Jerusalem, but not such engravers as are in Tyre; and therefore, since 
 temple-work must be the best in its kind, let me have the best workmen 
 that can be got." 
 
 (2.) With good materials to work on
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 cedar and other timber in abundance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>);

 for the house must be <I>wonderfully great,</I> that is, very stately
 and magnificent, no cost must be spared, nor any contrivance wanting in 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Here is Solomon's engagement to maintain the workmen 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 to give them so much wheat and barley, so much wine and oil. He did not
 feed his workmen with bread and water, but with plenty, and every thing 
 of the best. Those that employ labourers ought to take care they be not 
 only well paid, but well provided for with sufficient of that which is 
 wholesome and fit for them. Let the rich masters do for their poor 
 workmen as they would be done by if the tables were turned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he
 sent to Solomon, Because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath loved his people, he hath
 made thee king over them.
 &nbsp; 12  Huram said moreover, Blessed <I>be</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel,
 that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a
 wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might
 build a house for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and a house for his kingdom.
 &nbsp; 13  And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with
 understanding, of Huram my father's,
 &nbsp; 14  The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father
 <I>was</I> a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in
 brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and
 in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of
 graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him,
 with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David
 thy father.
 &nbsp; 15  Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the
 wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his
 servants:
 &nbsp; 16  And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt
 need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and
 thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 17  And Solomon numbered all the strangers that <I>were</I> in the
 land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father
 had numbered them; and they were found a hundred and fifty
 thousand and three thousand and six hundred.
 &nbsp; 18  And he set threescore and ten thousand of them <I>to be</I>
 bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand <I>to be</I> hewers in the
 mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the
 people a work.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. The return which Huram made to Solomon's embassy, in which he shows
 a great respect for Solomon and a readiness to serve him. Meaner people 
 may learn of these great ones to be neighbourly and complaisant.

 1. He congratulates Israel on having such a king as Solomon was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Because the Lord loved his people, he has made thee king.</I> Note,
 A wise and good government is a great blessing to a people, and may 
 well be accounted a singular token of God's favour.  He does not say, 
 <I>Because he loved</I> thee (though that was true,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:24">2 Sam. xii. 24</A>)

 <I>he made thee king,</I> but because he <I>loved his people.</I>
 Princes must look upon themselves as preferred for the public good, not 
 for their own personal satisfaction, and should rule so as to prove 
 that they were given in love and not in anger. 

 2. He blesses God for raising up such a successor to David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It should seem that Huram was not only very well affected to the Jewish
 nation, and well pleased with their prosperity, but that he was 
 proselyted to the Jewish religion, and worshipped Jehovah, <I>the God 
 of Israel</I> (who was now known by that name to the neighbouring 
 nations), as <I>the God that made heaven and earth,</I> and as the 
 fountain of power as well as being; for he sets up kings. Now that the 
 people of Israel kept close to the law and worship of God, and so 
 preserved their honour, the neighbouring nations were as willing to be 
 instructed by them in the true religion as Israel had been, in the days 
 of their apostasy, to be infected with the idolatries and superstitions 
 of their neighbours.  This made them high, that they lent to many 
 nations and did not borrow, lent truth to them, and did not borrow 
 error from them; as when they did the contrary it was their shame. 

 3.  He sent him a very ingenious curious workman, that would not fail
 to answer his expectations in every thing, one that had both Jewish and 
 Gentile blood meeting in him; for his mother was an Israelite (Huram 
 though she was of the tribe of Dan, and therefore says so here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>,

 but it seems she was of the tribe of Naphtali,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+7:14">1 Kings vii. 14</A>),

 but his father was a Tyrian--a good omen of uniting Jew and Gentile in
 the gospel temple, as it was afterwards when the building of the second 
 temple was greatly furthered by Darius 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:1-12">Ezra vi.</A>),

 who is supposed to have been the son of Esther--an Israelite by the
 mother's side. 

 4. He engaged for the timber, as much as he would have occasion for,
 and undertook to deliver it at Joppa, and withal signified his 
 dependence upon Solomon for the maintenance of the workmen as he had 
 promised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:15,16"><I>v.</I>  15, 16</A>.

 This agreement we had,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:8,9">1 Kings v. 8, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The orders which Solomon gave about the workmen. He would not 
 employ the free-born Israelites in the drudgery work of the temple 
 itself, not so much as to be overseers of it. In this he employed the 
 strangers who were proselyted to the Jewish religion, who had not lands 
 of inheritance in Canaan as the Israelites had, and therefore applied 
 to trades, and got their living by their ingenuity and industry. There 
 were, at this time, vast numbers of them in the land 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 who, if they were of any of the devoted nations, perhaps fell within
 the case, and therefore fell under the law, of the Gibeonites, to be 
 hewers of wood for the congregation: if not, yet being in many respects 
 well provided for by the law of Moses, and put upon an equal footing 
 with the native Israelites, they were bound in gratitude to do what
 they could for the service of the temple. Yet, no doubt, they were well 
 paid in money or money's worth: the law was, <I>Thou shalt not oppress 
 a stranger.</I> The distribution of them we have here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>,
 
 and again

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 in all 150,000. Canaan was a fruitful land, that found meat for so many
 mouths more than the numerous natives; and the temple was a vast 
 building, that found work for so many bands. Mr. Fuller suggests that 
 the expedient peculiar to this structure, of framing all beforehand, 
 must needs increase the work. I think it rather left so much the more 
 room for this vast multitude of hands to be employed in it; for in the 
 forest of Lebanon they might all be at work together, without crowding 
 one another, which they could not have been upon Mount Sion. And, if 
 there had not been such vast numbers employed, so large and curious a 
 fabric, which was begun and ended in seven years, might, for aught I 
 know, have been as long in building as St. Paul's.</P>
