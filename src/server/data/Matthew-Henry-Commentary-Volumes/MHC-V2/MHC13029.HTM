 David has said what he had to say to Solomon. But he had something more 
 to say to the congregation before he parted with them. 

 I. He pressed them to contribute, according to their ability, towards
 the building and furnishing of the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. They made their presents accordingly with great generosity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.

 III. David offered up solemn prayers and praises to God upon that
 occasion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:10-20">ver. 10-20</A>),

 with sacrifices,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:21,22">ver. 21, 22</A>.

 IV. Solomon was hereupon enthroned, with great joy and magnificence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:23-25">ver. 23-25</A>.

 V.  David, soon after this finished his course, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:26-30">ver. 26-30</A>.

 And it is hard to say which shines brighter here, the setting sun or 
 the rising sun.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation,
 Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, <I>is yet</I> young and
 tender, and the work <I>is</I> great: for the palace <I>is</I> not for man,
 but for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God.
 &nbsp; 2  Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God
 the gold for <I>things to be made</I> of gold, and the silver for
 <I>things</I> of silver, and the brass for <I>things</I> of brass, the iron
 for <I>things</I> of iron, and wood for <I>things</I> of wood; onyx stones,
 and <I>stones</I> to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours,
 and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in
 abundance.
 &nbsp; 3  Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my
 God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, <I>which</I>
 I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I
 have prepared for the holy house,
 &nbsp; 4  <I>Even</I> three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir,
 and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the
 walls of the houses <I>withal:</I>
 &nbsp; 5  The gold for <I>things</I> of gold, and the silver for <I>things</I> of
 silver, and for all manner of work <I>to be made</I> by the hands of
 artificers. And who <I>then</I> is willing to consecrate his service
 this day unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>?
 &nbsp; 6  Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of
 Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the
 rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,
 &nbsp; 7  And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five
 thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten
 thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one
 hundred thousand talents of iron.
 &nbsp; 8  And they with whom <I>precious</I> stones were found gave <I>them</I>
 to the treasure of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, by the hand of Jehiel
 the Gershonite.
 &nbsp; 9  Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,
 because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How handsomely David spoke to the great men of Israel, to engage 
 them to contribute towards the building of the temple. It is our duty 
 to <I>provoke one another to love and to good works,</I> not only to do 
 good ourselves, but to draw in others to do good too as much as we can. 
 There were many very rich men in Israel; they were all to share in the 
 benefit of the temple, and of those peaceable days which were to 
 befriend the building of it; and therefore, though David would not 
 impose on them, as a tax, what they should give towards it, he would 
 recommend the present as a fair occasion for a free-will offering, 
 because what is done in works of piety and charity should be done 
 willingly and not by constraint; for God loves a cheerful giver. 

 1. He would have them consider that Solomon was young and tender, and
 needed help; but that he was the person whom God had chosen to do this 
 work, and therefore was well worthy their assistance. It is good 
 service to encourage those in the work of God that are as yet young and 
 tender. 

 2.  That the world was great, and all hands should contribute to the
 carrying of it on. The palace to be built was not for man, but for the 
 Lord God; and the more was contributed towards the building the more 
 magnificent it would be, and therefore the better would it answer the 
 intention. 

 3. He tells them what great preparations had been made for this work.
 He did not intend to throw all the burden upon them, nor that it should 
 be built wholly by contributions, but that they should show their good 
 will, by adding to what was done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I have prepared with all my might,</I> that is, "I have made it my
 business." Work for God must be done with all our might, or we shall 
 bring nothing to pass in it.

 4. He sets them a good example.  Besides what was dedicated to this
 service out of the spoils and presents of the neighbouring nations, 
 which was for the building of the house (of which before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:14"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 14</A>),

 he had, out of his own share, offered largely for the beautifying and
 enriching of it, 3000 talents of gold and 7000 talents of silver 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>),

 and this because he had set his affection on the house of his God.  He
 gave all this, not as Papists build churches, in commutation of 
 penance, or to make atonement for sin, nor as Pharisees give alms, to 
 be seen of men; but purely because he loved the habitation of God's 
 house; so he professed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:8">Ps. xxvi. 8</A>)

 and here he proved it. Those who set their affection upon the service
 of God will think no pains nor cost too much to bestow upon it; and 
 then our offerings are pleasing to God when they come from love. Those 
 that set their affection on things above will set their affection on 
 the house of God, through which our way to heaven lies. Now this he 
 gives them an account of, to stir them up to do likewise. Note, Those 
 who would draw others to do that which is good must themselves lead. 
 Those especially who are advanced above others in place and dignity 
 should particularly contrive how to make their light shine before men, 
 because the influence of their example is more powerful and extensive 
 than that of other people.

 5. He stirs them up to do as he had done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>And who then is willing to concentrate his service this day unto the
 Lord?</I>

 (1.) We must each of us, in our several places, serve the Lord, and
 consecrate our service to him, separate it from other things that are 
 foreign and interfere with it, and direct and design it for the honour 
 and glory of God. 

 (2.) We must make the service of God our business, must <I>fill our
 hands to the Lord,</I> so the Hebrew phrase is. Those who engage 
 themselves in the service of God will have their hands full; there is 
 work enough for the whole man in that service. The filling of our hands 
 with the service of God intimates that we must serve him only, serve 
 him liberally, and serve him in the strength of grace derived from him.  
 
 (3.) We must be free herein, do it willingly and speedily, do it this
 day, when we are in a good mind. <I>Who is willing?</I> Now let him 
 show it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How handsomely they all contributed towards the building of the 
 temple when they were thus stirred up to it. Though they were persuaded 
 to it, yet it is said, <I>They offered willingly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 So he said who knew their hearts. Nay, they offered <I>with a perfect
 heart,</I> from a good principle and with a sincere respect to the 
 glory of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 How generous they were appears by the sum total of the contributions,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:7"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 They gave like themselves, like princes, like princes of Israel. And a
 pleasant day's work it was; for,

 1. <I>The people rejoiced,</I> which may be meant of the people
 themselves that offered: they were glad of the opportunity of honouring 
 God thus with their substance, and glad of the prospect of bringing 
 this good work to perfection. Or the common people rejoiced in the 
 generosity of their princes, that they had such rulers over them as 
 were forward to this good work. Every Israelite is glad to see temple 
 work carried on with vigour. 

 2. <I>David rejoiced with great joy</I> to see the good effects of his
 psalms and the other helps of devotion he had furnished them with, 
 rejoiced that his son and successor would have those about him that 
 were so well affected to the house of God, and that this work, upon 
 which his heart was so much set, was likely to go on. Note, It is a 
 great reviving to good men, when they are leaving the world, to see 
 those they leave behind zealous for religion and likely to keep it up.  
 <I>Lord, now let thou thy servant depart in peace.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Wherefore David blessed the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> before all the
 congregation: and David said, Blessed <I>be</I> thou, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of
 Israel our father, for ever and ever.
 &nbsp; 11  Thine, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>is</I> the greatness, and the power, and the
 glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all <I>that is</I> in the
 heaven and in the earth <I>is thine;</I> thine <I>is</I> the kingdom, O
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and thou art exalted as head above all.
 &nbsp; 12  Both riches and honour <I>come</I> of thee, and thou reignest
 over all; and in thine hand <I>is</I> power and might; and in thine
 hand <I>it is</I> to make great, and to give strength unto all.
 &nbsp; 13  Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy
 glorious name.
 &nbsp; 14  But who <I>am</I> I, and what <I>is</I> my people, that we should be
 able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things <I>come</I>
 of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.
 &nbsp; 15  For we <I>are</I> strangers before thee, and sojourners, as
 <I>were</I> all our fathers: our days on the earth <I>are</I> as a shadow,
 and <I>there is</I> none abiding.
 &nbsp; 16  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God, all this store that we have prepared to
 build thee a house for thine holy name <I>cometh</I> of thine hand,
 and <I>is</I> all thine own.
 &nbsp; 17  I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast
 pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine
 heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I
 seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer
 willingly unto thee.
 &nbsp; 18  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers,
 keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the
 heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:
 &nbsp; 19  And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy
 commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all
 <I>these things,</I> and to build the palace, <I>for</I> the which I have
 made provision.
 &nbsp; 20  And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 your God. And all the congregation blessed the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of their
 fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 the king.
 &nbsp; 21  And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and offered
 burnt offerings unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, on the morrow after that day,
 <I>even</I> a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, <I>and</I> a thousand
 lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance
 for all Israel:
 &nbsp; 22  And did eat and drink before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> on that day with great
 gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second
 time, and anointed <I>him</I> unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>to be</I> the chief
 governor, and Zadok <I>to be</I> priest.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The solemn address which David made to God upon occasion of the 
 noble subscriptions of the princes towards the building of the temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Wherefore David blessed the Lord,</I> not only alone in his closet,
 but <I>before all the congregation.</I> This I expected when we read

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 that <I>David rejoiced with great joy;</I> for such a devout man as he
 would no doubt make that the matter of his thanksgiving which was so 
 much the matter of his rejoicing. He that looked round with comfort 
 would certainly look up with praise. David was now old and looked upon 
 himself as near his end; and it well becomes aged saints, and dying 
 saints, to have their hearts much enlarged in praise and thanksgiving. 
 This will silence their complaints of their bodily infirmities, and 
 help to make the prospect of death itself less gloomy. David's psalms, 
 toward the latter end of the book, are most of them psalms of praise. 
 The nearer we come to the world of everlasting praise the more we 
 should speak the language and do the work of that world. In this 
 address,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He adores God, and ascribes glory to him as the God of Israel, 
 <I>blessed for ever and ever.</I> Our Lord's prayer ends with a 
 doxology much like this which David here begins with--<I>for thine is
 the kingdom, the power, and the glory.</I> This is properly praising 
 God--with holy awe and reverence, and agreeable affection,
 acknowledging, 

 (1.) His infinite perfections; not only that he is great, powerful,
 glorious, &c., but that his is the greatness, power, and glory, that 
 is, he has them in and of himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He is the fountain and centre of every thing that is bright and
 blessed. All that we can, in our most exalted praises, attribute to him 
 he has an unquestionable title to. His is the <I>greatness;</I> his 
 greatness is immense and incomprehensible; and all others are little, 
 are nothing, in comparison of him. His is the <I>power,</I> and it is 
 almighty and irresistible; power belongs to him, and all the power of 
 all the creatures is derived from him and depends upon him. His is the 
 <I>glory;</I> for his glory is his own end and the end of the whole 
 creation. All the glory we can give him with our hearts, lips, and 
 lives, comes infinitely short of what is his due. His is the 
 <I>victory;</I> he transcends and surpasses all, and is able to conquer 
 and subdue all things to himself; and his victories are incontestable 
 and uncontrollable. And his is the <I>majesty,</I> real and personal; 
 with him is terrible majesty, inexpressible and inconceivable. 

 (2.) His sovereign dominion, as rightful owner and possessor of all:
 "<I>All that is in the heaven, and in the earth, is thine,</I> and at 
 thy disposal, by the indisputable right of creation, and as supreme 
 ruler and commander of all: <I>thine is the kingdom,</I> and all kings 
 are thy subjects; for thou art head, and art to be exalted and 
 worshipped as head above all." 

 (3.) His universal influence and agency.  All that are rich and
 honourable among the children of men have their riches and honours from 
 God. This acknowledgment he would have the princes take notice of and 
 join in, that they might not think they had merited any thing of God by 
 their generosity; for from God they had their riches and honour, and 
 what they had returned to him was but a small part of what they had 
 received from him. Whoever are great among men, it is God's hand that 
 makes them so; and, whatever strength we have, it is God that gives it 
 to us, as the <I>God of Israel our father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:10,Ps+68:35"><I>v.</I> 10. Ps. lxviii. 35</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He acknowledges with thankfulness the grace of God enabling them to 
 contribute so cheerfully towards the building of the temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>):

 <I>Now therefore, our God, we thank thee.</I> Note, The more we do for
 God the more we are indebted to him for the honour of being employed in 
 his service, and for grace enabling us, in any measure, to serve him. 
 <I>Does he</I> therefore <I>thank that servant?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:9">Luke xvii. 9</A>.

 No: but that servant has a great deal of reason to thank him. He thanks
 God that they were <I>able to offer so willingly.</I> Note, 

 (1.) It is a great instance of the power of God's grace in us to be
 able to do the work of God willingly. He works <I>both to will and to 
 do;</I> and it is in the day of his power that his people are made 
 willing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.

 (2.) We must give God all the glory of all the good that is at any time
 done by ourselves or others. Our own good works must not be the matter 
 of our pride, nor the good works of others the matter of our flattery, 
 but both the matter of our praise; for certainly it is the greatest 
 honour and pleasure in the world faithfully to serve God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He speaks very humbly of himself, and his people, and the offerings 
 they had now presented to God. 

 (1.) For himself, and those that joined with him, though they were
 princes, he wondered that God should take such notice of them and do so 
 much for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Who am I, and what is my people?</I> David was the most honourable
 person, and Israel the most honourable person, then in the world; yet 
 thus does he speak of himself and them, as unworthy the divine 
 cognizance and favour.  David now looks very great, presiding in an 
 august assembly, appointing his successor, and making a noble present 
 to the honour of God; and yet he is little and low in his own eyes: 
 <I>Who am I, O Lord?</I> for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 <I>we are strangers before thee, and sojourners,</I> poor despicable
 creatures. Angels in heaven are at home there; saints on earth are but 
 strangers here: <I>Our days on the earth are as a shadow.</I> David's 
 days had as much of substance in them as most men's; for he was a great 
 man, a good man, a useful man, and now an old man, one that lived long 
 and lived to good purpose: and yet he puts himself not only into the 
 number, but in the front, of those who must acknowledge that their 
 <I>days on the earth are as a shadow,</I> which intimates that our life 
 is a vain life, a dark life, a transient life, and a life that will 
 have its periods either in perfect light or perfect darkness. The next 
 words explain it: <I>There is no abiding,</I> Heb. <I>no 
 expectation.</I> We cannot expect any great matters from it, nor can we 
 expect any long continuance of it. This is mentioned here as that which 
 forbids us to boast of the service we do to God. Alas! it is confined 
 to a scantling of time, it is the service of a frail and short life, 
 and therefore what can we pretend to merit by it?

 (2.) As to their offerings, <I>Lord,</I> says he, <I>of thy own have we
 given thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 
 and again
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 <I>It cometh of thy hand, and is all thy own.</I> "We have it from thee
 as a free gift, and therefore are bound to use it for thee; and what we 
 present to thee is but rent or interest from thy own." "In like manner" 
 (says bishop Patrick) "we ought to acknowledge God in all spiritual 
 things, referring every good thought, good purpose, good work, to his 
 grace, from whom we receive it." <I>Let him that glories</I> therefore 
 <I>glory in the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He appeals to God concerning his own sincerity in what he did, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 It is a great satisfaction to a good man to think that God <I>tries the
 heart</I> and <I>has pleasure in uprightness,</I> that, whoever may 
 misinterpret or contemn it, he is acquainted with and approves of the 
 <I>way of the righteous.</I> It was David's comfort that God knew with 
 what pleasure he both offered his own and saw the people's offering. He 
 was neither proud of his own good work nor envious of the good works of 
 others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He prays to God both for the people and for Solomon, that both might 
 hold on as they began. In this prayer he addresses God as <I>the God of 
 Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</I> a God in covenant with them and with us 
 for their sakes. Lord, give us grace to make good our part of the 
 covenant, that we may not forfeit the benefit of it. Or thus: they were 
 kept in their integrity by the grace of God establishing their way; let 
 the same grace that was sufficient for them be so for us. 

 (1.) For the people he prays 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 that what good God had put into their minds he would always keep there,
 that they might never be worse than they were now, might never lose the 
 convictions they were now under, nor cool in their affections to the 
 house of God, but always have the same thoughts of things as they now 
 seemed to have. Great consequences depend upon what is innermost, and 
 what uppermost, in the imagination of the thoughts of our heart, what 
 we aim at and what we love to think of. If any good have got possession 
 of our hearts, or the hearts of our friends, it is good by prayer to 
 commit the custody of it to the grace of God: "Lord, keep it there, 
 keep it for ever there.  David has prepared materials for the temple; 
 but, Lord, do thou prepare their hearts for such a privilege;" 
 <I>establish</I> their hearts, so the <I>margin.</I> "Confirm their 
 resolutions. They are in a good mind; keep them so when I am gone, them 
 and theirs for ever."

 (2.) For Solomon he prays 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 <I>Give him a perfect heart.</I> He had charged him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:9"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 9</A>)

 to serve God <I>with a perfect heart;</I> now here he prays to God to
 give him such a heart. He does not pray, "Lord, make him a rich man, a 
 great man, a learned man;" but, "Lord, make him an honest man;" for 
 that is better than all.  "Lord, <I>give him a perfect heart,</I> not 
 only in general <I>to keep thy commandments,</I> but in particular 
 <I>to build the palace,</I> that he may do that service with a single 
 eye." Yet his building the house would not prove him to have a perfect 
 heart unless he made conscience of keeping God's commandments. It is 
 not helping to build churches that will save us if we live in 
 disobedience to God's law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The cheerful concurrence of this great assembly in this great 
 solemnity. 

 1. They joined with David in the adoration of God. When he had done his
 prayer he called to them to testify their concurrence (<I>Now bless the 
 Lord your God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 which accordingly they did, by <I>bowing down their heads,</I> a
 gesture of adoration. Whoever is the mouth of the congregation, those 
 only have the benefit who join with him, not by <I>bowing down the 
 head</I> so much as by <I>lifting up the soul.</I>

 2.  They paid their respects to the king, looking upon him as an
 instrument in God's hand of much good to them; and, in honouring him, 
 they honoured God. 

 3. The next day they offered abundance of sacrifices to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),
 
 both burnt-offerings, which were wholly consumed, and peace-offerings,
 which the offerer had the greatest part of to himself.  Hereby they 
 testified a generous gratitude to God for the good posture their public 
 affairs were in, though David was going the way of all the earth. 

 4.  They feasted and rejoiced before God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 In token of their joy in God, and communion with him, they feasted upon
 their peace-offerings in a religious manner before the Lord. What had 
 been offered to God they feasted upon, by which was intimated to them 
 that they should be never the poorer for their late liberal 
 contributions to the service of the temple; they themselves should 
 feast upon the comfort of it. 

 5. They made Solomon king the second time. He having been before
 anointed in haste, upon occasion of Adonijah's rebellion, it was 
 thought fit to repeat the ceremony, for the greater satisfaction of the 
 people. They <I>anointed him to the Lord.</I> Magistrates must look 
 upon themselves as set apart for God, to be his ministers, and must 
 rule accordingly in the fear of God.  Zadok also was anointed to be 
 priest in the room of Abiathar, who had lately forfeited his honour.  
 Happy art thou, O Israel! under such a prince and such a pontiff.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  Then Solomon sat on the throne of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> as king instead
 of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
 &nbsp; 24  And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons
 likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the
 king.
 &nbsp; 25  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of
 all Israel, and bestowed upon him <I>such</I> royal majesty as had not
 been on any king before him in Israel.
 &nbsp; 26  Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
 &nbsp; 27  And the time that he reigned over Israel <I>was</I> forty years;
 seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three <I>years</I>
 reigned he in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 28  And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and
 honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
 &nbsp; 29  Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they
 <I>are</I> written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of
 Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,
 &nbsp; 30  With all his reign and his might, and the times that went
 over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the
 countries.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses bring king Solomon to his throne and king David to his 
 grave. Thus the rising generation thrusts out that which went before, 
 and says, "Make room for us." Every one has his day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is Solomon rising 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord.</I> Not his throne which he
 prepared in the heavens, but the throne of Israel is called <I>the 
 throne of the Lord</I> because not only is he King of all nations, and 
 all kings rule under him, but he was in a peculiar manner King of 
 Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:12">1 Sam. xii. 12</A>.

 He had the founding, he had the filling, of their throne, by immediate
 direction.  The municipal laws of their kingdom were divine. Urim and 
 prophets were the privy counsellors of their princes; therefore is 
 their throne called <I>the throne of the Lord.</I> Solomon's kingdom 
 typified the kingdom of the Messiah, and his is indeed <I>the throne of 
 the Lord;</I> for the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all 
 judgment to him; hence he calls him <I>his King,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6">Ps. ii. 6</A>.

 Being set on the <I>throne of the Lord,</I> the throne to which God
 called him, he prospered. Those that follow the divine guidance may 
 expect success by the divine blessing. Solomon prospered; for,

 1. His people paid honour to him, as one to whom honour is due: <I>All
 Israel obeyed him,</I> that is, were ready to swear allegiance to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 the <I>princes and mighty men,</I> and even <I>the sons of David,</I>
 though by seniority their title to the crown was prior to his, and they 
 might think themselves wronged by his advancement. God thought fit to 
 make him king, and made him fit to be so, and therefore they all 
 <I>submitted themselves to him.</I> God inclined their hearts to do so, 
 that his reign might, from the first, be peaceable. His father was a 
 better man than he, and yet came to the crown with much difficulty, 
 after long delay, and by many and slow steps. David had more faith, and 
 therefore had it more tried. <I>They submitted themselves</I> (Heb.  
 <I>They gave the hand under Solomon</I>), that is, bound themselves by 
 oath to be true to him (putting the hand under the thigh was a ceremony 
 anciently used in swearing); or they were so entirely devoted that they 
 would put their hand under his feet to serve him.

 2. God put honour upon him; for those that honour him he will honour:
 <I>The Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 His very countenance and presence, I am apt to think, had something in
 them very great and awful. All he said and all he did commanded 
 respect. None of all the judges or kings of Israel, his predecessors, 
 made such a figure as he did nor lived in such splendour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is David's setting, that great man going off the stage. The 
 historian here brings him to the end of his day, leaves him asleep, and 
 draws the curtains about him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He gives a summary account of the years of his reign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 He reigned forty years, as did Moses, Othniel, Deborah, Gideon, Eli,
 Samuel, and Saul, who were before him, and Solomon after him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He gives a short account of his death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 that he died <I>full of days, riches, and honour;</I> that is,

 (1.) Loaded with them. He was very old, and very rich, and very much
 honoured both of God and man. He had been a man of war from his youth, 
 and, as such, had his soul continually in his hand; yet he was not cut 
 off in the midst of his days, but was preserved through all dangers of 
 a military life, lived to a good old age, and died in peace, died in 
 his bed, and yet in the bed of honour.  

 (2.) Satiated with them. He was <I>full of days, riches, and
 honour;</I> that is, he had enough of this world and of the riches and 
 honours of it, and knew when he had enough, for he was very willing to 
 die and leave it, having said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:15">Ps. xlix. 15</A>),

 <I>God shall receive me,</I> and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:4">Ps. xxiii. 4</A>),

 <I>Thou art with me.</I> A good man will soon be full of days, riches,
 and honour, but will never be satisfied with them; no satisfaction but 
 in God's loving kindness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. For a fuller account of David's life and reign he refers to the 
 histories or records of those times, which were written by Samuel while 
 he lived, and continued, after his death, by Nathan and Gad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.
 
 <I>There</I> was related what was observable in his government at home
 and his wars abroad, <I>the times,</I> that is, the events of <I>the 
 times, that went over him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>.

 These registers were then in being, but are now lost. Note, Good use
 may be made of those histories of the church which are authentic though 
 not sacred or of divine inspiration.</P>
