 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter gives us a more full account of the reign of Rehoboam than 
 we had before in Kings and it is a very melancholy account. Methinks we
 are in the book of Judges again; for, 

 I. Rehoboam and his people did evil in the sight of the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:1">ver. 1</A>.
 
 II. God thereupon sold them into the hands of Shishak, king of Egypt,
 who greatly oppressed them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>.

 III. God sent a prophet to them, to expound to them the judgment and to
 call them to repentance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:5">ver. 5</A>.

 IV. They thereupon humbled themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:6">ver. 6</A>.

 V. God, upon their repentance, turned from his anger

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:7,12">ver. 7, 12</A>)

 and yet left them under the marks of his displeasure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 Lastly, Here is a general character of Rehoboam and his reign, with the
 conclusion of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the
 kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and all Israel with him.
 &nbsp; 2  And it came to pass, <I>that</I> in the fifth year of king
 Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because
 they had transgressed against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 &nbsp; 3  With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand
 horsemen: and the people <I>were</I> without number that came with him
 out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
 &nbsp; 4  And he took the fenced cities which <I>pertained</I> to Judah, and
 came to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 5  Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and <I>to</I> the
 princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem
 because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Ye
 have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand
 of Shishak.
 &nbsp; 6  Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled
 themselves; and they said, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> righteous.
 &nbsp; 7  And when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> saw that they humbled themselves, the word
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled
 themselves; <I>therefore</I> I will not destroy them, but I will grant
 them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon
 Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
 &nbsp; 8  Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know
 my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
 &nbsp; 9  So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took
 away the treasures of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the treasures of
 the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields
 of gold which Solomon had made.
 &nbsp; 10  Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and
 committed <I>them</I> to the hands of the chief of the guard, that
 kept the entrance of the king's house.
 &nbsp; 11  And when the king entered into the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the
 guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the
 guard chamber.
 &nbsp; 12  And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> turned
 from him, that he would not destroy <I>him</I> altogether: and also in
 Judah things went well.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Israel was very much disgraced and weakened by being divided into two 
 kingdoms; yet the kingdom of Judah, having both the temple and the 
 royal city, both the house of David and the house of Aaron, might have 
 done very well if they had continued in the way of their duty; but here 
 we have all out of order there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Rehoboam and his people left God: He <I>forsook the law of the 
 Lord,</I> and so in effect forsook God, and <I>all Israel with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He had his happy triennium, when he walked in the way of David and
 Solomon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:17"><I>ch.</I> xi. 17</A>),

 but it expired, and he grew remiss in the worship of God; in what
 instances we are not told, but he fell off, and Judah with him, here 
 called <I>Israel,</I> because they walked in the evil ways into which 
 Jeroboam had drawn the kingdom of Israel. Thus he did <I>when he had 
 established the kingdom and strengthened himself.</I> As long as he 
 thought his throne tottered he kept to his duty, that he might make God 
 his friend; but, when he found it stood pretty firmly, he thought he 
 had no more occasion for religion; he was safe enough without it. Thus 
 <I>the prosperity of fools destroys them.  Jeshurun waxed fat and 
 kicked.</I> When men prosper, and are in no apprehension of troubles, 
 they are ready to say to God, <I>Depart from us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God quickly brought troubles upon them, to awaken them, and recover 
 them to repentance, before their hearts were hardened. It was but in 
 the fourth year of Rehoboam that they began to corrupt themselves, and 
 in the fifth year the king of Egypt came up against them with a vast 
 army, took <I>the fenced cities of Judah, and came against 
 Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:2,3,4"><I>v.</I> 2, 3, 4</A>.

 This great calamity coming upon them so soon after they began to desert
 the worship of God, by a hand they had little reason to suspect (having 
 had a great deal of friendly correspondence with Egypt in the last 
 reign), and coming with so much violence that all the <I>fenced cities 
 of Judah,</I> which Rehoboam had lately fortified and garrisoned and on 
 which he relied much for the safety of his kingdom, fell immediately 
 into the hands of the enemy, without making any resistance, plainly 
 showed that it was from the Lord, because they had transgressed against 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Lest they should not readily or not rightly understand the meaning 
 of this providence, God by the word explains the rod, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 When the princes of Judah had all met at Jerusalem, probably in a great
 council of war, to concert measures for their own safety in this 
 critical juncture, he sent a prophet to them, the same that had brought 
 them an injunction from God not to fight against the ten tribes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:2"><I>ch.</I> xi. 2</A>),
 
 Shemaiah by name; he told them plainly that the reason why Shishak
 prevailed against them was not because they had been impolitic in the 
 management of their affairs (which perhaps the princes in this congress 
 were at this time scrutinizing), but because they had forsaken God. God 
 never leaves any till they first leave him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The rebukes both of the word and of the rod being thus joined, the 
 king and princes humbled themselves before God for their iniquity, 
 penitently acknowledged the sin, and patiently accepted the punishment 
 of it, saying, <I>The Lord is righteous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 "We have none to blame but ourselves; let God be clear when he
 judgeth." Thus it becomes us, when we are under the rebukes of 
 Providence, to justify God and judge ourselves. Even kings and princes 
 must either bend or break before God, either be humbled or be 
 ruined.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Upon the profession they made of repentance God showed them some
 favour, saved them from ruin, and yet left them under some remaining 
 fears of the judgment, to prevent their revolt again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God, in mercy, prevented the destruction they were now upon the 
 brink of. Such a vast and now victorious army as Shishak had, having 
 made themselves masters of all the fenced cities, what could be 
 expected but that the whole country, and even Jerusalem itself, would 
 in a little time be theirs? But when God saith, <I>Here shall the proud 
 waves be stayed,</I> the most threatening force strangely dwindles and 
 becomes impotent. Here again the destroying angel, when he comes to 
 Jerusalem, is forbidden to destroy it: "<I>My wrath shall not be poured 
 out upon Jerusalem;</I> not at this time, not by this hand, not utterly 
 to destroy it," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:7,12"><I>v.</I> 7, 12</A>.

 Note, Those that acknowledge God righteous in afflicting them shall
 find him gracious. Those that humble themselves before him shall find 
 favour with him. So ready is the God of mercy to take the first 
 occasion to show mercy. If we have humbled hearts under humbling 
 providences, the affliction has done its work, and it shall either be 
 removed or the property of it altered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He granted them some deliverance, not complete, but in part; he gave 
 them some advantages against the enemy, so that they recruited a 
 little; he <I>gave them deliverance for a little while,</I> so some. 
 They reformed but partially, and for a little while, soon relapsing 
 again; and, as their reformation was, so was their deliverance. Yet it 
 is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <I>in Judah things went well,</I> and began to look with a better face.

 (1.) In respect of piety. <I>There were good things in Judah</I> (so it
 is in the margin), good ministers, good people, good families, who were 
 made better by the calamities of their country.  Note, In times of 
 great corruption and degeneracy it is some comfort if there be a 
 remnant among whom good things ar found; this is a ground of hope in 
 Israel.

 (2.) In respect of prosperity. In Judah things went ill when all the
 fenced cities were taken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 but when they repented the posture of their affairs altered, and things
 went well. Note, If things do not go so well as we could wish, yet we 
 have reason to take notice of it with thankfulness if they go better 
 than was to have been expected, better than formerly, and better than 
 we deserved. We should own God's goodness if he do but grant us some 
 deliverance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Yet he left them to smart sorely by the hand of Shishak, both in 
 their liberty and in their wealth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In their liberty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>They shall be his servants</I> (that is, they shall lie much at his
 mercy and be put under contribution by him, and some of them perhaps be 
 taken prisoners and held in captivity by him), <I>that they may know my 
 service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.</I> They 
 complained, it may be, of the strictness of their religion, and 
 <I>forsook the law of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 because they thought it a yoke to hard, too heavy, upon them.  "Well,"
 saith God, "let them better themselves if they can; let the 
 neighbouring princes rule them awhile, since they are not willing that 
 I should rule them, and let them try how they like that. They might 
 have <I>served God with joyfulness and gladness of heart,</I> and would 
 not; let them <I>serve their enemies then in hunger and thirst</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:47,48">Deut. xxviii. 47, 48</A>),

 till they think of returning to <I>their first Master, for then it was
 better with them,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:7">Hos. ii. 7</A>.
 
 This, some think, is the meaning of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:24,25">Ezek. xx. 24, 25</A>.

 <I>Because they despised my statutes, I gave them statutes that were
 not good.</I> Note, 

 [1.] The more God's service is compared with other services the more
 reasonable and easy it will appear. 

 [2.] Whatever difficulties or hardships we may imagine there are in the
 way of obedience, it is better a thousand times to go through them than 
 to expose ourselves to the punishment of disobedience. Are the laws of 
 temperance thought hard? The effects of intemperance will be much 
 harder. The service of virtue is perfect liberty; the service of lust 
 is perfect slavery.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In their wealth. The king of Egypt plundered both the temple and 
 the exchequer, the treasuries of both which Solomon left very full; but 
 he <I>took them away;</I> yea, he <I>took all,</I> all he could lay his 
 hands on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 This was what he came for. David and Solomon, who walked in the way of
 God, filled the treasuries, one by war and the other by merchandise; 
 but Rehoboam, who forsook the law of God, emptied them. The taking away 
 of the golden shields, and the substituting of brazen ones in their 
 place

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>),
 
 we had an account of before,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:25-28">1 Kings xiv. 25-28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and
 reigned: for Rehoboam <I>was</I> one and forty years old when he began
 to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city
 which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put
 his name there. And his mother's name <I>was</I> Naamah an Ammonitess.
 &nbsp; 14  And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15  Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, <I>are</I> they not
 written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer
 concerning genealogies? And <I>there were</I> wars between Rehoboam
 and Jeroboam continually.
 &nbsp; 16  And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
 city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The story of Rehoboam's reign is here concluded, much as the story of
 the other reigns concludes. Two things especially are observable
 here:--

 1. That he was at length pretty well <I>fixed in his kingdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 His fenced cities in Judah did not answer his expectation, so he now
 <I>strengthened himself in Jerusalem,</I> which he made it his business 
 to fortify, and there he reigned seventeen years, in <I>the city which 
 the Lord had chosen to put his name there.</I> This intimates his 
 honour and privilege, that he had his royal seat in the holy city, 
 which yet was but an aggravation of his impiety--near the temple, but 
 far from God. Frequent skirmishes there were between his subjects and 
 Jeroboam's, such as amounted to <I>continual wars,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 but he held his own, and reigned, and, as it should seem, did not so
 grossly <I>forsake the law of God</I> as he had done

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 in his fourth year. 

 2. That he was never rightly fixed in his religion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He never quite cast off God; and yet in this he did evil, that he
 <I>prepared not, he engaged not, his heart to seek the Lord.</I> See 
 what the fault is laid upon.

 (1.) He did not serve the Lord because he did not seek the Lord. He did
 not pray, as Solomon did, for wisdom and grace. If we prayed better, we 
 should be every way better. Or he did not consult the word of God, did 
 not seek to that as his oracle, nor take directions from it.

 (2.) He made nothing of his religion because he did not set his heart
 to it, never minded it with any closeness of application, and never any 
 hearty disposition to it, nor ever came up to a steady resolution in 
 it. What little goodness he had was transient and passed away like the 
 morning cloud. He did evil because he was never determined for that 
 which is good. Those are easily drawn by Satan to any evil who are 
 wavering and inconstant in that which is good and are never persuaded 
 to make religion their business.</P>
