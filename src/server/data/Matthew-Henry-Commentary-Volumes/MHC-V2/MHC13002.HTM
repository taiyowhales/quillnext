 We have now come to what was principally intended, the register of the 
 children of Israel, that distinguished people, that were to "dwell 
 alone, and not be reckoned among the nations." Here we have, 

 I. The names of the twelve sons of Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. An account of the tribe of Judah, which has the precedency, not so
 much for the sake of David as for the sake of the Son of David, our 
 Lord, who sprang out of Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:14">Heb. vii. 14</A>.

 1. The first descendants from Judah, down to Jesse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:3-12">ver. 3-12</A>.

 2. The children of Jesse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:13-17">ver. 13-17</A>.

 3.  The posterity of Hezron, not only through Ram, from whom David
 came, but through Caleb 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>),

 Segub

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:21-24">ver. 21-24</A>),

 Jerahmeel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:25-33">v. 25-33</A>,

 and so to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:34-41">v. 41</A>),

 and more by Caleb 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:42-49">ver. 42-49</A>),

 with the family of Caleb the son of Hur, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:50-55">ver. 50-55</A>.

 The best exposition we can have of this and the following chapters, and
 which will give the clearest view of them, is found in those 
 genealogical tables which were published with some of the first 
 impressions of the last English Bible about 100 years ago, and 
 continued for some time; and it is a pity but they were revived in some 
 of our later editions, for they are of great use to those who 
 diligently search the scriptures. They are said to be drawn up by that 
 great master in scripture-learning, Mr. Hugh Broughton. We meet with 
 them sometimes in old Bibles.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  These <I>are</I> the sons of Israel; Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and
 Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun,
 &nbsp; 2  Dan, Joseph, and Benjamin, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
 &nbsp; 3  The sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah: <I>which</I> three
 were born unto him of the daughter of Shua the Canaanitess. And
 Er, the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 and he slew him.
 &nbsp; 4  And Tamar his daughter in law bare him Pharez and Zerah. All
 the sons of Judah <I>were</I> five.
 &nbsp; 5  The sons of Pharez; Hezron, and Hamul.
 &nbsp; 6  And the sons of Zerah; Zimri, and Ethan, and Heman, and
 Calcol, and Dara: five of them in all.
 &nbsp; 7  And the sons of Carmi; Achar, the troubler of Israel, who
 transgressed in the thing accursed.
 &nbsp; 8  And the sons of Ethan; Azariah.
 &nbsp; 9  The sons also of Hezron, that were born unto him; Jerahmeel,
 and Ram, and Chelubai.
 &nbsp; 10  And Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon, prince
 of the children of Judah;
 &nbsp; 11  And Nahshon begat Salma, and Salma begat Boaz,

 &nbsp; 13  And Jesse begat his firstborn Eliab, and Abinadab the
 second, and Shimma the third,
 &nbsp; 14  Nethaneel the fourth, Raddai the fifth,
 &nbsp; 15  Ozem the sixth, David the seventh:
 &nbsp; 16  Whose sisters <I>were</I> Zeruiah, and Abigail. And the sons of
 Zeruiah; Abishai, and Joab, and Asahel, three.
 &nbsp; 17  And Abigail bare Amasa: and the father of Amasa <I>was</I> Jether
 the Ishmeelite.

 Here is, 

 I. The family of Jacob. His twelve sons are here named, that 
 illustrious number so often celebrated almost throughout the whole 
 Bible, from the first to the last book of it. At every turn we meet 
 with the twelve tribes that descended from these twelve patriarchs. The 
 personal character of several of them was none of the best (the first 
 four were much blemished), and yet the covenant was entailed on their 
 seed; for it was of grace, free grace, that it was said, <I>Jacob have 
 I loved--not of works, lest any man should boast.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The family of Judah. That tribe was most praised, most increased, 
 and most dignified, of any of the tribes, and therefore the genealogy 
 of it is the first and largest of them all. In the account here given 
 of the first branches of that illustrious tree, of which Christ was to 
 be the top branch, we meet, 

 1. With some that were very bad. Here is Er, Judah's eldest son, that
 was <I>evil in the sight of the Lord,</I> and was cut off, in the 
 beginning of his days, by a stroke of divine vengeance: The <I>Lord 
 slew him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 His next brother, Onan, was no better, and fared no better. Here is
 Tamar, with whom Judah, her father-in-law, committed incest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 And here is Achan, called <I>Achar--a troubler,</I> that troubled
 Israel by taking of the accursed thing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Note, The best and most honourable families may have those belonging to
 them that are blemishes.

 2. With some that were very wise and good, as Heman and Ethan, Calcol
 and Dara, who were not perhaps the immediate sons of Zerah, but 
 descendants from him, and are named because they were the glory of 
 their father's house; for, when the Holy Ghost would magnify the wisdom 
 of Solomon, he declares him wiser than these four men, who, though the 
 sons of Mahol, are called Ezrahites, from Zerah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:31">1 Kings iv. 31</A>.

 That four brothers should be eminent for wisdom and grace was a rare
 thing. 

 3. With some that were very great, as Nahshon, who was prince of the
 tribe of Judah when the camp of Israel was formed in the wilderness, 
 and so led the van in that glorious march, and Salman, or Salmon, who 
 was in that post of honour when they entered into Canaan,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The family of Jesse, of which a particularly account is kept for 
 the sake of David, and the Son of David, who is <I>a rod out of the 
 stem of Jesse,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:1">Isa. xi. 1</A>.

 Hence it appears that David was a seventh son, and that his three great
 commanders, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel, were the sons of one of his 
 sisters, and Amasa of another. Three of the four went down slain to the 
 pit, though they were the terror of the mighty.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  And Caleb the son of Hezron begat <I>children</I> of Azubah <I>his</I>
 wife, and of Jerioth: her sons <I>are</I> these; Jesher, and Shobab,
 and Ardon.
 &nbsp; 19  And when Azubah was dead, Caleb took unto him Ephrath, which
 bare him Hur.
 &nbsp; 20  And Hur begat Uri, and Uri begat Bezaleel.
 &nbsp; 21  And afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir the
 father of Gilead, whom he married when he <I>was</I> threescore years
 old; and she bare him Segub.
 &nbsp; 22  And Segub begat Jair, who had three and twenty cities in the
 land of Gilead.
 &nbsp; 23  And he took Geshur, and Aram, with the towns of Jair, from
 them, with Kenath, and the towns thereof, <I>even</I> threescore
 cities. All these <I>belonged to</I> the sons of Machir the father of
 Gilead.
 &nbsp; 24  And after that Hezron was dead in Calebephratah, then Abiah
 Hezron's wife bare him Ashur the father of Tekoa.
 &nbsp; 25  And the sons of Jerahmeel the firstborn of Hezron were, Ram
 the firstborn, and Bunah, and Oren, and Ozem, <I>and</I> Ahijah.
 &nbsp; 26  Jerahmeel had also another wife, whose name <I>was</I> Atarah;
 she <I>was</I> the mother of Onam.
 &nbsp; 27  And the sons of Ram the firstborn of Jerahmeel were, Maaz,
 and Jamin, and Eker.
 &nbsp; 28  And the sons of Onam were, Shammai, and Jada. And the sons
 of Shammai; Nadab, and Abishur.
 &nbsp; 29  And the name of the wife of Abishur <I>was</I> Abihail, and she
 bare him Ahban, and Molid.
 &nbsp; 30  And the sons of Nadab; Seled, and Appaim: but Seled died
 without children.
 &nbsp; 31  And the sons of Appaim; Ishi. And the sons of Ishi; Sheshan.
 And the children of Sheshan; Ahlai.
 &nbsp; 32  And the sons of Jada the brother of Shammai; Jether, and
 Jonathan: and Jether died without children.
 &nbsp; 33  And the sons of Jonathan; Peleth, and Zaza. These were the
 sons of Jerahmeel.
 &nbsp; 34  Now Sheshan had no sons, but daughters. And Sheshan had a
 servant, an Egyptian, whose name <I>was</I> Jarha.
 &nbsp; 35  And Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his servant to wife;
 and she bare him Attai.
 &nbsp; 36  And Attai begat Nathan, and Nathan begat Zabad,
 &nbsp; 37  And Zabad begat Ephlal, and Ephlal begat Obed,
 &nbsp; 38  And Obed begat Jehu, and Jehu begat Azariah,
 &nbsp; 39  And Azariah begat Helez, and Helez begat Eleasah,
 &nbsp; 40  And Eleasah begat Sisamai, and Sisamai begat Shallum,
 &nbsp; 41  And Shallum begat Jekamiah, and Jekamiah begat Elishama.
 &nbsp; 42  Now the sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel <I>were,</I> Mesha
 his firstborn, which was the father of Ziph; and the sons of
 Mareshah the father of Hebron.
 &nbsp; 43  And the sons of Hebron; Korah, and Tappuah, and Rekem, and
 Shema.
 &nbsp; 44  And Shema begat Raham, the father of Jorkoam: and Rekem
 begat Shammai.
 &nbsp; 45  And the son of Shammai <I>was</I> Maon: and Maon <I>was</I> the father
 of Bethzur.
 &nbsp; 46  And Ephah, Caleb's concubine, bare Haran, and Moza, and
 Gazez: and Haran begat Gazez.
 &nbsp; 47  And the sons of Jahdai; Regem, and Jotham, and Geshan, and
 Pelet, and Ephah, and Shaaph.
 &nbsp; 48  Maachah, Caleb's concubine, bare Sheber, and Tirhanah.
 &nbsp; 49  She bare also Shaaph the father of Madmannah, Sheva the
 father of Machbenah, and the father of Gibea: and the daughter of
 Caleb <I>was</I> Achsah.
 &nbsp; 50  These were the sons of Caleb the son of Hur, the firstborn
 of Ephratah; Shobal the father of Kirjath-jearim,
 &nbsp; 51  Salma the father of Bethlehem, Hareph the father of
 Bethgader.
 &nbsp; 52  And Shobal the father of Kirjath-jearim had sons; Haroeh,
 <I>and</I> half of the Manahethites.
 &nbsp; 53  And the families of Kirjath-jearim; the Ithrites, and the
 Puhites, and the Shumathites, and the Mishraites; of them came
 the Zareathites, and the Eshtaulites.
 &nbsp; 54  The sons of Salma; Bethlehem, and the Netophathites,
 Ataroth, the house of Joab, and half of the Manahethites, the
 Zorites.
 &nbsp; 55  And the families of the scribes which dwelt at Jabez; the
 Tirathites, the Shimeathites, <I>and</I> Suchathites. These <I>are</I> the
 Kenites that came of Hemath, the father of the house of Rechab.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The persons mentioned in the former paragraph are most of them such as 
 we read of, and most of them such as we read much of, in other 
 scriptures; but very few of those to whom this paragraph relates are 
 mentioned any where else. It should seem, the tribe of Judah were more 
 full and exact in their genealogies than any other of the tribes, in 
 which we must acknowledge a special providence, for the clearing of the 
 genealogy of Christ. 

 1. Here we find Bezaleel, who was head-workman in building the
 tabernacle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+31:2">Exod. xxxi. 2</A>.

 2. Hezron, who was the son of Pharez 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 was the father of all this progeny, his sons, Caleb and Jerahmeel,
 being very fruitful, and he himself likewise, even in his old age, for 
 he left his wife pregnant when he died, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 This Hezron was one of the seventy that went down with Jacob into
 Egypt,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:12">Gen. xlvi. 12</A>.

 There his family thus increased, as other oppressed families there did.
 We cannot but suppose that he died during the Israelites' bondage in 
 Egypt; and yet it is here said he died in Caleb-Ephratah (that is, 
 Bethlehem), in the land of Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Perhaps, though the body of the people continued in Egypt, yet some
 that were more active than the rest, at least before their bondage came 
 to be extreme, visited Canaan sometimes and got footing there, though 
 afterwards they lost it. The achievements of Jair, here mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>),

 we had an account of in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:41">Num. xxxii. 41</A>;

 and, it is supposed, they were long after the conquest of Canaan. The
 Jews say, Hezron married his third wife when he was sixty years old

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 and another afterwards

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 because he had a great desire of posterity in the family of Pharez,
 from whom the Messiah was to descend. 

 3. Here is mention of one that <I>died without children</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),
 
 and another
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:32"><I>v.</I>  32</A>),

 and of one that <I>had no sons, but daughters,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Let those that are in any of these ways afflicted not think their case
 new or singular.  Providence orders these affairs of families by an 
 incontestable sovereignty, as pleaseth him, giving children, or 
 withholding them, or giving all of one sex. He is not bound to please 
 us, but we are bound to acquiesce in his good pleasure. To those that 
 love him he will himself be better than ten sons, and give them in his 
 house a place and a name better than of sons and daughters. Let not 
 those therefore that are written childless envy the families that are 
 built up and replenished. Shall our eye be evil because God's is good?  
 
 4. Here is mention of one who had an only daughter, and married her to
 his servant an Egyptian, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>.

 If it be mentioned to his praise, we must suppose that this Egyptian
 was proselyted to the Jewish religion and that he was very eminent for 
 wisdom and virtue, otherwise it would not have become a true-born 
 Israelite to match a daughter to him, especially an only daughter. If 
 Egyptians become converts, and servants do worthily, neither their 
 parentage nor their servitude should be a bar to their preferment. Such 
 a one this Egyptian servant might be that she who married him might 
 live as happily with him as if she had married one of the rulers of her 
 tribe.

 5. The pedigree of several of these terminates, not in a person, but in
 a place or country, as one is said to be <I>the father of 
 Kirjath-jearim</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>),
 
 another of Bethlehem
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),

 which was afterwards David's city, because these places fell to their
 lot in the division of the land. 

 6. Here are some that are said to be <I>families of scribes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:55"><I>v.</I> 55</A>),

 such as kept up learning in their family, especially
 scripture-learning, and taught the people the good knowledge of God.  
 Among all these great families we are glad to find some that were 
 <I>families of scribes. Would to God that all the Lord's people were 
 prophets</I>--all the families of Israel families of scribes, well 
 instructed to the kingdom of heaven, and able to bring out of their 
 treasury things new and old!</P>
