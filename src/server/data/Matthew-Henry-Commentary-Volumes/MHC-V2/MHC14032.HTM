 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  After these things, and the establishment thereof,
 Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and
 encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for
 himself.
 &nbsp; 2  And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he
 was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
 &nbsp; 3  He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop
 the waters of the fountains which <I>were</I> without the city: and
 they did help him.
 &nbsp; 4  So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all
 the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the
 land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much
 water?
 &nbsp; 5  Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that
 was broken, and raised <I>it</I> up to the towers, and another wall
 without, and repaired Millo <I>in</I> the city of David, and made
 darts and shields in abundance.
 &nbsp; 6  And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
 together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake
 comfortably to them, saying,
 &nbsp; 7  Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the
 king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that <I>is</I> with him:
 for <I>there be</I> more with us than with him:
 &nbsp; 8  With him <I>is</I> an arm of flesh; but with us <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our
 God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested
 themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The formidable design of Sennacherib against Hezekiah's kingdom, and 
 the vigorous attempt he made upon it. This Sennacherib was now, as 
 Nebuchadnezzar was afterwards, the terror and scourge and great 
 oppressor of that part of the world. He aimed to raise a boundless 
 monarchy for himself upon the ruins of all his neighbours. His 
 predecessor Shalmaneser had lately made himself master of the kingdom 
 of Israel, and carried the ten tribes captives. Sennacherib thought, in 
 like manner, to win Judah for himself. Pride and ambition put men upon 
 grasping at universal dominion. It is observable that, just about this 
 time, Rome, a city which afterwards came to reign more than any other 
 had done <I>over the kings of the earth,</I> was built by Romulus.  
 Sennacherib invaded Judah immediately after the reformation of it and 
 the re-establishment of religion in it: <I>After these things he 
 entered into Judah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 1. It was well ordered by the divine Providence that he did not give
 them this disturbance before the reformation was finished and 
 established, as it might then have put a stop to it. 

 2. Perhaps he intended to chastise Hezekiah for destroying that
 idolatry to which he himself was devoted. He looked upon Hezekiah as 
 profane in what he had done, and as having thrown himself out of the 
 divine protection. He accordingly considered him as one who might 
 easily be made a prey of.  

 3. God ordered it at this time that he might have an opportunity of
 showing himself strong on the behalf of this returning reforming 
 people. He brought this trouble upon them that he might have the 
 honour, and might put on them the honour, of their deliverance.  
 <I>After these things, and the establishment thereof,</I> one would 
 have expected to hear of nothing but perfect peace, and that none durst 
 meddle with a people thus qualified for the divine favour; yet the next 
 news we hear is that a threatening destroying army enters the country, 
 and is ready to lay all waste. We may be in the way of our duty and yet 
 meet with trouble and danger. God orders it so for the trial of our 
 confidence in him and the manifestation of his care concerning us. The 
 little opposition which Sennacherib met with in entering Judah induced 
 him to imagine that all was his own. He thought to <I>win all the 
 fenced cities</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and purposed to <I>fight against Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:7,13">2 Kings xviii. 7, 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The preparation which Hezekiah prudently made against this storm 
 that threatened him: <I>He took counsel with his princes</I> what he 
 should do, what measures he should take, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 With their advice he provided,

 1. That the country should give him a cold reception, for he took care
 that he should find no water in it (and then his army must perish for 
 thirst), or at least that there should be a scarcity of water, by which 
 his army would be weakened and unfitted for service. A powerful army, 
 if it want water but a few days, will be but a heap of dry dust. All 
 hands were set immediately to work to <I>stop up the fountains,</I> and 
 <I>the brook that ran through the midst of the land,</I> turning that 
 (it is probable) into the city by pipes under-ground. Such as this is 
 the policy commonly practised now-a-days of destroying the forage 
 before an invading army. 

 2. That the city should give him a warm reception. In order to this he
 repaired the wall, raised towers, and made darts (or, as it is in the 
 margin, <I>swords</I> or <I>weapons</I>) and shields in abundance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and appointed captains, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Note, Those that trust God with their safety must yet use proper means
 for their safety, otherwise they tempt him, and do not trust him. 
 <I>God will provide,</I> but so must we also.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The encouragement which he gave to his people to depend upon God 
 in this distress. He gathered them together in a broad open street, and 
 <I>spoke comfortably to them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He was himself undaunted, being confident the invasion would issue
 well. He was not like his father, who had much guilt to terrify him and 
 no faith to encourage him, so that, in a time of public danger, <I>his 
 heart was moved, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind,</I> 
 and then no marvel that <I>the heart of his people was so too,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:2">Isa. vii. 2</A>.

 With what he said he put life into his people, his captains especially,
 and <I>spoke to their heart,</I> as the word is.

 1. He endeavoured to keep down their fears: "<I>Be strong and
 courageous;</I> do not think of surrendering the city or capitulating, 
 but resolve to hold it out to the last man; do not think of losing the 
 city, nor of falling into the enemy's hand; there is no danger. Let the 
 soldiers be bold and brave, make good their posts, stand to their arms, 
 and fight manfully, and let the citizens encourage them to do so: <I>Be 
 not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria.</I>" The prophet had 
 thus encouraged them from God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:24">Isa. x. 24</A>):

 <I>Be not afraid of the Assyrians;</I> and here the king from him. Now
 it was that <I>the sinners in Zion were afraid</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:14">Isa. xxxiii. 14</A>),

 but the righteous <I>dwelt on high</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:15,16">Isa. xxxiii. 15, 16</A>)

 and <I>meditated on terror</I> so as to conquer it. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:18">Isa. xxxiii. 18</A>,

 which refers to what is recorded here.

 2. He endeavoured to keep up their faith, in order to the silencing and
 suppressing of their fears.  "Sennacherib has a <I>multitude with 
 him,</I> and yet there are <I>more with us than with him;</I> for we 
 have God with us, and how many do you reckon him for? With our enemy is 
 an arm of flesh, which he trusts to; but <I>with us is the Lord,</I> 
 whose power is irresistible, our God, whose promise is inviolable, a 
 God in covenant with us, <I>to help us, and to fight our battles,</I> 
 not only to help us to fight them, but to fight them for us if he 
 please:" and so he did here. Note, A believing confidence in God will 
 raise us above the prevailing fear of man. He that <I>feareth the fury 
 of the oppressor forgetteth the Lord his Maker,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:12,13">Isa. li. 12, 13</A>.

 It is probable that Hezekiah said more to this purport, and that the
 people rested themselves upon what he said, not merely upon his word, 
 but on the things he said concerning the presence of God with them and 
 his power to relieve them, the belief of which made them easy. Let the 
 good subjects and soldiers of Jesus Christ rest thus upon his word, and 
 boldly say, <I>Since God is for us, who can be against us?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants
 to Jerusalem, (but he <I>himself laid siege</I> against Lachish, and
 all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto
 all Judah that <I>were</I> at Jerusalem, saying,
 &nbsp; 10  Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust,
 that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?
 &nbsp; 11  Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to
 die by famine and by thirst, saying, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God shall
 deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
 &nbsp; 12  Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and
 his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall
 worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?
 &nbsp; 13  Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the
 people of <I>other</I> lands? were the gods of the nations of those
 lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?
 &nbsp; 14  Who <I>was there</I> among all the gods of those nations that my
 fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of
 mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of
 mine hand?
 &nbsp; 15  Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you
 on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation
 or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and
 out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God
 deliver you out of mine hand?
 &nbsp; 16  And his servants spake yet <I>more</I> against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God, and
 against his servant Hezekiah.
 &nbsp; 17  He wrote also letters to rail on the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, and
 to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of
 <I>other</I> lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand,
 so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine
 hand.
 &nbsp; 18  Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto
 the people of Jerusalem that <I>were</I> on the wall, to affright
 them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city.
 &nbsp; 19  And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the
 gods of the people of the earth, <I>which were</I> the work of the
 hands of man.
 &nbsp; 20  And for this <I>cause</I> Hezekiah the king, and the prophet
 Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.
 &nbsp; 21  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men
 of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king
 of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land.
 And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came
 forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.
 &nbsp; 22  Thus the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of
 Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and
 from the hand of all <I>other,</I> and guided them on every side.
 &nbsp; 23  And many brought gifts unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to Jerusalem, and
 presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in
 the sight of all nations from thenceforth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This story of the rage and blasphemy of Sennacherib, Hezekiah's prayer, 
 and the deliverance of Jerusalem by the destruction of the Assyrian 
 army, we had more at large in the book of Kings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:1-19:37">2 Kings xviii. and xix.</A>

 It is contracted here, yet large enough to show these three
 things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The impiety and malice of the church's enemies. Sennacherib has his 
 hands full in besieging Lachish 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 but hears that Hezekiah is fortifying Jerusalem and encouraging his
 people to stand it out; and therefore, before he come in person to 
 besiege it, he sends messengers to make speeches, and he himself writes 
 letters to frighten Hezekiah and his people into a surrender of the 
 city. See, 

 1. His great malice against the king of Judah, in endeavouring to
 withdraw his subjects from their allegiance to him. He did not treat 
 with Hezekiah as a man of honour would have done, nor propose fair 
 terms to him, but used mean and base artifices, unbecoming a crowned 
 head, to terrify the common people and persuade them to desert him. He
 represented Hezekiah as one who designed to deceive his subjects into 
 their ruin and betray them <I>to famine and thirst</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 as one who had done them great wrong and exposed them already to the
 divine displeasure by taking away the high places and altars

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and who, against the common interest of his people, held out against a
 force that would certainly be their ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 2. His great impiety against the God of Israel, <I>the God of
 Jerusalem</I> he is called

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 because that was the place he had chosen to put his name there, and
 because that was the place which was now threatened by the enemy and 
 which the divine Providence had under its special protection. This 
 proud blasphemer compared the great Jehovah, the Maker of heaven and 
 earth, with the dunghill gods of the nations, the work of men's hands, 
 and thought him no more able to deliver his worshippers than they were 
 to deliver theirs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 as if an infinite and eternal Spirit had no more wisdom and power than
 a stone or the stock of a tree. He boasted of his triumphs over the 
 gods of the nations, that they could none of them protect their people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:13-15"><I>v.</I> 13-15</A>),

 and thence inferred not only, <I>How shall your God deliver you?</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 but, as if he were inferior to them all, <I>How much less shall your
 God deliver you?</I> as if he were less able to help than any of them. 
 Thus did they rail, rail in writing (which, being more deliberate, is 
 so much the worse), <I>on the Lord God of Israel,</I> as if he were a 
 cipher and an empty name, like all the rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Sennacherib, in the instructions he gave, said more than enough; but,
 as if his blasphemies had been too little, his servants, who learned 
 insolence from their master, spoke yet more than he bade them 
 <I>against the Lord God and his servant Hezekiah,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 And God resents what is said against his servants, and will reckon for
 it, as well as what is said against himself. All this was intended to 
 frighten the people from their hope in God, which David's enemies 
 sought to take him off from

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:1,42:10">Ps. xi. 1; xlii. 10</A>),

 saying, <I>There is no help for him in God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:2,71:11">Ps. iii. 2; lxxi. 11</A>.

 Thus they hoped to take the city by weakening the hands of those that
 should defend it. Satan, in his temptations, aims to destroy our faith 
 in God's all-sufficiency, knowing that he shall gain his point if he 
 can do that; as we keep our ground if our <I>faith fail not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:32">Luke xxii. 32</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The duty as well as the interest of the church's friends, and that 
 is in the day of distress to pray and cry to Heaven. So Hezekiah did, 
 and the prophet Isaiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 It was a happy time when the king and the prophet joined thus in
 prayer. Is any troubled? Is any terrified?  Let him pray. So we engage 
 God for us; so we encourage ourselves in him. Praying to God is here 
 called <I>crying to Heaven,</I> because we are, in prayer, to eye him 
 as our Father in heaven, whence he beholds the children of men, and 
 where he has prepared his throne.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The power and goodness of the church's God. He is able both to 
 control his enemies, be they ever so high, and to relieve his friends, 
 be they ever so low.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As the blasphemies of his enemies engage him against them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:27">Deut. xxxii. 27</A>),

 so the prayers of his people engage him for them. They did so here.
 
 (1.) The army of the Assyrians was cut off by the sword of an angel,
 which triumphed particularly in the slaughter of the mighty men of
 valour, and the leaders and captains, who defied the sword of any man.
 God delights to abase the proud and secure. The Targum says, The Word
 of the Lord (the eternal Word) sent Gabriel to do this execution, and
 that it was done with lightning, and in the passover night: that was
 the night in which the angel destroyed the first-born of Egypt. But
 that was not all. 

 (2.) The king of the Assyrians, having received this disgrace, was cut
 off by the sword of his own sons. Those that <I>came forth of his own 
 bowels slew him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Thus was he mortified first, and then murdered--shamed first, and then
 slain. Evil pursues sinners; and, when they escape one mischief, they 
 run upon another unseen.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By this work of wonder, 

 (1.) God was glorified, as the protector of his people. Thus he saved 
 Jerusalem, not only from the hand of Sennacherib, but from the hand 
 <I>of all others,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>;

 for such a deliverance as this was an earnest of much mercy in store;
 and he <I>guided them,</I> that is, he guarded them, on every side. God 
 defends his people by directing them, shows them what they should do, 
 and so saves them from what is designed or done against them. For this 
 <I>many brought gifts unto the Lord,</I> when they saw the great power 
 of God in the defence of his people.  Strangers were thereby induced to 
 supplicate his favour and enemies to deprecate his wrath, and both 
 brought gifts to his temple, in token of their care and desire.

 (2.) Hezekiah was magnified as the favourite and particular care of 
 Heaven.  Many <I>brought presents to him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>),

 in token of the honour they had for him, and to make an interest in
 him. By the favour of God enemies are lost and friends gained.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed
 unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.
 &nbsp; 25  But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit
 <I>done</I> unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was
 wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 26  Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of
 his heart, <I>both</I> he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that
 the wrath of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
 &nbsp; 27  And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he
 made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for
 precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all
 manner of pleasant jewels;
 &nbsp; 28  Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and
 oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.
 &nbsp; 29  Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks
 and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very
 much.
 &nbsp; 30  This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of
 Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city
 of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.
 &nbsp; 31  Howbeit in <I>the business of</I> the ambassadors of the princes
 of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was
 <I>done</I> in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know
 all <I>that was</I> in his heart.
 &nbsp; 32  Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness,
 behold, they <I>are</I> written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet,
 the son of Amoz, <I>and</I> in the book of the kings of Judah and
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 33  And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in
 the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all
 Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his
 death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we conclude the story of Hezekiah with an account of three things 
 concerning him:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His sickness and his recovery from it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 The account of his sickness is but briefly mentioned here; we had a
 large narrative of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:1-11">2 Kings xx.</A>

 His disease seemed likely to be mortal. In the extremity of it he
 prayed. God answered him, and gave him a sign that he should recover, 
 the going back of the sun ten degrees.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His sin and his repentance for it, which were also more largely 
 related, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:12-21">2 Kings xx. 12</A>,

 &c. Yet several things are here observed concerning his sin which we 
 had not there.

 1. The occasion of it was the king of Babylon's sending an honourable
 embassy to him to congratulate him on his recovery. But here it is 
 added that they came to enquire of <I>the wonder that was done in the 
 land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 either the destruction of the Assyrian army or the going back of the
 sun. The Assyrians were their enemies; they came to enquire concerning 
 their fall, that they might triumph in it. The sun was their god; they 
 came to enquire concerning the favour he had shown to Hezekiah, that 
 they might honour him whom their god honoured, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 These miracles were wrought to alarm and awaken a stupid careless
 world, and turn them from dumb and lame idols to the living God; and 
 men were startled by them, but not converted till a greater wonder was 
 done in that land, in the appearing of Jesus Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:1,2">Matt. ii. 1, 2</A>.

 2. God left him to himself in it, to try him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 God, by the power of his almighty grace, could have prevented the sin;
 but he permitted it for wise and holy ends, that, by this trial and his 
 weakness in it, he might know, that is, it might be known (a usual 
 Hebraism), what was in his heart, that he was not so perfect in grace 
 as he thought he was, but had his follies and infirmities as other men. 
 God left him to himself to be proud of his wealth, to keep him from 
 being proud of his holiness. It is good for us to know ourselves, and 
 our own weakness and sinfulness, that we may not be conceited or 
 self-confident, but may always think meanly of ourselves and live in a 
 dependence upon divine grace. We know not the corruption of our own 
 hearts, nor what we shall do if God leave us to ourselves. <I>Lord, 
 lead us not into temptation.</I>

 3. His sin was the <I>his heart was lifted up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 He was proud of the honour God had put upon him in so many instances,
 the honour his neighbours did him in bringing him presents, and now 
 that the king of Babylon should send an embassy to him to caress and 
 court him: this exalted him above measure. When Hezekiah had destroyed 
 other idolatries he began to idolize himself. O what need have great 
 men, and good men, and useful men, to study their own infirmities and 
 follies, and their obligations to free grace, that they may never think 
 highly of themselves, and to beg earnestly of God that he will hide 
 pride from them and always keep them humble!

 4. The aggravation of his sin was the he made so bad a return to God
 for his favours to him, making even those favours the food and fuel of 
 his pride 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>He rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him.</I>
 Note, It is justly expected that those who have received mercy from God 
 should study to make some suitable returns for the mercies they have 
 received; and, if they do not, their ingratitude will certainly be 
 charged upon them. Though we cannot render an equivalent, or the 
 payment of a debt, we must render the acknowledgment of a favour. 
 <I>What shall I render</I> that may be so accepted? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:12">Ps. cxvi. 12</A>.

 5. The divine displeasure he was under for this sin; though it was but
 a heart-sin, and the overt-act seemed not only innocent but civil (the
 showing of his treasures to a friend), yet wrath came upon him and his
 kingdom for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Note, Pride is a sin that God hates as much as any, and particularly in
 his own people. Those that exalt themselves must expect to be abased, 
 and put under humbling providences. Wrath came on David for his pride 
 in numbering the people.

 6. His repentance for this sin: <I>He humbled himself for the pride of
 his heart.</I> Note,

 (1.) Though God may, for wise and holy ends, suffer his people to fall 
 into sin, yet he will not suffer them to lie still in it; they <I>shall 
 not be utterly cast down.</I> 

 (2.) Heart-sins are to be repented of, though they go no further. 

 (3.) Self-humiliation is a necessary branch of repentance. 

 (4.) Pride of heart, by which we have lifted up ourselves, is a sin for
 which we ought in a special manner to humble ourselves.  

 (5.) People ought to mourn for the sins of their rulers.  The
 inhabitants of Jerusalem humbled themselves with Hezekiah, because they
 either knew that they also had been guilty of the same sin, or at least
 feared that they might share in the punishment. When David, in his
 pride, numbered the people, they all smarted for his sin.  

 7. The reprieve granted thereupon. The wrath came not in his days.  
 While he lived the country had peace and truth prevailed; so much does 
 repentance avail to put by, or at least to put off, the tokens of God's 
 anger.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is the honour done to Hezekiah, 

 1. By the providence of God while he lived. He had <I>exceeding much
 riches and honour</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),
 
 replenished his stores, victualled his campus, fortified his city, and
 did all he wished to do; for God <I>had given him very much 
 substance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 Among his great performances, his turning the water-course of Gihon is
 mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 which was done upon occasion of Sennacherib's invasion,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 The water had come into that which is called the <I>old pool</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:11">Isa. xxii. 11</A>)

 and the <I>upper pool</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:3">Isa. vii. 3</A>);

 but he gathered the waters into a new place, for the greater
 convenience of the city, called the <I>lower pool,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:9">Isa. xxii. 9</A>.

 And, in general, he <I>prospered in all his works,</I> for they were
 good works.

 2. By the respect paid to his memory when he was dead.


 (1.) The prophet Isaiah wrote his life and reign
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 his acts and his goodness or piety, or which it is part of the honour
 to be recorded and remembered, for examples to others.

 (2.) The people <I>did him honour at his death</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 buried him in the chief of the sepulchres, made as great a burning for
 him as for Asa, or, which is a much greater honour, made great 
 lamentation for him, as for Josiah. See how the honour of serious 
 godliness is manifested in the consciences of men. Though it is to be 
 feared that the generality of the people did not heartily comply with 
 the reforming kings, yet they could not but praise their endeavours for 
 reformation, and the memory of those kings was blessed among them. It 
 is a debt we owe to those who have been eminently useful in their day 
 to do them honour at their death, when they are out of the reach of 
 flattery and we have seen the end of their conversation. The due 
 payment of this debt will be an encouragement to others to do 
 likewise.</P>
