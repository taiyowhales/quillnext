 In this chapter we have an abstract of the history, 

 I. Of two of the kings of Judah, Abijam, the days of whose reign were
 few and evil

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>),

 and Asa, who reigned well and long, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:9-24">ver. 9-24</A>.

 II. Of two of the kings of Israel, Nadab the son of Jeroboam, and
 Baasha the destroyer of Jeroboam's house,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat
 reigned Abijam over Judah.
 &nbsp; 2 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
 <I>was</I> Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
 &nbsp; 3 And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had
 done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his
 God, as the heart of David his father.
 &nbsp; 4 Nevertheless for David's sake did the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God give him a
 lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish
 Jerusalem:
 &nbsp; 5 Because David did <I>that which was</I> right in the eyes of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and turned not aside from any <I>thing</I> that he commanded him
 all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the
 Hittite.
 &nbsp; 6 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days
 of his life.
 &nbsp; 7 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did,
 <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
 of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
 &nbsp; 8 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the
 city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a short account of the short reign of Abijam the son of 
 Rehoboam king of Judah. He makes a better figure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:1-22">2 Chron. xiii.</A>,

 where we have an account of his war with Jeroboam, the speech which he
 made before the armies engaged, and the wonderful victory he obtained 
 by the help of God. There he is called <I>Abijah--My father is the 
 Lord,</I> because no wickedness is there laid to his charge. But here, 
 where we are told of his faults, <I>Jah,</I> the name of God, is, in 
 disgrace to him, taken away from his name, and he is called 
 <I>Abijam.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:24">Jer. xxii. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Few particulars are related concerning him. 

 1. Here began his reign in the beginning of Jeroboam's eighteenth year;
 for Rehoboam reigned but seventeen,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:21"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 21</A>.

 Jeroboam indeed survived Rehoboam, but Rehoboam's Abijah lived to
 succeed him and to be a terror to Jeroboam, while Jeroboam's Abijah 
 (whom we read of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:1"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 1</A>)

 died before him. 

 2.  He reigned scarcely three years, for he died before the end of
 Jeroboam's twentieth year, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Being made proud and secure by his great victory over Jeroboam

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:21">2 Chron. xiii. 21</A>),

 God cut him off, to make way for his son Asa, who would be a better
 man. 

 3. <I>His mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom,</I>
 that is, Absalom, David's son, as I am the rather inclined to think 
 because two other of Rehoboam's wives were his near relations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:18">2 Chron. xi. 18</A>),

 one the daughter of Jerimoth, David's son, and another the daughter of
 Eliab, David's brother. He took warning by his father not to marry 
 strangers; yet thought it below him to marry his subjects, except they 
 were of the royal family. 

 4. He carried on his father's wars with Jeroboam. As there was
 continual war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam, not set battles (these 
 were forbidden,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:24"><I>ch.</I> xii. 24</A>),

 but frequent encounters, especially upon the borders, one making
 incursions and reprisals on the other, so there was between Abijam and 
 Jeroboam 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 till Jeroboam, with a great army, invaded him, and then Abijam, not
 being forbidden to act in his own defence, routed him, and weakened 
 him, so that he compelled him to be quiet during the rest of his reign,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:20">2 Chron. xiii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. But, in general, we are told, 

 1. That he was not like David, had no hearty affection for the
 ordinances of God, though, to serve his purpose against Jeroboam, he 
 pleaded his possession of the temple and priesthood, as that upon which 
 he valued himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:10-12">2 Chron. xiii. 10-12</A>.

 Many boast of their profession of godliness who are strangers to the
 power of it, and plead the truth of their religion who yet are not true 
 to it. <I>His heart was not perfect with the Lord his God.</I> He 
 seemed to have zeal, but he wanted sincerity; he began pretty well, but 
 he fell off, and <I>walked in all the sins of his father,</I> followed 
 his bad example, though he had seen the bad consequences of it. He that 
 was all his days in war ought to have been so wise as to make and keep 
 his peace with God, and not to make him his enemy, especially having 
 found him so good a friend in his war with Jeroboam,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:18">2 Chron. xiii. 18</A>.

 <I>Let favour be shown to the wicked, yet will he not learn
 righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:10">Isa. xxvi. 10</A>.

 2. That yet it was for David's sake that he was advanced, and continued
 upon the throne; it was <I>for his sake</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>)

 that God thus <I>set up his son after him;</I> not for his own sake,
 nor for the sake of his father, in whose steps he trod, <I>but for the 
 sake of David,</I> whose example he would not follow. Note, It 
 aggravates the sin of a degenerate seed that they fare the better for 
 the piety of their ancestors and owe their blessings to it, and yet 
 will not imitate it. They stand upon that ground, and yet despise it, 
 and trample upon it, and unreasonably ridicule and oppose that which 
 they enjoy the benefit of. The kingdom of Judah was supported,

 (1.) That David might have a lamp, pursuant to the divine ordination of 
 <I>a lamp for his anointed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:17">Ps. cxxxii. 17</A>.

 (2.) That Jerusalem might be established, not only that the honours put 
 upon it in David's and Solomon's time might be preserved to it, but 
 that it might be reserved to the honours designed for it in 
 after-times. The character here given of David is very great--<I>that 
 he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord;</I> but the 
 exception is very remarkable--<I>save only in the matter of Uriah,</I> 
 including both his murder and the debauching of his wife. That was a 
 bad matter; it was a remaining blot upon his name, a bar in his 
 escutcheon, and the reproach of it was not wiped away, though the guilt 
 was. David was guilty of other faults, but they were nothing in 
 comparison of that; yet even that being repented of, though it be 
 mentioned for warning to others, did not prevail to throw him out of 
 the covenant, nor to cut off the entail of the promise upon his 
 seed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned
 Asa over Judah.
 &nbsp; 10 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his
 mother's name <I>was</I> Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
 &nbsp; 11 And Asa did <I>that which was</I> right in the eyes of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 as <I>did</I> David his father.
 &nbsp; 12 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed
 all the idols that his fathers had made.
 &nbsp; 13 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from
 <I>being</I> queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa
 destroyed her idol, and burnt <I>it</I> by the brook Kidron.
 &nbsp; 14 But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's
 heart was perfect with the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> all his days.
 &nbsp; 15 And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated,
 and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, silver, and gold, and vessels.
 &nbsp; 16 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
 their days.
 &nbsp; 17 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built
 Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa
 king of Judah.
 &nbsp; 18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold <I>that were</I> left
 in the treasures of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the treasures of
 the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his
 servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of
 Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at
 Damascus, saying,
 &nbsp; 19 <I>There is</I> a league between me and thee, <I>and</I> between my
 father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of
 silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of
 Israel, that he may depart from me.
 &nbsp; 20 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains
 of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote
 Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all
 the land of Naphtali.
 &nbsp; 21 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard <I>thereof,</I> that he
 left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
 &nbsp; 22 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none
 <I>was</I> exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the
 timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built
 with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
 &nbsp; 23 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all
 that he did, and the cities which he built, <I>are</I> they not
 written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
 Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his
 feet.
 &nbsp; 24 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
 fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son
 reigned in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a short account of the reign of Asa; we shall find a more 
 copious history of it 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+14:1-16:14">2 Chron. xiv., xv., and xvi.</A>

 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The length of it: <I>He reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 In the account we have of the kings of Judah we find the number of the
 good kings and the bad ones nearly equal; but then we may observe, to 
 our comfort, that the reign of the good kings was generally long, but 
 that of the bad kings short, the consideration of which will make the 
 state of God's church not altogether so bad within that period as it 
 appears at first sight. Length of days is in Wisdom's right hand.  
 <I>Honour thy father,</I> much more thy heavenly Father, <I>that thy 
 days may be long.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The general good character of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord,</I> and that
 is right indeed which is so in God's eyes; those are approved whom he 
 commends. He did <I>as did David his father,</I> kept close to God, and 
 to his instituted worship, was hearty and zealous for that, which gave 
 him this honourable character, that he was like David, though he was 
 not a prophet, or psalmist, as David was. If we come up to the graces 
 of those that have gone before us it will be our praise with God, 
 though we come short of their gifts. Asa was like David, though he was 
 neither such a conqueror nor such an author; for <I>his heart was 
 perfect with the Lord all his days</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 that is, he was both cordial and constant in his religion. What he did
 for God he was sincere in, steady and uniform, and did it from a good 
 principle, with a single eye to the glory of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The particular instances of Asa's piety. His times were times of 
 reformation.  For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He removed that which was evil. There reformation begins; and a 
 great deal of work of that kind his hand found to do. For, though it 
 was but twenty years after the death of Solomon that he began to reign, 
 yet very gross corruption had spread far and taken deep root. 
 Immorality he first struck at: <I>He took away the sodomites out of the 
 land,</I> suppressed the brothels; for how can either prince or people 
 prosper while those cages of unclean and filthy birds, more dangerous 
 than pest-houses, are suffered to remain? Then he proceeded against 
 idolatry: <I>He removed all the idols,</I> even those <I>that his 
 father had made,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 His father having made them, he was the more concerned to remove them,
 that he might cut off the entail of the curse, and prevent the visiting 
 of that iniquity upon him and his. Nay (which redounds much to his 
 honour, and shows his heart was perfect with God), when he found 
 idolatry in the court, he rooted it out thence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 When it appeared that Maachah his mother, or rather his grandmother
 (but called his <I>mother</I> because she had the educating of him in 
 his childhood), had an idol in a grove, though she was his mother, his 
 grandmother,--though, it is likely, she had a particular fondness for 
 it,--though, being old, she could not live long to patronise 
 it,--though she kept it for her own use only, yet he would by no means 
 connive at her idolatry. Reformation must begin at home. Bad practices 
 will never be suppressed in the country while they are supported in the 
 court. Asa, in every thing else, will honour and respect his mother; he 
 loves her well, but he loves God better, and (like the Levite,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:9">Deut. xxxiii. 9</A>)

 readily forgets the relation when it comes in competition with his
 duty. If she be an idolater, 

 (1.) Her idol shall be destroyed, publicly exposed to contempt,
 defaced, and burnt to ashes <I>by the brook Kidron,</I> on which, it is 
 probable, he strewed the ashes, in imitation of Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:20">Exod. xxxii. 20</A>)

 and in token of his detestation of idolatry and his indignation at it
 wherever he found it.  Let no remains of a court-idol appear. 

 (2.) She shall be deposed, He removed her from being queen, or from the
 queen, that is, from conversing with his wife; he banished her from the 
 court, and confined her to an obscure and private life. Those that have 
 power are happy when thus they have hearts to use it well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He re-established that which was good 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 He <I>brought into the house of God the dedicated things</I> which he
 himself had vowed out of the spoils of the Ethiopians he had conquered, 
 and which his father had vowed, but lived not to bring in pursuant to 
 his vow. We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well, not 
 only cast away the idols of our iniquity, but dedicate ourselves and 
 our all to God's honour and glory. When those who, in their infancy, 
 were by baptism devoted to God, make it their own act and deed to join 
 themselves to him and vigorously employ themselves in his service, this 
 is bringing in the dedicated things which they and their fathers have 
 dedicated: it is necessary justice--rendering to God the things that 
 are his.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The policy of his reign. He built cities himself, to encourage the 
 increase of his people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)

 and to invite others to him by the conveniences of habitation; and he
 was very zealous to hinder Baasha from building Ramah, because he 
 designed it for the cutting off of communication between his people and 
 Jerusalem and to hinder those who in obedience to God would come to 
 worship there. An enemy must by no means be suffered to fortify a 
 frontier town.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The faults of his reign. In both the things for which he was praised 
 he was found defective. The fairest characters are not without some 
 <I>but</I> or other in them. 

 1. Did he take away the idols? That was well; <I>but the high places
 were not removed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 therein his reformation fell short. He removed all images which were
 rivals with the true God or false representations of him; but the 
 altars which were set up in high places, and to which those sacrifices 
 were brought which should have been offered on the altar in the temple, 
 those he suffered to stand, thinking there was no great harm in them, 
 they having been used by good men before the temple was built, and 
 being loth to disoblige the people, who had a kindness to them and were 
 wedded to them both by custom and convenience; whereas in Judah and 
 Benjamin, the only tribes under Asa's government which lay so near 
 Jerusalem and the altars there, there was less pretence for them than 
 in those tribes which lay more remote. They were against the law, which 
 obliged them to worship <I>at one place,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:11">Deut. xii. 11</A>.

 They lessened men's esteem of the temple and the altars there, and were
 an open gap for idolatry to enter in at, while the people were so much 
 addicted to it. It was not well that Asa, when his hand was in, did not 
 remove these.  <I>Nevertheless his heart was perfect with the Lord.</I> 
 This affords us a comfortable note, That those may be found honest and 
 upright with God, and be accepted of him, who yet, in some instances, 
 come short of doing the good they might and should do. The perfection 
 which is made the indispensable condition of the new covenant is not to 
 be understood of sinlessness (then we were all undone), but sincerity. 
 
 2. Did he bring in the dedicated things? That was well; but he
 afterwards alienated the dedicated things, when he took the gold and 
 silver out of the house of God and sent them as a bribe to Benhadad, to 
 hire him to break his league with Baasha, and, by making an inroad upon 
 his country, to give him a diversion from the building of Ramah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.
 
 Here he sinned,

 (1.) In tempting Benhadad to break his league, and so to violate the
 public faith. If he did wrong in doing it, as certainly he did, Asa did 
 wrong in persuading him to do it.

 (2.) In that he could not trust God, who had done so much for him, to
 free him out of this strait, without using such indirect means to help 
 himself.

 (3.) In taking the gold out of the treasury of the temple, which was
 not to be made use of but on extraordinary occasions.  The project 
 succeeded.  Benhadad made a descent upon the land of Israel, which 
 obliged Baasha to retire with his whole force from Ramah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>),
 
 which gave Asa a fair opportunity to demolish his works there, and the
 timber and stones served him for the building of some cities of his 
 own, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 But, though the design prospered, we find it was displeasing to God;
 and though Asa valued himself upon the policy of it, and promised 
 himself that it would effectually secure his peace, he was told by the 
 prophet that he had done foolishly, and that <I>thenceforth he should 
 have wars;</I> see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:7-9">2 Chron. xvi. 7-9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The troubles of his reign. For the most part he prospered; but, 

 1.  Baasha king of Israel was a very troublesome neighbour to him. He 
 reigned twenty-four years, and all his days had war, more or less, with 
 Asa, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This was the effect of the division of the kingdoms, that they were
 continually vexing one another, and so weakened one another, which made 
 them both an easier prey to the common enemy.

 2. In his old age he was himself afflicted with the gout: He was
 <I>diseased in his feet,</I> which made him less fit for business and 
 peevish towards those about him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The conclusion of his reign. The acts of it were more largely 
 recorded in the common history (to which reference is here had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)

 than in this sacred one. He reigned long, but finished at last with

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in
 the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two
 years.
 &nbsp; 26 And he did evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and walked in the
 way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to
 sin.
 &nbsp; 27 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,
 conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which
 <I>belonged</I> to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid
 siege to Gibbethon.
 &nbsp; 28 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay
 him, and reigned in his stead.
 &nbsp; 29 And it came to pass, when he reigned, <I>that</I> he smote all
 the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed,
 until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:
 &nbsp; 30 Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which
 he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel to anger.
 &nbsp; 31 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did,
 <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
 of Israel?
 &nbsp; 32 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
 their days.
 &nbsp; 33 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son
 of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four
 years.
 &nbsp; 34 And he did evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and walked in the
 way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are now to take a view of the miserable state of Israel, while the 
 kingdom of Judah was happy under Asa's good government. It was 
 threatened that they should be as <I>a reed shaken in the water</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:15"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 15</A>),

 and so they were, when, during the single reign of Asa, the government
 of their kingdom was in six or seven different hands, as we find in 
 this and the following chapter. Jeroboam was upon the throne in the 
 beginning of his reign and Ahab at the end of it, and between them were 
 Nadab, Baasha, Elah, Zimri, Tibni, and Omri, undermining and destroying 
 one another. This they got by deserting the house both of God and of 
 David. Here we have, 

 1. The ruin and extirpation of the family of Jeroboam, according to the
 word of the Lord by Ahijah. His son Nadab succeeded him. If the death 
 of his brother Abijah had had a due influence upon him to make him 
 religious, and the honour done him at his death had engaged him to 
 follow his good example, his reign might have been long and glorious; 
 but he <I>walked in the way of his father</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 kept up the worship of his calves, and forbade his subjects to go up to
 Jerusalem to worship, <I>sinned and made Israel to sin,</I> and 
 therefore God brought ruin upon him quickly, in the second year of his 
 reign.  He was besieging Gibbethon, a city which the Philistines had 
 taken from the Danites, and was endeavouring to re-take it; and there, 
 in the midst of his army, did Baasha, with others, conspire against him 
 and kill him,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 and so little interest had he in the affections of his people that his
 army did not only not avenge his death, but chose his murderer for his 
 successor. Whether Baasha did it upon a personal pique against Nadab, 
 or to be avenged on the house of Jeroboam for some affront received 
 from them, or whether under pretence of freeing his country from the 
 tyranny of a bad prince, or whether merely from a principle of 
 ambition, to make way for himself to the throne, does not appear; but 
 he <I>slew him</I> and <I>reigned in his stead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 And the first thing he did when he came to the crown was to <I>cut off
 all the house of Jeroboam,</I> that he might the better secure himself 
 and his own usurped government. He thought it not enough to imprison or 
 banish them, but he destroyed them, left not only no males (as was 
 foretold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:10"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 10</A>),

 but none that breathed. Herein he was barbarous, but God was righteous.
 Jeroboam's sin was punished 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>);

 for those that provoke God do it <I>to their own confusion;</I> see
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:19">Jer. vii. 19</A>.
 
 Ahijah's prophecy was accomplished

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>);

 for no word of God shall fall to the ground.  Divine threatenings are
 not bugbears. 

 2. The elevation of Baasha. He shall be tried awhile, as Jeroboam was.
 Twenty-four years he reigned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 but showed that it was not from any dislike to Jeroboam's sin that he
 destroyed his family, but from malice and ambition; for, when he had 
 rooted out the sinner, he himself clave to the sin, and <I>walked in 
 the way of Jeroboam</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 though he had seen the end of that way; so strangely was his heart
 hardened with the deceitfulness of sin.</P>
