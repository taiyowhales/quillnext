 Though Joseph and Judah shared between them the forfeited honours of 
 the birthright, yet Levi was first of all the tribes, dignified and 
 distinguished with an honour more valuable than either the precedency 
 or the double portion, and that was the priesthood. That tribe God set 
 apart for himself; it was Moses's tribe, and perhaps for his sake was 
 thus favoured. Of that tribe we have an account in this chapter. 

 I. Their pedigree, the first fathers of the tribe

 and of some other of their families,

 The priests and Levites were more concerned than any other Israelites 
 to preserve their pedigree clear and to be able to prove it, because 
 all the honours and privileges of their office depended upon their 
 descent. And we read of those who, though perhaps they really were 
 children of the priests, yet, because they could not find the register 
 of their genealogies, nor make out their descent by any authentic 
 record, were, <I>as polluted, put from the priesthood,</I> and 
 forbidden to eat of the holy things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:62,63">Ezra ii. 62, 63</A>.

 It is but very little that is here recorded of the genealogies of this
 sacred tribe.
 
 I. The first fathers of it are here named twice,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:1,16"><I>v.</I> 1, 16</A>.

 Gershom, Kohath, and Merari, are three names which we were very
 conversant with in the book of Numbers, when the families of the 
 Levites were marshalled and had their work assigned to them. Aaron, and 
 Moses, and Miriam, we have known much more of than their names, and 
 cannot pass them over here without remembering that this was that Moses 
 and Aaron whom God honoured in making them instruments of Israel's 
 deliverance and settlement and <I>figures of him that was to come,</I> 
 Moses as a prophet and Aaron as a priest. And the mention of Nadab and 
 Abihu (though, having no children, there was no occasion to bring them 
 into the genealogy) cannot but remind us of the terrors of that divine 
 justice which they were made monuments of for offering strange fire, 
 that we may always fear before him.

 2. The line of Eleazar, the successor of Aaron, is here drawn down to
 the time of the captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:4-15"><I>v.</I> 4-15</A>.

 It begins with Eleazar, who came out of the house of bondage in Egypt,
 and ends with Jehozadak, who went into the house of bondage in Babylon. 
 Thus, for their sins, they were left as they were found, which might 
 also intimate that the Levitical priesthood did not make anything 
 perfect, but this was to be done by the <I>bringing in of a better 
 hope.</I> All these here named were not high priests; for, in the time 
 of the judges, that dignity was, upon some occasion or other, brought 
 into the family of Ithamar, of which Eli was; but in Zadok it returned 
 again to the right line. Of Azariah it is here said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 <I>He it is that executed the priest's office in the temple that
 Solomon built.</I> It is supposed that this was that Azariah who 
 bravely opposed the presumption of king Uzziah when he invaded the 
 priest's office

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+26:17,18">2 Chron. xxvi. 17, 18</A>),

 though he ventured his neck by so doing. This was done like a priest,
 like one that was truly zealous for his God. He that thus boldly 
 maintained and defended the priest's office, and made good its barriers 
 against such a daring insult, might well be said to <I>execute it;</I> 
 and this honour is put upon him for it; while Urijah, one of his 
 successors, for a base compliance with King Ahaz, in building him an 
 idolatrous altar, has the disgrace put upon him of being left out of 
 this genealogy, as perhaps some others are. But some think that this
 remark upon this Azariah should have been added to his grandfather of 
 the same name 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 who was the son of Ahimaaz, and that he was the priest who first
 officiated in Solomon's temple. 

 3. Some other of the families of the Levites are here accounted for.
 One of the families of Gershom (that of Libni) is here drawn down as 
 far as Samuel, who had the honour of a prophet added to that of a 
 Levite. One of the families of Merari (that of Mahli) is likewise drawn 
 down for several descents,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When the Levites were first ordained in the wilderness much of the work 
 then appointed them lay in carrying and taking care of the tabernacle 
 and the utensils of it, while they were in their march through the 
 wilderness. In David's time their number was increased; and, though the 
 greater part of them was dispersed all the nation over, to teach the 
 people the good knowledge of the Lord, yet those that attended the 
 house of God were so numerous that there was not constant work for them 
 all; and therefore David, by special commission and direction from God, 
 new-modelled the Levites, as we shall find in the latter part of this 
 book. Here we are told what the work was which he assigned them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Singing-work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 David was raised up on high to be the sweet psalmist of Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:1">2 Sam. xxiii. 1</A>),

 not only to pen psalms, but to appoint the singing of them in the house
 of the Lord (not so much because he was musical as because he was 
 devout), and this he did <I>after that the ark had rest.</I> While that 
 was in captivity, obscure, and unsettled, the harps were hung upon the 
 willow-trees: singing was then thought unseasonable (when the 
 bridegroom is taken away they shall fast); but the harps being resumed, 
 and the songs revived, at the bringing up of the ark, they were 
 continued afterwards. For we should rejoice as much in the prolonging 
 of our spiritual privileges as in the restoring of them. When the 
 service of the ark was much superseded by its rest they had other work 
 cut out for them (for Levites should never be idle) and were employed 
 in the service of song. Thus when the people of God come to the rest 
 which remains for them above they shall take leave of all their burdens 
 and be employed in everlasting songs. These singers kept up that 
 service in the tabernacle till the temple was built, and then they 
 <I>waited on their office</I> there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 When they came to that stately magnificent house they kept as close
 both to their office and to their order as they had done in the 
 tabernacle. It is a pity that the preferment of the Levites should ever 
 make them remiss in their business. We have here an account of the 
 three great masters who were employed in the service of the sacred 
 song, with their respective families; for they <I>waited with their 
 children,</I> that is, such as descended from them or were allied to 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were the three that were appointed to this
 service, one of each of the three houses of the Levites, that there 
 might be an equality in the distribution of this work and honour, and 
 that every one might know his post, such an admirable order was there 
 in this choir service.

 1. Of the house of Kohath was Heman with his family

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 a man of a sorrowful spirit, if it be the same Heman that penned the
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:1-18">88th psalm</A>,

 and yet a singer. He was the grandson of Samuel the prophet, the son of
 Joel, of whom it is said that <I>he walked not in the ways of 
 Samuel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:2,3">1 Sam. viii. 2, 3</A>);

 but it seems, though the son did not, the grandson did. Thus does the
 blessing entailed on the seed of the upright sometimes pass over one 
 generation and fasten upon the next. And this Heman, though the 
 grandson of that mighty prince, did not think it below him to be a 
 precentor in the house of God. David himself was willing to be a 
 door-keeper. Rather we may look upon this preferment of the grandson in 
 the church as a recompense for the humble modest resignation which the 
 grandfather made of his authority in the state. Many such ways God has 
 of making up his people's losses and balancing their disgraces. Perhaps 
 David, in making Heman the chief, had some respect to his old friend 
 Samuel. 

 2. Of the house of Gershom was Asaph, called <I>his brother,</I>
 because in the same office and of the same tribe, though of another 
 family. He was posted on Heman's right hand in the choir, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:39">v. 39</A>.
 
 Several of the psalms bear his name, being either penned by him or
 tuned by him as the chief musician. It is plain that he was the penman 
 of some psalms; for we read of those that praised the Lord in the words 
 of David and of Asaph. He was a seer as well as a singer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:30">2 Chron. xxix. 30</A>.

 His pedigree is traced up here, through names utterly unknown, as high
 as Levi, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:39-43"><I>v.</I> 39-43</A>.
 
 3. Of the house of Merari was Ethan
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>),

 who was appointed to Heman's left hand. His pedigree is also traced up
 to Levi,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 If these were the Heman and Ethan that penned the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:1-89:52">88th and 89th psalms</A>,
 
 there appears no reason here why they should be called <I>Ezrahites</I>
 (see the titles of those psalms), as there does why those should be 
 called so who are mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:6"><I>ch.</I> ii. 6</A>,
 
 and who were the sons of Zerah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. There was serving-work, abundance of service to be done <I>in the 
 tabernacle of the house of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>),

 to provide water and fuel,--to wash and sweep, and carry out ashes,--to
 kill, and flay, and boil the sacrifices; and to all such services there 
 were Levites appointed, those of other families, or perhaps those that 
 were not fit to be singers, that had either no good voice or no good 
 ear. <I>As every one has received the gift, so let him minister.</I> 
 Those that could not sing must not therefore be laid aside as good for 
 nothing; though they were not fit for that service, there was other 
 service they might be useful in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. There was sacrificing-work, and that was to be done by the priests 
 only, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>.

 They only were to sprinkle the blood and burn the incense; as for
 <I>the work of the most holy place,</I> that was to be done by the high 
 priest only. Each had his work, and they both needed one another and 
 both helped one another in it. Concerning the work of the priests we 
 are here told,

 1. What was the end they were to have in their eye. They were to
 <I>make an atonement for Israel,</I> to mediate between the people and 
 God; not to magnify and enrich themselves, but to serve the public. 
 They were <I>ordained for men.</I> 

 2. What was the rule they were to have in their eye. They presided in
 God's house, yet must do as they were bidden, according to all that God 
 commanded. That law the highest are subject to.</P>

 We have here an account of the Levites' cities. They are here called 
 their <I>castles</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>),

 not only because walled and fortified, and well guarded by the country
 (for it is the interest of every nation to protect its ministers), but 
 because they and their possessions were, in a particular manner, the 
 care of the divine providence: as God was their portion, so God was 
 their protection; and a cottage will be a castle to those that abide 
 under the shadow of the Almighty. This account is much the same with 
 that which we had,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:1-45">Josh. xxi.</A>

 We need not be critical in comparing them (what good will it do us?)
 nor will it do any hurt to the credit of the holy scripture if the 
 names of some of the places be not spelt just the same here as they 
 were there. We know it is common for cities to have several names.
 <I>Sarum</I> and <I>Salisbury, Salop</I> and <I>Shrewsbury,</I> are 
 more unlike than <I>Hilen</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:58"><I>v.</I> 58</A>)
 
 and <I>Holon</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:15">Josh. xxi. 15</A>),
 
 <I>Ashan</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>)
 
 and <I>Ain</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:16">Josh. xxi. 16</A>),

 <I>Alemeth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>)
 
 and <I>Almon</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:18">Josh. xxi. 18</A>);

 and time changes names. We are only to observe that in this appointment
 of cities for the Levites God took care, 

 1. For the accomplishment of dying Jacob's prediction concerning this
 tribe, that it should be <I>scattered in Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:7">Gen. xlix. 7</A>.

 2. For the diffusing of the knowledge of himself and his law to all
 parts of the land of Israel. Every tribe had Levites' cities in it;
 and so every room was furnished with a candle, so that none could be 
 ignorant of his duty but it was either his own fault or the Levites'. 
 

 3. For a comfortable maintenance for those that ministered in holy
 things. Besides their tithes and offerings, they had glebe-lands and
 cities of their own to dwell in. Some of the most considerable cities
 of Israel fell to the Levites' lot. Every tribe had benefit by the 
 Levites, and therefore every tribe must contribute to their support.
 <I>Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that 
 teacheth,</I> and do it cheerfully.</P>
