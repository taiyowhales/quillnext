 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 mine horn is exalted in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: my mouth is enlarged over mine
 enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.
 &nbsp; 2 <I>There is</I> none holy as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for <I>there is</I> none beside
 thee: neither <I>is there</I> any rock like our God.
 &nbsp; 3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let <I>not</I> arrogancy come
 out of your mouth: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> a God of knowledge, and by
 him actions are weighed.
 &nbsp; 4 The bows of the mighty men <I>are</I> broken, and they that
 stumbled are girded with strength.
 &nbsp; 5 <I>They that were</I> full have hired out themselves for bread;
 and <I>they that were</I> hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born
 seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.
 &nbsp; 6 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the
 grave, and bringeth up.
 &nbsp; 7 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and
 lifteth up.
 &nbsp; 8 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, <I>and</I> lifteth up the
 beggar from the dunghill, to set <I>them</I> among princes, and to
 make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the
 earth <I>are</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s, and he hath set the world upon them.
 &nbsp; 9 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be
 silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.
 &nbsp; 10 The adversaries of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall be broken to pieces; out
 of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall judge the
 ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and
 exalt the horn of his anointed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Hannah's thanksgiving, dictated, not only by the spirit of 
 prayer, but by the spirit of prophecy. Her petition for the mercy she 
 desired we had before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:11"><I>ch.</I> i. 11</A>),

 and here we have her return of praise; in both <I>out of the abundance
 of a heart</I> deeply affected (in the former with her own wants, and 
 in the latter with God's goodness) <I>her mouth spoke.</I> Observe in 
 general, 

 1. When she had received mercy from God she owned it, with thankfulness
 to his praise.  Not like the nine lepers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:17">Luke xvii. 17</A>.
 
 Praise is our rent, our tribute.  We are unjust if we do not pay it. 

 2.  The mercy she had received was an answer to prayer, and therefore
 she thought herself especially obliged to give thanks for it. What we 
 win by prayer we may wear with comfort, and must wear with praise. 

 3.  Her thanksgiving is here called a prayer: <I>Hannah prayed;</I> for
 thanksgiving is an essential part of prayer.  In every address to God 
 we must express a grateful regard to him as our benefactor. Nay, and 
 thanksgiving for mercies received shall be accepted as a petition for 
 further mercy. 

 4. From this particular mercy which she had received from God she takes
 occasion, with an elevated and enlarged heart, to speak glorious things 
 of God and of his government of the world for the good of his church. 
 Whatever at any time gives rise to our praises in this manner they 
 should be raised. 

 5.  Her prayer was mental. <I>Her voice was not heard;</I> but in her
 thanksgiving she spoke, that all might hear her.  She made her 
 supplication <I>with groanings that could not be uttered,</I> but now 
 her lips were opened to <I>show forth God's praise.</I> 

 6. This thanksgiving is here left upon record for the encouragement of
 those of the weaker sex to attend the throne of grace.  God will regard 
 their prayers and praises. The virgin Mary's song has great affinity 
 with this of Hannah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:46">Luke i. 46</A>.

 Three things we have in this thanksgiving:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Hannah's triumph in God, in his glorious perfections, and the great 
 things he had done for her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:1-3"><I>v.</I> 1-3</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What great things she says of God. She takes little notice of the 
 particular mercy she was now rejoicing in, does not commend Samuel for 
 the prettiest child, the most toward and sensible for his age that she 
 ever saw, as fond parents are too apt to do. No, she overlooks the 
 gift, and praises the giver; whereas most forget the giver and fasten 
 only on the gift. Every stream should lead us to the fountain; and the 
 favours we receive from God should raise our admiration of the infinite 
 perfections there are in God. There may be other Samuels, but no other 
 Jehovah. <I>There is none beside thee.</I> Note, God is to be praised 
 as a peerless being, and of unparalleled perfection. This glory is due 
 unto his name, to own not only that there is <I>none like him, but that 
 there is none besides him.</I> All others were pretenders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:31">Ps. xviii. 31</A>.
 
 Four of God's glorious attributes Hannah here celebrates the glory
 of:--

 (1.) His unspotted purity. This is that attribute which is most praised
 in the upper world, by those that always behold his face, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:3,Re+4:8">Isa. vi. 3; Rev. iv. 8</A>.

 When Israel triumphed over the Egyptians God was praised <I>as glorious
 in holiness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:11">Exod. xv. 11</A>.

 So here, in Hannah's triumph, <I>There is none holy as the Lord.</I> It
 is the rectitude of his nature, his infinite agreement with himself, 
 and the equity of his government and judgment in all the 
 administrations of both. At the remembrance of this we ought to give 
 thanks. 

 (2.) His almighty power: <I>Neither is there any rock</I> (or <I>any
 strength,</I> for so the word is sometimes rendered) <I>like our 
 God.</I> Hannah had experienced a mighty support by staying herself 
 upon him, and therefore speaks as she had found, and seems to refer to 
 that of Moses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:31">Deut. xxxii. 31</A>.

 (3.) His unsearchable wisdom: <I>The Lord,</I> the Judge of all, <I>is
 a God of knowledge;</I> he clearly and perfectly sees into the 
 character of every person and the merits of every cause, and he gives 
 knowledge and understanding to those that seek them of him. 

 (4.) His unerring justice: <I>By him actions are weighed.</I> His own
 are so, in his eternal counsels; the actions of the children of men are 
 so, in the balances of his judgment, so that he will <I>render to every 
 man according to his work,</I> and is not mistaken in what any man is 
 or does.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How she solaces herself in these things. What we give God the glory 
 of we may take the comfort of. Hannah does so, 

 (1.) In holy joy: <I>My heart rejoiceth in the Lord;</I> not so much in
 her son as in her God; he is to be the gladness of our joy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+43:4">Ps. xliii. 4</A>),

 and our joy must not terminate in any thing short of him: "<I>I rejoice
 in thy salvation;</I> not only in this particular favour to me, but in 
 the salvation of thy people Israel, those salvations especially which 
 this child will be an instrument of, and that, above all, by Christ, 
 which those are but the types of."

 (2.) In holy triumph: "<I>My horn is exalted;</I> not only is my
 reputation saved by my having a son, but greatly raised by having such 
 a son." We read of some of the singers whom David appointed to lift up 
 the horn, an instrument of music, in praising God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+25:5">1 Chron. xxv. 5</A>),

 so that, <I>My horn is exalted</I> means this, "My praises are very
 much elevated to an unusual strain." <I>Exalted in the Lord;</I> God is 
 to have the honour of all our exaltations, and in him must we triumph. 
 <I>My mouth is enlarged,</I> that is, "Now I have wherewith to answer 
 those that reproached me." He that has his quiver full of arrows, his 
 house full of children, shall not be ashamed to <I>speak with the enemy 
 in the gate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:5">Ps.  cxxvii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How she herewith silences those that set up themselves as rivals 
 with God and rebels against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Talk no more so exceedingly proudly.</I> Let not Peninnah and her
 children upbraid her any more with her confidence in God and praying to 
 him: at length she found it not in vain. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:10">Mic. vii. 10</A>,

 <I>Then she that is my enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her
 that said, Where is thy God?</I> Or perhaps it was below her to take so 
 much notice of Peninnah, and her malice, in this song; but this is 
 intended as a check to the insolence of the Philistines, and other 
 enemies of God and Israel, that <I>set their mouth against the 
 heavens,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:9">Ps. lxxiii. 9</A>.

 "Let this put them to silence and shame; he that has thus judged for me
 against my adversary will judge for his people against all theirs."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The notice she takes of the wisdom and sovereignty of the divine 
 providence, in its disposals of the affairs of the children of men; 
 such are the vicissitudes of them, and such the strange and sudden 
 turns and revolutions of them, that it is often found a very short step 
 between the height of prosperity and the depth of adversity. <I>God 
 has</I> not only <I>set the one over against the other</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:14">Eccl. vii. 14</A>),

 but the one very near the other, and no gulf fixed between them, that
 we may <I>rejoice as though we rejoiced not</I> and <I>weep as though 
 we wept not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The strong are soon weakened and the weak are soon strengthened, 
 when God pleases, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 On the one hand, if he speak the word, <I>the bows of the mighty men
 are broken;</I> they are disarmed, disabled to do as they have before 
 done and as they have designed to do. Those have been worsted in battle 
 who seemed upon all accounts to have the advantage on their side, and 
 thought themselves sure of victory. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:9,Ps+37:15,17">Ps. xlvi. 9; xxxvii. 15, 17</A>.

 Particular persons are soon weakened by sickness and age, and they find
 that the bow does not long abide in strength; many a mighty man who has 
 gloried in his might has found it a deceitful bow, that failed him when 
 he trusted to it. On the other hand, if the Lord speak the word, those 
 who stumble through weakness, who were so feeble that they could not go 
 straight or steady, are <I>girded with strength,</I> in body and mind, 
 and are able to bring great things to pass. Those who were weakened by 
 sickness return to their vigour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:25">Job xxxiii. 25</A>),

 and those who were brought down by sorrow shall recover their comfort,
 which will <I>confirm the weak hands and the feeble knees,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:3">Isa. xxxv. 3</A>.

 Victory turns in favour of that side that was given up for gone, and
 even <I>the lame take the prey,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:23">Isa. xxxiii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The rich are soon impoverished and the poor strangely enriched on a 
 sudden, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Providence sometimes does so blast men's estates and cross their
 endeavours, and with a fire not blown consume their increase, that 
 those who were full (their barns full, and their bags full, their 
 <I>houses full of good things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:18">Job xxii. 18</A>,

 and their <I>bellies full of these hidden treasures,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>)

 have been reduced to such straits and extremities as to want the
 necessary supports of life, and to <I>hire out themselves for 
 bread,</I> and they must dig, since to <I>beg they are ashamed. Riches 
 flee away</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:5">Prov. xxiii. 5</A>),

 and leave those miserable who, when they had them, placed their
 happiness in them. To those that have been full and free poverty must 
 needs be doubly grievous. But, on the other hand, sometimes Providence 
 so orders it that <I>those who are hungry cease,</I> that is, cease to 
 hire out themselves for bread as they have done. Having, by God's 
 blessing on their industry, got beforehand in the world, and enough to 
 live upon at ease, <I>they shall hunger no more, not thirst any 
 more.</I> This is not to be ascribed to fortune, nor merely to men's 
 wisdom or folly. <I>Riches are not to men of understanding, nor favour 
 to men of skill</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:11">Eccl. ix. 11</A>),

 nor is it always men's own fault that they become poor, but

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 <I>the Lord maketh some poor and maketh others rich;</I> the
 impoverishing of one is the enriching of another, and it is God's 
 doing. To some he gives power to get wealth, from others he takes away 
 power to keep the wealth they have. Are we poor? God made us poor, 
 which is a good reason why we should be content, and reconcile 
 ourselves to our condition. Are we rich? God made us rich, which is a 
 good reason why we should be thankful, and serve him cheerfully in the 
 abundance of good things he gives us. It may be understood of the same 
 person; those that were rich God makes poor, and after awhile makes 
 rich again, as Job; he gave, he takes away, and then gives again. Let 
 not the rich be proud and secure, for God can soon make them poor; let 
 not the poor despond and despair, for God can in due time enrich them 
 again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Empty families are replenished and numerous families diminished and 
 made few. This is the instance that comes close to the occasion of the 
 thanksgiving: <I>The barren hath borne seven,</I> meaning herself, for, 
 though at present she had but one son, yet that one being a Nazarite, 
 devoted to God and employed in his immediate service, he was to her as 
 good as seven. Or it is the language of her faith. Now that she had one 
 she hoped for more, and was not disappointed; she had five more 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 so that if we reckon Samuel but for two, as we well may, she has the
 number she promised herself: the <I>barren hath borne seven,</I> while, 
 on the other hand, <I>she that hath many children has waxed feeble,</I> 
 and hath left bearing. She says no more.  Peninnah is now mortified and 
 crest-fallen. The tradition of the Jews is that when Hannah bore one 
 child Peninnah buried two. There are many instances both of the 
 increase of families that were inconsiderable and the extinguishing of 
 families that made a figure,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:23,Ps+107:38">Job xxii. 23; Ps. cvii. 38</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. God is the sovereign Lord of life and death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The Lord killeth and maketh alive.</I> Understand it,

 (1.) Of God's sovereign dominion and universal agency, in the lives and
 deaths of the children of men. He presides in births and burials.  
 Whenever any die it is God that directs the arrows of death. <I>The 
 Lord killeth.</I> Death is his messenger, strikes whom and when he 
 bids; none are brought to the dust but it is he that brings them down, 
 for in his hand are the <I>keys of death and the grave,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:18">Rev. i. 18</A>.
 
 Whenever any are born it is he that <I>makes them alive. None knows
 what is the way of the spirit,</I> but this we know, that it comes from 
 the <I>Father of spirits.</I> Whenever any are recovered from sickness, 
 and delivered from imminent perils, it is God that bringeth up; for 
 <I>to him belong the issues from death.</I>

 (2.) Of the distinction he makes between some and others: <I>He
 killeth</I> some, and <I>maketh,</I> that is, keepeth, others 
 <I>alive</I> that were in the same danger (in war, suppose, or 
 pestilence), two in a bed together, it may be, one taken by death and 
 the other left alive. <I>Even so, Father, because it seemed good in thy 
 eyes.</I> Some that were most likely to live are brought down to the 
 grave, and others that were as likely to die are brought up; for living 
 and dying do not go by likelihoods. God's providences towards some are 
 killing, ruining to their comforts, and towards others at the same time 
 reviving.

 (3.) Of the change he makes with one and the same person: <I>He killeth
 and bringeth down to the grave,</I> that is, he brings even to death's 
 door, and then revives and raises up, when even life was despaired of 
 and a sentence of death received,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:8,9">2 Cor. i. 8, 9</A>.

 <I>He turns to destruction,</I> and then says, <I>Return,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.

 Nothing is too hard for God to do, no, not the quickening of the dead,
 and putting life into dry bones.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Advancement and abasement are both from him. He brings some low and 
 lifts up others 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 humbles the proud and gives grace and honour to the lowly, lays those
 in the dust that would vie with the God above them and trample upon all 
 about them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:12">Job xl. 12, 13</A>),

 but lifts up those with his salvation that humble themselves before
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:10">Jam. iv. 10</A>.

 Or it may be understood of the same persons: those whom he had brought
 low, when they are sufficiently humbled, he lifteth up. This is 
 enlarged upon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 <I>He raiseth up the poor out of the dust,</I> a low and mean
 condition, nay, from the dunghill, a base and servile condition, 
 loathed, and despised, <I>to set them among princes.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:7,8">Ps. cxiii. 7, 8</A>.

 Promotion comes not by chance, but from the counsel of God, which often
 prefers those that were very unlikely and that men thought very 
 unworthy. Joseph and Daniel, Moses and David, were thus strangely 
 advanced, from a prison to a palace, from a sheep-hook to a sceptre.  
 The princes they are set among may be tempted to disdain them, but God 
 can establish the honour which he gives thus surprisingly, and make 
 them even to <I>inherit the throne of glory.</I> Let not those whom 
 Providence has thus preferred be upbraided with the dust and dunghill 
 they are raised out of, for the meaner their beginnings were the more 
 they are favoured, and God is glorified, in their advancement, if it be 
 by lawful and honourable means.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. A reason is given for all these dispensations which obliges us to 
 acquiesce in them, how surprising soever they are: <I>For the pillars 
 of the earth are the Lord's.</I> 

 (1.) If we understand this literally, it intimates God's almighty
 power, which cannot be controlled. He upholds the whole creation, 
 founded the earth, and still sustains it by the word of his power. What 
 cannot he do in the affairs of families and kingdoms, far beyond our 
 conception and expectation, <I>who hangs the earth upon nothing?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:7">Job xxvi. 7</A>.
 
 But,

 (2.) If we understand it figuratively, it intimates his incontestable
 sovereignty, which cannot be disputed. The princes and great ones of 
 the earth, the directors of states and governments, are the <I>pillars 
 of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:3">Ps.  lxxv. 3</A>.

 On these hinges the affairs of the world seem to turn, but they are the
 Lord's, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:9">Ps. xlvii. 9</A>.

 From him they have their power, and therefore he may advance whom he
 pleases; and who may say, <I>What doest thou?</I></P>

 III. A prediction of the preservation and advancement of all God's 
 faithful friends, and the destruction of all his and their enemies. 
 Having testified her joyful triumph in what God had done, and is doing, 
 she concludes with joyful hopes of what he would do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 Pious affections (says bishop Patrick) in those days rose many times to
 the height of prophecy, whereby God continued in that nation his true 
 religion, in the midst of their idolatrous inclinations. This prophecy 
 may refer,

 1. More immediately to the government of Israel by Samuel, and by David
 whom he was employed to anoint. The Israelites, God's saints, should be 
 protected and delivered; the Philistines, their enemies, should be 
 conquered and subdued, and particularly by <I>thunder,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:10"><I>ch.</I> vii. 10</A>.

 Their dominions should be enlarged, king David strengthened and greatly
 exalted, and Israel (that in the time of the judges had made so small a 
 figure and had much ado to subsist) should now shortly become great and 
 considerable, and give law to all its neighbours. An extraordinary 
 change that was; and the birth of Samuel was, as it were, the dawning 
 of that day. But, 

 2. We have reason to think that this prophecy looks further, to the
 kingdom of Christ, and the administration of that kingdom of grace, of 
 which she now comes to speak, having spoken so largely of the kingdom 
 of providence. And here is the first time that we meet with the name 
 <I>Messiah,</I> or <I>his Anointed.</I> The ancient expositors, both 
 Jewish and Christian, make it to look beyond David, to the Son of 
 David. Glorious things are here spoken of the kingdom of the Mediator, 
 both before and since his incarnation; for the method of the 
 administration of it, both by the eternal Word and by that Word made 
 flesh, is much the same. Concerning that kingdom we are here assured,

 (1.) That all the loyal subjects of it shall be carefully and
 powerfully protected

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>He will keep the feet of his saints.</I> There are a people in the
 world that are God's saints, his select and sanctified ones; and he 
 will keep their feet, that is, all that belongs to them shall be under 
 his protection, down to their very feet, the lowest part of the body. 
 If he will keep their feet, much more their head and hearts. Or he will 
 keep their feet, that is, he will secure the ground they stand on, and 
 establish their goings; he will set a guard of grace upon their 
 affections and actions, that their feet may neither wander out of the 
 way nor stumble in the way. When their feet are ready to slip

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:2">Ps.  lxxiii. 2</A>)

 <I>his mercy holdeth them up</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:18">Ps. xciv. 18</A>)
 
 and <I>keepeth them from falling,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:24">Jude 24</A>.

 While we keep God's ways he will keep our feet. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:23,24">Ps. xxxvii. 23, 24</A>.

 (2.) That all the powers engaged against it shall not be able to effect
 the ruin of it. By strength shall no man prevail. God's strength is 
 engaged for the church; and, while it is so, man's strength shall not 
 prevail against it. The church seems destitute of strength, her friends 
 few and feeble, but prevalency does not go by human strength, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:16">Ps. xxxiii. 16</A>.
 
 God neither needs it for him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:10">Ps. cxlvii. 10</A>)
 
 nor dreads it against him.

 (3.) That all the enemies of it will certainly be broken and brought
 down: <I>The wicked shall be silent in darkness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 They shall be struck both blind and dumb, not be able to see their way
 nor have any thing to say for themselves. Damned sinners are sentenced 
 to utter darkness, and in it they will be for ever speechless,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:12,13">Matt.  xxii. 12, 13</A>.
 
 The wicked are called <I>the adversaries of the Lord,</I> and it is
 foretold 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 that they <I>shall be broken to pieces.</I> Their designs against his
 kingdom among men will all be dashed, and they themselves destroyed; 
 how can those speed better that are in arms against Omnipotence? See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:27">Luke xix. 27</A>.

 God has many ways of doing it, and, rather than fail, from <I>heaven
 shall he thunder upon them,</I> and so, not only put them in terror and 
 consternation, but bring them to destruction. Who can stand before 
 God's thunderbolts? 

 (4.) That the conquests of this kingdom shall extend themselves to
 distant regions: <I>The Lord shall judge the ends of the earth.</I> 
 David's victories and dominions reached far, but the <I>uttermost parts 
 of the earth</I> are promised to the Messiah for his <I>possession</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:8">Ps. ii. 8</A>),

 to be either reduced to his golden sceptre or ruined by his iron rod.
 God is Judge of all, and he will judge for his people against his and 
 their enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:5,6">Ps. cx. 5, 6</A>.

 (5.) That the power and honour of Messiah the prince shall grow and
 increase more and more: <I>He shall give strength unto his king,</I> 
 for the accomplishing of his great undertaking 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:21">Ps. lxxxix. 21</A>,

 and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:43">Luke xxii. 43</A>),

 strengthen him to go through the difficulties of his humiliation, and 
 in his exaltation he will <I>lift up the head</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:7">Ps. cx. 7</A>),

 lift up the horn, the power and honour, of his <I>anointed,</I> and
 <I>make him higher than the kings of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:27">Ps. lxxxix. 27</A>.

 This crowns the triumph, and is, more than any thing, the matter of her
 exultation. Her <I>horn is exalted</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 because she foresees the horn of the Messiah will be so. This secures
 the hope. The subjects of Christ's kingdom will be safe, and the 
 enemies of it will be ruined, for the anointed, the Lord Christ, is 
 girded with strength, and is able to save and destroy unto the 
 uttermost.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did
 minister unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> before Eli the priest.
 &nbsp; 12 Now the sons of Eli <I>were</I> sons of Belial; they knew not the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 13 And the priests' custom with the people <I>was, that,</I> when
 any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the
 flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his
 hand;
 &nbsp; 14 And he struck <I>it</I> into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or
 pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for
 himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came
 thither.
 &nbsp; 15 Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came,
 and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the
 priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.
 &nbsp; 16 And <I>if</I> any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn
 the fat presently, and <I>then</I> take <I>as much</I> as thy soul
 desireth; then he would answer him, <I>Nay;</I> but thou shalt give
 <I>it me</I> now: and if not, I will take <I>it</I> by force.
 &nbsp; 17 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for men abhorred the offering of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 18 But Samuel ministered before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>being</I> a child,
 girded with a linen ephod.
 &nbsp; 19 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought <I>it</I>
 to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to
 offer the yearly sacrifice.
 &nbsp; 20 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. And they went unto their own home.
 &nbsp; 21 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare
 three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 22 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto
 all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled <I>at</I>
 the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
 &nbsp; 23 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of
 your evil dealings by all this people.
 &nbsp; 24 Nay, my sons; for <I>it is</I> no good report that I hear: ye
 make the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s people to transgress.
 &nbsp; 25 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him:
 but if a man sin against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, who shall intreat for him?
 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their
 father, because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> would slay them.
 &nbsp; 26 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and also with men.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have the good character and posture of Elkanah's 
 family, and the bad character and posture of Eli's family. The account 
 of these two is observably interwoven throughout this whole paragraph, 
 as if the historian intended to set the one over against the other, 
 that they might set off one another. The devotion and good order of 
 Elkanah's family aggravated the iniquity of Eli's house; while the 
 wickedness of Eli's sons made Samuel's early piety appear the more 
 bright and illustrious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let us see how well things went in Elkanah's family and how much 
 better than formerly. 

 1. Eli dismissed them from the house of the Lord, when they had entered
 their little son there, with a blessing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 He blessed as one having authority: <I>The Lord give thee</I> more
 children <I>of this woman, for the loan that is lent to the Lord.</I> 
 If Hannah had then had many children, it would not have been such a 
 generous piece of piety to part with one out of many for the service of 
 the tabernacle; but when she had but one, an only one whom she loved, 
 her Isaac, to present him to the Lord was such an act of heroic piety 
 as should by no means lose its reward. As when Abraham had offered 
 Isaac he received the promise of a numerous issue

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:16,17">Gen. xxii. 16, 17</A>),

 so did Hannah, when she had presented Samuel unto the Lord a living
 sacrifice. Note, What is lent to the Lord will certainly be repaid with 
 interest, to our unspeakable advantage, and oftentimes in kind. Hannah 
 resigns one child to God, and is recompensed with five; for Eli's 
 blessing took effect

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>She bore three sons and two daughters.</I> There is nothing lost by
 lending to God or losing for him; it shall be repaid <I>a 
 hundred-fold,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:29">Matt. xix. 29</A>.

 2. They returned to their own habitation.  This is twice mentioned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>,
 
 and again

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 It was very pleasant to attend at God's house, to bless him, and to be
 blessed of him. But they have a family at home that must be looked 
 after, and thither they return, cheerfully leaving the dear little one 
 behind them, knowing they left him in a good place; and it does not 
 appear that he cried after them, but was as willing to stay as they 
 were to leave him, so soon did he <I>put away childish things</I> and 
 behave like a man.

 3. They kept up their constant attendance at the house of God with
 their <I>yearly sacrifice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 They did not think that their son's ministering there would excuse
 them, or that that offering must serve instead of other offerings; but, 
 having found the benefit of drawing near to God, they would omit no 
 appointed season for it, and now they had one loadstone more in Shiloh 
 to draw them thither. We may suppose they went thither to see their 
 child oftener than once a year, for it was not ten miles from Ramah; 
 but their annual visit is taken notice of because then they brought 
 their yearly sacrifice, and then Hannah fitted up her son (and some 
 think oftener than once a year) with a new suit of clothes, <I>a little 
 coat</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:19"><I>v.</I>  19</A>)

 and every thing belonging to it. She undertook to find him with clothes
 during his apprenticeship at the tabernacle, and took care he should be 
 well provided, that he might appear the more decent and sightly in his 
 ministration, and to encourage him in his towardly beginnings. Parents 
 must take care that their children want nothing that is fit for them, 
 whether they are with them or from them; but those that are dutiful and 
 hopeful, and minister to the Lord, must be thought worthy of double 
 care and kindness. 

 4. The child Samuel did very well. Four separate times he is mentioned
 in these verses, and two things we are told of:--

 (1.) The service he did to the Lord. He did well indeed, for he
 <I>ministered to the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:11,18"><I>v.</I> 11, 18</A>)

 according as his capacity was. He learned his catechism and was
 constant to his devotions, soon learned to read, and took a pleasure in 
 the book of the law, and thus he <I>ministered to the Lord.</I> He 
 ministered before Eli, that is, under his inspection, and as he ordered 
 him, not before Eli's sons; all parties were agreed that they were 
 unfit to be his tutors. Perhaps he attended immediately on Eli's 
 person, was ready to him to fetch and bring as he had occasion, and 
 that is called <I>ministering to the Lord.</I> Some little services 
 perhaps he was employed in about the altar, though much under the age 
 appointed by the law for the Levites' ministration. He could light a 
 candle, or hold a dish, or run on an errand, or shut a door; and, 
 because he did this with a pious disposition of mind it is called 
 <I>ministering to the Lord,</I> and great notice is taken of it. After 
 awhile he did his work so well that Eli appointed that he should 
 minister with a <I>linen ephod</I> as the priests did (though he was no 
 priest), because he saw that God was with him. Note, Little children 
 must learn betimes to <I>minister to the Lord.</I> Parents must train 
 them up to it, and God will accept them. Particularly let them learn to 
 pay respect to their teachers, as Samuel to Eli. None can begin too 
 soon to be religious.  See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:2,Mt+21:15,16">Ps. viii. 2, and Matt.  xxi. 15, 16</A>.

 (2.) The blessing he received from the Lord: He <I>grew before the
 Lord,</I> as a tender plant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),
 
 <I>grew on</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>)

 in strength and stature, and especially in wisdom and understanding and
 fitness for business. Note, Those young people that serve God as well 
 as they can will obtain grace to improve, that they may serve him 
 better. Those that are planted in God's house shall <I>flourish,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:13">Ps. xcii. 13</A>.

 <I>He was in favour with the Lord and with man.</I> Note, It is a great
 encouragement to children to be tractable, and virtuous, and good 
 betimes, that if they be both God and man will love them. Such children 
 are the darlings both of heaven and earth. What is here said of Samuel 
 is said of our blessed Saviour, that great example,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:52">Luke  ii. 52</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us now see how ill things went in Eli's family, though seated 
 at the very door of the tabernacle. The nearer the church the further 
 from God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The abominable wickedness of Eli's sons 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>The sons of Eli were sons of Belial.</I> It is emphatically
 expressed. Nothing appears to the contrary but that Eli himself was a 
 very good man, and no doubt had educated his sons well, giving them 
 good instructions, setting them good examples, and putting up many a 
 good prayer for them; and yet, when they grew up, they proved <I>sons 
 of Belial,</I> profane wicked men, and arrant rakes: <I>They knew not 
 the Lord.</I> They could not but have a notional knowledge of God and 
 his law, a form of knowledge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:20">Rom. ii. 20</A>),

 yet, because their practice was not conformable to it, they are spoken
 of as wholly ignorant of God; they lived as if they knew nothing at all 
 of God. Note, Parents cannot give grace to their children, nor does it 
 run in the blood. Many that are sincerely pious themselves live to see 
 those that come from them notoriously impious and profane; <I>for the 
 race is not to the swift.</I> Eli was high priest and judge in Israel. 
 His sons were priests by their birth. Their character was sacred and 
 honourable, and obliged them, for their reputation-sake, to observe 
 decorum. They were resident at the fountain-head both of magistracy and 
 ministry, and yet they were <I>sons of Belial,</I> and their honour, 
 power, and learning, made them so much the worse. They did not go to 
 <I>serve other gods,</I> as those did that lived at a distance from the 
 altar, for from the house of God they had their wealth and dignity; 
 but, which was worse, they managed the service of God as if he had been 
 one of the dunghill deities of the heathen. It is hard to say which 
 dishonours God more, idolatry or profaneness, especially the 
 profaneness of the priests. Let us see the wickedness of Eli's sons; 
 and it is a sad sight.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They profaned the offerings of the Lord, and made a gain to 
 themselves, or rather a gratification of their own luxury, out of them. 
 God had provided competently for them out of the sacrifices. <I>The 
 offerings of the Lord made by fire</I> were a considerable branch of 
 their revenue, but not enough to please them; they served not the God 
 of Israel, but their own bellies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:18">Rom. xvi. 18</A>),

 being such as the prophet calls <I>greedy dogs that can never have
 enough,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:11">Isa.  lvi. 11</A>.

 [1.] They robbed the offerers, and seized for themselves some of their
 part of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings.  The priests had for 
 their share the <I>wave-breast</I> and the <I>heave shoulder</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:34">Lev. vii. 34</A>),

 but these did not content them; when the flesh was boiling for the
 offerer to feast upon religiously with his friends, they sent a servant 
 with a flesh-hook of three teeth, a trident, and that must be stuck 
 into the pot, and whatever that brought up the priest must have

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>),

 and the people, out of their great veneration, suffered this to grow
 into a custom, so that after awhile prescription was pleaded for this 
 manifest wrong. 

 [2.] They stepped in before God himself, and encroached upon his right
 too. <I>As if it were a small thing to weary men, they wearied my God 
 also,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:13">Isa. vii. 13</A>.

 Be it observed, to the honour of Israel, that though the people tamely
 yielded to their unwarrantable demands from them, yet they were very 
 solicitous that God should not be robbed: <I>Let them not fail to burn 
 the fat presently,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Let the altar have its due, for that is the main matter. Unless God
 have the fat, they can feast with little comfort upon the flesh. It was 
 a shame that the priests should need to be thus admonished by the 
 people of their duty; but they regarded not the admonition. The priest 
 will be served first, and will take what he thinks fit of the fat too, 
 for he is weary of boiled meat, he must have roast, and, in order to 
 that, they must give it to him raw; and if the offerer dispute it, 
 though not in his own favour (let the priest take what he pleases of 
 his part) but in favour of the altar (let them be sure to <I>burn the 
 fat</I> first), even the priest's servant had grown so very imperious 
 that he would either have it now or take it by force, than which there 
 could not be a greater affront to God nor a greater abuse to the 
 people. The effect was, <I>First,</I> That God was displeased: <I>The 
 sin of the young men was very great before the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Nothing is more provoking to God than the profanation of sacred things,
 and men serving their lusts with the offerings of the Lord. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> That religion suffered by it: <I>Men abhorred the 
 offerings of the Lord.</I> All good men abhorred their management of 
 the offerings, and too many insensibly fell into a contempt of the 
 offerings themselves for their sakes. It was the people's sin to think 
 the worse of God's institutions, but it was the much greater sin of the 
 priests that gave them occasion to do so. Nothing brings a greater 
 reproach upon religion than ministers' covetousness, sensuality, and 
 imperiousness. In the midst of this sad story comes in the repeated 
 mention of Samuel's devotion. <I>But Samuel ministered before the 
 Lord,</I> as an instance of the power of God's grace, in preserving him 
 pure and pious in the midst of this wicked crew; and this helped to 
 keep up the sinking credit of the sanctuary in the minds of the people, 
 who, when they had said all they could against Eli's sons, could not 
 but admire Samuel's seriousness, and speak well of religion for his 
 sake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They debauched the women that came to worship at the door of the 
 tabernacle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 They had wives of their own, but were like <I>fed horses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:8">Jer. v. 8</A>.
 
 To have gone to the harlots' houses, the common prostitutes, would have
 been abominable wickedness, but to use the interest which as priests 
 they had in those women that had devout dispositions and were 
 religiously inclined, and to bring them to commit their wickedness, was 
 such horrid impiety as one can scarcely think it possible that men who 
 called themselves priests should ever be guilty of. <I>Be astonished, O 
 heavens! at this, and tremble, O earth!</I> No words can sufficiently 
 express the villany of such practices as these.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The reproof which Eli gave his sons for this their wickedness: 
 <I>Eli was very old</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 and could not himself inspect the service of the tabernacle as he had
 done, but left all to his sons, who, because of the infirmities of his 
 age, slighted him, and did what they would. However, he was told of the 
 wickedness of his sons, and we may well imagine what a heart-breaking 
 it was to him, and how much it added to the burdens of his age; but it 
 should seem he did not so much as reprove them till he heard of their 
 debauching the women, and then he thought fit to give them a check. Had 
 he rebuked them for their greediness and luxury, this might have been 
 prevented. Young people should be told of their faults as soon as it is 
 perceived that they begin to be extravagant, lest their hearts be 
 hardened. Now concerning the reproof he gave them observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That it was very just and rational. That which he said was very 
 proper. 

 [1.] He tells them that the matter of fact was too plain to be denied
 and too public to be concealed: "<I>I hear of your evil dealings by all 
 this people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 It is not the surmise of one or two, but the avowed testimony of many;
 all your neighbours cry out shame on you, and bring their complaints to
 me, expecting that I should redress the grievance."

 [2.] He shows them the bad consequences of it, that they not only
 sinned, but made Israel to sin, and would have the people's sin to
 answer for as well as their own: "You that should turn men from
 iniquity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:6">Mal. ii. 6</A>),

 <I>you make the Lord's people to transgress,</I> and corrupt the nation
 instead of reforming it; you tempt people to go and serve other gods
 when they see the God of Israel so ill served."

 [3.] He warns them of the danger they brought themselves into by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 He intimates to them what God afterwards told him, that the
 <I>iniquity</I> would not be <I>purged with sacrifice nor offering,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+3:14"><I>ch.</I> iii. 14</A>.

 <I>If one man sin against another,</I> the judge (that is, the priest,
 who was appointed to be the judge in many cases, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:9">Deut. xvii. 9</A>)

 <I>shall judge him,</I> shall undertake his cause, arbitrate the
 matter, and make atonement for the offender; <I>but if a man sin 
 against the Lord</I> (that is, if a priest profane the holy things of 
 the Lord, if a man that deals with God for others do himself affront 
 him) <I>who shall entreat for him?</I> Eli was himself a judge, and had 
 often made intercession for transgressors, but, says he, "You that 
 <I>sin against the Lord,</I>" that is, "against the law and honour of 
 God, in those very things which immediately pertain to him, and by 
 which reconciliation is to be made, how can I entreat for you?" Their 
 condition was deplorable indeed when their own father could not speak a 
 good word for them, nor could have the face to appear as their 
 advocate. Sins against the remedy, the atonement itself, are most 
 dangerous, <I>treading under foot the blood of the covenant,</I> for 
 then there <I>remains no more sacrifice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:26">Heb. x. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It was too mild and gentle. He should have rebuked them sharply. 
 Their crimes deserved sharpness; their temper needed it; the softness 
 of his dealing with them would but harden them the more. The 
 animadversion was too easy when he said, <I>It is no good report.</I> 
 he should have said, "It is a shameful scandalous thing, and not to be 
 suffered!" Whether it was because he loved them or because he feared 
 them that he dealt thus tenderly with them, it was certainly an 
 evidence of his want of zeal for the honour of God and his sanctuary. 
 He bound them over to God's judgment, but he should have taken 
 cognizance of their crimes himself, as high priest and judge, and have 
 restrained and punished them. What he said was right, but it was not 
 enough.  Note, It is sometimes necessary that we put an edge upon the 
 reproofs we give. There are those that must be saved <I>with fear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:23">Jude 23</A>.

 3. Their obstinacy against this reproof. His lenity did not at
 all work upon them: They <I>hearkened not to their father,</I> though 
 he was also a judge. They had no regard either to his authority or to 
 his affection, which was to them <I>an evident token of perdition;</I> 
 it was <I>because the Lord would slay them.</I> They had long hardened 
 their hearts, and now God, in a way of righteous judgment, hardened 
 their hearts, and seared their consciences, and withheld from them the 
 grace they had resisted and forfeited. Note, Those that are deaf to the 
 reproofs of wisdom are manifestly marked for ruin. The Lord has 
 <I>determined to destroy them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:16">2 Chron. xxv. 16</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:1">Prov. xxix. 1</A>.
 
 Immediately upon this, Samuel's tractableness is again mentioned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 to shame their obstinacy: <I>The child Samuel grew.</I> God's grace is
 his own; he denied it to the sons of the high priest and gave it to the 
 child of an obscure country Levite.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him,
 Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy
 father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?
 &nbsp; 28 And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel <I>to be</I>
 my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an
 ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all
 the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
 &nbsp; 29 Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering,
 which I have commanded <I>in my</I> habitation; and honourest thy sons
 above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the
 offerings of Israel my people?
 &nbsp; 30 Wherefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel saith, I said indeed <I>that</I>
 thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for
 ever: but now the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> saith, Be it far from me; for them that
 honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be
 lightly esteemed.
 &nbsp; 31 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and
 the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man
 in thine house.
 &nbsp; 32 And thou shalt see an enemy <I>in my</I> habitation, in all <I>the
 wealth</I> which <I>God</I> shall give Israel: and there shall not be an
 old man in thine house for ever.
 &nbsp; 33 And the man of thine, <I>whom</I> I shall not cut off from mine
 altar, <I>shall be</I> to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine
 heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the
 flower of their age.
 &nbsp; 34 And this <I>shall be</I> a sign unto thee, that shall come upon
 thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die
 both of them.
 &nbsp; 35 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, <I>that</I> shall do
 according to <I>that</I> which <I>is</I> in mine heart and in my mind: and
 I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine
 anointed for ever.
 &nbsp; 36 And it shall come to pass, <I>that</I> every one that is left in
 thine house shall come <I>and</I> crouch to him for a piece of silver
 and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into
 one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Eli reproved his sons too gently, and did not threaten them as he 
 should, and therefore God sent a prophet to him to reprove him sharply, 
 and to threaten him, because, by his indulgence of them, he had 
 strengthened their hands in their wickedness. If good men be wanting in 
 their duty, and by their carelessness and remissness contribute any 
 thing to the sin of sinners, they must expect both to hear of it and to 
 smart for it. Eli's family was now nearer to God than all <I>the 
 families of the earth, and therefore he will punish them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:2">Amos iii. 2</A>.
 
 The message is sent to Eli himself, because God would bring him to
 repentance and save him; not to his sons, whom he had determined to 
 destroy. And it might have been a means of awakening him to do his duty 
 at last, and so to have prevented the judgment, but we do not find it 
 had any great effect upon him. The message this prophet delivers from 
 God is very close.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He reminds him of the great things God had done for the house of his 
 fathers and for his family. He appeared to Aaron in Egypt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:27">Exod. iv. 27</A>),
 
 in the house of bondage, as a token of further favour which he designed
 for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 He advanced him to the priesthood, entailed it upon his family, and
 thereby dignified it above any of the families of Israel.  He entrusted 
 him with honourable work, to offer on God's altar, <I>to burn 
 incense,</I> and to wear that ephod in which was the breast-plate of 
 judgment. He settled upon him an honourable maintenance, a share out of 
 <I>all the offerings made by fire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 What could he have done more for them, to engage them to be faithful to
 him? Note, The distinguishing favours we have received from God, 
 especially those of the spiritual priesthood, are great aggravations of 
 sin, and will be remembered against us in the day of account, if we 
 profane our crown and betray our trusts,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:6,2Sa+12:7,8">Deut. xxxii. 6; 2 Sam. xii. 7, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He exhibits a high charge against him and his family. His children 
 did wickedly, and he connived at it, and thereby involved himself in 
 the guilt; the indictment therefore runs against them all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 1.  His sons had impiously profaned the holy things of God: "<I>You
 kick at my sacrifice which I have commanded;</I> not only trample upon 
 the institution as a mean thing, but spurn at it as a thing you hate to 
 be tied up to." They did the utmost despite imaginable to the offerings 
 of the Lord when they committed all that outrage and rapine about them 
 that we read of, and violently plundered the pots on which, in effect, 
 <I>Holiness to the Lord</I> was written

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:20">Zech. xiv. 20</A>),

 and took that fat to themselves which God had appointed to be burnt on
 his altar. 

 2. Eli had bolstered them up in it, by not punishing their insolence
 and impiety: "Thou for thy part <I>honourest thy sons above me,</I>" 
 that is, "thou hadst rather see my offerings disgraced by their 
 profanation of them than see thy sons disgraced by a legal censure upon 
 them for so doing, which ought to have been inflicted, even to 
 suspension and deprivation <I>ab officio et beneficio--of their office 
 and its emoluments.</I>" Those that allow and countenance their 
 children in any evil way, and do not use their authority to restrain 
 and punish them, do in effect <I>honour them more than God,</I> being 
 more tender of their reputation than of his glory and more desirous to 
 humour them than to honour him. 

 3. They had all shared in the gains of the sacrilege. It is to be
 feared that Eli himself, though he disliked and reproved the abuses 
 they committed, yet did not forbear to eat of the roast meat they 
 sacrilegiously got, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 He was a <I>fat heavy man</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:18"><I>ch.</I> iv. 18</A>),

 and therefore it is charged upon the whole family (though Hophni and
 Phinehas were principally guilty), <I>You make yourselves fat with the 
 chief of all the offerings.</I> God gave them sufficient to feed them, 
 but that would not suffice; they made themselves fat, and served their 
 lusts with that which God was to be served with. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:8">Hos. iv. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He declares the cutting off of the entail of the high priesthood 
 from his family 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 "<I>The Lord God of Israel,</I> who is jealous for his own honour and
 Israel's, says, and lets thee know it, that thy commission is revoked 
 and superseded." <I>I said, indeed, that thy house, and the house of 
 thy father</I> Ithamar (for from that younger son of Aaron Eli 
 descended), <I>should walk before me for ever.</I> Upon what occasion 
 the dignity of the high priesthood was transferred from the family of 
 Eleazar to that of Ithamar does not appear; but it seems this had been 
 done, and Eli stood fair to have that honour perpetuated to his 
 posterity. But observe, the promise carried its own condition along 
 with it: <I>They shall walk before me forever,</I> that is, "they shall 
 have the honour, provided they faithfully do the service." <I>Walking 
 before God</I> is the great condition of the covenant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:1">Gen. xvii. 1</A>.

 Let them set me before their face, and I will set them before my face
 continually

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:12">Ps. xli. 12</A>),

 otherwise not. But now the Lord says, <I>Be it far from me.</I> "Now
 that you cast me off you can expect no other than that I should cast 
 you off; you will not walk before me as you should, and therefore you 
 shall not." Such wicked and abusive servants God will discard, and turn 
 out of his service. Some think there is a further reach in this recall 
 of the grant, and that it was not only to be fulfilled shortly in the 
 deposing of the posterity of Eli, when Zadok, who descended from 
 Eleazar, was put in Abiathar's room, but it was to have its complete 
 accomplishment at length in the total abolition of the Levitical 
 priesthood by the priesthood of Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He gives a good reason for this revocation, taken from a settled 
 and standing rule of God's government, according to which all must 
 expect to be dealt with (like that by which Cain was tried, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:7">Gen. iv. 7</A>):
 
 <I>Those that honour me I will honour, and those that despise me shall
 be lightly esteemed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Observe in general, 

 (1.) That God is the fountain of honour and dishonour; he can exalt the
 meanest and put contempt upon the greatest.

 (2.) As we deal with God we must expect to be dealt with by him, and
 yet more favourably than we deserve. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:25,26">Ps. xviii. 25, 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Particularly, 

 (1.) Be it spoken, to the everlasting reputation of religion or of
 serious godliness, that it gives honour to God and puts honour upon 
 men. By it we seek and serve the glory of God, and he will be 
 behind-hand with none that do so, but here and hereafter will secure 
 their glory. The way to be truly great is to be truly good. If we 
 humble and deny ourselves in any thing to honour God, and have a single 
 eye to him in it, we may depend upon this promise, he will put the best 
 honour upon us. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:26">John xii. 26</A>.

 (2.) Be it spoken, to the everlasting reproach of impiety or
 profaneness, that this does dishonour to God (despises the greatest and 
 best of beings, whom angels adore) and will bring dishonour upon men, 
 for those that do so shall be lightly esteemed; not only God will 
 lightly esteem them (that perhaps they will not regard, as those that 
 honour him value his honour, of whom therefore it is said, <I>I will 
 honour them</I>), but they shall be lightly esteemed by all the world; 
 the very honour they are proud of shall be laid in the dust; they shall 
 see themselves despised by all mankind, their names a reproach; when 
 they are gone, their memory shall rot, and, when they rise again, it 
 shall be to everlasting shame and contempt. The dishonour which their 
 impotent malice puts upon God and his omnipotent justice will return 
 upon their own heads, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:12">Ps. lxxix. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He foretels the particular judgments which should come upon his 
 family, to its perpetual ignominy. A curse should be entailed upon his 
 posterity, and a terrible curse it is, and shows how jealous God is in 
 the matters of his worship and how ill he takes it when those who are 
 bound by their character and profession to preserve and advance the 
 interests of his glory are false to their trust, and betray them. If 
 God's ministers be vicious and profane, <I>of how much sorer punishment 
 will they be thought worthy,</I> here and for ever, than other sinners! 
 Let such read the doom here passed on Eli's house, and tremble. It is 
 threatened,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That their power should be broken 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>I will cut off thy arm, and the arm of thy father's house.</I> They
 should be stripped of all their authority, should be deposed, and have 
 no influence upon the people as they had had. God <I>would make them 
 contemptible and base.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:8,9">Mal. ii. 8, 9</A>.

 The sons had abused their power to oppress the people and encroach upon
 their rights, and the father had not used his power, as he ought to 
 have done, to restrain and punish them, and therefore it was justly 
 threatened that the arm should be cut off which was not stretched out 
 as it should have been.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That their lives should be shortened. He was himself an old man; but 
 instead of using the wisdom, gravity, experience, and authority of his 
 age, for the service of God and the support of religion, he had 
 suffered the infirmities of age to make him more cool and remiss in his 
 duty, and therefore it is here threatened that none of his posterity 
 should live to be old, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.

 It is twice spoken: "<I>There shall not be an old man in thy house for
 ever;</I>" and again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),
 
 "<I>All the increase of thy house,</I> from generation to generation,
 <I>shall die in the flower of their age,</I> when they are in the midst 
 of the years of their service," so that though the family should not be 
 extinct, yet it should never be considerable, nor should any member of 
 it come to be eminent in his day. Bishop Patrick relates, out of some 
 of the Jewish writers, that long after this, there being a family in 
 Jerusalem none of which commonly lived above eighteen years, upon 
 search it was found that they descended from the house of Eli, on which 
 this sentence was passed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That all their comforts should be embittered. 

 (1.) The comfort they had in the sanctuary, in its wealth and
 prosperity: <I>Thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation.</I> This was 
 fulfilled in the Philistines' invasions and the mischiefs they did to 
 Israel, by which the country was impoverished

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:19"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 19</A>),

 and no doubt the priests' incomes were thereby very much impaired. The
 captivity of the ark was such an act of hostility committed upon God's 
 habitation as broke Eli's heart. As it is a blessing to a family to see 
 <I>peace upon Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:5,6">Ps. cxxviii. 5, 6</A>),

 so the contrary is a sore judgment upon a family, especially a family
 of priests.

 (2.) The comfort of their children: "<I>The man of thine whom I shall
 not cut off by an untimely death</I> shall live to be a blot and burden 
 to the family, a scandal and vexation to his relations; he shall be to 
 <I>consume thy eyes</I> and <I>grieve thy heart,</I> for his 
 foolishness or his sickliness, his wickedness or his poverty." Grief 
 for a dead child is great, but for a bad child often greater.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That their substance should be wasted and they should be reduced to 
 extreme poverty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 "<I>He that is left</I> alive <I>in thy house</I> shall have little joy
 of his life, for want of a livelihood; he shall come and crouch to the 
 succeeding family for a subsistence."

 (1.) He shall beg for the smallest alms--<I>a piece of silver</I> (and
 the word signifies the <I>least</I> piece) and <I>a morsel of 
 bread.</I> See how this answered the sin. Eli's sons must have the best 
 pieces of flesh, but their sons will be glad of <I>a morsel of 
 bread.</I> Note, Want is the just punishment of wantonness. Those who 
 could not be content without dainties and varieties are brought, they 
 or theirs, to want necessaries, and the Lord is righteous in thus 
 visiting them. 

 (2.) He shall beg for the meanest office: <I>Put me into somewhat
 belonging to the priesthood</I> (as it is in the original); <I>make me 
 as one of the hired servants,</I> the fittest place for a prodigal. 
 Plenty and power are forfeited when they are abused. They should not be 
 able to pretend to any good preferment, not to any place at the altar, 
 but should petition for some poor employment, be the work ever so hard 
 and the wages ever so small, so they might but get bread.  This, it is 
 probable, was fully accomplished when Abiathar, who was of Eli's race, 
 was deposed by Solomon for treason, and he and his turned out of office 
 in the temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:26,27">1 Kings ii. 26, 27</A>),

 by which it is easy to think his posterity were reduced to the
 extremities here described.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That God would shortly begin to execute these judgments in the death 
 of Hophni and Phinehas, the sad tidings of which Eli himself should 
 live to hear: <I>This shall be a sign to thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 When thou hearest it, say, "Now the word of God begins to operate; here
 is one threatening fulfilled, from which I infer that all the rest will 
 be fulfilled in their order." Hophni and Phinehas had many a time 
 sinned together, and it is here foretold that they should die together 
 both in one day. Bind these tares in a bundle for the fire. This was 
 fulfilled,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:11"><I>ch.</I>  iv. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. In the midst of all these threatenings against the house of Eli, 
 here is mercy promised to Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>I will raise me up a faithful priest.</I> 

 1. This was fulfilled in Zadoc, of the family of Eleazar, who came into
 Abiathar's place in the beginning of Solomon's reign, and was faithful 
 to his trust; and the high priests were of his posterity as long as the 
 Levitical priesthood continued. Note, The wickedness of ministers, 
 though it destroy themselves, yet it shall not destroy the ministry.  
 How bad soever the officers are, the office shall continue always to 
 the end of the world.  If some betray their trust, yet others shall be 
 raised up that will be true to it. God's work shall never fall to the 
 ground for want of hands to carry it on.  The high priest is here said 
 to <I>walk before God's anointed</I> (that is, David and his seed) 
 because he wore the breast-plate of judgment, which he was to consult, 
 not in common cases, but for the king, in the affairs of state. Note, 
 Notwithstanding the degeneracy we see and lament in many families, God 
 will secure to himself a succession. If some grow worse than their 
 ancestors, others, to balance that, shall grow better. 

 2. It has its full accomplishment in the priesthood of Christ, that
 merciful and faithful high priest whom God raised up when the Levitical 
 priesthood was thrown off, who in all things did his father's mind, and 
 for whom God will build a sure house, build it on a rock, so that the 
 gates of hell cannot prevail against it.</P>
