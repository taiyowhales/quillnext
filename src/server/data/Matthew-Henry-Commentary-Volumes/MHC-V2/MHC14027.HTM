 Here is a very short account of the reign of Jotham, a pious prosperous
 prince, of whom one would wish to have known more: but we may better
 dispense with the brevity of his story because that which lengthened
 the history of the last three kings was their degeneracy in their
 latter end, of which we have had a faithful account; but there was no
 occasion for such a melancholy conclusion of the history of this reign,
 which is only an account,

 I. Of the date and continuance of this reign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+27:1,8">ver. 1, 8</A>.

 II.  The general good character of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+27:2,6">ver. 2, 6</A>.

 III. The prosperity of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+27:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 IV. The period of it,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Jotham <I>was</I> twenty and five years old when he began to
 reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's
 name also <I>was</I> Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
 &nbsp; 2  And he did <I>that which was</I> right in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered
 not into the temple of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. And the people did yet
 corruptly.
 &nbsp; 3  He built the high gate of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and on the
 wall of Ophel he built much.
 &nbsp; 4  Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in
 the forests he built castles and towers.
 &nbsp; 5  He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed
 against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an
 hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat,
 and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay
 unto him, both the second year, and the third.
 &nbsp; 6  So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God.
 &nbsp; 7  Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his
 ways, lo, they <I>are</I> written in the book of the kings of Israel
 and Judah.
 &nbsp; 8  He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
 reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 9  And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
 city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There is not much more related here concerning Jotham than we had 
 before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+15:32-38">2 Kings xv. 32</A>,

 &c.</P>

 I. He reigned well. He <I>did that which was right in the sight of the 
 Lord;</I> the course of his reign was good, and pleasing to God, whose 
 favour he made his end, and his word his rule, and (which shows that he 
 acted from a good principle) he <I>prepared his ways before the Lord 
 his God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+27:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 that is, he walked circumspectly and with much caution, contrived how
 to shun that which was evil and compass that which was good. He looked 
 before him, and cast his affairs into such a posture and method as made 
 the regular management of them the more easy. Or he established or 
 fixed his ways before the Lord, that is, he walked steadily and 
 constantly in the way of his duty, was uniform and resolute in it: not 
 like some of those that went before him, who, though they had some good 
 in them, lost their credit by their inconstancy and inconsistency with 
 themselves. They had run well, but something hindered them. It was not 
 so with Jotham. Two things are observed here in his character:--

 1. What was amiss in his father he amended in himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+27:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 He did <I>according to all that his father did</I> well and wisely;
 howbeit he would not imitate him in which he did amiss; for he 
 <I>entered not into the temple of the Lord</I> to burn incense as his 
 father did, but took warning by his fate not to dare so presumptuous a 
 thing. Note, We must not imitate the best men, and those we have the 
 greatest veneration for, any further than they did well; but, on the 
 contrary, their falls, and the injurious consequences of them, must be 
 warnings to us to walk the more circumspectly, that we stumble not at 
 the same stone that they stumbled at. 

 2. What was amiss in his people he could not prevail to amend: <I>The 
 people did yet corruptly.</I> Perhaps it reflects some blame upon him, 
 that he was wanting in his part towards the reformation of the land. 
 Men may be very good themselves, and yet not have courage and zeal to 
 do what they might do towards the reforming of others. However it
 certainly reflects a great deal of blame upon the people, that they did 
 not do what they might have done to improve the advantages of so good a 
 reign: they had good instructions given them and a good example set 
 before them, but they would not be reformed; so that even in the reign 
 of their good kings, as well as in that of the bad ones, they were 
 <I>treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath;</I> for they still did 
 corruptly, and the founder melted in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He prospered, and became truly reputable. 

 1. He built. He began with <I>the gate of the house of the Lord,</I>
 which he repaired, beautified, and raised. He then <I>fortified the 
 wall of Ophel, and built cities in the mountains of Judah</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+27:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>),

 took all possible care for the fortifying of his country and the
 replenishing of it. 

 2.  He conquered. He prevailed against the Ammonites, who had invaded
 Judah in Jehoshaphat's time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:1"><I>ch.</I> xx. 1</A>.

 He triumphed over them, and exacted great contributions from them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+27:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 He <I>became mighty</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+27:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 in wealth and power, and influence upon the neighbouring nations, who
 courted his friendship and feared his displeasure; and this he got by 
 <I>preparing his ways before the Lord his God.</I> The more stedfast we 
 are in religion the more mighty we are both for the resistance of that 
 which is evil and for the performance of that which is good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He finished his course too soon, but finished it with honour. He 
 had the unhappiness to die in the midst of his days; but, to balance 
 that, the happiness not to out-live his reputation, as the last three 
 of his predecessors did. He died when he was but forty-one years of age 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+27:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 but <I>his wars and his ways,</I> his wars abroad and his ways at home,
 were so glorious that they were recorded in the book of the kings of 
 Israel, as well as of the kings of Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+27:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The last words of the chapter are the most melancholy, as they inform
 us that <I>Ahaz his son,</I> whose character, in all respects, was the 
 reverse of his, <I>reigned in his stead.</I> When the wealth and power 
 with which wise men have done good devolve upon fools, that will do 
 hurt with them, it is a lamentation, and shall be for a 
 lamentation.</P>
