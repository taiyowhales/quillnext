 We have here some intermission of David's troubles by Saul. Providence
 favoured him with a breathing time, and yet this chapter gives us
 instances of the troubles of David. If one vexation seems to be over,
 we must not be secure; a storm may arise from some other point, as here
 to David. 

 I. Tidings of the death of Samuel could not but trouble him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:1">ver. 1</A>.

 But, 

 II. The abuse he received from Nabal is more largely recorded in this
 chapter. 
 
 1. The character of Nabal,

 3. His churlish answer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:10-12">ver. 10-12</A>.

 4. David's angry resentment of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:13,21,22">ver. 13, 21, 22</A>.

 5.  Abigail's prudent care to prevent the mischief it was likely to
 bring upon her family, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:14-20">ver. 14-20</A>.

 6. Her address to David to pacify him,

 8.  The death of Nabal,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered
 together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah.
 And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a short account of Samuel's death and burial. 

 1. Though he was a great man, and one that was admirably well qualified
 for public service, yet he spent the latter end of his days in 
 retirement and obscurity, not because he was superannuated (for he knew 
 how to preside in a college of the prophets,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:20"><I>ch.</I> xix. 20</A>),

 but because Israel had rejected him, for which God thus justly
 chastised them, and because his desire was to be quiet and to enjoy 
 himself and his God in the exercises of devotion now in his advanced 
 years, and in this desire God graciously indulged him. Let old people 
 be willing to rest themselves, though it look like burying themselves 
 alive. 

 2. Though he was a firm friend to David, for which Saul hated him, as
 also for dealing plainly with him, yet he died in peace even in the 
 worst of the days of the tyranny of Saul, who, he sometimes feared, 
 would kill him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+16:2"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 2</A>.
 
 Though Saul loved him not, yet he feared him, as Herod did John, and
 feared the people, for all knew him to be a prophet. Thus is Saul 
 restrained from hurting him. 

 3. All Israel lamented him; and they had reason, for they had all a
 loss in him. His personal merits commanded this honour to be done him 
 at his death. His former services to the public, when he judged Israel, 
 made this respect to his name and memory a just debt; it would have 
 been very ungrateful to have withheld it.  The sons of the prophets had 
 lost the founder and president of their college, and whatever weakened 
 them was a public loss. But that was not all: Samuel was a constant 
 intercessor for Israel, prayed daily for them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:23"><I>ch.</I> xii. 23</A>.

 If he go, they part with the best friend they have.  The loss is the
 more grievous at this juncture when Saul has grown so outrageous and 
 David is driven from his country; never more need of Samuel than now, 
 yet now he is removed. We will hope that the Israelites lamented 
 Samuel's death the more bitterly because they remembered against 
 themselves their own sin and folly in rejecting him and desiring a 
 king. Note, 

 (1.) Those have hard hearts who can bury their faithful ministers with
 dry eyes, who are not sensible of the loss of those who have prayed for 
 them and taught them the way of the Lord.

 (2.) When God's providence removes our relations and friends from us we
 ought to be humbled for our misconduct towards them while they were 
 with us. 

 4.  They buried him, not in the school of the prophets at Naioth, but
 in his own house (or perhaps in the garden pertaining to it) at Ramah, 
 where he was born. 

 5. David, thereupon, went down to the wilderness of Paran, retiring
 perhaps to mourn the more solemnly for the death of Samuel. Or, rather, 
 because now that he had lost so good a friend, who was (and he hoped 
 would be) a great support to him, he apprehended his danger to be 
 greater than ever, and therefore withdrew to a wilderness, out of the 
 limits of the land of Israel; and now it was that he <I>dwelt in the 
 tents of Kedar,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:5">Ps. cxx. 5</A>.

 In some parts of this wilderness of Paran Israel wandered when they
 came out of Egypt. The place would bring to mind God's care concerning 
 them, and David might improve that for his own encouragement, now in 
 his wilderness-state.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  And <I>there was</I> a man in Maon, whose possessions <I>were</I> in
 Carmel; and the man <I>was</I> very great, and he had three thousand
 sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in
 Carmel.
 &nbsp; 3 Now the name of the man <I>was</I> Nabal; and the name of his wife
 Abigail: and <I>she was</I> a woman of good understanding, and of a
 beautiful countenance: but the man <I>was</I> churlish and evil in his
 doings; and he <I>was</I> of the house of Caleb.
 &nbsp; 4 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his
 sheep.
 &nbsp; 5 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the
 young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him
 in my name:
 &nbsp; 6 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth <I>in prosperity,</I>
 Peace <I>be</I> both to thee, and peace <I>be</I> to thine house, and peace
 <I>be</I> unto all that thou hast.
 &nbsp; 7 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy
 shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there
 ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.
 &nbsp; 8 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the
 young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day:
 give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy
 servants, and to thy son David.
 &nbsp; 9 And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal
 according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.
 &nbsp; 10 And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who <I>is</I>
 David? and who <I>is</I> the son of Jesse? there be many servants now
 a days that break away every man from his master.
 &nbsp; 11 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that
 I have killed for my shearers, and give <I>it</I> unto men, whom I
 know not whence they <I>be?</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here begins the story of Nabal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A short account of him, who and what he was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>),

 a man we should never have heard of if there had not happened some
 communication between him and David. Observe, 

 1. His name: <I>Nabal--a fool;</I> so it signifies. It was a wonder
 that his parents would give him that name and an ill omen of what 
 proved to be this character. Yet indeed we all of us deserve to be so 
 called when we come into the world, for <I>man is born like the wild 
 ass's colt</I> and <I>foolishness is bound up in our hearts.</I> 

 2. His family: He was of the house of Caleb, but was indeed of another
 spirit.  He inherited Caleb's estate; for Maon and Carmel lay near 
 Hebron, which was given to Caleb

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+14:14,15:54,55">Josh. xv. 54, 55; xiv. 14</A>),

 but he was far from inheriting his virtues. He was a disgrace to his
 family, and then it was no honour to him. <I>Degeneranti genus 
 opprobrium--A Good extraction is a reproach to him who degenerates from 
 it.</I> The LXX., and some other ancient versions, read it 
 appellatively, not, He was a Calebite, but He was a dogged man, of a 
 currish disposition, surly and snappish, and always snarling. He was 
 <B><I>anthropos kynikos</I></B>--<I>a man that was a cynic.</I> 

 3. His wealth: He was very great, that is, very rich (for riches make
 men look great in the eye of the world), otherwise, to one that takes 
 his measures aright, he really looked very mean. Riches are common 
 blessings, which God often gives to Nabals, to whom he gives neither 
 wisdom nor grace. 

 4. His wife--Abigail, a woman of great understanding.  Her name
 signifies, <I>the joy of her father;</I> yet he could not promise 
 himself much joy of her when he married her to such a husband, 
 enquiring more after his wealth than after his wisdom. Many a child is 
 thrown away upon a great heap of the dirt of worldly wealth, married to 
 that, and to nothing else that is desirable. Wisdom is good with an 
 inheritance, but an inheritance is good for little without wisdom. Many 
 an Abigail is tied to a Nabal; and if it be so, be her understanding, 
 like Abigail's, ever so great, it will be little enough for her 
 exercises. 

 5. His character. He had no sense either of honour or honesty; not of
 honour, for he was churlish, cross, and ill-humoured; not of honesty, 
 for he was evil in his doings, hard and oppressive, and a man that 
 cared not what fraud and violence he used in getting and saving, so he 
 could but get and save. This is the character given of Nabal by him who 
 knows what every man is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David's humble request to him, that he would send him some victuals 
 for himself and his men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. David, it seems, was in such distress that he would be glad to be 
 beholden to him, and did in effect come a begging to his door. What 
 little reason have we to value the wealth of this world when so great a 
 churl as Nabal abounds and so great a saint as David suffers want! Once 
 before we had David begging his bread, but then it was of Ahimelech the 
 high priest, to whom one would not grudge to stoop. But to send a 
 begging to Nabal was what such a spirit as David had could not admit 
 without some reluctancy; yet, if Providence bring him to these straits, 
 he will not say that to beg he is ashamed. Yet see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:25">Ps. xxxvii. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He chose a good time to send to Nabal, when he had many hands 
 employed about him in shearing his sheep, for whom he was to make a 
 plentiful entertainment, so that good cheer was stirring. Had he sent 
 at another time, Nabal would have pretended he had nothing to spare, 
 but now he could not have that excuse. It was usual to make feasts at 
 their sheep-shearings, as appears by Absalom's feast on that occasion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+13:24">2 Sam. xiii. 24</A>),

 for wool was one of the staple commodities of Canaan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. David ordered his men to deliver their message to him with a great 
 deal of courtesy and respect: "<I>Go to Nabal, and greet him in my 
 name.</I> Tell him I sent you to present my service to him, and to 
 enquire how he does and his family," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He puts words in their mouths

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Thus shall you say to him that liveth;</I> our translators add,
 <I>in prosperity,</I> as if those live indeed that live as Nabal did, 
 with abundance of the wealth of this world about them; whereas, in 
 truth, those that<I>live in pleasure are dead while they live,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:6">1 Tim. v. 6</A>.

 This was, methinks too high a compliment to pass upon Nabal, to call
 him <I>the man that liveth.</I> David knew better things, that in God's 
 favour is life, not in the world's smiles; and by the rough answer he 
 was well enough served, for this too smooth address to such a 
 muck-worm. Yet his good wishes were very commendable.  "<I>Peace be to 
 thee,</I> all good both to soul and body. <I>Peace be to thy house and 
 to all that thou hast.</I>" Tell him I am a hearty well-wisher to his 
 health and prosperity. He bids them call him his <I>son David</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 intimating that, for his age and estate, David honoured him as a
 father, and therefore hoped to receive some fatherly kindness from 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He pleaded the kindness which Nabal's shepherds had received from 
 David and his men; and one good turn requires another. He appeals to 
 Nabal's own servants, and shows that when David's soldiers were 
 quartered among Nabal's shepherds, 

 (1.) They did not hurt them themselves, did them no injury, gave them
 no disturbance, were not a terror to them, nor took any of the lambs 
 out of the flock. Yet, considering the character of David's men, men in 
 distress, and debt, and discontented, and the scarcity of provisions in 
 his camp, it was not without a great deal of care and good management 
 that they were kept from plundering.

 (2.) They protected them from being hurt by others. David himself does
 but <I>intimate</I> this, for he would not boast of his good offices: 
 <I>Neither was there aught missing to them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 But Nabal's servants, to whom he appealed, went further

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>They were a wall unto us, both by night and day.</I> David's
 soldiers were a guard to Nabal's shepherds when the bands of the 
 <I>Philistines robbed the threshing-floors</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:1"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 1</A>)

 and would have robbed the sheep-folds. From those plunderers Nabal's
 flocks were protected by David's care, and therefore he says, <I>Let us 
 find favour in thy eyes.</I> Those that have shown kindness may justly 
 expect to receive kindness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He was very modest in his request. Though David was anointed king, 
 he insisted not upon royal dainties, but, "Give whatsoever comes to thy 
 hand, and we will be thankful for it." Beggars must not be choosers. 
 Those that deserved to have been served first will now be glad of what 
 is left. They plead, <I>We come in a good day,</I> a festival, when not 
 only the provision is more plentiful, but the heart and hand are 
 usually more open and free than at other times, when much may be spared 
 and yet not be missed. David demands not what he wanted as a debt, 
 either by way of tribute as he was a king, or by way of contribution as 
 he was a general, but asks it as a boon to a friend, that was his 
 humble servant. David's servants delivered their message faithfully 
 and very handsomely, not doubting but to go back well laden with 
 provisions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Nabal's churlish answer to this modest petition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 One could not have imagined it possible that any man should be so very
 rude and ill-conditioned as Nabal was. David called himself his 
 <I>son,</I> and asked bread and a fish, but, instead thereof, Nabal 
 gave him a stone and a scorpion; not only denied him, but abused him. 
 If he had not thought fit to send him any supplies for fear of 
 Ahimelech's fate, who paid dearly for his kindness to David; yet he 
 might have given a civil answer, and made the denial as modest as the 
 request was. But, instead of that, he falls into a passion, as covetous 
 men are apt to do when they are asked for any thing, thinking thus to 
 cover one sin with another, and by abusing the poor to excuse 
 themselves from relieving them. But God will not thus be mocked.

 1. He speaks scornfully of David as an insignificant man, not worth
 taking notice of. The Philistines could say of him, <I>This is</I> 
 David <I>the king of the land,</I> that <I>slew his ten thousands</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:11"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 11</A>),

 yet Nabal his near neighbour, and one of the same tribe, affects not to
 know him, or not to know him to be a man of any merit or distinction: 
 <I>Who is David?  And who is the son of Jesse?</I> He could not be 
 ignorant how much the country was obliged to David for his public 
 services, but his narrow soul thinks not of paying any part of that 
 debt, nor so much as of acknowledging it; he speaks of David as an 
 inconsiderable man, obscure, and not to be regarded. Think it not 
 strange if great men and great merits be thus disgraced. 

 2. He upbraids him with his present distress, and takes occasion from
 it to represent him as a bad man, that was fitter to be set in the 
 stocks for a vagrant than to have any kindness shown him. How naturally 
 does he speak the churlish clownish language of those that hate to give 
 alms! <I>There are many servants now-a-days</I> (as if there had been 
 none such in former days) <I>that break every man from his master,</I> 
 suggesting that David was one of them himself ("He might have kept his 
 place with his master Saul, and then he needed not have sent to me for 
 provisions"), and also that he entertained and harboured those that 
 were fugitives like himself. It would make one's blood rise to hear so 
 great and good a man as David thus vilified and reproached by such a 
 base churl as Nabal. <I>But the vile person will speak villany,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:5-7">Isa. xxxii. 5-7</A>.

 If men bring themselves into straits by their own folly, yet they are
 to be pitied and helped, and not trampled upon and starved. But D avid 
 was reduced to this distress, not by any fault, no, nor any 
 indiscretion, of his own, but purely by the good services he had done 
 to his country and the honours which his God had put upon him; and yet 
 he was represented as a fugitive and runagate. Le t this help us to 
 bear such reproaches and misrepresentations of us with patience and 
 cheerfulness, and make us easy under them, that it has often been the 
 lot of the excellent ones of the earth. Some of the best men that ever 
 the world was blest with were counted as the <I>off-scouring of all 
 things,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:13">1 Cor. iv. 13</A>.

 3.  He insists much upon the property he had in the provisions of his
 table, and will by no means admit any body to share in them. "It is my 
 bread and my flesh, yes, and my water too (though < I>usus communis 
 aquarum</I>--<I>water is every one's property</I>), and it is prepared 
 for my shearers," priding himself in it that it was all his own; and 
 who denied it? Who offered to dispute his title? But this, he thinks, 
 will justify him in keeping i t all to himself, and giving David none; 
 for may he not do what he will with his own? Whereas we mistake if we 
 think we are absolute lords of what we have and may do what we please 
 with it. No, we are but stewards, and must use it as we are directed, 
 remembering it is not our own, but his that entrusted us with it.  
 Riches are <B><I>ta allotria</I></B> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:12">Luke xvi. 12</A>);

 they are <I>another's,</I> and we ought not to talk too much of their
 being our own.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and
 came and told him all those sayings.
 &nbsp; 13 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword.
 And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on
 his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men;
 and two hundred abode by the stuff.
 &nbsp; 14 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying,
 Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our
 master; and he railed on them.
 &nbsp; 15 But the men <I>were</I> very good unto us, and we were not hurt,
 neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with
 them, when we were in the fields:
 &nbsp; 16 They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the
 while we were with them keeping the sheep.
 &nbsp; 17 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil
 is determined against our master, and against all his household:
 for he <I>is such</I> a son of Belial, that <I>a man</I> cannot speak to
 him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The report made to David of the abuse Nabal had given to his 
 messengers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>They turned their way.</I> They showed their displeasure, as became
 them to do, by breaking off abruptly from such a churl, but prudently 
 governed themselves so well as not to render railing for railing, not 
 to call him as he deserved, much less to take by force what ought of 
 right to have been given them, but came and told David that he might do 
 as he thought fit. Christ's servants, when they are thus abused, must 
 leave it to him to plead his own cause and wait till he appear in it. 
 The servant showed his lord what affronts he had received, but did not 
 return them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:21">Luke xiv. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David's hasty resolution hereupon. He girded on his sword, and 
 ordered his men to do so too, to the number of 400, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 And what he said we are told,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 1. He repented of the kindness he had done to Nabal, and looked upon it
 as thrown away upon him. He said, "<I>surely in vain have I kept all 
 that this fellow hath in the wilderness.</I> I thought to oblige him 
 and make him my friend, but I see it is to no purpose. He has no sense 
 of gratitude, nor is he capable of receiving the impressions of a good 
 turn, else he could not have used me thus. He hath <I>requited me evil 
 for good.</I>" But, when we are thus requited, we should not repent of 
 the good we have done, nor be backward to do good another time. God is 
 kind to the evil and unthankful, and why may not we? 

 2. He determined to destroy Nabal and all that belonged to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 Here David did not act like himself.  His resolution was bloody, to cut
 off all the males of Nabal's house, and spare none, man nor man-child. 
 The ratification of his resolution was passionate: <I>So, and more also 
 do to God</I> (he was going to say <I>to me,</I> but that would better 
 become Saul's mouth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:44"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 44</A>,

 than David's, and therefore he decently turns it off) <I>to the enemies
 of David. Is this thy voice, O David?</I> Can the man after God's own 
 heart speak thus unadvisedly with his lips? Has he been so long in the 
 school of affliction, where he should have learned patience, and yet so 
 passionate? Is this he who used to be dumb and deaf when he was 
 reproached 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:13">Ps. xxxviii. 13</A>),

 who but the other day spared him who sought his life, and yet now will
 not spare any thing that belongs to him who has only put an affront 
 upon his messengers? He who at other times used to be calm and 
 considerate is now put into such a heat by a few hard words that 
 nothing will atone for them but the blood of a whole family. Lord, what 
 is man! What are the best of men, when God leaves them to themselves, 
 to try them, that they may know what is in their hearts?  From Saul 
 David expected injuries, and against those he was prepared and stood 
 upon his guard, and so kept his temper; but from Nabal he expected 
 kindness, and therefore the affront he gave him was a surprise to him, 
 found him off his guard, and, by a sudden and unexpected attack, put 
 him for the present into disorder. What need have we to pray, <I>Lord, 
 lead us not into temptation!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The account given of this matter to Abigail by one of the 
 servants, who was more considerate than the rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Had this servant spoken to Nabal, and shown him the danger he had
 exposed himself to by his own rudeness, he would have said, "Servants 
 are now-a-days so saucy, and so apt to prescribe, that there is no 
 enduring them," and, it may be, would have turned him out of doors. But 
 Abigail, being a woman of good understanding, took cognizance of the 
 matter, even from her servant, who,

 1. Did David justice in commending him and his men for their civility
 to Nabal's shepherds, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 "The men were very good to us, and, though they were themselves
 exposed, yet they protected us and were a wall unto us." Those who do 
 that which is good shall, one way or other, have the praise of the 
 same. Nabal's own servant will be a witness for David that he is a man 
 of honour and conscience, whatever Nabal himself says of him. And,

 2. He did Nabal no wrong in condemning him for his rudeness to David's
 messengers: <I>He railed on them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>he flew upon them</I> (so the word is) with an intolerable rage;
 "for," say they, "it is his usual practice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He is such a son of Belial, so very morose and intractable, that a man
 cannot speak to him but he flies into a passion immediately." Abigail 
 knew it too well herself.

 3. He did Abigail and the whole family a kindness in making her
 sensible what was likely to be the consequence. He knew David so well 
 that he had reason to think he would highly resent the affront, and 
 perhaps had had information of David's orders to his men to march that 
 way; for he is very positive <I>evil is determined against our master, 
 and all his household,</I> himself among the rest, would be involved in 
 it. Therefore he desires his mistress to consider what was to be done 
 for their common safety. They could not resist the force David would
 bring down upon them, nor had they time to send to Saul to protect 
 them; something therefore must be done to pacify David.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and
 two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five
 measures of parched <I>corn,</I> and a hundred clusters of raisins,
 and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid <I>them</I> on asses.
 &nbsp; 19 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I
 come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.
 &nbsp; 20 And it was <I>so, as</I> she rode on the ass, that she came down
 by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came
 down against her; and she met them.
 &nbsp; 21 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
 <I>fellow</I> hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of
 all that <I>pertained</I> unto him: and he hath requited me evil for
 good.
 &nbsp; 22 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I
 leave of all that <I>pertain</I> to him by the morning light any that
 pisseth against the wall.
 &nbsp; 23 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the
 ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the
 ground,
 &nbsp; 24 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, <I>upon</I> me
 <I>let this</I> iniquity <I>be:</I> and let thine handmaid, I pray thee,
 speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.
 &nbsp; 25 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial,
 <I>even</I> Nabal: for as his name <I>is,</I> so <I>is</I> he; Nabal <I>is</I> his
 name, and folly <I>is</I> with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the
 young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
 &nbsp; 26 Now therefore, my lord, <I>as</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth, and <I>as</I> thy
 soul liveth, seeing the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath withholden thee from coming to
 <I>shed</I> blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now
 let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as
 Nabal.
 &nbsp; 27 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto
 my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my
 lord.
 &nbsp; 28 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord
 fighteth the battles of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and evil hath not been found in
 thee <I>all</I> thy days.
 &nbsp; 29 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but
 the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling
 out, <I>as out</I> of the middle of a sling.
 &nbsp; 30 And it shall come to pass, when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall have done to
 my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning
 thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;
 &nbsp; 31 That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart
 unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that
 my lord hath avenged himself: but when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall have dealt
 well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of Abigail's prudent management for the 
 preserving of her husband and family from the destruction that was just 
 coming upon them; and we find that she did her part admirably well and 
 fully answered her character. The passion of fools often makes those 
 breaches in a little time which the wise, with all their wisdom, have 
 much ado to make up again. It is hard to say whether Abigail was more 
 miserable in such a husband or Nabal happy in such a wife. A 
 <I>virtuous woman is a crown to her husband,</I> to protect as well as 
 adorn, and will <I>do him good and not evil.</I> Wisdom in such a case 
 as this was better than weapons of war. 

 1. It was her wisdom that what she did she did quickly, and without
 delay; she made haste, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 It was no time to trifle or linger when all was in danger. Those that
 desire conditions of peace must send when the enemy is yet a great way 
 off,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:32">Luke xiv. 32</A>.

 2. It was her wisdom that what she did she did herself, because, being
 a woman of great prudence and very happy address, she knew better how 
 to manage it than any servant she had. The virtuous woman will herself 
 <I>look well to the ways of her household,</I> and not devolve this 
 duty wholly upon others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Abigail must endeavour to atone for Nabal's faults. Now he had been in 
 two ways rude to David's messengers, and in them to David: He had 
 denied them the provisions they asked for, and he had given them very 
 provoking language. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By a most generous present, Abigail atones for his denial of their 
 request. If Nabal had given them what came next to hand, they would 
 have gone away thankful; but Abigail prepares the very best the house 
 afforded and abundance of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 according to the usual entertainments of those times, not only
 <I>bread</I> and <I>flesh,</I> but <I>raisins</I> and <I>figs,</I> 
 which were their dried sweet-meats.  Nabal grudged them <I>water,</I> 
 but she took <I>two bottles</I> (<I>casks</I> or <I>rundlets</I>) 
 <I>of wine,</I> 
 loaded her asses with these provisions, and sent them before; for <I>a 
 gift pacifieth anger,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:14">Prov. xxi. 14</A>.

 Jacob thus pacified Esau. When the <I>instruments of the churl are
 evil, the liberal devises liberal things,</I> and loses nothing by it; 
 for by <I>liberal things shall he stand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:7,8">Isa. xxxii. 7, 8</A>.

 Abigail not only lawfully, but laudably, disposed of all these goods of
 her husband's without his knowledge (even when she had reason to think 
 that if he had known what she did he would not have consented to it), 
 because it was not to gratify her own pride or vanity, but for the 
 necessary defence of him and his family.  which otherwise would have 
 been inevitably ruined. Husbands and wives, for their common good and 
 benefit, have a joint-interest in their worldly possessions; but if 
 either waste, or unduly spend in any way, it is a robbing of the 
 other.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. By a most obliging demeanour, and charming speech, she atones for 
 the abusive language which Nabal had given them. She met David upon the 
 march, big with resentment, and meditating the destruction of Nabal 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 but with all possible expressions of complaisance and respect she
 humbly begs his favour, and solicits him to pass by the offence. Her 
 demeanour was very submissive: <I>She bowed herself to the ground 
 before David</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)

 <I>and fell at his feet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Yielding pacifies great offences.  She put herself into the place and
 posture of a penitent and of a petitioner, and was not ashamed to do 
 it, when it was for the good of her house, in the sight both of her own 
 servants and of David's soldiers. She humbly begs of David that he will 
 give her the hearing: <I>Let thy handmaid speak in thy audience.</I> 
 But she needed not thus to bespeak his attention and patience; what she 
 said was sufficient to command it, for certainly nothing could be more 
 fine nor more moving.  No topic of argument is left untouched; every 
 thing is well placed and well expressed, most pertinently and 
 pathetically urged, and improved to the best advantage, with such a 
 force of natural rhetoric as cannot easily be paralleled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She speaks to him all along with the deference and respect due to so 
 great and good a man, calls him <I>My lord,</I> over and over, to 
 expiate her husband's crime in saying, "Who is David?" She does not 
 upbraid him with the heat of his passion, though he deserved to be 
 reproved for it; nor does she tell him how ill it became his character; 
 but endeavours to soften him and bring him to a better temper, not 
 doubting but that then his own conscience would upbraid him with 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She takes the blame of the ill-treatment of his messengers upon 
 herself: "<I>Upon me, my lord, upon me, let this iniquity be,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 If thou wilt be angry, be angry with me, rather than with my poor
 husband, and look upon it <I>as the trespass of thy handmaid,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Sordid spirits care not how much others suffer for their faults, while
 generous spirits can be content to suffer for the faults of others. 
 Abigail here discovered the sincerity and strength of her conjugal 
 affection and concern for her family: whatever Nabal was, he was her 
 husband.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. She excuses her husband's fault by imputing it to his natural 
 weakness and want of understanding 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>Let not my lord</I> take notice of his rudeness and ill manners,
 for it is like him; it is not the first time that he has behaved so 
 churlishly; he must be borne with, for it is for want of wit: <I>Nabal 
 is his name</I>" (which signifies a <I>fool</I>), "<I>and folly is with 
 him.</I> It was owing to his folly, not his malice. He is simple, but 
 not spiteful. Forgive him, for he knows not what he does." What she 
 said was too true, and she said it to excuse his fault and prevent his 
 ruin, else she would not have done well to give such a bad character as 
 this of her own husband, whom she ought to make the best of, and not to 
 speak ill of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. She pleads her own ignorance of the matter: "<I>I saw not the young 
 men,</I> else they should have had a better answer, and should not have 
 gone without their errand," intimating hereby that though her husband 
 was foolish, and unfit to manage his affairs himself, yet he had so 
 much wisdom as to be ruled by her and take her advice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. She takes it for granted that she has gained her point already, 
 perhaps perceiving, by David's countenance, that he began to change his 
 mind 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>Seeing the Lord hath withholden thee.</I> She depends not upon her
 own reasonings, but God's grace, to mollify him, and doubts not but 
 that grace would work powerfully upon him; and then, "<I>Let all thy 
 enemies be as Nabal,</I> that is, if thou forbear to avenge thyself, no 
 doubt God will avenge thee on him, as he will on all thy other 
 enemies." Or it intimates that it was below him to take vengeance on so 
 weak and impotent an enemy as Nabal was, who, as he would do him no 
 kindness, so he could do him no hurt, for he needed to wish no more 
 concerning his enemies than that they might be as unable to resist him 
 as Nabal was. Perhaps she refers to his sparing Saul, when, but the 
 other day, he had him at his mercy. "Didst thou forbear to avenge 
 thyself on that lion that would devour thee, and wilt thou shed the 
 blood of this dog that can but bark at thee?" The very mentioning of 
 what he was about to do, to shed blood and to avenge himself, was 
 enough to work upon such a tender gracious spirit as David had; and it 
 should seem, by his reply

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 that it affected him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. She makes a tender of the present she had brought, but speaks of it 
 as unworthy of David's acceptance, and therefore desires it may be 
 given to the <I>young men that followed him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 and particularly to those ten that were his messengers to Nabal, and
 whom he had treated so rudely.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. She applauds David for the good services he had done against the 
 common enemies of his country, the glory of which great achievements, 
 she hoped, he would not stain by any personal revenge: "<I>My lord 
 fighteth the battles of the Lord</I> against the Philistines, and 
 therefore he will leave it to God to fight his battles against those 
 that affront him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 <I>Evil has not been found in thee all thy days.</I> Thou never yet
 didst wrong to any of thy countrymen (though persecuted as a traitor), 
 and therefore thou wilt not begin now, nor do a thing which Saul will 
 improve for the justifying of his malice against thee."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. She foretels the glorious issue of his present troubles. "It is true 
 <I>a man pursues thee</I> and <I>seeks thy life</I>" (she names not 
 Saul, out of respect to his present character as king), "but thou 
 needest not look with so sharp and jealous an eye upon every one that 
 affronts thee;" for all these storms that now ruffle thee will be blown 
 over shortly. She speaks it with assurance, 

 (1.) That God would keep him safe: <I>The soul of my lord shall be
 bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God,</I> that is, God 
 shall <I>hold thy soul in life</I> (as the expression is,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:9">Ps. lxvi. 9</A>)

 as we hold those things which are bundled up or which are precious to
 us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:15">Ps. cxvi. 15</A>.

 <I>Thy soul shall be treasured up in the treasure of lives</I> (so the
 Chaldee), under lock and key as our treasure is.  "Thou shalt abide 
 under the special protection of the divine providence." The <I>bundle 
 of life is with the Lord our God,</I> for in his hand our breath is, 
 and our times. Those are safe, and may be easy, that have him for their 
 protector. The Jews understand this not only of the <I>life that now 
 is,</I> but of that <I>which is to come,</I> even the happiness of 
 separate souls, and therefore use it commonly as an inscription on 
 their gravestones. "Here we have laid the body, but trust that <I>the 
 soul is bound up in the bundle of life, with the Lord our God.</I>" 
 There it is safe, while the dust of the body is scattered.

 (2.) That God would make him victorious over his enemies. Their souls
 he shall <I>sling out,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 The stone is bound up in the sling, but it is in order to be thrown out
 again; so the souls of the godly shall be bundled as corn for the barn, 
 but the souls of the wicked as tares for the fire.

 (3.) That God would settle him in wealth and power: "<I>The Lord will
 certainly make my lord a sure house,</I> and no enemy thou hast can 
 hinder it; therefore <I>forgive this trespass,</I>" that is, "show 
 mercy, as thou hopest to find mercy. God will make thee great, and it 
 is the glory of great men to pass by offences."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 9. She desires him to consider how much more comfortable it would be to 
 him in the reflection to have forgiven this affront than to have 
 revenged it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>.

 She reserves this argument for the last, as a very powerful one with so
 good a man, that the less he indulged his passion the more he consulted 
 his peace and the repose of his own conscience, which every wise man 
 will be tender of.

 (1.) She cannot but think that if he should avenge himself it would
 afterwards be a grief and an offence of heart to him, Many have done 
 that in a heat which they have a thousand times wished undone again. 
 The sweetness of revenge is soon turned into bitterness.

 (2.) She is confident that if he pass by the offence it will afterwards
 by no grief to him; but, on the contrary, it would yield him 
 unspeakable satisfaction that his wisdom and grace had got the better 
 of his passion. Note, When we are tempted to sin we should consider how 
 it will appear in the reflection.  Let us never do any thing for which 
 our own consciences will afterwards have occasion to upbraid us, and 
 which we shall look back upon with regret: <I>My heart shall not 
 reproach me.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 10. She recommends herself to his favour: <I>When the Lord shall have 
 dealt well with my lord, then remember thy handmaid,</I> as one that 
 kept thee from doing that which would have disgraced thy honour, 
 disquieted thy conscience, and made a blot in thy history. We have 
 reason to remember those with respect and gratitude who have been 
 instrumental to keep us from sin.</P>

 Abigail was a wise reprover of David's passion, and he gave an obedient
 ear to the reproof, according to his own principle

 such an admonition either better given or better taken.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David gives God thanks for sending him this happy check to a sinful 
 way 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who sent thee this day to meet
 me.</I> Note, 

 1. God is to be acknowledged in all the kindnesses that our friends do
 us either for soul or body. Whoever meet us with counsel, direction,
 comfort, caution, or seasonable reproof, we must see God sending them.
 
 2. We ought to be very thankful for those happy providences which are
 means of preventing sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives Abigail thanks for interposing so opportunely between him 
 and the mischief he was about to do: <I>Blessed be thy advice, and 
 blessed be thou,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Most people think it enough if they take a reproof patiently, but we
 meet with few that will take it thankfully and will commend those that 
 give it to them and accept it as a favour.  Abigail did not rejoice 
 more that she had been instrumental to save her husband and family from 
 death than David did that Abigail had been instrumental to save him and 
 his men from sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He seems very apprehensive of the great danger he was in, which 
 magnified the mercy of his deliverance. 

 1. He speaks of the sin as very great. He was coming to shed blood, a
 sin of which when in his right mind he had a great horror, witness his 
 prayer, <I>Deliver me from blood-guiltiness.</I> He was coming to 
 <I>avenge himself with his own hand,</I> and that would be stepping 
 into the throne of God, who has said, <I>Vengeance is mine; I will 
 repay.</I> The more heinous any sin is the greater mercy it is to be 
 kept from it. He seems to aggravate the evil of his design with this, 
 that it would have been an injury to so wise and good a woman as 
 Abigail: God has <I>kept me back from hurting thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Or perhaps, at the first sight of Abigail, he was conscious of a
 thought to do her a mischief for offering to oppose him, and therefore 
 reckons it a great mercy that God gave him patience to hear her speak.

 2. He speaks of the danger of his falling into it as very imminent:
 "<I>Except thou hadst hasted,</I> the bloody execution had been done." 
 The nearer we were to the commission of sin the greater was the mercy 
 of a seasonable restraint--<I>Almost gone</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:2">Ps. lxxiii. 2</A>)
 
 and yet upheld.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He dismissed her with an answer of peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 He does, in effect, own himself overcome by her eloquence: "<I>I have
 hearkened to thy voice,</I> and will not prosecute the intended 
 revenge, for I <I>have accepted thy person,</I> am well pleased with 
 thee and what thou hast said." Note,

 1. Wise and good men will hear reason, and let that rule them, though
 it come from those that are every way their inferiors, and though their 
 passions are up and their spirits provoked.

 2. Oaths cannot, bind us to that which is sinful. David had solemnly
 vowed the death of Nabal. He did evil to make such a vow, but he would 
 have done worse if he had performed it. 

 3. A wise and faithful reproof is often better taken, and speeds
 better, than we expected, such is the hold God has of men's 
 consciences. See

 <FONT SIZE=+1>36  And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in
 his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart <I>was</I>
 merry within him, for he <I>was</I> very drunken: wherefore she told
 him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
 &nbsp; 37 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone
 out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his
 heart died within him, and he became <I>as</I> a stone.
 &nbsp; 38 And it came to pass about ten days <I>after,</I> that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 smote Nabal, that he died.
 &nbsp; 39 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed
 <I>be</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from
 the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And
 David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.
 &nbsp; 40 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to
 Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to
 take thee to him to wife.
 &nbsp; 41 And she arose, and bowed herself on <I>her</I> face to the earth,
 and said, Behold, <I>let</I> thine handmaid <I>be</I> a servant to wash the
 feet of the servants of my lord.
 &nbsp; 42 And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with
 five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the
 messengers of David, and became his wife.
 &nbsp; 43 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both
 of them his wives.
 &nbsp; 44 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to
 Phalti the son of Laish, which <I>was</I> of Gallim.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are now to attend Nabal's funeral and Abigail's wedding.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Nabal's funeral. The apostle speaks of some that were <I>twice 
 dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:12">Jude 12</A>.

 We have hare Nabal <I>thrice</I> dead, though but just now wonderfully
 rescued from the sword of David and delivered from so great a death; 
 for the preservations of wicked men are but reservations for some 
 further sorer strokes of divine wrath. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Nabal dead drunk,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 Abigail came home, and, it should seem, he had so many people and so
 much plenty about him that he neither missed her nor the provisions she 
 took to David; but she found him in the midst of his jollity, little 
 thinking how near he was to ruin by one whom he had foolishly made his 
 enemy. Sinners are often most secure when they are most in danger and 
 destruction is at the door. Observe,

 (1.) How extravagant he was in the entertainment of his company: <I>He
 held a feast like the feast of a king,</I> so magnificent and abundant, 
 though his guests were but his sheep-shearers. This abundance might 
 have been allowed if he had considered what God gave him his estate 
 for, not to look great with, but to do good with. It is very common for 
 those that are most niggardly in any act of piety or charity to be most 
 profuse in gratifying a vain humour or a base lust. A mite is grudged 
 to God and his poor; but, to make a <I>fair show in the flesh, gold is 
 lavished out of the bag.</I> If Nabal had not answered to his name, he 
 would never have been thus secure and jovial, till he had enquired 
 whether he was safe from David's resentments; but (as bishop Hall 
 observes) thus foolish are carnal men, that give themselves over to 
 their pleasures before they have taken any care to make their peace 
 with God.

 (2.) How sottish he was in the indulgence of his own brutish appetite:
 <I>He was very drunk,</I> a sign he was <I>Nabal, a fool,</I> that 
 could not use his plenty without abusing it, could not be pleasant with 
 his friends without making a beast of himself. There is not a surer 
 sign that a man has but little wisdom, nor a surer way to ruin the 
 little he has, than drinking to excess. Nabal, that never thought he 
 could bestow too little in charity, never thought he could bestow too 
 much in luxury.  Abigail, finding him in this condition (and probably 
 those about him little better, when the master of the feast set them so 
 bad an example), had enough to do to set the disordered house to-rights 
 a little, but told Nabal nothing of what she had done with reference to 
 David, nothing of his folly in provoking David, of his danger or of his 
 deliverance, for, being drunk, he was as incapable to hear reason as he 
 was to speak it. To give good advice to those that are in drink is to 
 <I>cast pearls before swine;</I> it is better to stay till they are 
 sober.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Nabal again dead with melancholy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 Next morning, when he had come to himself a little, his wife told him
 how near to destruction he had brought himself and his family by his 
 own rudeness, and with what difficulty she had interposed to prevent 
 it; and, upon this, <I>his heart died within him and he became as a 
 stone.</I> Some suggest that the expense of the satisfaction made to 
 David, by the present Abigail brought him, broke his heart: it seems 
 rather that the apprehension he now had of the danger he had narrowly 
 escaped put him into a consternation, and seized his spirits so that he 
 could not recover it.  He grew sullen, and said little, ashamed of his 
 own folly, put out of countenance by his wife's wisdom. How is he 
 changed! His heart over-night merry with wine, next morning heavy as a 
 stone; so deceitful are carnal pleasures, so transient the laughter of 
 the fool. <I>The end of that mirth is heaviness.</I> Drunkards are 
 sometimes sad when they reflect upon their own folly. Joy in God makes 
 the heart always light.  Abigail could never, by her wise reasonings, 
 bring Nabal to repentance; but now, by her faithful reproof, she brings 
 him to despair.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Nabal, at last, dead indeed: <I>About ten days after,</I> when he 
 had been kept so long under this pressure and pain, <I>the Lord smote 
 him that he died</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 and, it should seem, he never held up his head; it is just with God
 (says bishop Hall) that those who live without grace should die without 
 comfort, nor can we expect better while we go on in our sins. Here is 
 no lamentation made for Nabal. He departed without being lamented. 
 Every one wished that the country might never sustain a greater loss. 
 <I>David,</I> when he heard the news of his death, <I>gave God 
 thanks</I> for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.
 
 He blessed God,

 (1.) That he had kept him from killing him: <I>Blessed be the lord, who
 hath kept his servant from evil.</I> He rejoices that Nabal died a 
 natural death and not by his hand. We should take all occasions to 
 mention and magnify God's goodness to us in keeping us from sin.

 (2.) That he had taken the work into his own hands, and had vindicated
 David's honour, and not suffered him to go unpunished who had been 
 abusive to him; hereby his interest would be confirmed, and all would 
 stand in awe of him, as one for whom God fought. 

 (3.) That he had thereby encouraged him and all others to commit their
 cause to God, when they are in any way injured, with an assurance that, 
 in his own time, he will redress their wrongs if they sit still and 
 leave the matter to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Abigail's wedding. David was so charmed with the beauty of her 
 person, and the uncommon prudence of her conduct and address, that, as 
 soon as was convenient, after he heard she was a widow, he informed her 
 of his attachment to her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>),

 not doubting but that she who approved herself so good a wife to so bad
 a husband as Nabal would much more make a good wife to him, and having 
 taken notice of her respect to him and her confidence of his coming to 
 the throne. 

 1. He courted by proxy, his affairs, perhaps, not permitting him to
 come himself. 

 2. She received the address with great modesty and humility

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 reckoning herself unworthy of the honour, yet having such a respect for
 him that she would gladly be one of the poorest servants of his family, 
 to wash the feet of the other servants. None so fit to be preferred as 
 those that can thus humble themselves. 

 3. She agreed to the proposal, went with his messenger, took a retinue
 with her agreeable to her quality, and <I>she became his wife,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 She did not upbraid him with his present distresses, and ask him how he
 could maintain her, but valued him,

 (1.) Because she knew he was a very good man.

 (2.) Because she believed he would, in due time, be a very great man.
 She married him in faith, not questioning but that, though now he had 
 not a house of his own that he durst bring her to, yet God's promise go 
 him would at length be fulfilled. Thus those who join themselves to 
 Christ must be willing now to suffer with him, believing that hereafter 
 they shall reign with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> On this occasion we have some account of David's wives. 
 
 1. One that he had lost before he married Abigail, Michal, Saul's
 daughter, his first, and the wife of his youth, to whom he would have 
 been constant if she would have been so to him, but Saul had given her 
 to another 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>),

 in token of his displeasure against him and disclaiming the relation of
 a father-in-law to him. 
 
 2. Another that he married besides Abigail

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>),

 and, as should seem, before her, for she is named first,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+27:3"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 3</A>.

 David was carried away by the corrupt custom of those times; but from
 the beginning it was not so, nor is it so now that Messias has come, 
 and the times of reformation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:4,5">Matt. xix. 4, 5</A>.

 Perhaps Saul's defrauding David of his only rightful wife was the
 occasion of his running into this irregularity; for, when the knot of 
 conjugal affection is once loosed, it is scarcely ever tied fast again.  
 When David could not keep his first wife he thought that would excuse 
 him if he did not keep to his second. But we deceive ourselves if we 
 think to make others' faults a cloak for our own.</P>
