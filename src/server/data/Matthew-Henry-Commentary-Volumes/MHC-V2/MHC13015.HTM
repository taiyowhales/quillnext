 The bringing in of the ark to the city of David was a very good work;
 it was resolved upon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:4">xiii. 4</A>),

 and attempted, but not perfected; it lay by the way in the house of
 Obed-edom. Now this chapter gives us an account of the completing of
 that good work.  

 I. How it was done more regularly than before. 

 1. A place was prepared for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:1">ver. 1</A>.

 2. The priests were ordered to carry it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:2-15">ver. 2-15</A>.

 3. The Levites had their offices assigned them in attending on it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:16-24">ver. 16-24</A>.

 II. How it was done more successfully than before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:25">ver. 25</A>.

 1.  The Levites made no mistake in their work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:26">ver. 26</A>.

 2. David and the people met with no damp upon their joy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:27,28">ver. 27, 28</A>.
 
 As for Michal's despising David, it was nothing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:29">ver. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And <I>David</I> made him houses in the city of David, and
 prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.
 &nbsp; 2  Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the
 Levites: for them hath the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> chosen to carry the ark of God,
 and to minister unto him for ever.
 &nbsp; 3  And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring
 up the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto his place, which he had prepared for
 it.
 &nbsp; 4  And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:
 &nbsp; 5  Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an
 hundred and twenty:
 &nbsp; 6  Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two
 hundred and twenty:
 &nbsp; 7  Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an
 hundred and thirty:
 &nbsp; 8  Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his
 brethren two hundred:
 &nbsp; 9  Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren
 fourscore:
 &nbsp; 10  Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren
 a hundred and twelve.
 &nbsp; 11  And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for
 the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel,
 and Amminadab,
 &nbsp; 12  And said unto them, Ye <I>are</I> the chief of the fathers of the
 Levites: sanctify yourselves, <I>both</I> ye and your brethren, that
 ye may bring up the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel unto <I>the place
 that</I> I have prepared for it.
 &nbsp; 13  For because ye <I>did it</I> not at the first, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God
 made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due
 order.
 &nbsp; 14  So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to
 bring up the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel.
 &nbsp; 15  And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon
 their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded
 according to the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 16  And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their
 brethren <I>to be</I> the singers with instruments of music,
 psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the
 voice with joy.
 &nbsp; 17  So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his
 brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari
 their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;
 &nbsp; 18  And with them their brethren of the second <I>degree,</I>
 Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and
 Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and
 Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters.
 &nbsp; 19  So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <I>were appointed</I> to
 sound with cymbals of brass;
 &nbsp; 20  And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and
 Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on
 Alamoth;
 &nbsp; 21  And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom,
 and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.
 &nbsp; 22  And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, <I>was</I> for song: he
 instructed about the song, because he <I>was</I> skilful.
 &nbsp; 23  And Berechiah and Elkanah <I>were</I> doorkeepers for the ark.
 &nbsp; 24  And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai,
 and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow
 with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah
 <I>were</I> doorkeepers for the ark.

 Preparation is here made for the bringing of the ark home to the city 
 of David from the house of Obed-edom. It is here owned that in the 
 former attempt, though it was a very good work and in it they <I>sought 
 God,</I> yet they <I>sought him, not after the due order,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 "We did not go about our work considerately; and therefore we sped so
 ill." Note, It is not enough that we do that which is good, but we must 
 do it well--not enough that we seek God in a due ordinance, but we must
 seek after him, in a due order. Note, also, When we have suffered for 
 our irregularities we must learn thereby to be more regular; then we 
 answer the end of chastisement. Let us see how the matter was mended. 
 
 1. David now prepared a place for the reception of the ark, before he
 brought it to him; and thus he sought in the due order. He had not time 
 to <I>build a house,</I> but he <I>pitched a tent</I> for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 probably according to the pattern shown to Moses in the mount, or as
 near it as might be, of curtains and boards. Observe, When he made 
 houses for himself in the city of David he prepared a place for the 
 ark. Note, Wherever we build for ourselves, we must be sure to make 
 room for God's ark, for a church in the house. 

 2. David now ordered that the Levites or priests should carry the ark
 upon their shoulders.  Now he bethought himself of that which he could 
 not but know before, that, <I>none ought to carry the ark but the 
 Levites,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The Kohathites carried it in their ordinary marches, and therefore had
 no wagons allotted them, because their work was to <I>bear upon their 
 shoulders,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:9">Num. vii. 9</A>.

 But upon extraordinary occasions, as when they passed Jordan and
 compassed Jericho, the priests carried it. This rule was express, and 
 yet David himself forgot it, and put the ark upon a cart. Note, Even 
 those that are very knowing in the word of God, yet have it not always 
 so ready to them as were to be wished when they have occasion to use 
 it. Wise and good men may be guilty of an oversight, which, as soon as 
 they are aware of, they will correct. David did not go about to justify 
 what had been done amiss, nor to lay the blame on others, but owned 
 himself guilty, with others, of not seeking God in a due order, and now 
 took care not only to summon the Levites to the solemnity, as he did 
 all Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 
 and had done before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:2"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 2</A>),

 but to see that they assembled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 especially the sons of Aaron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 To them he gives the solemn charge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>You are the chief of the fathers of the Levites,</I> therefore do
 you <I>bring up the ark of the Lord.</I> It is expected that those who 
 are advanced above others in dignity should go before others in duty. 
 "You are the chief, and therefore more is expected from you than from 
 others, both by way of service yourselves and influence on the rest. 
 You did it not at first, neither did your duty yourselves nor took care 
 to instruct us, and we smarted for it: <I>The Lord made a breach upon 
 us;</I> we have all smarted for your neglect; <I>this has been by your 
 means</I> (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:9">Mal. i. 9</A>):

 therefore <I>sanctify yourselves,</I> and mind your business." When
 those that have suffered for doing ill thus learn to do better the 
 correction is well bestowed. 

 3. The Levites and priests sanctified themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 and were ready to carry the ark on their shoulders, according to the
 law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Note, Many that are very remiss in their duty, if they were but
 faithfully told of it, would reform and do better. The breach upon Uzza 
 made the priests more careful to sanctify themselves, that is, to 
 cleanse themselves from all ceremonial pollution and to compose 
 themselves for the solemn service of God, so as to strike a reverence 
 upon the people. Some are made examples, that others may be made 
 exemplary and very cautious.

 4. Officers were appointed to be ready to bid the ark welcome, with
 every possible expression of joy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 David ordered the chief of the Levites to nominate those that they knew
 to be proficients for this service.  Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were now 
 first appointed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 They undertook to sound with symbols

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),
 
 others with psalteries
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 others with harps, on the <I>Sheminith,</I> or <I>eighth,</I> eight
 notes higher or lower than the rest, according to the rules of the 
 concert, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 Some that were priests blew with the trumpet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),
 
 as was usual at the removal of the ark
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:8">Num. x. 8</A>)

 and at solemn feasts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:3">Ps. lxxxi. 3</A>.
 
 And one was appointed for song

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 for he was skilful in it, could sing well himself and instruct others.
 Note, As every man has <I>received the gift,</I> so he ought to 
 <I>minister the same,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:10">1 Pet. iv. 10</A>.

 And those that excel in any endowment should not only use it for the
 common good themselves, but teach others also, and not grudge to make 
 others as wise as themselves. This way of praising God by musical 
 instruments had not hitherto been in use. But David, being a prophet, 
 instituted it by divine direction, and added it to the other <I>carnal 
 ordinances</I> of that dispensation, as the apostle calls them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:10">Heb. ix. 10</A>.

 The New Testament keeps up singing of psalms, but has not appointed
 church-music. Some were appointed to be porters

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 others door-keepers for the ark
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>),

 and one of these was Obed-edom, who reckoned it no doubt a place of
 honour, and accepted it as recompence for the entertainment he had 
 given to the ark. He had been for three months housekeeper to the ark, 
 and indeed its landlord.  But, when he might not be so any longer, such 
 an affection had he for it that he was glad to be its door-keeper.</P>

 <A NAME="1Ch15_29"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over
 thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.
 &nbsp; 26  And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare
 the ark of the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that they offered seven
 bullocks and seven rams.
 &nbsp; 27  And David <I>was</I> clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all
 the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the
 master of the song with the singers: David also <I>had</I> upon him an
 ephod of linen.
 &nbsp; 28  Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with
 trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and
 harps.
 &nbsp; 29  And it came to pass, <I>as</I> the ark of the covenant of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul
 looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and
 she despised him in her heart.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All things being got ready for the carrying of the ark to the city of 
 David, and its reception there, we have here an account of the 
 solemnity of this conveyance thither from the house of Obed-edom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God helped the Levites that carried it. The ark was no very great 
 burden, that those who carried it needed any extraordinary help. But, 
 
 1. It is good to take notice of the assistance of the divine providence
 even in those things that fall within the compass of our natural 
 powers: if God did not help us, we could not stir a step. 

 2. In all our religious exercises we must particularly derive help from
 heaven. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+26:22">Acts xxvi. 22</A>.

 All our sufficiency for holy duties is from God. 

 3. The Levites, remembering the breach upon Uzza, were probably ready
 to tremble when they took up the ark; but God helped them, that is, he 
 encouraged them to it, silenced their fears, and strengthened their 
 faith. 

 4. God helped them to do it decently and well, and without making any
 mistake.  If we perform any religious duties so as to escape a breach, 
 and come off with our lives, we must own it is God that helps us; for, 
 if left to ourselves, we should be guilty of some fatal miscarriages. 
 God's ministers that bear the vessels of the Lord have special need of 
 divine help in their ministrations, that God in them may be glorified 
 and his church edified. And, if God help the Levites, the people have 
 the benefit of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. When they experienced the tokens of God's presence with them they 
 offered sacrifices of praise to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 This also he helped them to do. They offered these bullocks and rams
 perhaps by way of atonement for the former error, that it might not now 
 be remembered against them, as well as by way of acknowledgment for the 
 help now received.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. There were great expressions of rejoicing used: the sacred music 
 was played, David danced, the singers sang, and the common people 
 shouted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.
 
 This we had before,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:14,15">2 Sam. vi. 14, 15</A>.

 Learn hence, 

 1.  That we serve a good master, who delights to have his servants sing
 at their work. 

 2. That times of public reformation are, and should be, times of public
 rejoicing. Those are unworthy of the ark that are not glad of it. 

 3. It is not any disparagement to the greatest of men to show
 themselves zealous in the acts of devotion. Michal indeed despised 
 David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+15:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>);

 but <I>her</I> despising him did not make him at all despicable; he did
 not regard it himself, nor did any that were wise and good (and why 
 should we covet the esteem of any but such?) think the worse of 
 him.</P>
