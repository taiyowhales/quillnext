 David has now quite taken leave both of Saul's court and of his camp, 
 has bidden farewell to his alter idem--his other self, the beloved
 Jonathan; and henceforward to the end of this book he is looked upon 
 and treated as an outlaw and proclaimed a traitor. We still find him 
 shifting from place to place for his own safety, and Saul pursuing him. 
 His troubles are very particularly related in this and the following 
 chapters, not only to be a key to the Psalms, but that he might be, as 
 other prophets, an example to the saints in all ages, "of suffering 
 affliction, and of patience," and especially that he might be a type of 
 Christ, who, being anointed to the kingdom, humbled himself, and was 
 therefore highly exalted. But the example of the suffering Jesus was a 
 copy without a blot, that of David was not so; witness the records of 
 this chapter, where we find David in his flight, 

 I. Imposing upon Abimelech the priest, to get from him both victuals 
 and arms,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.
 
 II. Imposing upon Achish, king of Gath, by feigning himself mad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:10-15">ver. 10-15</A>.

 Justly are troubles called temptations, for many are by them drawn into 
 sin.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech
 was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why <I>art</I>
 thou alone, and no man with thee?
 &nbsp; 2 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath
 commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know
 any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have
 commanded thee: and I have appointed <I>my</I> servants to such and
 such a place.
 &nbsp; 3 Now therefore what is under thine hand? give <I>me</I> five
 <I>loaves of</I> bread in mine hand, or what there is present.
 &nbsp; 4 And the priest answered David, and said, <I>There is</I> no common
 bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young
 men have kept themselves at least from women.
 &nbsp; 5 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth
 women <I>have been</I> kept from us about these three days, since I
 came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and <I>the
 bread is</I> in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this
 day in the vessel.
 &nbsp; 6 So the priest gave him hallowed <I>bread:</I> for there was no
 bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.
 &nbsp; 7 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul <I>was</I> there that
 day, detained before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and his name <I>was</I> Doeg, an
 Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that <I>belonged</I> to Saul.
 &nbsp; 8 And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under
 thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword
 nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required
 haste.
 &nbsp; 9 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine,
 whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it <I>is here</I>
 wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take
 <I>it:</I> for <I>there is</I> no other save that here. And David said,
 <I>There is</I> none like that; give it me.

 Here, 

 I. David, in distress, flies in the tabernacle of God, now pitched at 
 Nob, supposed to be a city in the tribe of Benjamin. Since Shiloh was 
 forsaken, the tabernacle was often removed, though the ark still 
 remained at Kirjath-jearim. Hither David came in his flight from Saul's 
 fury

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and applied to Ahimelech the priest. Samuel the prophet could not
 protect him, Jonathan the prince could not. He therefore has recourse 
 next to Ahimelech the priest. He foresees he must now be an exile, and 
 therefore comes to the tabernacle, 

 1. To take an affecting leave of it, for he knows not when he shall see 
 it again, and nothing will be more afflictive to him in his banishment 
 than his distance from the house of God, and his restraint from public 
 ordinances, as appears by many of his psalms. He had given an 
 affectionate farewell to his friend Jonathan, and cannot go till he has 
 given the like to the tabernacle.  

 2. To enquire of the Lord there, and to beg direction from him in the
 way both of duty and safety, his case being difficult and dangerous.  
 That this was his business appears

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:10"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 10</A>,

 where it is said that <I>Ahimelech enquired of the Lord for him,</I> as
 he had done formerly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It is a great comfort to us in a day of trouble that we have a God to
 go to, to whom we may open our case, and from whom we may ask and 
 expect direction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Ahimelech the priest is surprised to see him in so poor an 
 equipage; having heard that he had fallen into disgrace at court, he 
 looked shy upon him, as most are apt to do upon their friends when the 
 world frowns upon them. He was afraid of incurring Saul's displeasure 
 by entertaining him, and took notice how mean a figure he now made to 
 what he used to make: <I>Why art thou alone?</I> He had some with him 
 (as appears 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+2:26">Mark ii. 26</A>),

 but they were only his own servants; he had none of the courtiers, no
 persons of quality with him, as he used to have at other times, when he 
 came to enquire of the Lord. He says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:4">Ps. xlii. 4</A>)

 he was wont to <I>go with a multitude to the house of God;</I> and,
 having now but two or three with him, Ahimelech might well ask, <I>Why 
 art thou alone?</I> He that was suddenly advanced from the solitude of 
 a shepherd's life to the crowd and hurries of the camp is now as soon 
 reduced to the desolate condition of an exile and is <I>alone like a 
 sparrow on the housetop,</I> such charges are there in this world and 
 so uncertain are its smiles! Those that are courted to-day may be 
 deserted to-morrow.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. David, under pretence of being sent by Saul upon public services, 
 solicits Ahimelech to supply his present wants, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here David did not behave like himself. He told Ahimelech a gross 
 untruth, that Saul had ordered him business to despatch, that his 
 attendants were dismissed to such a place, and that he was charged to 
 observe secresy and therefore durst not communicate it, no, not to the 
 priest himself. This was all false. What shall we say to this? The 
 scripture does not conceal it, and we dare not justify it. It was ill 
 done, and proved of bad consequence; for it <I>occasioned the death of 
 the priests of the Lord,</I> as David reflected upon it afterwards with 
 regret, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:22"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 22</A>.

 It was needless for him thus to dissemble with the priest, for we may
 suppose that, if he had told him the truth, he would have sheltered and 
 relieved him as readily as Samuel did, and would have known the better 
 how to advise him and enquire of God for him.  People should be free 
 with their faithful ministers. David was a man of great faith and 
 courage, and yet now both failed him, and he fell thus foully through 
 fear and cowardice, and both owing to the weakness of his faith. Had he 
 trusted God aright, he would not have used such a sorry sinful shift as 
 this for his own preservation. It is written, not for our imitation, 
 no, not in the greatest straits, but for our admonition. <I>Let him 
 that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall;</I> and let us all pray 
 daily, <I>Lord, lead us not into temptation.</I> Let us all take 
 occasion from this to lament, 

 (1.) The weakness and infirmity of good men; the best are not perfect 
 on this side heaven. There may be true grace where yet there are many 
 failings.  

 (2.) The wickedness of bad times, which forces good men into such 
 straits as prove temptations too strong for them. Oppression makes a 
 wise man do foolishly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Two things David begged of Ahimelech, <I>bread</I> and a 
 <I>sword.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He wanted bread: <I>five loaves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Travelling was then troublesome, when men generally carried their
 provisions with them in kind, having little money and no public houses, 
 else David would not now have had to seek for bread. It seems David had 
 known the <I>seed of the righteous begging bread</I> occasionally, but 
 not constantly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:25">Ps. xxxvii. 25</A>.
 
 Now,

 [1.] The priest objected that he had none but hallowed bread, 
 <I>show-bread,</I> which had stood a week on the golden table in the 
 sanctuary, and was taken thence for the use of the priests and their 
 families, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 It seems the priest kept no good house, but wanted either a heart to be
 hospitable or provisions wherewithal to be so.  Ahimelech thinks that 
 the young men that attended David might not eat of this bread unless 
 they had for some time abstained from women, even from their own wives; 
 this was required at the <I>giving of the law</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:15">Exod. xix. 15</A>),

 but otherwise we never find this made the matter of any ceremonial
 purity on the one side or pollution on the other, and therefore the 
 priest here seems to be over-nice, not to say superstitious. 

 [2.] David pleads that he and those that were with him, in this case of 
 necessity, might lawfully eat of the hallowed bread, for they were not 
 only able to answer his terms of keeping from women for three days 
 past, but <I>the vessels</I> (that is, the bodies) <I>of the young men 
 were holy,</I> being <I>possessed in sanctification and honour at all 
 times</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+4:4,5">1 Thess. iv. 4, 5</A>),

 and therefore God would take particular care of them, that they wanted
 not necessary supports, and would have his priest to do so. Being thus 
 holy, holy things were not forbidden them. Poor and pious Israelites 
 were in effect priests to God, and, rather than be starved, might feed 
 on the bread which was appropriated to the priests. Believers are 
 spiritual priests, and the offerings of the Lord shall be their 
 inheritance; they eat the bread of their God. He pleads that the bread 
 is in a manner common, now that what was primarily the religious use of 
 it is over; especially (as our margin reads it) <I>where there is other 
 bread</I> (<I>hot,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 <I>sanctified that day in the vessel,</I> and put in the room of it
 upon the table. This was David's plea, and the Son of David approves 
 it, and shows from it that mercy is to be preferred to sacrifice, that 
 ritual observance must give way to moral duties, and that may be done 
 in a case of an urgent providential necessity which may not otherwise 
 be done. He brings it to justify his disciples in plucking the ears of 
 corn on the sabbath day, for which the Pharisees censured them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:3,4">Matt.  xii. 3, 4</A>.

 [3.] Ahimelech hereupon supplies him: <I>He gave him hallowed bread</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and some think it was about this that <I>he enquired of the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:10"><I>ch.</I>  xxii. 10</A>.

 As a faithful servant he would not dispose of his master's provisions
 without his master's leave. This bread, we may suppose, was the more 
 agreeable to David for its being hallowed, so precious were all sacred 
 things to him. The show-bread was but twelve loaves in all, yet out of 
 these he gave David five 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 though they had no more in the house; but he trusted Providence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He wanted a sword. Persons of quality, though officers of the 
 army, did not then wear their swords so constantly as now they do, else 
 surely David would not have been without one. It was a wonder that 
 Jonathan did not furnish him with his, as he had before done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:4"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 4</A>.
 
 However, it happened that he had now no weapons with him, the reason of
 which he pretends to be because he came away in haste, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Those that are furnished with the sword of the Spirit and the shield of
 faith cannot be disarmed of them, nor need they, at any time, to be at 
 a loss. But the priests, it seems, had no swords: the weapons of their 
 warfare were not carnal. There was not a sword to be found about the 
 tabernacle but the sword of Goliath, which was laid up behind the 
 ephod, as a monument of the glorious victory David obtained over him.  
 Probably David had an eye to that when he asked the priest to help him 
 with a sword; for, that being mentioned, O! says he, <I>there is none 
 like that, give it to me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He could not use Saul's armour, for he had not proved it; but this
 sword of Goliath he had made trial of and done execution with. By this 
 it appears that he was now well grown in strength and stature, that he 
 could wear and wield such a sword as that. God had <I>taught his hands 
 to war,</I> so that he could do wonders,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:34">Ps. xviii. 34</A>.

 Two things we may observe concerning this sword:--

 [1.] That God had graciously given it to him, as a pledge of his 
 singular favour; so that whenever he drew it, nay, whenever he looked 
 upon it, it would be a great support to his faith, by bringing to mind 
 that great instance of the particular care and countenance of the 
 divine providence respecting him. 

 [2.] That he had gratefully given it back to God, dedicating it to him 
 and to his honour as a token of his thankfulness; and now in his 
 distress it stood him greatly in stead.  Note, What we devote to God's 
 praise, and serve him with, is most likely to redound, one way or 
 other, to our own comfort and benefit.  What we gave we have.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus was David well furnished with arms and victuals; but it fell out 
 very unhappily that there was one of Saul's servants then attending 
 before the Lord, <I>Doeg</I> by name, that proved a base traitor both 
 to David and Ahimelech. He was by birth an Edomite 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and though proselyted to the Jewish religion, to get the preferment he
 now had under Saul, yet he retained the ancient and hereditary enmity 
 of Edom to Israel. He was master of the herds, which perhaps was then a 
 place of as much honour as master of the horse is now. Some occasion or 
 other he had at this time to wait on the priest, either to be purified 
 from some pollution or to pay some vow; but, whatever his business was, 
 it is said, he was <I>detained before the Lord.</I> He must attend and 
 could not help it, but he was sick of the service, <I>snuffed at it, 
 and said, What a weariness is it!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:13">Mal. i. 13</A>.

 He would rather have been any where else than before the Lord, and
 therefore, instead of minding the business he came about, was plotting 
 to do David a mischief and to be revenged on Ahimelech for detaining 
 him. God's sanctuary could never secure such wolves in sheep's 
 clothing. See

 went to Achish the king of Gath.
 &nbsp; 11 And the servants of Achish said unto him, <I>Is</I> not this
 David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of
 him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David
 his ten thousands?
 &nbsp; 12 And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore
 afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
 &nbsp; 13 And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned
 himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the
 gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
 &nbsp; 14 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is
 mad: wherefore <I>then</I> have ye brought him to me?

 to play the mad man in my presence? shall this <I>fellow</I> come into

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, though king elect, is here an exile--designed to be master of
 vast treasures, yet just now begging his bread--anointed to the crown,
 and yet here forced to flee from his country. Thus do God's providences 
 sometimes seem to run counter to his promises, for the trial of his 
 people's faith, and the glorifying of his name, in the accomplishment 
 of his counsels, notwithstanding the difficulties that lay in the way. 
 Here is, 

 1. David's flight into the land of the Philistines, where he hoped to 
 be hid, and to remain undiscovered in the court or camp of Achish king 
 of Gath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Israel's darling is necessitated to quit the land of Israel, and he
 that was the Philistine's great enemy (upon I know not what 
 inducements) goes to seek for shelter among them.  It should seem that 
 as, though the Israelites loved him, yet the king of Israel had a 
 personal enmity to him, which obliged him to leave his own country, so, 
 though the Philistines hated him, yet the king of Gath had a personal 
 kindness for him, valuing his merit, and perhaps the more for his 
 killing Goliath of Gath, who, it may be, had been no friend to Achish.  
 To him David now went directly, as to one he could confide in, as 
 afterwards

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+27:2,3"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 2, 3</A>),

 and Achish would not have protected him but that he was afraid of
 disobliging his own people. God's persecuted people have often found 
 better usage from Philistines than from Israelites, in the Gentile 
 theatres than in the Jewish synagogues. The king of Judah imprisoned 
 Jeremiah, and the king of Babylon set him at liberty. 

 2. The disgust which the servants of Achish took at his being there,
 and their complaint of it to Achish

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>Is not this David?</I> Is not this he that has triumphed over the
 Philistines?  witness that burden of the song which was so much talked 
 of, <I>Saul has slain his thousands,</I> but <I>David,</I> this very 
 man, <I>his ten thousands.</I> Nay, Is not this he that (if our 
 intelligence from the land of Israel be true) is, or is to be, <I>king 
 of the land?</I>" As such, "he must be an enemy to our country; and is 
 it safe or honourable for us to protect or entertain such a man?" 
 Achish perhaps had intimated to them that it would be policy to 
 entertain David, because he was now an enemy to Saul, and he might be 
 hereafter a friend to them. It is common for the outlaws of a nation to 
 be sheltered by the enemies of that nation. But the servants of Achish 
 objected to his politics, and thought it not at all fit that he should 
 stay among them.  

 3. The fright which this put David into. Though he had some reason to
 put confidence in Achish, yet, when he perceived the servants of Achish 
 jealous of him, he began to be afraid that Achish would be obliged to 
 deliver him up to them, and he was <I>sorely afraid</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and perhaps he was the more apprehensive of his own danger, when he was
 thus discovered, because he wore Goliath's sword, which, we may 
 suppose, was well known in Gath, and with which he had reason to expect 
 they would cut off his head, as he had cut off Goliath's with it.  
 David now learned by experience what he has taught us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:9">Ps. cxviii. 9</A>),
 
 <I>that it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in
 princes.</I> Men of high degree are a lie, and, if we make them our 
 hope, they may prove our fear. It was at this time that David penned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:1-23">Psalm lv.</A>

 (<I>Michtam, a golden psalm), when the Philistines took him in
 Gath,</I> where having shown before God his distresses, he resolves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 
 "<I>What time I am afraid I will trust in thee;</I> and therefore
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 <I>will not be afraid what man can do unto me,</I> no, not the sons of
 giants." 

 4. The course he took to get out of their hands: <I>He feigned himself
 mad,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He used the gestures and fashions of a natural fool, or one that had
 gone out of his wits, supposing they would be ready enough to believe 
 that the disgrace he had fallen into, and the troubles he was now in, 
 had driven him distracted. This dissimulation of his cannot be 
 justified (it was a mean thing thus to disparage himself, and 
 inconsistent with truth thus to misrepresent himself, and therefore not 
 becoming the honour and sincerity of such a man as David); yet it may 
 in some degree be excused, for it was not a downright lie and it was 
 like a stratagem in war, by which he imposed upon his enemies for the 
 preservation of his own life. What David did here in pretence and for 
 his own safety, which made it partly excusable, drunkards do really, 
 and only to gratify a base lust: they made fools of themselves and 
 change their behaviour; their words and actions commonly are either as 
 silly and ridiculous as an idiot's or as furious and outrageous as a 
 madman's, which has often made me wonder that ever men of sense and 
 honour should allow themselves in it. 
 
 5. His escape by this means,

 I am apt to think Achish was aware that the delirium was but
 counterfeit, but, being desirous to protect David (as we find 
 afterwards he was very kind to him, even when the lord of the 
 Philistines favoured him not,

 he pretended to his servants that he really thought he was mad, and
 therefore had reason to question whether it was David or no; or, if it 
 were, they need not fear him, what harm could he do them now that his

 shall be desolate,</I> though they may be, as he now was, solitary and 
 distressed, <I>persecuted, but not forsaken.</I></P>
