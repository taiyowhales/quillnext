 Things are here ripening for, and hastening towards, the utter 
 destruction of Jerusalem. We left Jehoiakim on the throne, placed there 
 by the king of Egypt: now here we have, 

 I. The troubles of his reign, how he was brought into subjection by the
 king of Babylon, and severely chastised for attempting to shake off the 
 yoke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>),

 and how Egypt also was conquered by Nebuchadnezzar,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:7">ver. 7</A>.

 II. The desolations of his son's reign, which continued but three
 months; and then he and all his great men, being forced to surrender at
 discretion, were carried captives to Babylon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:8-16">ver. 8-16</A>.

 III. The preparatives of the next reign (which was the last of all) for
 the utter ruin of Jerusalem, which the next chapter will give us an 
 account of,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and
 Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and
 rebelled against him.
 &nbsp; 2 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and
 bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the
 children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it,
 according to the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which he spake by his servants
 the prophets.
 &nbsp; 3 Surely at the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came <I>this</I> upon Judah,
 to remove <I>them</I> out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh,
 according to all that he did;
 &nbsp; 4 And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled
 Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> would not pardon.
 &nbsp; 5 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did,
 <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
 of Judah?
 &nbsp; 6 So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son
 reigned in his stead.
 &nbsp; 7 And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his
 land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt
 unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the first mention of a name which makes a great figure 
 both in the histories and in the prophecies of the Old Testament; it is 
 that of <I>Nebuchadnezzar,</I> king of Babylon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 that head of gold. He was a potent prince, and one that was the terror
 of the mighty in the land of the living; and yet his name would not 
 have been known in sacred writ if he had not been employed in the 
 destruction of Jerusalem and the captivity of the Jews.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He made Jehoiakim his tributary and kept him in subjection three 
 years, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Nebuchadnezzar began his reign in the fourth year of Jehoiakim. In his
 eighth year he made him his prisoner, but restored him upon his promise 
 of faithfulness to him.  That promise he kept about three years, but 
 then rebelled, probably in hopes of assistance from the king of Egypt. 
 If Jehoiakim had served his God as he should have done, he would not 
 have been servant to the king of Babylon; but God would thus make him 
 know the difference between his service and <I>the service of the kings 
 of the countries,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:8">2 Chron. xii. 8</A>.

 If he had been content with his servitude, and true to his word, his
 condition would have been no worse; but, rebelling against the king of 
 Babylon, he plunged himself into more trouble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. When he rebelled Nebuchadnezzar sent his forces against him to 
 destroy his country, bands of Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, Ammonites, 
 who were all now in the service and pay of the king of Babylon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 and withal retained, and now showed, their ancient enmity to the Israel
 of God. Yet no mention is here made of their commission from the king 
 of Babylon, but only of that from the King of kings: <I>The Lord sent 
 against him</I> all these bands; and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>Surely at the commandment of the Lord came this upon Judah,</I> else
 the commandment of Nebuchadnezzar could not have brought it. Many are 
 serving God's purposes who are not aware of it. Two things God intended 
 in suffering Judah to be thus harassed:--

 1. The punishment of the sins of Manasseh, which God now visited upon
 <I>the third and fourth generation.</I> So long he waited before he 
 visited them, to see if the nation would repent; but they continued 
 impenitent, notwithstanding Josiah's endeavours to reform them, and 
 ready to relapse, upon the first turn, into their former idolatries. 
 Now that the old bond was put in suit they were called up upon the 
 former judgment; that was revived which God had <I>laid up in 
 store,</I> and <I>sealed among his treasures</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:34,Job+14:17">Deut. xxxii. 34; Job xiv. 17</A>),

 and in remembrance of that he removed Judah out of his sight, and let
 the world know that <I>time will not wear out the guilt of sin</I> and 
 that reprieves are not pardons. All that Manasseh did was called to 
 mind, but especially the <I>innocent blood that he shed,</I> much of 
 which, we may suppose, was the blood of God's witnesses and 
 worshippers, <I>which the Lord would not pardon.</I> Is there then any 
 unpardonable sin but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost? This is 
 meant of the remitting of the temporal punishment.  Though Manasseh 
 repented, and we have reason to think even the persecutions and murders 
 he was guilty of were pardoned, so that he was delivered from the wrath 
 to come; yet, as they were national sins, they lay still charged upon 
 the land, crying for national judgments. Perhaps some were now living 
 who were aiding and abetting; and the present king was guilty of 
 innocent blood, as appears 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:17">Jer. xxii. 17</A>.

 See what a provoking sin murder is, how loud it cries, and how long.
 See what need nations have to lament the sins of their fathers, lest 
 they smart for them. God intended hereby the accomplishment of the 
 prophecies; it was <I>according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke 
 by his servants the prophets.</I> Rather shall Judah be <I>removed out 
 of his sight,</I> nay, rather shall <I>heaven and earth pass away,</I> 
 than any word of God fall to the ground. Threatenings will be fulfilled 
 as certainly as promises, if the sinner's repentance prevent not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The king of Egypt was likewise subdued by the king of Babylon, and 
 a great part of his country taken from him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It was but lately that he had oppressed Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:33"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 33</A>.

 Now he is himself brought down and disabled to attempt any thing for
 the recovery of his losses or the assistance of his allies. He dares 
 not <I>come any more out of his land.</I> Afterwards he attempted to 
 give Zedekiah some relief, but was obliged to retire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+37:7">Jer. xxxvii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Jehoiakim, seeing his country laid waste and himself ready to fall 
 into the enemy's hand, as it should seem, died of a broken heart, in 
 the midst of his days 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>).

 So <I>Jehoiakim slept with his fathers;</I> but it is not said that he
 was <I>buried with them,</I> for no doubt the prophecy of Jeremiah was 
 fulfilled, that he should not be lamented, as his father was, but 
 <I>buried with the burial of an ass</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:18,19">Jer. xxii. 18, 19</A>),
 
 and his dead body cast out, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:30">Jer. xxxvi. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 Jehoiachin <I>was</I> eighteen years old when he began to reign,
 and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name
 <I>was</I> Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 9 And he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 according to all that his father had done.
 &nbsp; 10 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
 came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
 &nbsp; 11 And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city,
 and his servants did besiege it.
 &nbsp; 12 And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of
 Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes,
 and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth
 year of his reign.
 &nbsp; 13 And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in
 pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had
 made in the temple of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had said.
 &nbsp; 14 And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and
 all the mighty men of valour, <I>even</I> ten thousand captives, and
 all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest
 sort of the people of the land.
 &nbsp; 15 And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's
 mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of
 the land, <I>those</I> carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to
 Babylon.
 &nbsp; 16 And all the men of might, <I>even</I> seven thousand, and
 craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all <I>that were</I> strong <I>and</I> apt
 for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to
 Babylon.
 &nbsp; 17 And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother
 king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.
 &nbsp; 18 Zedekiah <I>was</I> twenty and one years old when he began to
 reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
 name <I>was</I> Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
 &nbsp; 19 And he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
 &nbsp; 20 For through the anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> it came to pass in
 Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his
 presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This should have been the history of king Jehoiachin's <I>reign,</I> 
 but, alas! it is only the history of king Jehoiachin's 
 <I>captivity,</I> as it is called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:2">Ezek. i. 2</A>.

 He came to the crown, not to have the honour of wearing it, but the
 shame of losing it. <I>Ideo tantum venerat, ut exiret--He came in only 
 to go out.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His reign was short and inconsiderable. He reigned but three months, 
 and then was removed and carried captive to Babylon, as his father, it 
 is likely, would have been if he had lived but so much longer. What an 
 unhappy young prince was this, that was thrust into a falling house, a 
 sinking throne! What an unnatural father had he, who begat him to 
 suffer for him, and by his own sin and folly had left himself nothing 
 to bequeath to his son but his own miseries! Yet this young prince 
 reigned long enough to show that he justly smarted for his fathers' 
 sins, for he trod in their steps 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord,</I> as they had
 done; he did nothing to cut off the entail of the curse, to discharge 
 the incumbrances of his crown, and therefore (<I>transit cum onere--the 
 incumbrance descends with the crown</I>) with his own iniquity that of 
 his fathers shall come into the account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The calamities that came upon him, and his family, and people, in 
 the very beginning of his reign, were very grievous. 

 1. Jerusalem was besieged by the king of Babylon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 He had sent his forces to ravage the country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Now he came himself, and laid siege to the city. Now the word of God
 was fulfilled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:49-69">Deut. xxviii. 49</A>,

 &c.), <I>The Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far, of fierce 
 countenance,</I> that shall first <I>eat of the fruit of thy land</I> 
 and then <I>besiege thee in all thy gates.</I>

 2. Jehoiachin immediately surrendered at discretion. As soon as he
 heard the king of Babylon had come in person against the city, his name 
 having at this time become very formidable, he beat a parley and went 
 out to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Had he made his peace with God, and taken the method that Hezekiah did
 in the like case, he needed not to have feared the king of Babylon, but 
 might have held out with courage, honour, and success (one should have 
 chased a thousand); but, wanting the faith and piety of an Israelite, 
 he had not the resolution of a man, of a soldier, of a prince. He and 
 his royal family, his mother and wives, his servants and princes, 
 delivered themselves up prisoners of war; this was the consequence of 
 their being servants of sin. 

 3.  Nebuchadnezzar rifled the treasuries both of the church and of the
 state, and carried away the silver and gold of both,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Now the word of God by Isaiah was fulfilled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:17"><I>ch.</I> xx. 17</A>),

 <I>All that is in thy house shall be carried to Babylon.</I> Even the
 vessels of the temple which Solomon had made, and laid up in store to 
 be used as the old ones were worn out, he cut off from the temple, and 
 began to cut them in pieces, but, upon second thoughts, reserved them 
 for his own use, for we find Belshazzar drinking wine in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:2,3">Dan. v. 2, 3</A>.

 4.  He carried away a great part of Jerusalem into captivity, to weaken
 it, that he might effectually secure to himself the dominion of it and 
 prevent its revolt, and to enrich himself with the wealth or service of 
 those he took away. There had been some carried away eight years before 
 this, in the first year of Nebuchadnezzar and the third of Jehoiakim, 
 among whom were Daniel and his fellows. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:1,6">Dan. i. 1, 6</A>.

 They had approved themselves so well that this politic prince coveted
 more of them. Now he carried off,

 (1.) The young king himself and his family

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 and we find
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:27-29"><I>ch.</I> xxv. 27-29</A>)

 that for thirty-seven years he continued a close prisoner.

 (2.) All the great men, the princes and officers, whose riches were
 <I>kept for the owners thereof to their hurt</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:13">Eccl. v. 13</A>),

 tempting the enemies to make a prey of them first.

 (3.) All the military men, the <I>mighty men of valour</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),
 
 <I>the mighty of the land</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 <I>the men of might, even all that were strong and apt for war,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 These could not defend themselves, and the conqueror would not leave
 them to defend their country, but took them away, to be employed in his 
 service.

 (4.) All the craftsmen and smiths who made weapons of war; in taking
 them he did, in effect, disarm the city, according to the Philistines' 
 policy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:19">1 Sam. xiii. 19</A>.
 
 In this captivity Ezekiel the prophet was carried away
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:1,2">Ezek. i. 1, 2</A>)

 and Mordecai, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:6">Esth. ii. 6</A>.

 This Jehoiachin was also called <I>Jeconiah</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+3:16">1 Chron. iii. 16</A>),

 and in contempt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:24">Jer. xxii. 24</A>,

 where his captivity is foretold) <I>Coniah.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The successor whom the king of Babylon appointed in the room of 
 Jehoiachin. God had written him childless 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:30">Jer. xxii. 30</A>)

 and therefore his uncle was entrusted with the government. The king of
 Babylon made Mattaniah king, the son of Josiah; and to remind him, and 
 let all the world know, that he was his creature, he changed his name 
 and called him <I>Zedekiah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 God had sometimes charged it upon his people, <I>They have set up
 kings, but not by me</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:4">Hos. viii. 4</A>),

 and now, to punish them for that, the king of Babylon shall have the
 setting up of their kings. Those are justly deprived of their liberty 
 that use it, and insist upon it, against God's authority. This Zedekiah 
 was the last of the kings of Judah. The name which the king of Babylon 
 gave him signifies <I>The justice of the Lord,</I> and was a presage of 
 the glorifying of God's justice in his ruin. 

 1. See how impious this Zedekiah was. Though the judgments of God upon
 his three immediate predecessors might have been a warning to him not 
 to tread in their steps, yet <I>he did that which was evil,</I> like 
 all the rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 2. See how impolitic he was. As his predecessor lost his courage, so he
 his wisdom, with his religion, for he <I>rebelled against the king of 
 Babylon</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 whose tributary he was, and so provoked him whom he was utterly unable
 to contend with, and who, if he had continued true to him, would have 
 protected him. This was the most foolish thing he could do, and 
 hastened the ruin of his kingdom. This came to pass <I>through the 
 anger of the Lord, that he might cast them out from his presence.</I> 
 Note, When those that are entrusted with the counsels of a nation act 
 unwisely, and against their true interest, we ought to take notice of 
 the displeasure of God in it.  It is for the sins of a people that God 
 <I>removes the speech of the trusty and takes away the understanding of 
 the aged,</I> and <I>hides from their eyes the things that belong 
 to</I> the public <I>peace.</I> Whom God will destroy he 
 infatuates.</P>
