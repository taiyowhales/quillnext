 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a much fuller account of the reign of Abijah, the son of 
 Rehoboam, than we had in the Kings. There we found that his character 
 was no better than his father's--he "walked in the sins of his father,
 and his heart was not right with God," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:2,3">1 Kings xv. 2, 3</A>.

 But here we find him more brave and successful in war than his father
 was. He reigned but three years, and was chiefly famous for a glorious
 victory he obtained over the forces of Jeroboam. Here we have, 

 I. The armies brought into the field on both sides, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:3">ver. 3</A>.

 The remonstrance which Abijah made before the battle, setting forth the
 justice of his cause,

 III. The distress which Judah was brought into by the policy of
 Jeroboam, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.

 IV. The victory they obtained notwithstanding, by the power of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:15-20">ver. 15-20</A>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to
 reign over Judah.
 &nbsp; 2  He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also
 <I>was</I> Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war
 between Abijah and Jeroboam.
 &nbsp; 3  And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant
 men of war, <I>even</I> four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam
 also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred
 thousand chosen men, <I>being</I> mighty men of valour.
 &nbsp; 4  And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which <I>is</I> in mount
 Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;
 &nbsp; 5  Ought ye not to know that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel gave the
 kingdom over Israel to David for ever, <I>even</I> to him and to his
 sons by a covenant of salt?
 &nbsp; 6  Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son
 of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.
 &nbsp; 7  And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of
 Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son
 of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could
 not withstand them.
 &nbsp; 8  And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the
 hand of the sons of David; and ye <I>be</I> a great multitude, and
 <I>there are</I> with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for
 gods.
 &nbsp; 9  Have ye not cast out the priests of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the sons of
 Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the
 manner of the nations of <I>other</I> lands? so that whosoever cometh
 to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, <I>the
 same</I> may be a priest of <I>them that are</I> no gods.
 &nbsp; 10  But as for us, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> our God, and we have not
 forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 <I>are</I> the sons of Aaron, and the Levites <I>wait</I> upon <I>their</I>
 business:
 &nbsp; 11  And they burn unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> every morning and every evening
 burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the showbread also <I>set they
 in order</I> upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with
 the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God; but ye have forsaken him.
 &nbsp; 12  And, behold, God himself <I>is</I> with us for <I>our</I> captain, and
 his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O
 children of Israel, fight ye not against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of your
 fathers; for ye shall not prosper.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Abijah's mother was called <I>Maachah,</I> the daughter of Absalom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:20"><I>ch.</I> xi. 20</A>;

 here she is called <I>Michaiah,</I> the daughter of Uriel. It is most
 probable that she was a grand-daughter of Absalom, by his daughter 
 Tamar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+14:27">2 Sam. xiv. 27</A>),

 and that her immediate father was this Uriel. But we are here to attend
 Abijah into the field of battle with Jeroboam king of Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God gave him leave to engage with Jeroboam, and owned him in the 
 conflict, though he would not permit Rehoboam to do it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:4"><I>ch.</I> xi. 4</A>.

 1. Jeroboam, it is probable, was now the aggressor, and what Abijah did
 was in his own necessary defence. Jeroboam, it may be, happening to 
 survive Rehoboam, claimed the crown of Judah be survivorship, at least 
 hoped to get it from this young king, upon his accession to the throne.  
 Against these impudent pretensions it was brave in Abijah to take up 
 arms, and God stood by him. 

 2. When Rehoboam attempted to recover his ten tribes Jeroboam was upon
 his good behaviour, and there must be some trial of him; but now that 
 he had discovered what manner of man he was, by setting up the calves 
 and casting off the priests, Abijah is allowed to chastise him, and it 
 does not appear that he intended any more; whereas Rehoboam aimed at no 
 less than the utter reduction of the ten tribes, which was contrary to 
 the counsel of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jeroboam's army was double in number to that of Abijah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 for he had ten tribes to raise an army out of, while Abijah had but
 two. Of the army on both sides it is said, they were <I>mighty men, 
 chosen men,</I> and <I>valiant;</I> but the army of Judah consisted 
 only of 400,000, while Jeroboam's army amounted to 800,000. The 
 inferior number however proved victorious; for the battle is not always 
 to the strong nor the cause to the majority.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Abijah, before he fought them, reasoned with them, to persuade 
 them, though not to return to the house of David (that matter was 
 settled by the divine determination and he acquiesced), yet to desist 
 from fighting against the house of David. He would not have them 
 <I>withstand the kingdom of the Lord in the hands of the sons of 
 David</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 but at least to be content with what they had. Note, It is good to try
 reason before we use force. If the point may be gained by dint of 
 argument, better so than by dint of sword. We must never fly to violent 
 methods till all the arts of persuasion have been tried in vain. War 
 must be the <I>ultima ratio regum</I>--<I>the last resort of kings.</I> 
 Fair reasoning may do a great deal of good and prevent a good deal of 
 mischief. <I>How forcible are right words!</I> Abijah had got with his 
 army into the heart of their country; for he made this speech upon a 
 hill in Mount Ephraim, where he might be heard by Jeroboam and the 
 principal officers, with whom it is probable he desired to have a 
 treaty, to which they consented. It has been usual for great generals 
 to make speeches to their soldiers to animate them, and this speech of 
 Abijah had some tendency to do this, but was directed to Jeroboam and 
 all Israel. Two things Abijah undertakes to make out, for the 
 satisfaction of his own men and the conviction of the enemy:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he had right on his side, a <I>jus divinum</I>--<I>a divine
 right:</I> "You know, or ought to know, that <I>God gave the kingdom to 
 David and his sons for ever</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 not by common providence, his usual way of disposing of kingdoms, but
 by a covenant of salt, a lasting covenant, a covenant made by 
 sacrifice, which was always salted; so bishop Patrick. All Israel had 
 owned that David was a king of God's making, and that God had entailed 
 the crown upon his family; so that Jeroboam's taking the crown of 
 Israel at first was not justifiable: yet it is not certain that Abijah 
 referred chiefly to that, for he knew that Jeroboam had a grant from 
 God of the ten tribes.  His attempt, however, to disturb the peace and 
 possession of the king of Judah was by no means excusable; for when the 
 ten tribes were given to him two were reserved for the house of David. 
 Abijah shows,

 (1.) That there was a great deal of dishonesty and disingenuousness in
 Jeroboam's first setting himself up: He <I>rebelled against his 
 lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)
 
 who had preferred him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:28">1 Kings xi. 28</A>),

 and basely took advantage of Rehoboam's weakness in a critical
 juncture, when, in gratitude to his old master and in justice to his 
 title, he ought rather to have stood by him, and helped to secure the 
 people in their allegiance to him, than to head a party against him and 
 make a prey of him, which was unworthily done and what he could not 
 expect to prosper in. Those that supported him are here called <I>vain 
 men</I> (a character perhaps borrowed from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:3">Judg. xi. 3</A>),

 men that did not act from any steady principle, but were given to
 change, and men of Belial, that were for shaking off the yoke of 
 government and setting those over them that would do just as they would 
 have them do. 

 (2.) That there was a great deal of impiety in his present attempt;
 for, in fighting against the house of David, he fought <I>against the 
 kingdom of the Lord.</I> Those who oppose right oppose the righteous 
 God who sits in the throne judging right, and cannot promise themselves 
 success in so doing. Right may indeed go by the worst for a time, but 
 it will prevail at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he had God on his side. This he insisted much upon, that the 
 religion of Jeroboam and his army was false and idolatrous, but that he 
 and his people, the men of Judah, had the pure worship of the true and 
 living God among them. It appears from the character given of Abijah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:3">1 Kings xv. 3</A>)

 that he was not himself in this war chiefly from the religion of his
 kingdom. For, 

 (1.) Whatever he was otherwise, it should seem that he was no idolator,
 or, if he connived at the high places and images

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+14:3,5"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 3, 5</A>),

 yet he constantly kept up the temple-service.  

 (2.) Whatever corruptions there were in the kingdom of Judah, the state
 of religion among them was better than in the kingdom of Israel, with 
 which they were now contending. 

 (3.) It is common for those that deny the power of godliness to boast
 of the form of it.

 (4.) It was the cause of his kingdom that he was pleading; and, though
 he was not himself so good as he should have been, yet he hoped that, 
 for the sake of the good men and good things that were in Judah, God 
 would now appear for them. Many that have little religion themselves 
 yet have so much sense and grace as to value it in others. See how he 
 describes, 

 [1.] The apostasy of Israel from God. "<I>You are a great
 multitude,</I>" said he, "far superior to us in number; but we need not 
 fear you, for you have that among yourselves which is enough to ruin 
 you. For," <I>First,</I> "You have calves for your gods

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 that are unable to protect and help you and will certainly cause the
 true and living God to oppose you.  Those will be Achans, troublers of 
 your camp." <I>Secondly,</I> "You have base men for your priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 You have cast off the tribes of Levi, and the house of Aaron, whom God
 appointed to minister in holy things; and, in conformity to the custom 
 of the idolatrous nations, make any man a priest that has a mind to the 
 office and will be at the charge of the consecration, though ever so 
 much a scandal to the office." Yet such, though very unfit to be 
 priests, were fittest of all to be <I>their</I> priests; for what more 
 agreeable to gods that were no gods than priests that were no priests?  
 Like to like, both pretenders and usurpers. 

 [2.] The adherence of Judah to God: "<I>But as for us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 <I>we have not forsaken God.</I> Jehovah is our God, the God of our
 fathers, the God of Israel, who is able to protect us, and give us 
 success. He is with us, for we are with him." <I>First,</I> "At home in 
 his temple: We <I>keep his charge,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 We worship no images, have no priests but what he has ordained, no
 rites of worship but what he has prescribed. Both the temple service 
 and the temple furniture are of his appointing. His appointment we 
 abide by, and neither add nor diminish. These we have the comfort of, 
 these we now stand up in the defence of: so that upon a religious as 
 well as a civil account we have the better cause.  <I>Secondly,</I> 
 Here in the camp; he is our captain, and we may therefore be sure that 
 he is with us, because we are with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 And, as a token of his presence, we have here with us his priests,
 sounding his trumpets according to the law, as a testimony against you, 
 and an assurance to us that in the day of battle we shall be 
 <I>remembered before the Lord our God</I> and <I>saved from our 
 enemies;</I>" for so this sacred signal is explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:9">Num. x. 9</A>.
 
 Nothing is more effectual to embolden men, and put spirit into them,
 than to be sure that God is with them and fights for them.  He 
 concludes with fair warning to his enemies.  "<I>Fight not against the 
 God of your fathers.</I> It is folly to fight against the God of 
 almighty power; but it is treachery and base ingratitude to fight 
 against your fathers' God, and you cannot expect to prosper."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them:
 so they were before Judah, and the ambushment <I>was</I> behind them.
 &nbsp; 14  And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle <I>was</I> before
 and behind: and they cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the priests sounded
 with the trumpets.
 &nbsp; 15  Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah
 shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel
 before Abijah and Judah.
 &nbsp; 16  And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God
 delivered them into their hand.
 &nbsp; 17  And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter:
 so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen
 men.
 &nbsp; 18  Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time,
 and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of their fathers.
 &nbsp; 19  And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,
 Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns
 thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof.
 &nbsp; 20  Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of
 Abijah: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> struck him, and he died.
 &nbsp; 21  But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and
 begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.
 &nbsp; 22  And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his
 sayings, <I>are</I> written in the story of the prophet Iddo.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We do not find that Jeroboam offered to make any answer at all to 
 Abijah's speech. Though it was much to the purpose, he resolved not to 
 heed it, and therefore he heard it as though he heard it not. He came 
 to fight, not to dispute. The longest sword, he thought, would 
 determine the matter, not the better cause. Let us therefore see the 
 issue, whether right and religion carried the day or no.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Jeroboam, who trusted to his politics, was beaten. He was so far 
 from fair reasoning that he was not for fair fighting. We may suppose 
 that he felt a sovereign contempt for Abijah's harangue. "One 
 stratagem," thinks he, "is worth twenty such speeches; we will soon 
 give him an answer to all his arguments; he shall soon find himself 
 overpowered with numbers, surrounded on every side with the instruments 
 of death, and then let him boast of his religion and his title to the 
 crown." A parley, it is probable, was agreed on, yet Jeroboam basely 
 takes the advantage of it, and, while he was treating, <I>laid his 
 ambushment behind Judah,</I> against all the laws of arms. What honour 
 could be expected in a <I>servant when he reigned?</I> Abijah was 
 <I>for peace,</I> but, <I>when he spoke, they were for war,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:7">Ps. cxx. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Abijah and his people, who trusted in their God, came off 
 conquerors, notwithstanding the disproportion of their strength and 
 numbers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were brought into a great strait, put into a great fright, for 
 <I>the battle was before and behind.</I> A good cause, and one which is 
 designed to be victorious, may for a season be involved in 
 embarrassment and distress. It was David's case.  <I>They compassed me 
 about like bees,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:10-12">Ps. cxviii. 10-12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In their distress, when danger was on every side, which way should 
 they look but upwards for deliverance? It is an unspeakable comfort 
 that no enemy (not the most powerful or politic), no stratagem or 
 ambushment, can cut off our communication with heaven; our way 
 thitherward is always open. 

 (1.) <I>They cried unto the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 We hope they did this before they engaged in this war, but the distress
 they were in made them renew their prayers and quickened them to be 
 importunate. God brings his people into straits, that he may teach them 
 to <I>cry unto him.</I> Earnest praying is crying.

 (2.) They <I>relied on the God of their fathers,</I> depended upon his
 power to help them and committed themselves to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 The prayer of faith is the prevailing prayer, and this is that by which
 we overcome the world, <I>even our faith,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:4">1 John v. 4</A>.

 (3.) The <I>priests sounded the trumpets</I> to animate them by giving
 them an assurance of God's presence with them. It was not only a 
 martial but a sacred sound, and put life into their faith. 

 (4.) They shouted in confidence of victory: "The day is our own, for
 God is with us." To the cry of the prayer they added the shout of 
 faith, and so became more than conquerors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Thus they obtained a complete victory: <I>As the men of Judah 
 shouted</I> for joy in God's salvation, <I>God smote Jeroboam</I> and 
 his army with such terror and amazement that they could not strike a 
 stroke, but fled with the greatest precipitation imaginable, and the 
 conquerors gave no quarter, so that they put to the sword 500,000 
 chosen men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 more, it is said, than ever we read of in any history to have been
 killed in one battle; but the battle was the Lord's, who would thus 
 chastise the idolatry of Israel and own the house of David. But see the 
 sad effect of division: it was the blood of Israelites that was thus 
 shed like water by Israelites, while the heathen, their neighbours, to 
 whom the name of Israel had formerly been a terror, cried, <I>Aha!</I> 
 <I>so would we have it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The consequence of this was that the children of Israel, though they 
 were not brought back to the house of David (which by so great a blow 
 surely they would have been had not the determinate counsel of God been 
 otherwise), yet, for that time, were <I>brought under,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Many cities were taken, and remained in the possession of the kings of
 Judah; as Bethel particularly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 What became of the golden calf there, when it came into the hands of
 the king of Judah, we are not told; perhaps it was removed to some 
 place of greater safety, and at length to Samaria

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:5">Hos. viii. 5</A>);
 
 yet in Jehu's time we find it at Bethel,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:29">2 Kings x. 29</A>.

 Perhaps Abijah, when it was in his power to demolish it, suffered it to
 stand, for <I>his heart was not perfect</I> with God; and, not 
 improving what he had got for the honour of God, he soon lost it all 
 again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The death of both of the conquered and of the conqueror, 
 not long after. 

 1. Jeroboam never looked up after this defeat, though he survived it
 two or three years. He could not recover <I>strength again,</I>

 The Lord struck him either with some bodily disease, of which he
 languished, or with melancholy and trouble of mind; his heart was 
 broken, and vexation at his loss brought his head, probably by this 
 time a hoary head, with sorrow to the grave. He escaped the sword of 
 Abijah, but God struck him: and there is no escaping his sword.

 2.  Abijah waxed mighty upon it. What number of wives and children he
 had before does not appear; but now he multiplied his wives to fourteen 
 in all, by whom he had thirty-eight children,

 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of those arrows. It seems,
 he had ways peculiar to himself, and sayings of his own, which were 
 recorded with his acts in the history of those times,

 But the number of his months was cut off in the midst, and, soon after
 his triumphs, death conquered the conqueror. Perhaps he was too much 
 lifted up with his victories, and therefore God would not let him live 
 long to enjoy the honour of them.</P>
