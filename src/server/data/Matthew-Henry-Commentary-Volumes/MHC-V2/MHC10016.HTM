 In the close of the foregoing chapter we left David flying from 
 Jerusalem, and Absalom entering into it; in this chapter,

 I. We are to follow David in his melancholy flight; and there we find
 him,

 1.  Cheated by Ziba, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 2. Cursed by Shimei, which he bears with wonderful patience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:5-14">ver. 5-14</A>.

 II. We are to meet Absalom in his triumphant entry; and there we find 
 him,
 
 1. Cheated by Hushai, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:15-19">ver. 15-19</A>.

 2. Counselled by Ahithophel to go in unto his father's concubines,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And when David was a little past the top <I>of the hill,</I>
 behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple
 of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred <I>loaves</I> of bread,
 and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred of summer
 fruits, and a bottle of wine.
 &nbsp; 2 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And
 Ziba said, The asses <I>be</I> for the king's household to ride on;
 and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the
 wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.
 &nbsp; 3 And the king said, And where <I>is</I> thy master's son? And Ziba
 said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said,
 To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my
 father.
 &nbsp; 4 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine <I>are</I> all that
 <I>pertained</I> unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech
 thee <I>that</I> I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We read before how kind David was to Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, 
 how he prudently entrusted his servant Ziba with the management of his 
 estate, while he generously entertained him at his own table, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+9:10"><I>ch.</I> ix. 10</A>.
 
 This matter was well settled; but, it seems, Ziba is not content to be
 manager, he longs to be master, of Mephibosheth's estate. Now, he 
 thinks, is his time to make himself so; if he can procure a grant of it 
 from the crown, whether David or Absalom get the better it is all one 
 to him, he hopes he shall secure his prey, which he promises himself by 
 fishing in troubled waters. In order hereunto, 

 1. He made David a handsome present of provisions, which was the more
 welcome because it came seasonably

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and with this he designed to incline him to himself; for <I>a man's
 gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:16">Prov. xviii. 16</A>.

 Nay, <I>Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:8">Prov. xvii. 8</A>.

 David inferred from this that Ziba was a very discreet and generous
 man, and well affected to him, when, in all, he designed nothing but to 
 make his own market and to get Mephibosheth's estate settled upon 
 himself. Shall the prospect of advantage in this world make men 
 generous to the rich?  and shall not the belief of an abundant 
 recompence in the resurrection of the just make us charitable to the 
 poor?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:14">Luke xiv. 14</A>.

 Ziba was very considerate in the present he brought to David; it was
 what would do him some good in his present distress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Observe, The wine was intended for those that were faint, not for the
 king's own drinking, or the courtiers; it seems, they did not commonly 
 use it, but it was for cordials for those <I>that were ready to 
 perish,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:6">Prov. xxxi. 6</A>.

 Blessed art thou, O land!  when thy princes use wine for strength, as
 David did, and not for drunkenness, as Absalom did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+18:28"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 28</A>.

 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:17">Eccl. x. 17</A>.

 Whatever Ziba intended in this present, God's providence sent it to
 David for his support very graciously. God makes use of bad men for 
 good purposes to his people, and sends them meat by ravens. Having by 
 his present insinuated himself into David's affection, and gained 
 credit with him, the next thing he has to do for the compassing of his 
 end is to incense him against Mephibosheth, which he does by a false 
 accusation, representing him as ungratefully designing to raise himself 
 by the present broils, and to recover the crown to his own head, now 
 that David and his son were contending for it. David enquires for him 
 as one of his family, which gives Ziba occasion to tell this false 
 story of him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 What immense damages do masters often sustain by the lying tongues of
 their servants! David knew Mephibosheth not to be an ambitious man, but 
 easy in his place, and well-affected to him and his government; nor 
 could he be so weak as to expect with his lame legs to climb the ladder 
 of preferment; yet David gives credit to the calumny, and, without 
 further enquiry or consideration, convicts Mephibosheth of treason, 
 seizes his lands as forfeited, and grants them to Ziba: <I>Behold, 
 thine are all that pertained to Mephibosheth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 a rash judgment, and which afterwards he was ashamed of, when the truth
 came to light,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:29"><I>ch.</I> xix. 29</A>.

 Princes cannot help it, but they will be sometimes (as our law speaks)
 deceived in their grants; but they ought to use all means possible to 
 discover the truth and to guard against malicious designing men, who 
 would impose upon them, as Ziba did upon David. Having by his wiles 
 gained his point, Ziba secretly laughed at the king's credulity, 
 congratulated himself on his success, and departed, with a great 
 compliment upon the king, that he valued his favour more than 
 Mephibosheth's estate: "Let me <I>find grace in thy sight, O king!</I> 
 and I have enough." Great men ought always to be jealous of flatterers, 
 and remember that nature has given them two ears, that they may hear 
 both sides.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out
 a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name <I>was</I>
 Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he
 came.
 &nbsp; 6 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king
 David: and all the people and all the mighty men <I>were</I> on his
 right hand and on his left.
 &nbsp; 7 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou
 bloody man, and thou man of Belial:
 &nbsp; 8 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house
 of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and,
 behold, thou <I>art taken</I> in thy mischief, because thou <I>art</I> a
 bloody man.
 &nbsp; 9 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why
 should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I
 pray thee, and take off his head.
 &nbsp; 10 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
 Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath said unto him,
 Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?
 &nbsp; 11 And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold,
 my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much
 more now <I>may this</I> Benjamite <I>do it?</I> let him alone, and let him
 curse; for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath bidden him.
 &nbsp; 12 It may be that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will look on mine affliction, and
 that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will requite me good for his cursing this day.
 &nbsp; 13 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along
 on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and
 threw stones at him, and cast dust.
 &nbsp; 14 And the king, and all the people that <I>were</I> with him, came
 weary, and refreshed themselves there.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We here find how David bore Shimei's curses much better than he had 
 borne Ziba's flatteries. By the latter he was brought to pass a wrong 
 judgment on another, by the former to pass a right judgment on himself. 
 The world's smiles are more dangerous than its frowns. Observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How insolent and furious Shimei was, and how his malice took 
 occasion from David's present distress to be so much the more 
 outrageous. David, in his flight, had come to Bahurim, a city of 
 Benjamin in or near which this Shimei lived, who, being of the house of 
 Saul (with the fall of which all his hopes of preferment fell), had an 
 implacable enmity to David, unjustly looking upon him as the ruin of 
 Saul and his family only because, by the divine appointment, he 
 succeeded Saul. While David was in prosperity and power, Shimei hated 
 him as much as he did now, but he durst not then say anything against 
 him. God knows what is in the hearts of those that are disaffected to 
 him and his government, but earthly princes do not. Now he came forth, 
 and cursed David with all the bad words and wishes he could invent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Why he took this opportunity to give vent to his malice. 

 (1.) Because now he thought he might do it safely; yet, if David had
 thought proper to resent the provocation, it would have cost Shimei his
 life.

 (2.) Because now it would be most grievous to David, would add
 affliction to his grief, and pour vinegar into his wounds. He complains
 of those as most barbarous who <I>talk to the grief of those whom God
 has wounded,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:26">Ps. lxix. 26</A>.

 So Shimei did, loading him with curses whom no generous eye could look
 upon without compassion.

 (3.) Because now he thought that Providence justified his reproaches,
 and that David's present afflictions proved him to be as bad a man as 
 he was willing to represent him. Job's friends condemned him upon this 
 false principle.  Those that are under the rebukes of a gracious God 
 must not think it strange if these bring upon them the reproaches of 
 evil men. If once it be said, <I>God hath forsaken him,</I> presently 
 it follows, <I>Persecute and take him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:11">Ps. lxxi. 11</A>.

 But it is the character of a base spirit thus to trample upon those
 that are down, and insult over them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How his malice was expressed. See, 

 (1.) What this wretched man did: <I>He cast stones at David</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 as if his king had been a dog, or the worst of criminals, whom all
 Israel must stone with stones till he die. Perhaps he kept at such a 
 distance that the stones he threw could not reach David, nor any of his 
 attendants, yet he showed what he would have done if it had been in his 
 power. <I>He cast dust</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 which, probably, would blow into his own eyes, like the curses he
 threw, which, being causeless, would return upon his own head. Thus, 
 while his malice made him odious, the impotency of it made him 
 ridiculous and contemptible. Those that fight against God cannot hurt 
 him, though they hate him. <I>If thou sinnest, what doest thou against 
 him?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:6">Job xxxv. 6</A>.

 It was an aggravation of his wickedness that David was attended with
 his mighty men on his right hand and on his left, so that he was not in 
 so forlorn a condition as he thought (<I>persecuted but not 
 forsaken</I>), and that he continued to do it, and did it the more
 passionately, for David's bearing it patiently.

 (2.) What he said.  With the stones he shot his arrows, even bitter
 words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>),

 in contempt of that law, <I>Thou shalt not curse the gods,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:28">Exod. xxii. 28</A>.
 
 David was a man of honour and conscience, and in great reputation for
 every thing that was just and good; what could this foul mouth say 
 against him? Why, truly, what was done long since to the house of Saul 
 was the only thing which he could recollect, and with this he upbraided 
 David because it was the thing that he himself was a loser by. See how 
 apt we are to judge of men and their character by what they are to us, 
 and to conclude that those are certainly evil men that have ever so 
 justly been, or that we ever so unjustly think have been, instruments 
 of evil to us. So partial are we to ourselves that no rule can be more 
 fallacious than this. No man could be more innocent of the blood of the 
 house of Saul than David was. Once and again he spared Saul's life, 
 while Saul sought his. When Saul and his sons were slain by the 
 Philistines, David and his men were many miles off; and, when they 
 heard it, they lamented it. From the murder of Abner and Ish-bosheth he 
 had sufficiently cleared himself; and yet all <I>the blood of the house 
 of Saul</I> must be laid at his door. Innocency is no fence against 
 malice and falsehood; nor are we to think it strange if we be charged 
 with that from which we have been most careful to keep ourselves. It is 
 well for us that men are not to be our judges, but he whose judgment is 
 according to truth. The blood of the house of Saul is here most 
 unjustly charged upon David, 

 [1.] As that which gave him his character, and denominated him a bloody
 man and a man of Belial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 And, if a man of blood, no doubt a man of Belial, that is, a child of
 the devil, who is called <I>Belial</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:15">2 Cor. vi. 15</A>),

 and who was a murderer from the beginning. Bloody men are the worst of
 men. 

 [2.] As that which brought the present trouble upon him: "Now that thou
 art dethroned, and driven out to the wilderness, <I>the Lord has 
 returned upon thee the blood of the house of Saul.</I>" See how forward 
 malicious men are to press God's judgments into the service of their 
 own passion and revenge. If any who have, as they think, wronged them, 
 should come into trouble, the injury done to them must be made the 
 cause of the trouble.  But we must take heed lest we wrong God by 
 making his providence thus to patronise our foolish and unjust 
 resentments. As the <I>wrath of man works not the righteousness of 
 God,</I> so the righteousness of God serves not the wrath of man. 

 [3.] As that which would now be his utter ruin; for he endeavours to
 make him despair of ever recovering his throne again. Now they said, 
 <I>There is no help for him in God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:2">Ps. iii. 2</A>),

 <I>the Lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom</I>
 (not Mephibosheth--the house of Saul never dreamed of making <I>him</I> 
 king, as Ziba suggested), <I>and thou art taken in thy mischief,</I> 
 that is, "the mischief that will be thy destruction, and all because 
 thou art a bloody man." Thus Shimei cursed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See how patient and submissive David was under this abuse. The sons 
 of Zeruiah, Abishai particularly, were forward to maintain David's 
 honour with their swords; they resented the affront keenly, as well 
 they might: <I>Why should this dead dog</I> be suffered to <I>curse the 
 king?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 If David will but give them leave, they will put these lying cursing
 lips to silence, and take off his head; for his throwing stones at the 
 king was an overt act, which abundantly proved that he compassed and 
 imagined his death. But the king would by no means suffer it: <I>What 
 have I to do with you? So let him curse.</I> Thus Christ rebuked the 
 disciples, who, in zeal for his honour, would have commanded fire from 
 heaven on the town that affronted him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:55">Luke  ix. 55</A>.
 
 Let us see with what considerations David quieted himself. 

 1. The chief thing that silenced him was that he had deserved this
 affliction. This is not mentioned indeed; for a man may truly repent, 
 and yet needs not, upon all occasions, proclaim his penitent 
 reflections. Shimei unjustly upbraided him with the blood of Saul: from 
 <I>that</I> his conscience acquitted him, but, at the same time, it 
 charged him with the blood of Uriah. "The reproach is too true" (thinks 
 David), "though false as he means it." Note, A humble tender spirit 
 will turn reproaches into reproofs, and so get good by them, instead of 
 being provoked by them.  

 2. He observes the hand of God in it: <I>The Lord hath said unto him,
 Curse David</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and again, <I>So let him curse, for the Lord hath bidden him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 As it was Shimei's sin, it was not from God, but from the devil and his
 own wicked heart, nor did God's hand in it excuse or extenuate it, much 
 less justify it, any more than it did the sin of those who put Christ 
 to death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23,4:28">Acts ii. 23; iv. 28</A>.

 But, as it was David's affliction, it was from the Lord, one of the
 evils which he raised up against him.  David looked above the 
 instrument of his trouble to the supreme director, as Job, when the 
 plunderers had stripped him, acknowledged, <I>The Lord hath taken 
 away.</I> Nothing more proper to quiet a gracious soul under affliction 
 than an eye to the hand of God in it.  <I>I opened not my mouth, 
 because thou didst it.</I> The scourge of the tongue is God's rod.

 3. He quiets himself under the less affliction with the consideration
 of the greater

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>My son seeks my life, much more may this Benjamite.</I> Note,
 Tribulation works patience in those that are sanctified. The more we 
 bear the better able we should be to bear still more; what tries our 
 patience should improve it. The more we are inured to trouble the less 
 we should be surprised at it, and not think it strange. Marvel not that 
 enemies are injurious, when even friends are unkind; nor that friends 
 are unkind, when even children are undutiful. 

 4. He comforts himself with hopes that God would, in some way or other,
 bring good to him out of his affliction, would balance the trouble 
 itself, and recompense his patience under it: "<I>The Lord will requite 
 me good for his cursing.</I> If God bid Shimei grieve me, it is that he 
 himself may the more sensibly comfort me; surely he has mercy in store 
 for me, which he is preparing me for by this trial." We may depend upon 
 God as our pay-master, not only for our services, but for our 
 sufferings. <I>Let them curse, but bless thou.</I> David, at length, is 
 housed at Bahurim

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 where he meets with refreshment, and is hidden from this strife of
 tongues.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to
 Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
 &nbsp; 16 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's
 friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God
 save the king, God save the king.
 &nbsp; 17 And Absalom said to Hushai, <I>Is</I> this thy kindness to thy
 friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?
 &nbsp; 18 And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be,
 and with him will I abide.
 &nbsp; 19 And again, whom should I serve? <I>should I</I> not <I>serve</I> in
 the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's
 presence, so will I be in thy presence.
 &nbsp; 20 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what
 we shall do.
 &nbsp; 21 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's
 concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel
 shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the
 hands of all that <I>are</I> with thee be strong.
 &nbsp; 22 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and
 Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 23 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those
 days, <I>was</I> as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so
 <I>was</I> all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with
 Absalom.

 Absalom had notice sent him speedily by some of his friends at 
 Jerusalem that David had withdrawn, and with what a small retinue he 
 had gone; so that the coasts were clear, Absalom might take possession 
 of Jerusalem when he pleased. The gates were open, and there was none 
 to oppose him. Accordingly he came without delay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 extremely elevated, no doubt, with this success at first, and that that
 in which, when he formed his design, he probably apprehended the 
 greatest difficulty, was so easily and effectually done. Now that he is 
 master of Jerusalem he concludes all his own, the country will follow 
 of course. God suffers wicked men to prosper awhile in their wicked 
 plots, even beyond their expectation, that their disappointment may be 
 the more grievous and disgraceful. The most celebrated politicians of 
 that age were Ahithophel and Hushai. The former Absalom brings with him 
 to Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 the other meets him there
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 so that he cannot but think himself sure of success, when he has both
 these to be his counsellors; on them he relies, and consults not the 
 ark, though he has that with him. But miserable counsellors were they 
 both; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Hushai would never counsel him to do wisely. He was really his 
 enemy, and designed to betray him, while he pretended to be in his 
 interest; so that Absalom could not have a more dangerous man about 
 him. 

 1. Hushai complimented him upon his accession to the throne, as if he
 had been abundantly satisfied in this title, and well pleased that he 
 had come to the possession, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 What arts of dissimulation are those tempted to use who govern
 themselves by fleshly wisdom! and how happy are those who have not 
 known these depths of Satan, but have their conversation in the world 
 with simplicity and godly sincerity!

 2.  Absalom was surprised to find <I>him</I> for him who was known to
 be David's intimate friend and confidant. He asks him, <I>Is this thy 
 kindness to thy friend?</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 pleasing himself with this thought, that all would be his, since Hushai
 was. He doubts not of his sincerity, but easily believes what he wishes 
 to be true, that David's best friends are so in love with himself as to 
 take the first opportunity to declare for him, <I>though the pride of 
 his heart deceived him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:3">Obad. 3</A>.

 Hushai confirmed him in the belief that he was hearty for him. For,
 though David is his friend, yet he is for the king in 
 <I>possession,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Whom the people choose, and Providence smiles upon, he will be faithful
 to; and he is for the king in <I>succession</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 the rising sun. It was true, he loved his father; but he had had his
 day, and it was over; and why should he not love his successor as well? 
 Thus he pretended to give reasons for a resolution he abhorred the 
 thought of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Ahithophel counselled him to do wickedly, and so did as effectually 
 betray him as he did who was designedly false to him; for those that 
 advise men to sin certainly advise them to their hurt; and that 
 government which is founded in sin is founded in the sand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It seems, Ahithophel was noted as a deep politician; his counsel was 
 as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Such reputation was he in for subtlety and sagacity in public affairs,
 such reaches had he beyond other privy-counselors, such reasons would 
 he give for his advice, and such success generally his projects had, 
 that all people, good and bad, both David and Absalom, had a profound 
 regard for his sentiments, too much by far, when they regarded him 
 <I>as an oracle of God;</I> shall the prudence of any mortal compare 
 with him who only is wise? Let us observe from this account of 
 Ahithophel's fame for policy,

 (1.) That many excel in worldly wisdom who are utterly destitute of
 heavenly grace, because those who set up for oracles themselves are apt 
 to despise the oracles of God. <I>God has chosen the foolish things of 
 the world;</I> and the greatest statesmen are seldom the greatest 
 saints. 

 (2.) That frequently the greatest politicians act most foolishly for
 themselves. Ahithophel was cried up for an oracle, and yet very 
 unwisely took part with Absalom, who was not only a usurper, but a rash 
 youth, never likely to come to good, whose fall, and the fall of all 
 that adhered to him, any one, with the tenth part of the policy that 
 Ahithophel pretended to, might foresee. Well, after all, honesty is the 
 best policy, and will be found so in the long run.  But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His policy in this case defeated its own aim.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The wicked counsel Ahithophel gave to Absalom. Finding that David 
 had left his concubines to keep the house, he advised him to <I>lie 
 with them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 a very wicked thing. The divine law had made it a capital crime, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+20:11">Lev. xx. 11</A>.

 The apostle speaks of it as a piece of villany <I>not so much as named
 among the Gentiles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+5:1">1 Cor. v. 1</A>.
 
 Reuben lost his birthright for it. But Ahithophel advised Absalom to it
 as a public thing, because it would give assurance to all Israel, 

 [1.] That he was in good earnest in his pretensions. No doubt he
 resolved to make himself master of all that belonged to his predecessor 
 when he began with his concubines. 

 [2.] That he was resolved never to make peace with his father upon any
 terms; for by this he would render himself so odious to his father that 
 he would never be reconciled to him, which perhaps the people were 
 jealous of and that they must be sacrificed to the reconciliation. 
 Having drawn the sword, he did, by this provocation, throw away the 
 scabbard, which would strengthen the hands of his party and keep them 
 firmly to him. This was Ahithophel's cursed policy, which bespoke him 
 rather <I>an oracle of devil than of God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Absalom's compliance with this counsel. It entirely suited his 
 lewd and wicked mind, and he delayed not to put it in execution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 When an unnatural rebellion was the opera, what fitter prologue could
 there be to it than such unnatural lust?  Thus was his wickedness all 
 of a piece, and such as a conscience not quite seared could not 
 entertain the thoughts of without the utmost horror. Nay, the client 
 outdoes what his counsel advises. Ahithophel advised him to do it, that
 all Israel shall <I>see</I> it. A tent is accordingly spread on the top 
 of the house for the purpose; so impudently does he declare his sin as 
 Sodom. Yet, in this, the word of God was fulfilled in the letter of it: 
 God had threatened, by Nathan, that, for defiling Bath-sheba, David 
 should have his own wives publicly debauched 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:11,12"><I>ch.</I> xii. 11, 12</A>),

 and some think that Ahithophel, in advising it, designed to be revenged
 on David for the injury done to Bath-sheba, who was his grand-daughter: 
 for she was the daughter of Eliam

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:3"><I>ch.</I>  xi. 3</A>),
 
 who was the son of Ahithophel,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:34"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 34</A>.

 Job speaks of this as the just punishment of adultery (<I>Let my wife
 grind to another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:9,10">Job xxxi. 9, 10</A>),

 and the prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:13,14">Hos. iv. 13, 14</A>.

 What to think of these concubines, who submitted to this wickedness, I
 know not; but how unrighteous soever Absalom and they were, we must 
 say, <I>The Lord is righteous:</I> nor shall any word of his fall to 
 the ground.</P>
