 How Nehemiah wrestled with God and prevailed we read in the foregoing 
 chapter; now here we are told how, like Jacob, he prevailed with men 
 also, and so found that his prayers were heard and answered. 

 I. He prevailed with the king to send him to Jerusalem with a
 commission to build a wall about it, and grant him what was necessary 
 for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. He prevailed against the enemies that would have obstructed him in
 his journey 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>)

 and laughed him out of his undertaking,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:19-20">ver. 19, 20</A>.

 III. He prevailed upon his own people to join with him in this good
 work, viewing the desolations of the walls 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:12-16">ver. 12-16</A>)

 and then gaining them to lend every one a hand towards the rebuilding
 of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:17,18">ver. 17, 18</A>.

 Thus did God own him in the work to which he called him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year
 of Artaxerxes the king, <I>that</I> wine <I>was</I> before him: and I took
 up the wine, and gave <I>it</I> unto the king. Now I had not been
 <I>beforetime</I> sad in his presence.
 &nbsp; 2  Wherefore the king said unto me, Why <I>is</I> thy countenance
 sad, seeing thou <I>art</I> not sick? this <I>is</I> nothing <I>else</I> but
 sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,
 &nbsp; 3  And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why
 should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my
 fathers' sepulchres, <I>lieth</I> waste, and the gates thereof are
 consumed with fire?
 &nbsp; 4  Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request?
 So I prayed to the God of heaven.
 &nbsp; 5  And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy
 servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send
 me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I
 may build it.
 &nbsp; 6  And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,)
 For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So
 it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.
 &nbsp; 7  Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let
 letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they
 may convey me over till I come into Judah;
 &nbsp; 8  And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that
 he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace
 which <I>appertained</I> to the house, and for the wall of the city,
 and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted
 me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.

 When Nehemiah had prayed for the relief of his countrymen, and perhaps 
 in David's words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:18">Ps. li. 18</A>,

 <I>Build thou the walls of Jerusalem</I>), he did not sit still and
 say, "Let God now do his own work, for I have no more to do," but set 
 himself to forecast what he could do towards it. Our prayers must be
 seconded with our serious endeavours, else we mock God. Nearly four 
 months passed, from Chisleu to Nisan (from November to March), before 
 Nehemiah made his application to the king for leave to go to Jerusalem, 
 either because the winter was not a proper time for such a journey, and 
 he would not make the motion till he could pursue it, or because it was 
 so long before his month of waiting came, and there was no coming into 
 the king's presence uncalled,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+4:11">Esth. iv. 11</A>.

 Now that he attended the king's table he hoped to have his ear. We are
 not thus limited to certain moments in our addresses to the King of 
 kings, but have liberty of access to him at all times; to the throne of 
 grace we never come unseasonably. Now here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The occasion which he gave the king to enquire into his cares and 
 griefs, by appearing sad in his presence. Those that speak to such 
 great men must not fall abruptly upon their business, but fetch a 
 compass. Nehemiah would try whether he was in a good humour before he 
 ventured to tell him his errand, and this method he took to try him. He 
 took up the wine and gave it to the king when he called for it, 
 expecting that then he would look him in the face. He had not used to 
 be sad in the king's presence, but conformed to the rules of the court 
 (as courtiers must do), which would admit no sorrows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+4:2">Esth. iv. 2</A>.

 Though he was a stranger, a captive, he was easy and pleasant. Good men
 should do what they can by their cheerfulness to convince the world of 
 the pleasantness of religious ways and to roll away the reproach cast 
 upon them as melancholy; but there is a time for all things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:4">Eccl. iii. 4</A>.

 Nehemiah now saw cause both to be sad and to appear so. The miseries of
 Jerusalem gave him cause to be sad, and his showing his grief would 
 give occasion to the king to enquire into the cause. He did not 
 dissemble sadness, for he was really in grief for the afflictions of 
 Joseph, and was not like the hypocrites who <I>disfigure their 
 faces;</I> yet he could have concealed his grief if it had been 
 necessary (the heart knows its own bitterness, and in the midst of 
 laughter is often sad), but it would now serve his purpose to discover 
 his sadness. Though he had wine before him, and probably, according to 
 the office of the cup-bearer, did himself drink of it before he gave it 
 to the king, yet it would not <I>make his heart glad,</I> while God's 
 Israel was in distress.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The kind notice which the king took of his sadness and the enquiry 
 he made into the cause of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick?</I> Note, 

 1.  We ought, from a principle of Christian sympathy, to concern
 ourselves in the sorrows and sadnesses of others, even of our 
 inferiors, and not say, What is it to us? Let not masters despise their 
 servants' griefs, but desire to make them easy. The great God is not 
 pleased with the dejections and disquietments of his people, but would 
 have them both <I>serve him with gladness</I> and <I>eat their bread 
 with joy.</I> 

 2.  It is not strange if those that are sick have sad countenances,
 because of what is felt and what is feared; sickness will make those 
 grave that were most airy and gay: yet a good man, even in sickness, 
 may be of good cheer if he knows that his sins are forgiven.  

 3.  Freedom from sickness is so great a mercy that while we have that
 we ought not to be inordinately dejected under any outward burden; yet 
 sorrow for our own sins, the sins of others, and the calamities of 
 God's church, may well sadden the countenance, without sickness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The account which Nehemiah gave the king of the cause of his 
 sadness, which he gave with meekness and fear. 

 1. With fear. He owned that now (though it appears by the following
 story that he was a man of courage) <I>he was sorely afraid,</I> 
 perhaps of the king's wrath (for those eastern monarchs assumed an 
 absolute power of life and death,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:12,13,5:19">Dan. ii. 12, 13; v. 19</A>)

 or of misplacing a word, and losing his request by the mismanagement of
 it. Though he was a wise man, he was jealous of himself, lest he should 
 say any thing imprudently; it becomes us to be so. A good assurance is 
 indeed a good accomplishment, yet a humble self-diffidence is not man's 
 dispraise. 

 2. With meekness. Without reflection upon any man, and with all the
 respect, deference, and good-will, imaginable to the king his master, 
 he says, "<I>Let the king live for ever;</I> he is wise and good, and 
 the fittest man in the world to rule." He modestly asked, "<I>Why 
 should not my countenance be sad</I> as it is <I>when</I> (though I 
 myself am well and at east) <I>the city</I>" (the king knew what city 
 he meant), "<I>the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste?</I>" 
 Many are melancholy and sad but can give no reason for being so, cannot 
 tell why nor wherefore; such should chide themselves for, and chide 
 themselves out of, their unjust and unreasonable griefs and fears. But 
 Nehemiah could give so good a reason for his sadness as to appeal to 
 the king himself concerning it. Observe,

 (1.) He calls Jerusalem <I>the place of his fathers' sepulchres,</I>
 the place where his ancestors were buried. It is good for us to think 
 often of our fathers' sepulchres; we are apt to dwell in our thoughts 
 upon their honours and titles, their houses and estates, but let us 
 think also of their sepulchres, and consider that those who have gone 
 before us in the world have also gone before us out of the world, and 
 their monuments are momentos to us. There is also a great respect owing 
 to the memory of our fathers, which we should not be willing to see 
 injured.  All nations, even those that have had no expectation of the 
 resurrection of the dead, have looked upon the sepulchres of their 
 ancestors as in some degree sacred and not to be violated.

 (2.) He justifies himself in his grief: "I do well to be sad.  Why
 should I not be so?" There is a time even for pious and prosperous men 
 to be sad and to show their grief. The best men must not think to 
 antedate heaven by banishing all sorrowful thoughts; it is a vale of 
 tears we pass through, and we must submit to the temper of the climate.

 (3.) He assigns the ruins of Jerusalem as the true cause of his grief.
 Note, All the grievances of the church, but especially its desolations, 
 are, and ought to be, matter of grief and sadness to all good people, 
 to all that have a concern for God's honour and that are living members 
 of Christ's mystical body, and are of a public spirit; they favour even 
 Zion's dust, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:14">Ps. cii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The encouragement which the king gave him to tell his mind, and the 
 application he thereupon made in his heart to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The king had an affection for him, and was not pleased to see him
 melancholy. It is also probable that he had a kindness for the Jews' 
 religion; he had discovered it before in the commission he gave to 
 Ezra, who was a churchman, and now again in the power he put Nehemiah 
 into, who was a statesman. Wanting therefore only to know how he might 
 be serviceable to Jerusalem, he asks this its anxious friend, "<I>For 
 what dost thou make request?</I> Something thou wouldst have; what is 
 it?" He was afraid to speak

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 but this gave him boldness; much more may the invitation Christ has
 given us to pray, and the promise that we shall speed, enable us to 
 come boldly to the throne of grace. Nehemiah immediately <I>prayed to 
 the God of heaven</I> that he would give him wisdom to ask properly and 
 incline the king's heart to grant him his request. Those that would 
 find favour with kings must secure the favour of the King of kings. He 
 prayed to the God of heaven as infinitely above even this mighty 
 monarch. It was not a solemn prayer (he had not opportunity for that), 
 but a secret sudden ejaculation; he lifted up his heart to that God who 
 understands the language of his heart: <I>Lord, give me a mouth and 
 wisdom; Lord, give me favour in the sight of this man.</I> Note, It is 
 good to be much in pious ejaculations, especially upon particular 
 occasions. Wherever we are we have a way open heaven-ward. This will 
 not hinder any business, but further it rather; therefore let no 
 business hinder this, but give rise to it rather. Nehemiah had prayed 
 very solemnly with reference to this very occasion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1;11"><I>ch.</I> i. 11</A>),

 yet, when it comes to the push, he prays again.  Ejaculations and
 solemn prayers must not jostle out one another, but each have its 
 place.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. His humble petition to the king. When he had this encouragement he 
 presented his petition very modestly and with submission to the king's 
 wisdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 but very explicitly. He asked for a commission to go as governor to
 Judah, to build the wall of Jerusalem, and to stay there for a certain 
 time, so many months, we may suppose; and then either he had his 
 commission renewed or went back and was sent again, so that he presided 
 there twelve years at least,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:14"><I>ch.</I> v. 14</A>.

 He also asked for a convoy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and an order upon the governors, not only to permit and suffer him to
 pass through their respective provinces, but to supply him with what he 
 had occasion for, with another order upon the keeper of the forest of 
 Lebanon to give him timber for the work that he designed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The king's great favour to him in asking him <I>when he would 
 return,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He intimated that he was unwilling to lose him, or to be long without
 him, yet to gratify him, and do a real office of kindness to his 
 people, he would spare him awhile, and let him have what clauses he 
 pleased inserted in his commission, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Here was an immediate answer to his prayer; for the seed of Jacob never
 sought the God of Jacob in vain. In the account he gives of the success 
 of his petition he takes notice,

 1. Of the presence of the queen; she sat by
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 which (they say) was not usual in the Persian court, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:11">Esth. i. 11</A>.

 Whether the queen was his back friend, that would have hindered him,
 and he observes it to the praise of God's powerful providence that 
 though she was by yet he succeeded, or whether she was his true friend, 
 and it is observed to the praise of God's kind providence that she was 
 present to help forward his request, is not certain. 

 2. Of the power and grace of God. He gained his point, not according to
 his merit, his interest in the king, or his good management, but 
 <I>according to the good hand of his God upon him.</I> Gracious souls 
 take notice of God's hand, his good hand, in all events which turn in 
 favour of them.  <I>This is the Lord's doing,</I> and therefore doubly 
 acceptable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them
 the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army
 and horsemen with me.
 &nbsp; 10  When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
 Ammonite, heard <I>of it,</I> it grieved them exceedingly that there
 was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 11  So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
 &nbsp; 12  And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me;
 neither told I <I>any</I> man what my God had put in my heart to do at
 Jerusalem: neither <I>was there any</I> beast with me, save the beast
 that I rode upon.
 &nbsp; 13  And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even
 before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the
 walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof
 were consumed with fire.
 &nbsp; 14  Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the
 king's pool: but <I>there was</I> no place for the beast <I>that was</I>
 under me to pass.
 &nbsp; 15  Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the
 wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and
 <I>so</I> returned.
 &nbsp; 16  And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did;
 neither had I as yet told <I>it</I> to the Jews, nor to the priests,
 nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did
 the work.
 &nbsp; 17  Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we <I>are</I> in,
 how Jerusalem <I>lieth</I> waste, and the gates thereof are burned
 with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that
 we be no more a reproach.
 &nbsp; 18  Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon
 me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they
 said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands
 for <I>this</I> good <I>work.</I>
 &nbsp; 19  But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
 Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard <I>it,</I> they laughed us to
 scorn, and despised us, and said, What <I>is</I> this thing that ye
 do? will ye rebel against the king?
 &nbsp; 20  Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven,
 he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and
 build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in
 Jerusalem.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Now Nehemiah was dismissed by the court he was sent from. The king 
 appointed <I>captains of the army</I> and <I>horsemen</I> to go <I>with 
 him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 both for his guard and to show that he was a man whom <I>the king did
 delight to honour,</I> that all the king's servants might respect him 
 accordingly. Those whom the King of kings sends he thus protects, he 
 thus dignifies with a host of angels to attend them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he was received by the country he was sent to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By the Jews and their friends at Jerusalem. We are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That while he concealed his errand they took little notice of him. 
 He was at <I>Jerusalem three days</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and it does not appear that any of the great men of the city waited on
 him to congratulate him on his arrival, but he remained unknown. The 
 king sent horsemen to attend him, but the Jews sent none to meet him; 
 he had no beast with him, but that which he himself rode on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Wise men, and those who are worthy of double honour, yet covet not to
 come with observation, to make a show, or make a noise, no, not when 
 they come with the greatest blessings. Those that shortly are to have 
 <I>the dominion in the morning</I> the world now knows not, but they 
 lie hid,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:1">1 John iii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That though they took little notice of him he took great notice of 
 them and their state. He arose in the night, and viewed the ruins of 
 the walls, probably by moon-light 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 that he might see what was to be done and in what method they must go
 about it, whether the old foundation would serve, and what there was of 
 the old materials that would be of use. Note, 

 [1.] Good work is likely to be well done when it is first well
 considered. 

 [2.] It is the wisdom of those who are engaged in public business, as
 much as may be, to <I>see with their own eyes,</I> and not to proceed 
 altogether upon the reports and representations of others, and yet to 
 do this without noise, and if possible unobserved. 

 [3.] Those that would build up the church's walls must first take notice
 of the ruins of those walls. Those that would know how to amend must 
 enquire what is amiss, what needs reformation, and what may serve as it 
 is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That when he disclosed his design to the rulers and people they 
 cheerfully concurred with him in it. He did not tell them, at first, 
 what he came about 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 because he would not seem to do it for ostentation, and because, if he
 found it impracticable, he might retreat the more honourably. Upright 
 humble men will not sound a trumpet before their alms or any other of 
 their good offices. But when he had viewed and considered the thing, 
 and probably felt the pulse of the rulers and people, he told them 
 <I>what God had put into his heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 even to <I>build up the wall of Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 Observe,

 [1.] How fairly he proposed the undertaking to them: "<I>You see the
 distress we are in,</I> how we lie exposed to the enemies that are 
 round about us, how justly they reproach us as foolish and despicable, 
 how easily they may make a prey of us whenever they have a mind; 
 <I>come, therefore, and let us build up the wall.</I>" He did not 
 undertake to do the work without them (it could not be the work of one 
 man), nor did he charge or command imperiously, though he had the 
 king's commission; but in a friendly brotherly way he exhorted and 
 excited them to join with him in this work. To encourage them hereto, 
 he speaks of the design, <I>First,</I> As that which owed it origin to 
 the special grace of God. He takes not the praise of it to himself, as 
 a good thought of his own, but acknowledges that God <I>put it into his 
 heart,</I> and therefore they all ought to countenance it (whatever is 
 of God must be promoted), and might hope to prosper in it, for what God 
 puts men upon he will own them in. <I>Secondly,</I> As that which owed 
 its progress hitherto to the special providence of God. He produced the 
 king's commission, told them how readily it was granted and how forward 
 the king was to favour his design, in which he saw the hand of his God 
 <I>good upon him.</I> It would encourage both him and them to proceed 
 in an undertaking which God had so remarkably smiled upon. Thus he 
 proposed it to them; and, 

 [2.] They presently came to a resolution, one and all, to concur with
 him: <I>Let us rise up and build.</I> They are ashamed that they have 
 sat still so long without so much as attempting this needful work, and 
 now resolve to rise up out of their slothfulness, to bestir themselves, 
 and to stir up one another. "<I>Let us rise up,</I>" that is, "let us 
 do it with vigour, and diligence, and resolution, as those that are 
 determined to go through with it." <I>So they strengthened their 
 hands,</I> their own and one another's, <I>for this good work.</I> 
 Note, <I>First,</I> Many a good work would find hands enough to be laid 
 to it if there were but one good head to lead in it. They all saw the 
 desolations of Jerusalem, yet none proposed the repair of them; but, 
 when Nehemiah proposed it, they all consented to it. It is a pity that 
 a good motion should be lost purely for want of one to move it and to 
 break the ice in it. <I>Secondly,</I> By stirring up ourselves and one 
 another to that which is good, we strengthen ourselves and one another 
 for it; for the great reason why we are weak in our duty is because we 
 are cold to it, indifferent and unresolved.  Let us now see how 
 Nehemiah was received,</P>

 2. By those that wished ill to the Jews. Those whom God and his Israel 
 blessed they cursed. 

 (1.) When he did but show his face it vexed them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Sanballat and Tobiah, two of the Samaritans, but by birth the former a
 Moabite, the latter an Ammonite, when they saw one come armed with a
 commission from the king to do service to Israel, <I>were exceedingly
 grieved</I> that all their little paltry arts to weaken Israel were
 thus baffled and frustrated by a fair, and noble, and generous project
 to strengthen them. Nothing is a greater vexation to the enemies of
 good people, who have misrepresented them to princes as turbulent, and
 factious, and not fit to live, than to see them stand right in the
 opinion of their rulers, their innocency cleared and their reproach
 rolled away, and that they are thought not only fit to live, but fit to
 be trusted. When they saw a man come in that manner, who professedly
 <I>sought the welfare of the children of Israel,</I> it vexed them to
 the heart.  <I>The wicked shall see it, and be grieved.</I>

 (2.) When he began to act they set themselves to hinder him, but in
 vain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 [1.] See here with what little reason the enemies attempted to
 discourage him. They represented the undertaking as a silly thing:
 <I>They laughed us to scorn and despised us</I> as foolish builders, 
 that could not finish what we began. They represented the undertaking 
 also as a wicked thing, no better than treason: <I>Will you rebel 
 against the king?</I> Because this was the old invidious charge, though 
 now they had a commission from the king and were taken under his 
 protection, yet still they must be called rebels. 

 [2.] See also with what good reason the Jews slighted these
 discouragements.  They bore up themselves with this that they were the 
 <I>servants of the God of heaven,</I> the only true and living God, 
 that they were acting for him in what they did, and that therefore he 
 would bear them out and prosper them, though the heathen raged,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1">Ps. ii. 1</A>.

 They considered also that the reason why these enemies did so malign
 them was because they had no right in Jerusalem, but envied them their 
 right in it. Thus may the impotent menaces of the church's enemies be 
 easily despised by the church's friends.</P>
