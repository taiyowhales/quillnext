 Nothing that occurred in the quiet and peaceable times of Israel is 
 recorded; the forty years' rest after the conquest of Jabin is passed 
 over in silence; and here begins the story of another distress and 
 another deliverance, by Gideon, the fourth of the judges. Here is, 

 I. The calamitous condition of Israel, by the inroads of the
 Midianites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. The message God sent them by a prophet, by convincing them of sin,
 to prepare them for deliverance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.

 III. The raising up of Gideon to be their deliverer.

 1. A commission which God sent him by the hand of an angel, and
 confirmed by a sign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:11-24">ver. 11-24</A>.

 2. The first-fruits of his government in the reform of his father's
 house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:25-32">ver. 25-32</A>.

 3. The preparations he made for a war with the Midianites, and the 
 encouragement given him by a sign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:33-40">ver. 33-40</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
 &nbsp; 2 And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: <I>and</I>
 because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the
 dens which <I>are</I> in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.
 &nbsp; 3 And <I>so</I> it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites
 came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even
 they came up against them;
 &nbsp; 4 And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of
 the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for
 Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
 &nbsp; 5 For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they
 came as grasshoppers for multitude; <I>for</I> both they and their
 camels were without number: and they entered into the land to
 destroy it.
 &nbsp; 6 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the
 Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, 

 I. Israel's sin renewed: <I>They did evil in the sight of the Lord,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The burnt child dreads the fire; yet this perverse unthinking people, 
 that had so often smarted sorely for their idolatry, upon a little 
 respite of God's judgments return to it again. <I>This people hath a 
 revolting rebellious heart,</I> not kept in awe by the terror of God's 
 judgments, nor engaged in honour and gratitude by the great things he 
 had done for them to keep themselves in his love. The providence of God 
 will not change the hearts and lives of sinners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Israel's troubles repeated. This would follow of course; let all 
 that sin expect to suffer; let all that return to folly expect to 
 return to misery. <I>With the froward God will show himself froward</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:26">Ps. xviii. 26</A>),

 and will walk contrary to those that walk contrary to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:21,24">Lev. xxvi. 21, 24</A>.
 
 Now as to this trouble,

 1. It arose from a very despicable enemy. God delivered them into the
 hand of Midian 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 not Midian in the south where Jethro lived, but Midian in the east that
 joined to Moab

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+22:4">Num. xxii. 4</A>),

 a people that all men despised as uncultivated and unintelligent; hence
 we read not here of any king, lord, or general, that they had, but the 
 force with which they destroyed Israel was an undisciplined mob; and, 
 which made it the more grievous, they were a people that Israel had 
 formerly subdued, and in a manner destroyed (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+31:7">Num. xxxi. 7</A>),

 and yet by this time (nearly 200 years after) the poor remains of them
 were so multiplied, and so magnified, that they were capable of being 
 made a very severe scourge to Israel. Thus <I>God moved them to 
 jealousy with those who were not a people,</I> even a foolish nation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:21">Deut. xxxii. 21</A>.

 The meanest creature will serve to chastise those that have made the
 great Creator their enemy. And, when those we are authorized to rule 
 prove rebellious and disobedient to us, it concerns us to enquire 
 whether we have not been so to our sovereign Ruler.

 2. It arose to a very formidable height 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>The hand of Midian prevailed,</I> purely by their multitude. God had
 promised to increase Israel as the sand on the sea shore; but their sin 
 stopped their growth and diminished them, and then their enemies, 
 though otherwise every way inferior to them, overpowered them with 
 numbers. They came upon them as <I>grasshoppers for multitude</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 not in a regular army to engage them in the field, but in a confused
 swarm to plunder the country, quarter themselves upon it, and enrich 
 themselves with its spoils--bands of robbers, and no better. And sinful 
 Israel, being separated by sin from God, had not spirit to make head 
 against them.  Observe the wretched havoc that these Midianites made 
 with their bands of plunderers in Israel. Here we have,

 (1.) The Israelites imprisoned, or rather imprisoning themselves, in 
 dens and caves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 This was owing purely to their own timorousness and faint-heartedness,
 that they would rather fly than fight; it was the effect of a guilty 
 conscience, which made them tremble at the shaking of a leaf, and the 
 just punishment of their apostasy from God, who thus fought against 
 them with those very terrors with which he would otherwise have fought 
 for them. Had it not been for this, we cannot but think Israel a match 
 for the Midianites, and able enough to make head against them; but the 
 heart that departs from God is lost, not only to that which is good, 
 but to that which is great. Sin dispirits men, and makes them sneak 
 into dens and caves. The day will come when chief captains and mighty 
 men will call in vain to rocks and mountains to hide them.

 (2.) The Israelites impoverished, greatly impoverished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 The Midianites and the other children of the east that joined with them
 to live by spoil and rapine (as long before the Sabeans and Chaldeans 
 did that plundered Job, free-booters) made frequent incursions into the 
 land of Canaan. This fruitful land was a great temptation to them; and 
 the sloth and luxury into which the Israelites had sunk by forty years' 
 rest made them and their substance an easy prey to them. They came up 
 against them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 
 pitched their camps among them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and brought their cattle with them, particularly camels innumerable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 not a flying party to make a sally upon them and be gone presently, but
 they resolved to force their way, and penetrated through the heart of 
 the country as far as Gaza on the western side, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They let the Israelites alone to sow their ground, but towards harvest
 they came and seized all, and ate up and destroyed it, both grass and 
 corn, and when they went away took with them the sheep and oxen, so 
 that in short they left no sustenance for Israel, except what was 
 privately taken by the rightful owners into the dens and caves. Now 
 here we may see,

 [1.] The justice of God in the punishment of their sin. They had 
 neglected to honour God with their substance in tithes and offerings, 
 and had prepared that for Baal with which God should have been served, 
 and now God justly sends an enemy to take it away <I>in the season 
 thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:8,9">Hos. ii. 8, 9</A>.

 [2.] The consequence of God's departure from a people; when he goes all 
 good goes and all mischiefs break in. When Israel kept in with God, 
 they reaped what others sowed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:13,Ps+105:44">Josh. xxiv. 13; Ps. cv. 44</A>);

 but now that God had forsaken them others reaped what they sowed. Let
 us take occasion from this to bless God for our national peace and 
 tranquillity, that we <I>eat the labour of our hands.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Israel's sense of God's hand revived at last. Seven years, year 
 after year, did the Midianites make these inroads upon them, each we 
 may suppose worse than the other 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 until at last, all other succours failing, <I>Israel cried unto the
 Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 for crying to Baal ruined them, and would not help them. When God
 judges he will overcome; and sinners shall be made either to bend or 
 break before him.</P>

 <A NAME="Jud6_7"> </A>
 <A NAME="Jud6_8"> </A>
 <A NAME="Jud6_9"> </A>
 <A NAME="Jud6_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> because of the Midianites,
 &nbsp; 8 That the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sent a prophet unto the children of Israel,
 which said unto them, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, I
 brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house
 of bondage;
 &nbsp; 9 And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out
 of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from
 before you, and gave you their land;
 &nbsp; 10 And I said unto you, I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God; fear not the
 gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not
 obeyed my voice.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 

 I. The cognizance God took of the cries of Israel, when at length they 
 were directed towards him. Though in their prosperity they had 
 neglected him and made court to his rivals, and though they never 
 looked towards him until they were driven to it by extremity, yet, upon 
 their complain and prayer, he intended relief for them. Thus would he 
 show how ready he is to forgive, how swift he is to show mercy, and how 
 inclinable to hear prayer, that sinners may be encouraged to return and 
 repent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:4">Ps. cxxx. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The method God took of working deliverance for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Before he sent an angel to raise them up a saviour he sent a prophet 
 to reprove them for sin, and to bring them to repentance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 This prophet is not named, but he was a man, a prophet, not an angel,
 as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:1"><I>ch.</I> ii. 1</A>.

 Whether this prophet took an opportunity of delivering his message to
 the children of Israel when they had met together in a general 
 assembly, at some solemn feast or other great occasion, or whether he 
 went from city to city and from tribe to tribe, preaching to this 
 purport, is not certain; but his errand was to convince them of sin, 
 that, in their crying to the Lord, they might confess that with sorrow 
 and shame, and not spend their breath in only complaining of their 
 trouble. They cried to God for a deliverer, and God sent them a prophet 
 to instruct them, and to make them ready for deliverance. Note, 

 (1.) We have reason to hope God is designing mercy for us if we find he 
 is by his grace preparing us for it. If to those that are sick he sends 
 a messenger, an interpreter, by whom he <I>shows unto man his 
 uprightness, then he is gracious,</I> and grants a recovery, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:23,24">Job xxxiii. 23, 24</A>.

 (2.) The sending of prophets to a people, and the furnishing of a land 
 with faithful ministers, is a token for good, and an evidence that God 
 has mercy in store for them. He thus turns us to him, and then causes 
 his face to shine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:19">Ps. lxxx. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We have here the heads of the message which this prophet delivered 
 in to Israel, in the name of the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He sets before them the great things God had done for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>):

 <I>Thus saith the Lord God of Israel;</I> they had worshipped the
 <I>gods of the nations,</I> as if they had had no God of their own to 
 worship and therefore might choose whom they pleased; but they are here 
 reminded of one whom they had forgotten, who was known by the title of 
 <I>the God of Israel,</I> and to him they must return. They had turned 
 to other gods, as if their own had been either incapable or unwilling 
 to protect them, and therefore they are told what he did for their 
 fathers, in whose loins they were, the benefit of which descended and 
 still remained to this their ungrateful seed.

 [1.] He brought them out of Egypt, where otherwise they would have 
 continued in perpetual poverty and slavery. 

 [2.] He <I>delivered them out of the hands of all that oppressed 
 them;</I> this is mentioned to intimate that the reason why they were 
 not now delivered out of the hands of the oppressing Midianites was not 
 for want of any power or good-will in God, but because by their 
 iniquity they had sold themselves, and God would not redeem them until 
 they by repentance revoked the bargain. 

 [3.] He put them in quiet possession of this good land; this not only 
 aggravated their sin, and affixed the brand of base ingratitude to it, 
 but it justified God, and cleared him from blame upon account of the 
 trouble they were now in. They could not say he was unkind, for he had
 given all possible proofs of his designing well for them; if ill befel 
 them notwithstanding, they must thank themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He shows the easiness and equity of God's demands and expectations 
 from them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>I am the Lord your God,</I> to whom you lie under the highest
 obligations, <I>fear not the gods of the Amorites,</I>" that is, "do 
 not worship them, nor show any respect to them; do not worship them for 
 fear of their doing you any hurt, for what hurt can they do you while I 
 am your God? Fear God, and you need not fear them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He charges them with rebellion against God, who had laid this 
 injunction upon them: <I>But you have not obeyed my voice.</I> The 
 charge is short, but very comprehensive; this was the malignity of all 
 their sin, it was disobedience to God; and therefore it was this that 
 brought those calamities upon them under which they were now groaning, 
 pursuant to the threatenings annexed to his commands. He intends hereby 
 to bring them to repentance; and our repentance is then right and 
 genuine when the sinfulness of sin, as disobedience to God, is that in 
 it which we chiefly lament.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 And there came an angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and sat under an oak
 which <I>was</I> in Ophrah, that <I>pertained</I> unto Joash the Abiezrite:
 and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide <I>it</I>
 from the Midianites.
 &nbsp; 12 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> appeared unto him, and said unto
 him, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> with thee, thou mighty man of valour.
 &nbsp; 13 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> be with
 us, why then is all this befallen us? and where <I>be</I> all his
 miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 bring us up from Egypt? but now the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath forsaken us, and
 delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.
 &nbsp; 14 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy
 might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the
 Midianites: have not I sent thee?
 &nbsp; 15 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save
 Israel? behold, my family <I>is</I> poor in Manasseh, and I <I>am</I> the
 least in my father's house.
 &nbsp; 16 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and
 thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
 &nbsp; 17 And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy
 sight, then show me a sign that thou talkest with me.
 &nbsp; 18 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and
 bring forth my present, and set <I>it</I> before thee. And he said, I
 will tarry until thou come again.
 &nbsp; 19 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened
 cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he
 put the broth in a pot, and brought <I>it</I> out unto him under the
 oak, and presented <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 20 And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the
 unleavened cakes, and lay <I>them</I> upon this rock, and pour out the
 broth. And he did so.
 &nbsp; 21 Then the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> put forth the end of the staff
 that <I>was</I> in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened
 cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the
 flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 departed out of his sight.
 &nbsp; 22 And when Gideon perceived that he <I>was</I> an angel of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord 
 G<FONT SIZE=-1>OD</FONT>! for because I have seen an
 angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> face to face.
 &nbsp; 23 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto him, Peace <I>be</I> unto thee; fear not:
 thou shalt not die.
 &nbsp; 24 Then Gideon built an altar there unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and called
 it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it <I>is</I> yet in Ophrah of the
 Abi-ezrites.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is not said what effect the prophet's sermon had upon the people, 
 but we may hope it had a good effect, and that some of them at least 
 repented and reformed upon it; for here, immediately after, we have the 
 dawning of the day of their deliverance, by the effectual calling of 
 Gideon to take upon him the command of their forces against the 
 Midianites.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The person to be commissioned for this service was Gideon, the son 
 of Joash, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The father was now living, but he was passed by, and this honour put
 upon the son, for the father kept up in his own family the worship of 
 Baal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 which we may suppose this son, as far as was in his power, witnessed
 against. He was of the half tribe of Manasseh that lay in Canaan, of 
 the family of Abiezer; the eldest house of that tribe,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+17:2">Josh. xvii. 2</A>.

 Hitherto the judges were raised up out of that tribe which suffered
 most by the oppression, and probably it was so here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The person that gave him the commission was an <I>angel of the 
 Lord;</I> it should seem not a created angel, but the Son of God 
 himself, the eternal Word, the Lord of the angels, who then appeared 
 upon some great occasions in human shape, as a prelude (says the 
 learned bishop Patrick) to what he intended in the fulness of time, 
 when he would take our nature upon him, as we say, for good and all. 
 This angel is here called <I>Jehovah,</I> the incommunicable name of 
 God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14, 16</A>),
 
 and he said, <I>I will be with thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This divine person appeared here to Gideon, and it is observable how 
 he found him, 

 (1.) Retired--all alone. God often manifests himself to his people when 
 they are out of the noise and hurry of this world. Silence and
 solitude befriend our communion with God. 

 (2.) Employed in threshing wheat, with a <I>staff</I> or <I>rod</I> (so 
 the word signifies), such as they used in beating out fitches and 
 cummin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:27">Isa. xxviii. 27</A>),

 but now used for wheat, probably because he had but little to thresh,
 he needed not the oxen to tread it out. It was not then looked upon as 
 any diminution to him, though he was a person of some account and a 
 <I>mighty man of valour,</I> to lay his hand to the business of the 
 husbandman. He had many servants

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 and yet would not himself live in idleness. We put ourselves in the way
 of divine visits when we employ ourselves in honest business. Tidings 
 of Christ's birth were brought to the shepherds when they were keeping 
 their flocks. The work he was about was an emblem of that greater work 
 to which he was now to be called, as the disciples' fishing was. From 
 threshing corn he is fetched to thresh the Midianites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+41:15">Isa. xli. 15</A>.

 (3.) Distressed; he was threshing his wheat, not in the 
 threshing-floor, the proper place, but <I>by the wine-press,</I> in 
 some private unsuspected corner, for fear of the Midianites. He himself 
 shared in the common calamity, and now the angel came to animate him 
 against Midian when he himself could speak so feelingly of the 
 heaviness of their yoke. The day of the greatest distress is God's time 
 to appear for his people's relief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let us now see what passed between the angel and Gideon, who knew 
 not with certainty, till after he was gone, that he was an angel, but 
 supposed he was a prophet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The angel accosted him with respect, and assured him of the 
 presence of God with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He calls him a <I>mighty man of valour,</I> perhaps because he observed
 how he threshed his corn with all his might; and seest thou a man 
 diligent in his business? whatever his business is, he shall <I>stand 
 before kings.</I> He that is faithful in a few things shall be ruler 
 over many. Gideon was a man of a brave active spirit, and yet buried 
 alive in obscurity, through the iniquity of the times; but he is here 
 animated to undertake something great, like himself, with that word, 
 <I>The Lord is with thee,</I> or, as the Chaldee reads it, <I>the Word 
 of the Lord is thy help.</I> It was very sure that the Lord was with 
 him when this angel was with him.  By this word,

 [1.] He gives him his commission. If we have God's presence with us, 
 this will justify us and bear us out in our undertakings. 

 [2.] He inspires him with all necessary qualifications for the 
 execution of his commission. "The Lord is with thee to guide and 
 strengthen thee, to animate and support thee." 

 [3.] He assures him of success; for, <I>if God be for us, who can</I> 
 prevail <I>against us?</I> If he be with us, nothing can be wanting to 
 us. The presence of God with us is all in all to our prosperity, 
 whatever we do. Gideon was a mighty man of valour, and yet he could 
 bring nothing to pass without the presence of God, and that presence is 
 enough to make any man mighty in valour and to give a man courage at 
 any time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Gideon gave a very melancholy answer to this joyful salutation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>O my Lord! if the Lord be with us</I> (which the Chaldee reads,
 <I>Is the Shechinah of the Lord our help?</I> making that the same with 
 <I>the Word of the Lord) why then has all this befallen us?</I> "all 
 this trouble and distress from the Midianites' incursions, which force 
 me to thresh wheat here by the wine-press--all this loss, and grief, 
 and fright; and <I>where are all the miracles which our fathers told us 
 of?</I>" Observe, In his reply he regards not the praise of his own 
 valour, nor does this in the least elevate him or give him any 
 encouragement, though it is probable the angel adapted what he said to 
 that which Gideon was at the same time thinking of; while his labouring 
 hands were employed about his wheat, his working head and daring heart 
 were meditating Israel's rescue and Midian's ruin, with which thought 
 he that knows the heart seasonably sets in, calls him a man of valour 
 for his brave projects, and open him a way to put them in execution; 
 yet Gideon, as if not conscious to himself of any thing great or 
 encouraging in his own spirit, fastens only on the assurance the angel 
 had given him of God's presence, as that by which they held all their 
 comfort. Observe, The angel spoke in particular to him: <I>The Lord is 
 with thee;</I> but he expostulates for all: <I>If the Lord be with 
 us,</I> herding himself with the thousands of Israel, and admitting no 
 comfort but what they might be sharers in, so far is he from the 
 thoughts of monopolizing it, though he had so fair an occasion given 
 him. Note, Public spirits reckon that only an honour and joy to 
 themselves which puts them in a capacity of serving the common 
 interests of God's church. Gideon was a mighty man of valour, but as 
 yet weak in faith, which makes it hard to him to reconcile to the 
 assurances now given him of the presence of God,

 [1.] The distress to which Israel was reduced: <I>Why has all this</I> 
 (and <I>all this</I> was no little) <I>befallen us?</I> Note, It is 
 sometimes hard, but never impossible, to reconcile cross providences 
 with the presence of God and his favour. 

 [2.] The delay of their deliverance: "<I>Where are all the miracles 
 which our fathers told us of?</I> Why does not the same power which 
 delivered our fathers from the yoke of the Egyptians deliver us out of 
 the hands of the Midianites?" As if because God did not immediately 
 work miracles for their deliverance, though they had by their sins 
 forfeited his favour and help, it must be questioned whether ever he 
 had wrought the miracles which their fathers told them of, or, if he 
 had, whether he had now the same wisdom, and power, and good-will to 
 his people, that he had had formerly. This was his weakness. We must 
 not expect that the miracles which were wrought when a church was in 
 the forming, and some great truth in the settling, should be continued 
 and repeated when the formation and settlement are completed: no, nor 
 that the mercies God showed to our fathers that served him, and kept 
 close to him, should be renewed to us, if we degenerate and revolt from 
 him. Gideon ought not to have said either, <I>First,</I> That <I>God 
 had delivered them into the hands of the Midianites,</I> for by their 
 iniquities they had sold themselves, or, <I>Secondly,</I> That now they 
 were in their hands he had forsaken them, for he had lately sent them a 
 prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 which was a certain indication that he had not forsaken them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The angel gave him a very effectual answer to his objections, by 
 giving him a commission to deliver Israel out of the hands of the 
 Midianites, and assuring him of success therein, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Now the angel is called <I>Jehovah,</I> for he speaks as one having
 authority, and not as a messenger.

 [1.] There was something extraordinary in the look he now gave to 
 Gideon; it was a gracious favourable look, which revived his spirits 
 that dropped, and silenced his fears, such a look as that with which 
 God's <I>countenance beholds the upright,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:7">Ps. xi. 7</A>.

 He looked upon him, and smiled at the objections he made, which he gave
 him no direct answer to, but girded and clothed him with such power as 
 would shortly enable him to answer them himself, and make him ashamed 
 that ever he had made them. It was a speaking look, like Christ's upon 
 Peter

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:61">Luke xxii. 61</A>),

 a powerful look, a look that strangely darted new light and life into
 Gideon's breast, and inspired him with a generous heat, far above what 
 he felt before. 

 [2.] But there was much more in what he said to him. <I>First,</I> He
 commissioned him to appear and act as Israel's deliverer. Such a one 
 the few thinking people in the nation, and Gideon among the rest, were 
 now expecting to be raised up, according to God's former method, in 
 answer to the cries of oppressed Israel; and now Gideon is told, "Thou 
 art the man: <I>Go in this thy might,</I> this might wherewith thou art 
 now threshing wheat; go and employ it to a nobler purpose; <I>I will 
 make thee a thresher of men.</I>" Or, rather, "this might wherewith 
 thou art now endued by this look." God gave him his commission by 
 giving him all the qualifications that were necessary for the execution 
 of it, which is more than the mightiest prince and potentate on earth 
 can do for those to whom he gives commissions. God's fitting men for 
 work is a sure and constant evidence of his calling them to it. "Go, 
 not in thy might, that which is natural, and of thyself, depend not on 
 thy own valour; but go in <I>this</I> thy might, this which thou hast 
 now received, <I>go in the strength of the Lord God,</I> that is, the 
 strength with which thou must strengthen thyself." <I>Secondly,</I> He 
 assured him of success. This was enough to put courage into him; he 
 might be confident he should not miscarry in the attempt; it should not 
 turn either to his own disgrace or the damage of his people (as baffled 
 enterprises do), but to his honour and their happiness: <I>Thou shalt 
 save Israel from the hand of the Midianites,</I> and so shalt not only 
 be an eye-witness, but a glorious instrument, of such wonders as thy 
 <I>fathers told thee of.</I> Gideon, we may suppose, looked as one 
 astonished at this strange and surprising power conferred upon him, and 
 questions whether he may depend upon what he hears: the angel ratifies 
 his commission with a <I>teste meipso</I>--<I>an appeal to his own 
 authority;</I> there needed no more. "<I>Have not I commanded 
 thee</I>--I that have all power in heaven and earth, and particular 
 authority here as Israel's King, giving commissions 
 immediately--<I>I</I> who <I>am that I am,</I> the same that sent 
 Moses?"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:14">Exod. iii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Gideon made a very modest objection against this commission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>O my Lord! wherewith shall I save Israel?</I> This question bespeaks
 him either,

 [1.] Distrustful of God and his power, as if, though God should be with 
 him, yet it were impossible for him to save Israel. True faith is often 
 weak, yet it shall not be rejected, but encouraged and strengthened. 
 Or, 

 [2.] Inquisitive concerning the methods he must take: "Lord, I labour 
 under all imaginable disadvantages for it; if I must do it, thou must 
 put me in the way." Note, Those who receive commissions from God must 
 expect and seek for instructions from him. Or rather, 

 [3.] Humble, self-diffident, and self-denying. The angel had honoured 
 him, but see how meanly he speaks of himself: "My family is 
 comparatively poor in Manasseh" (impoverished, it may be, more than 
 other families by the Midianites), "and I am the least, that have the 
 least honour and interest, <I>in my father's house;</I> what can I 
 pretend to do? I am utterly unfit for the service, and unworthy of the 
 honour." Note, God often chooses to do great things by those that are 
 little, especially that are so in their own eyes. God delights to 
 advance the humble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) This objection was soon answered by a repetition of the promise
 that God would be with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 "Object not thy poverty and meanness; such things have indeed often
 hindered men in great enterprises, but what are they to a man that has 
 the presence of God with him, which will make up all the deficiencies 
 of honour and estate.  <I>Surely I will be with thee,</I> to direct and 
 strengthen thee, and put such a reputation upon thee that, how weak 
 soever thy personal interest is, thou shalt have soldiers enough to 
 follow thee, and be assured <I>thou shalt smite the Midianites as one 
 men,</I> as easily as if they were but one man and as effectually. All 
 the thousands of Midian shall be as if they had but one neck, and thou 
 shalt have the cutting of it off."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) Gideon desires to have his faith confirmed touching this 
 commission; for he would not be over-credulous of that which tended so 
 much to his own praise, would not venture upon an undertaking so far 
 above him, and in which he must engage many more, but he would be well 
 satisfied himself of his authority, and would be able to give 
 satisfaction to others as to him who gave him that authority. He 
 therefore humbly begs of this divine person, whoever he was, 

 [1.] That he would give him a sign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 And, the commission being given him out of the common road of
 providence, he might reasonably expect it should be confirmed by some 
 act of God out of the common course of nature: "Show me a sign to 
 assure me of the truth of this concerning which thou talkest with me, 
 that it is something more than talk, and that thou art in earnest." 
 Now, under the dispensation of the Spirit, we are not to expect signs 
 before our eyes, such as Gideon here desired, but must earnestly pray 
 to God that, if <I>we have found grace in his sight,</I> he would show 
 us a sign in our heart, by the powerful operations of his Spirit there, 
 <I>fulfilling the work of faith,</I> and perfecting what is lacking in 
 it.

 [2.] In order hereunto, that he would accept of a treat, and so give 
 him a further and longer opportunity of conversation with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 Those who know what it is to have communion with God desire the
 continuance of it, and are loth to part, praying with Gideon, <I>Depart 
 not hence, I pray thee.</I> That which Gideon desired in courting his 
 stay was that he might bring out some provision of meat for this 
 stranger. He did not take him into the house to entertain him there, 
 perhaps because his father's house were not well affected to him and 
 his friends, or because he desired still to be in private with this 
 stranger, and to converse with him alone (therefore he calls not for a 
 servant to bring the provision, but fetches it himself), or because 
 thus his father Abraham entertained angels unawares, not in his tent, 
 but under a tree, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:8">Gen. xviii. 8</A>.

 Upon the angel's promise to stay to dinner with him, he hastened to
 bring out a kid, which, it is likely, was ready boiled for his own 
 dinner, so that in making it ready he had nothing to do but to put it 
 in the basket (for here was no sauce to serve it up in, nor the dish 
 garnished) and the broth in a vessel, and so he presented it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 Hereby he intended, <I>First,</I> To testify his grateful and generous
 respects to this stranger, and, in him, to God who sent him, as one 
 that studied what he should render. He had pleaded the poverty of his 
 family

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 to excuse himself from being a general, but not here to excuse himself
 from being hospitable. Out of the little which the Midianites had left 
 him he would gladly spare enough to entertain a friend, especially a 
 messenger from heaven.  <I>Secondly,</I> To try who and what this 
 extraordinary person was.  What he brought out is called his 
 <I>present,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 It is the same word that is used for a meat-offering, and perhaps that
 word is used which signifies both because Gideon intended to leave it 
 to this divine person to determine which it should be when he had it 
 before him: whether a feast or a meat-offering, and accordingly he 
 would be able to judge concerning him: if he ate of it as common meat, 
 he would suppose him to be a man, a prophet; if otherwise, as it 
 proved, he should know him to be an angel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) The angel gives him a sign in and by that which he had kindly 
 prepared for his entertainment. For what we offer to God for his glory, 
 and in token of our gratitude to him, will be made by the grace of God 
 to turn to our own comfort and satisfaction. The angel ordered him to 
 take the flesh and bread out of the basket, and lay it upon a hard and 
 cold rock, and to pour out the broth upon it, which, if he brought it 
 hot, would soon be cold there; and <I>Gideon did so</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),
 
 believing that the angel appointed it, not in contempt of his courtesy,
 but with an intention to give him a sign, which he did, abundantly to 
 his satisfaction. For, 

 [1.] He turned the <I>meat into an offering made by fire, of a sweet 
 savour</I> unto himself, showing hereby that he was not a man who 
 needed meat, but the Son of God who was to be served and honoured by 
 sacrifice, and who in the fulness of time was to make himself a 
 sacrifice. 

 [2.] He brought fire <I>out of the rock,</I> to consume this sacrifice, 
 summoning it, not by striking the rock, as we strike fire out of a 
 flint, but by a gentle touch given to the offering with the end of his 
 staff, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Hereby he gave him a sign that he had <I>found grace in his sight,</I>
 for God testified his acceptance of sacrifices by kindling them, if 
 public, with fire from heaven, as those of Moses and Elias, if private, 
 as this, with fire out of the earth, which was equivalent: both were 
 the effect of divine power; and this acceptance of his sacrifice 
 evidenced the acceptance of his person, confirmed his commission, and 
 perhaps was intended to signify his success in the execution of it, 
 that he and his army should be a surprising terror and consumption to 
 the Midianites, like this fire out of the rock.

 [3.] He <I>departed out of his sight</I> immediately, did not walk off 
 as a man, but vanished and disappeared as a spirit. Here was as much of 
 a sign as he could wish.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (8.) Gideon, though no doubt he was confirmed in his faith by the 
 indications given of the divinity of the person who had spoken to him, 
 yet for the present was put into a great fright by it, till God 
 graciously pacified him and removed his fears.

 [1.] Gideon speaks peril to himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>When he perceived that he was an angel</I> (which was not till he
 had departed, as the two disciples knew not it was Jesus they had been 
 talking with till he was going,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:31">Luke xxiv. 31</A>),
 
 then he cried out, <I>Alas! O Lord God!</I> be merciful to me, I am
 undone, for <I>I have seen an angel,</I> as Jacob, who wondered that 
 his life was preserved when he had seen God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:30">Gen. xxxii. 30</A>.

 Ever since man has by sin exposed himself to God's wrath and curse an
 express from heaven has been a terror to him, as he scarcely dares to 
 expect good tidings thence; at least, in this world of sense, it is a 
 very awful thing to have any sensible conversation with that world of 
 spirits to which we are so much strangers. Gideon's courage failed him 
 now.

 [2.] God speaks peace to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 It might have been fatal to him, but he assures him it should not. The
 Lord had <I>departed out of his sight,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 But though he must no longer walk by sight he might still live by
 faith, that faith which comes by hearing; for the Lord said to him, 
 with an audible voice (as bishop Patrick thinks) these encouraging 
 words, "<I>Peace be unto thee,</I> all is well, and be thou satisfied 
 that it is so. Fear not; he that came to employ thee did not intend to 
 slay thee; <I>thou shalt not die.</I>" See how ready God is to revive 
 the hearts of those that tremble at his word and presence, and to give 
 those that stand in awe of his majesty assurances of his mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The memorial of this vision which Gideon set up was a monument in
 form of an altar, the rather because it was by a kind of sacrifice upon 
 a rock, without the solemnity of an altar, that the angel manifested 
 his acceptance of him; then an altar was unnecessary (the angel's staff 
 was sufficient to sanctify the gift without an altar), but now it was 
 of use to preserve the remembrance of the vision, which was done by the 
 name Gideon gave to this memorial, <I>Jehovah-shalom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)--<I>The

 Lord peace.</I> This is,

 (1.) The title of the Lord that spoke to him. Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+16:13">Gen. xvi. 13</A>.

 The same that is the <I>Lord our righteousness</I> is <I>our peace</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:14">Eph. ii. 14</A>),
 
 our reconciler and so our Saviour. Or,

 (2.) The substance of what he said to him: "<I>The Lord spoke 
 peace,</I> and created that fruit of the lips, bade me be easy when I 
 was in that agitation." Or, 

 (3.) A prayer grounded upon what he had said, so the margin understands 
 it: <I>The Lord send peace,</I> that is, rest from the present trouble, 
 for still the public welfare lay nearest his heart.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25 And it came to pass the same night, that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto
 him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of
 seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father
 hath, and cut down the grove that <I>is</I> by it:
 &nbsp; 26 And build an altar unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God upon the top of
 this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and
 offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou
 shalt cut down.
 &nbsp; 27 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had said unto him: and <I>so</I> it was, because he feared his
 father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do
 <I>it</I> by day, that he did <I>it</I> by night.
 &nbsp; 28 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning,
 behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut
 down that <I>was</I> by it, and the second bullock was offered upon
 the altar <I>that was</I> built.
 &nbsp; 29 And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And
 when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash
 hath done this thing.
 &nbsp; 30 Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son,
 that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and
 because he hath cut down the grove that <I>was</I> by it.
 &nbsp; 31 And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye
 plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let
 him be put to death whilst <I>it is yet</I> morning: if he <I>be</I> a god,
 let him plead for himself, because <I>one</I> hath cast down his
 altar.
 &nbsp; 32 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let
 Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.

 Here, 

 I. Orders are given to Gideon to begin his government with the 
 reformation of his father's house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 A correspondence being settled between God and Gideon, by the
 appearance of the angel to him, it was kept up in another way; the same 
 night after he had seen God, when he was full of thoughts concerning 
 what had passed, which probably he had not yet communicated to any, 
 <I>The Lord said unto him</I> in a dream, <I>Do so and so.</I> Note, 
 God's visits, if gratefully received, shall be graciously repeated. Bid 
 God welcome, and he will come again.  Gideon is appointed,

 1. To throw down Baal's altar, which it seems hi father had, either
 for his own house or perhaps for the whole town. See the power of God's 
 grace, that he could raise up a reformer, and the condescensions of his 
 grace, that he would raise up a deliverer, out of the family of one 
 that was a ring-leader in idolatry. But Gideon must not now think it 
 enough not to worship at that altar, which we charitably hope he had 
 not done, but he must throw it down; not consecrate the same altar to 
 God (tit is bishop Hall's observation), but utterly demolish it. God 
 first commands down the monuments of superstition, and then enjoins his 
 own service. He must likewise <I>cut down the grove that was by it,</I> 
 the plantation of young trees, designed to beautify the place. The 
 learned bishop Patrick, by the grove, understands the image in the 
 grove, probably the image of Ashtaroth (for the word for a grove is 
 <I>Ashereh</I>), which stood upon or close by the altar.

 2. To erect an altar to God, <I>to Jehovah his God,</I> which
 probably was to be notified by an inscription upon the altar to that 
 purport--to Jehovah, Gideon's God, or Israel's. It would have been an 
 improper thing for him to build an altar, even to the God of Israel, 
 especially for burnt-offering and sacrifice, and would have been 
 construed into a contempt of the altar at Shiloh, if God, who has not 
 tied up himself to his own laws, had not bidden him to do it. But now 
 it was his duty and honour to be thus employed. God directs him to the 
 place where he should build it, on the <I>top of the rock,</I> perhaps 
 in the same place in which the angel had appeared to him, near to the 
 altar he had already built: and he must not do it in a hurry, but with 
 the decency that became a religious action (<I>in an orderly 
 manner,</I> as it is in the margin), according to the ancient law for 
 altars raised on particular occasions, that they must be of earth not 
 of hewn stone. The word here used for the rock on which the altar was 
 to be built signifies a fortress, or strong-hold, erected, some think, 
 to secure them from the Midianites; if so, it was no security while the 
 altar of Baal was so near it, but it was effectually fortified when an 
 altar to the Lord was built on the top of it, for that is the best 
 defence upon our glory. On this altar,

 (1.) He was to offer sacrifice. Two bullocks he must offer: his 
 father's <I>young bullock, and the second bullock of seven years 
 old,</I> so it should rather be read, not <I>even</I> the second as we 
 read it. The former, we may suppose, he was to offer for himself, the 
 latter <I>for the sins of the people</I> whom he was to deliver. It was 
 requisite he should thus make peace with God, before he made war on 
 Midian. Till sin be pardoned through the great sacrifice, no good is to 
 be expected. These bullocks, it is supposed, were intended for 
 sacrifices on the altar of Baal, but were now converted to a better 
 use. Thus, when the <I>strong man armed</I> is overcome and 
 dispossessed, the stronger than he divides the spoil, seizes that for 
 himself <I>which was prepared for Baal.</I> Let him come <I>whose right 
 it is,</I> and <I>give it to him.</I> 

 (2.) Ball's grove, or image, or whatever it was that was the sanctity 
 or beauty of his altar, must not only be burnt, but must be used as 
 fuel for God's altar, to signify not only that whatever sets up itself 
 in opposition to God shall be destroyed, but that the justice of God 
 will be glorified in its destruction. God ordered Gideon to do this,

 [1.] To try his zeal for religion, which it was necessary he should 
 give proofs of before he took the field, to give proof of his valour 
 there. 

 [2.] That some steps might hereby to taken towards Israel's 
 reformation, which must prepare the way for their deliverance. Sin,
 the cause, must be taken away, else how should the trouble, which was 
 but the effect, come to an end? And it might be hoped that this example 
 of Gideon's, who was now shortly to appear so great a man, would be 
 followed by the rest of the cities and tribes, and the destruction of 
 this one altar of Baal would be the destruction of many.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Gideon was <I>obedient to the heavenly vision,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 He that was to command the Israel of God must be subject to the God of
 Israel, without disputing, and, as a type of Christ, must first <I>save 
 his people from their sins,</I> and then save them from their enemies.

 1. He had servants of his own, whom he could confide in, who, we may
 suppose, like him, had kept their integrity, and had <I>not bowed the 
 knee to Baal,</I> and therefore were forward to assist him in 
 destroying the altar of Baal.

 2. He did not scruple taking his father's bullock and offering it to
 God without his father's consent, because God, who expressly commanded 
 him to do so, had a better title to it than his father had, and it was 
 the greatest real kindness he could do to his father to prevent his 
 sin.

 3. He expected to incur the displeasure of his father's household by
 it, and the ill-will of his neighbours, yet he did it, remembering how 
 much it was Levi's praise that, in the cause of God, <I>he said to his 
 father and mother, I have not seen him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:9">Deut. xxxiii. 9</A>.

 And, while he was sure of the favour of God, he feared not the anger of
 men; he that bade him do it would bear him out. Yet, 

 4. Though he feared not their resentment when it was done, to prevent
 their resistance in the doing of it he prudently chose to do it by 
 night, that he might not be disturbed in these sacred actions. And some 
 think it was the same night in which God spoke to him to do it, and 
 that, as soon as ever he had received the orders, he immediately 
 applied himself to the execution of them, and finished before 
 morning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He was brought into peril of his life for doing it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:28-30"><I>v.</I> 28-30</A>.

 1. It was soon discovered what was done. Gideon, when he had gone
 through with the business, did not desire the concealment of it, nor 
 could it be hid, for the men of the city <I>rose early in the 
 morning,</I> as it should seem, to say their matins at Baal's altar, 
 and so to begin the day with their god, such a one as he was, a shame 
 to those who say the true God is their God, and yet, in the morning, 
 direct no prayer to him, nor look up.

 2. It was soon discovered who had done it. Strict enquiry was made.
 Gideon was known to be disaffected to the worship of Baal, which 
 brought him into suspicion, and positive proof immediately came against 
 him: "Gideon, no doubt, <I>has done this thing.</I>"

 3. Gideon being found guilty of the fact, to such a pitch of impiety
 had these degenerate Israelites arrived that they take it for law he 
 must die for the same, and require his own father (who, by patronising 
 their idolatry, had given them too much cause to expect he would comply 
 with them herein) to deliver him up: <I>Bring out thy son, that he may 
 die.</I> Be astonished, O heavens! at this, and tremble, O earth! By 
 the law of God the worshippers of Baal were to die, but these wicked 
 men impiously turn the penalty upon the worshippers of the God of 
 Israel. How prodigiously mad were they upon their idols! Was it not 
 enough to offer the choicest of their bullocks to Baal, but must the 
 bravest youth of their city fall as a sacrifice to that dunghill-deity, 
 when they pretended he was provoked? How soon will idolaters become 
 persecutors!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He was rescued out of the hands of his persecutors by his own 
 father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. There were those that stood against Gideon, that not only appeared 
 at the first to make a demand, but insisted on it, and would have him 
 put to death. Notwithstanding the heavy judgments they were at this 
 time under for their idolatry, yet they hated to be reformed, and 
 walked contrary to God even when he was walking contrary to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Yet then <I>Joash stood for him;</I> he was one of the chief men of 
 the city. Those that have power may do a great deal for the protection 
 of an honest man and an honest cause, and when they so use their power 
 they are ministers of God for good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This Joash had patronised Baal's altar, yet now protects him that 
 had destroyed it, 

 [1.] Out of natural affection to his son, and perhaps a particular 
 esteem for him as a virtuous, valiant, valuable, young man, and never 
 the worse for not joining with him in the worship of Baal. Many that 
 have not courage enough to keep their integrity themselves yet have so 
 much conscience left as makes them love and esteem those that do. If 
 Joash had a kindness for Baal, yet he had a greater kindness for his 
 son. Or, 

 [2.] Out of a care for the public peace. The mob grew riotous, and, he 
 feared, would grow more so, and therefore, as some think, he bestirred 
 himself to repress the tumult: "Let it be left to the judges; it is not 
 for you to pass sentence upon any man;" he that offers it, <I>let him 
 be put to death:</I> he means not as an idolater, but as a disturber of 
 the peace, and the mover of sedition. Under this same colour Paul was 
 rescued at Ephesus from those that were as zealous for Diana as these 
 were for Baal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+19:40">Acts xix. 40</A>.
 
 Or,

 [3.] Out of a conviction that Gideon had done well. His son, perhaps, 
 had reasoned with him, or God, who has all hearts in his hands, had 
 secretly and effectually influenced him to appear thus against the 
 advocates for Baal, though he had complied with them formerly in the 
 worship of Baal. Note, It is good to appear for God when we are called 
 to it, though there be few or none to second us, because God can 
 incline the hearts of those to stand by us from whom we little expect 
 assistance. Let us do our duty, and then trust God with our safety.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Two things Joash urges:--

 [1.] That it was absurd for them to plead for Baal. "Will you that are 
 Israelites, the worshippers of the one only living and true God, plead 
 for Baal, a false god? Will you be so sottish, so senseless? Those 
 whose fathers' god Baal was, and who never knew any other, are more 
 excusable in pleading for him than you are, that are in covenant with 
 Jehovah, and have been trained up in the knowledge of him. You that 
 have smarted so much for worshipping Baal, and have brought all this 
 mischief and calamity upon yourselves by it, will you yet plead for 
 Baal?" Note, It is bad to commit sin, but it is great wickedness indeed 
 to plead for it, especially to plead for Baal, that idol, whatever it 
 is, which possesses that room in the heart which God should have. 

 [2.] That it was needless for them to plead for Baal. If he were not a
 god, as was pretended, they could have nothing to say for him; if he 
 were, he was able to plead for himself, as the God of Israel had often 
 done by fire from heaven, or some other judgment against those who put 
 contempt upon him. Here is a fair challenge to Baal to <I>do either 
 good or evil,</I> and the result convinced his worshippers of their 
 folly in praying to one to help them that could not avenge himself; 
 after this Gideon remarkably prospered, and thereby it appeared how 
 unable Baal was to maintain his own cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Gideon's father hereupon gave him a new name 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>);

 he called him <I>Jerubbaal:</I> "Let Baal plead; let him plead against
 him if he can; if he have any thing to say for himself against his 
 destroyer, let him say it." This name was a standing defiance to Baal: 
 "Now that Gideon is taking up arms against the Midianites that worship 
 Baal, let him defend his worshippers if he can." It likewise gave 
 honour to Gideon (a sworn enemy to that great usurper, and that had 
 carried the day against him), that encouragement to his soldiers, that 
 they fought under one that fought for God against this great competitor 
 with him for the throne. It is the probable conjecture of the learned 
 that that Jerombalus whom Sanchoniathon (one of the most ancient of all 
 the heathen writers) speaks of as <I>a priest of the god Jao</I> (a 
 corruption of the name <I>Jehovah</I>), and one to whom he was indebted 
 for a great deal of knowledge, was this Jerubbaal. He is called 
 <I>Jerubbesheth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:12">2 Sam. xi. 12</A>),

 <I>Baal,</I> a <I>lord,</I> being fitly turned into <I>Besheth,
 shame.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>33 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children
 of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in
 the valley of Jezreel.
 &nbsp; 34 But the Spirit of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came upon Gideon, and he blew a
 trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.
 &nbsp; 35 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was
 gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto
 Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
 &nbsp; 36 And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine
 hand, as thou hast said,
 &nbsp; 37 Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; <I>and</I> if
 the dew be on the fleece only, and <I>it be</I> dry upon all the earth
 <I>beside,</I> then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine
 hand, as thou hast said.
 &nbsp; 38 And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and
 thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the
 fleece, a bowl full of water.
 &nbsp; 39 And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against
 me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee,
 but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the
 fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
 &nbsp; 40 And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece
 only, and there was dew on all the ground.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 I. The descent which the enemies of Israel made upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 A vast number of Midianites, Amalekites, and Arabians, got together,
 and came over Jordan, none either caring or daring to guard that 
 important and advantageous pass against them, and they made their 
 headquarters in the valley of Jezreel, in the heart of Manasseh's 
 tribe, not far from Gideon's city. Some think that the notice they had 
 of Gideon's destroying Baal's altar brought them over, and that they 
 came to plead for Baal and to make that a pretence for quarrelling with 
 Israel; but it is more likely that it was now harvest-time, when they 
 had been wont each year to make such a visit as this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and that they were expected when Gideon was threshing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 God raised up Gideon to be ready against this terrible blow came. Their
 success so many years in these incursions, the little opposition they 
 had met with and the great booty they had carried off, made them now 
 both very eager and very confident. But it proved that <I>the measure 
 of their iniquity was full</I> and the year of recompence had come; 
 they must now <I>make an end to spoil</I> and <I>must be spoiled,</I> 
 and they are <I>gathered as sheaves to the floor</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+4:12,13">Mic. iv. 12, 13</A>),
 
 for Gideon to thresh.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The preparation which Gideon makes to attack them in their camp, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>.

 1. God by his Spirit put life into Gideon: <I>The Spirit of the Lord
 clothes Gideon</I> (so the word is), clothed him as a robe, to put 
 honour upon him, clothed him as a coat of mail, to put defence upon 
 him. Those are well clad that are thus clothed. <I>A spirit of 
 fortitude from before the Lord clothed Gideon;</I> so the Chaldee. He 
 was of himself a mighty man of valour; yet personal strength and 
 courage, though vigorously exerted, would not suffice for this great 
 action; he must have the <I>armour of God</I> upon him, and this is 
 what he must depend upon: <I>The Spirit of the Lord clothed him</I> in 
 an extraordinary manner. Whom God calls to his work he will qualify and 
 animate for it.

 2. Gideon with his trumpet put life into his neighbours, God working
 with him; he <I>blew a trumpet,</I> to call in volunteers, and more 
 came in than perhaps he expected.

 (1.) The men of Abiezer, though lately enraged against him for throwing 
 down the altar of Baal, and though they had condemned him to death as a 
 criminal, were now convinced of their error, bravely came in to his 
 assistance, and submitted to him as their general: <I>Abiezer was 
 gathered after him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 So suddenly can God turn the hearts even of idolaters and persecutors.

 (2.) Distant tribes, even Asher and Naphtali, which lay most remote, 
 though strangers to him, obeyed his summons, and sent him in the best 
 of their forces, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 Though they lay furthest from the danger, yet, considering that if
 their neighbours were over-run by the Midianites their own turn would 
 be next, they were forward to join against a common enemy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The signs which God gratified him with, for the confirming both of 
 his own faith and that of his followers; and perhaps it was more for 
 their sakes than for his own that he desired them. Or, perhaps, he 
 desired by these to be satisfied whether this was the time of his 
 conquering the Midianites, or whether he was to wait for some other 
 opportunity. Observe,

 1. His request for a sign 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>):

 "Let me by this <I>know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand,</I> let
 <I>a fleece of wool,</I> spread in the open air, be <I>wet with the 
 dew,</I> and let the ground about it be dry." The purport of this is, 
 <I>Lord, I believe, help thou my unbelief.</I> He found his own faith 
 weak and wavering, and therefore begged of God by this sign to perfect 
 what was lacking in it.  We may suppose that God, who intended to give 
 him these signs, for the glorifying of his own power and goodness, put 
 it into his heart to ask them. Yet, when he repeated his request for a 
 second sign, the reverse of the former, he did it with a very humble 
 apology, deprecating God's displeasure, because it looked so like a 
 peevish humoursome distrust of God and dissatisfaction with the many 
 assurances he had already given him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 <I>Let not thy anger be hot against me.</I> Though he took the boldness
 to ask another sign, yet he did it with such fear and trembling as 
 showed that the familiarity God had graciously admitted him to did not 
 breed any contempt of God's glory, nor presumption on God's goodness. 
 Abraham had given him an example of this, when God gave him leave to be 
 very free with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:30,32">Gen. xviii. 30, 32</A>),

 <I>O let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak.</I> God's favour must
 be sought with great reverence, a due sense of our distance, and a 
 religious fear of his wrath.

 2. God's gracious grant of his request. See how tender God is of true
 believers though they be weak, and how ready to condescend to their 
 infirmities, that the bruised reed may not be broken nor the smoking 
 flax quenched. Gideon would have <I>the fleece wet</I> and the 
 <I>ground dry;</I> but then, lest any should object, "It is natural for 
 wool, if ever so little moisture fall, to drink it in and retain it, 
 and therefore there was nothing extraordinary in this," though the 
 quantity wrung out was sufficient to obviate such an objection, yet he 
 desires that next night the ground might be wet and the fleece dry, and 
 it is done, so willing is God to <I>give to the heirs of promise strong 
 consolation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:17,18">Heb. vi. 17, 18</A>),

 even by two immutable things. He suffers himself, not only to be
 prevailed with by their importunities, but even to be prescribed to by 
 their doubts and dissatisfactions.  These signs were,

 (1.) Truly miraculous, and therefore abundantly serving to confirm his 
 commission. It is said of the dew that it is <I>from the Lord,</I> and
 <I>tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:7">Micah v. 7</A>);

 and yet God here in this matter <I>hearkened to the voice of a man;</I>
 as to Joshua, in directing the course of the sun, so to Gideon in 
 directing that of the dew, by which it appears that it falls not by 
 chance, but by providence. The latter sign inverted the former, and, to 
 please Gideon, it was wrought backward and forward, whence Dr. Fuller 
 observes that <I>heaven's real miracles will endure turning, being 
 inside and outside both alike.</I>

 (2.) Very significant. He and his men were going to engage the 
 Midianites; could God distinguish between a small fleece of Israel and 
 the vast floor of Midian? Yes, by this he is made to know that he can. 
 Is Gideon desirous that the dew of divine grace might descend upon 
 himself in particular? He sees the fleece wet with dew to assure him of 
 it. Does he desire that God will be as the dew to all Israel? Behold, 
 all the ground is wet. Some make this fleece an emblem of the Jewish 
 nation, which, when time was, was wet with the dew of God's word and 
 ordinances, while the rest of the world was dry; but since the 
 rejection of Christ and his gospel they are dry <I>as the heath in the 
 wilderness,</I> while the nations about are <I>as a watered 
 garden.</I></P>
