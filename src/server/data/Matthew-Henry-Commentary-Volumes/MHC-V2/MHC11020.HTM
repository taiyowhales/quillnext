 This chapter is the history of a war between Ben-hadad king of Syria 
 and Ahab king of Israel, in which Ahab was, once and again, victorious. 
 We read nothing of Elijah or Elishain all this story; Jezebel's rage, 
 it is probable, had abated, and the persecution of the prophets began 
 to cool, which gleam of peace Elijah improved. He appeared not at 
 court, but, being told how many thousands of good people there were in 
 Israel more than he thought of, employed himself, as we may suppose, in 
 founding religious houses, schools, or colleges of prophets, in several 
 parts of the country, to be nurseries of religion, that they might help 
 to reform the nation when the throne and court would not be reformed. 
 While he was thus busied, God favoured the nation with the successes we 
 here read of, which were the more remarkable because obtained against 
 Ben-hadad king of Syria, whose successor, Hazael, was ordained to be a 
 scourge to Israel. They must shortly suffer by the Syrians, and yet now 
 triumphed over them, that, if possible, they might be led to repentance 
 by the goodness of God. Here is, 

 I. Ben-hadad's descent upon Israel, and his insolent demand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. The defeat Ahab gave him, encouraged and directed by a prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:12-21">ver. 12-21</A>.

 III. The Syrians rallying again, and the second defeat Ahab gave them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:22-30">ver. 22-30</A>.

 IV. The covenant of peace Ahab made with Ben-hadad, when he had him at
 his mercy 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:31-34">ver. 31-34</A>),

 for which he is reproved and threatened by a prophet,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host
 together: and <I>there were</I> thirty and two kings with him, and
 horses, and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and
 warred against it.
 &nbsp; 2 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city,
 and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,
 &nbsp; 3 Thy silver and thy gold <I>is</I> mine; thy wives also and thy
 children, <I>even</I> the goodliest, <I>are</I> mine.
 &nbsp; 4 And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,
 according to thy saying, I <I>am</I> thine, and all that I have.
 &nbsp; 5 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh
 Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou
 shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy
 children;
 &nbsp; 6 Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this
 time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy
 servants; and it shall be, <I>that</I> whatsoever is pleasant in thine
 eyes, they shall put <I>it</I> in their hand, and take <I>it</I> away.
 &nbsp; 7 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land,
 and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this <I>man</I> seeketh
 mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children,
 and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.
 &nbsp; 8 And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken
 not <I>unto him,</I> nor consent.
 &nbsp; 9 Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my
 lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the
 first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers
 departed, and brought him word again.
 &nbsp; 10 And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto
 me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for
 handfuls for all the people that follow me.
 &nbsp; 11 And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell <I>him,</I> Let
 not him that girdeth on <I>his harness</I> boast himself as he that
 putteth it off.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The threatening descent which Ben-hadad made upon Ahab's kingdom, 
 and the siege he laid to Samaria, his royal city,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 What the ground of the quarrel was we are not told; covetousness and
 ambition were the principle, which would never want some pretence or 
 other. David in his time had quite subdued the Syrians and made them 
 tributaries to Israel, but Israel's apostasy from God makes them 
 formidable again. Asa had tempted the Syrians to invade Israel once

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:18-20"><I>ch.</I> xv. 18-20</A>),

 and now they did it of their own accord. It is dangerous bringing a
 foreign force into the country: posterity may pay dearly for it. 
 Ben-hadad had with him thirty-two kings, who were either tributaries to 
 him, and bound in duty to attend him, or confederates with him, and 
 bound in interest to assist him. How little did the title of king look 
 when all these poor petty governors pretended to it!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The treaty between these two kings. Surely Israel's defence had 
 departed from them, or else the Syrians could not have marched so 
 readily, and with so little opposition, to Samaria, the head and heart 
 of the country, a city lately built, and therefore, we may suppose, not 
 well fortified, but likely to fall quickly into the hands of the 
 invaders; both sides are aware of this, and therefore,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Ben-hadad's proud spirit sends Ahab a very insolent demand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.
 
 A parley is sounded, and a trumpeter (we may suppose) is sent into the
 city, to let Ahab know that he will raise the siege upon condition that
 Ahab become his vassal (Nay, his <I>villain</I>), and not only pay him
 a tribute out of what he has, but make over his title to Ben-hadad, and 
 hold all at his will, even his wives and children, the godliest of 
 them. The manner of expression is designed to gall them; "All shall be 
 mine, without exception."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Ahab's poor spirit sends Ben-hadad a very disgraceful submission. It 
 is general indeed (he cannot mention particulars in his surrender with 
 so much pleasure as Ben-hadad did in his demand), but it is effectual: 
 <I>I am thine, and all that I have,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 See the effect of sin.
 
 (1.) If he had not by sin provoked God to depart from him, Ben-hadad
 could not have made such a demand. Sin brings men into such straits, by 
 putting them out of divine protection. If God may not rule us, our 
 enemies shall. A rebel to God is a slave to all besides. Ahab had
 prepared his silver and gold for Baal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:8">Hos. ii. 8</A>.

 Justly therefore is it taken from him; such an alienating amounts to a
 forfeiture.

 (2.) If he had not by sin wronged his own conscience, and set that
 against him, he could not have made such a mean surrender. Guilt 
 dispirits men, and makes them cowards. He knew Baal could not help, and 
 had no reason to think that God would, and therefore was content to buy 
 his life upon any terms. Skin for skin, and all that is dear to him, he 
 will give for it; he will rather live a beggar than not die a 
 prince.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Ben-hadad's proud spirit rises upon his submission, and becomes yet 
 more insolent and imperious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 Ahab had laid his all at his feet, at his mercy, expecting that one
 king would use another generously, that this acknowledgment of 
 Ben-hadad's sovereignty would content him, the honour was sufficient 
 for the present, and he might hereafter make use of it if he saw cause 
 (<I>Satis est prostrasse leoni</I>--<I>It suffices the lion to have 
 laid his victim prostrate</I>); but this will not serve.

 (1.) Ben-hadad is as covetous as he is proud, and cannot go away unless
 he have the possession as well as the dominion. He thinks it not enough 
 to call it his, unless he have it in his hands. He will not so much as 
 lend Ahab the use of his own goods above a day longer.

 (2.) He is as spiteful as he is haughty. Had he come himself to select
 what he had a mind for, it would have shown some respect to a crowned 
 head; but he will send his servants to insult the prince, and hector 
 over him, to rifle the palace, and strip it of all its ornaments; nay, 
 to give Ahab the more vexation, they shall be ordered, not only to take 
 what they please, but, if they can learn which are the persons or 
 things that Ahab is in a particular manner fond of, to take those: 
 <I>Whatsoever is pleasant in thy eyes they shall take away.</I> We are 
 often crossed in that which we most dote upon; and that proves least 
 safe which is most dear.

 (3.) He is as unreasonable as he is unjust, and will construe the
 surrender Ahab made for himself as made for all his subjects too, and 
 will have them also to lie at his mercy: "They shall search, not only 
 thy house, but <I>the houses of thy servants</I> too, and plunder them 
 at discretion." Blessed be God for peace and property, and that what we 
 have we can call our own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Ahab's poor spirit begins to rise too, upon this growing insolence; 
 and, if it becomes not bold, yet it becomes desperate, and he will 
 rather hazard his life than give up all thus. 

 (1.) How he takes advice of his privy-council, who encourage him to
 stand it out. He speaks but poorly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 appeals to them whether Ben-hadad be not an unreasonable enemy, and do
 not seek mischief. What else could he expect from one who, without any 
 provocation given him, had invaded his country and besieged his capital 
 city? He owns to them how he had truckled to him before, and will have 
 them advise him what he should do in this strait; and they speak 
 bravely (<I>Hearken not to him, nor consent,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 promising no doubt to stand by him in the refusal.

 (2.) Yet he expresses himself very modestly in his denial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He owns Ben-hadad's dominion over him: "<I>Tell my lord the king</I> I
 have no design to affront him, nor to receded from the surrender I have 
 already made; what I offered at first I will stand to, <I>but this 
 thing I may not do;</I> I must not give what is none of my own." It was 
 a mortification to Ben-hadad that even such an abject spirit as Ahab's 
 durst deny him; yet it should seem, by his manner of expressing 
 himself, that he durst not have done it if his people had not animated 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Ben-hadad proudly swears the ruin of Samaria. The threatening waves 
 of his wrath, meeting with this check, rage and foam, and make a noise. 
 In his fury, he imprecates the impotent revenge of his gods, <I>if the 
 dust of Samaria serve for handfuls for his army</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 so numerous, so resolute, an army will be bring into the field against
 Samaria, and so confident is he of their success; it will be done as 
 easily as the taking up of a handful of dust; all shall be carried 
 away, even the ground on which the city stands. Thus confident is his 
 pride, thus cruel is his malice; this prepares him to be ruined, though 
 such a prince and such a people are unworthy of the satisfaction of 
 seeing him ruined.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Ahab sends him a decent rebuke to his assurance, dares not defy his 
 menaces, only reminds him of the uncertain turns of war 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "Let not him that begins a war, and is girding on his sword, his
 armour, his harness, boast of victory, or think himself sure of it, 
 <I>as if he had put it off,</I> and had come home a conqueror." This 
 was one of the wisest words that ever Ahab spoke, and is a good item or 
 momento to us all; it is folly to boast beforehand of any day, since we 
 know not what it may bring forth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:1">Prov. xxvii. 1</A>),

 but especially to boast of a day of battle, which may prove as much
 against us as we promise ourselves it will be for us. It is impolitic 
 to despise an enemy, and to be too sure of victory is the way to be 
 beaten. Apply it to our spiritual conflicts. Peter fell by his 
 confidence. While we are here we are but girding on the harness, and 
 therefore must never boast as though we had put it off. <I>Happy is the 
 man that feareth always,</I> and is never off his watch.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And it came to pass, when <I>Benhadad</I> heard this message, as
 he <I>was</I> drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he
 said unto his servants, Set <I>yourselves in array.</I> And they set
 <I>themselves in array</I> against the city.
 &nbsp; 13 And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,
 saying, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Hast thou seen all this great
 multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day;
 and thou shalt know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 14 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 <I>Even</I> by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he
 said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.
 &nbsp; 15 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the
 provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after
 them he numbered all the people, <I>even</I> all the children of
 Israel, <I>being</I> seven thousand.
 &nbsp; 16 And they went out at noon. But Benhadad <I>was</I> drinking
 himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and
 two kings that helped him.
 &nbsp; 17 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out
 first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There
 are men come out of Samaria.
 &nbsp; 18 And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them
 alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.
 &nbsp; 19 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out
 of the city, and the army which followed them.
 &nbsp; 20 And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and
 Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an
 horse with the horsemen.
 &nbsp; 21 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and
 chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The treaty between the besiegers and the besieged being broken off 
 abruptly, we have here an account of the battle that ensued 
 immediately.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The Syrians, the besiegers, had their directions from a drunken 
 king, who gave orders over his cups, as he was <I>drinking</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 <I>drinking himself drunk</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 <I>with the kings in the pavilions,</I> and this at noon. Drunkenness
 is a sin which armies and their officers have of old been addicted to. 
 Say not thou then that the former days were, in this respect, better 
 than these, though these are bad enough. Had he not been very secure he 
 would not have sat to drink; and, had he not been intoxicated, he would 
 not have been so very secure. Security and sensuality went together in 
 the old world, and Sodom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:26-29">Luke xvii. 26</A>,

 &c. Ben-hadad's drunkenness was the forerunner of his
 fall, as Belshazzar's was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:1-31">Dan v</A>.

 How could he prosper that preferred his pleasure before his business,
 and kept his kings to drink with him when they should have been at 
 their respective posts to fight for him? In his drink,

 1. He orders the town to be invested, the engines fixed, and every
 thing got ready for the making of a general attack

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),
 
 but stirs not from his drunken club to see it done. <I>Woe unto thee, O
 land! when thy king is</I> such <I>a child.</I> 

 2. When the besieged made a sally (and, by that time, he was far gone)
 he gave orders to take them alive

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 not to kill them, which might have been done more easily and safely,
 but to seize them, which gave them an opportunity of killing the 
 aggressors; so imprudent was he in the orders he gave, as well as 
 unjust, in ordering them to be taken prisoners though they came for 
 peace and to renew the treaty. Thus, as is usual, he drinks, and 
 forgets the law, both the policies and the justice of war.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The Israelites, the besieged, had their directions from an inspired 
 prophet, one of the prophets of the Lord, whom Ahab had hated and 
 persecuted: <I>And behold a prophet, even one, drew near to the king of 
 Israel;</I> so it may be read, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Behold, and wonder, that God should send a prophet with a kind and 
 gracious message to so wicked a prince as Ahab was; but he did it, 

 (1.) For his people Israel's sake, who, though wickedly degenerated,
 were the seed of Abraham his friend and Jacob his chosen, the children 
 of the covenant, and not yet cast off.

 (2.) That he might magnify his mercy, in doing good to one so evil and
 unthankful, might either bring him to repentance or leave him the more 
 inexcusable.

 (3.) That he might mortify the pride of Ben-hadad and check his
 insolence. Ahab's idolatry shall be punished hereafter, but Ben-hadad's 
 haughtiness shall be chastised now; for God resists the proud, and is 
 pleased to say that <I>he fears the wrath of the enemy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:26,27">Deut. xxxii. 26, 27</A>.

 There was but one prophet perhaps to be had in Samaria, and he drew
 near with this message, intimating that he had been forced to keep at a 
 distance. Ahab, in his prosperity, would not have borne the sight of
 him, but now he bids him welcome, when none of the prophets of the 
 groves can give him any assistance. He enquired not for a prophet of 
 the Lord, but God sent one to him unasked, for he waits to be 
 gracious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Two things the prophet does:--

 (1.) He animates Ahab with an assurance of victory, which was more than
 all the elders of Israel could give him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 though they promised to stand by him. This prophet, who is not named
 (for he <I>spoke in God's name</I>), tells him from God that this very
 day the siege shall be raised, and the army of the Syrians routed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 When the prophet said, <I>Thus saith the Lord,</I> we may suppose Ahab
 began to tremble, expecting a message of wrath; but he is revived when 
 it proves a gracious one. He is informed what use he ought to make of 
 this blessed turn of affairs: "<I>Thou shalt know that I am 
 Jehovah,</I> the sovereign Lord of all." God's foretelling a thing that 
 was so very unlikely proved that it was his own doing.

 (2.) He instructs him what to do for the gaining of this victory. 

 [1.] He must not stay till the enemy attacked him, but must sally out
 upon them and surprise them in their trenches. 

 [2.] The persons employed must be the <I>young men of the princes of
 the provinces,</I> the pages, the footmen, who were few in number, only 
 232, utterly unacquainted with war, and the unlikeliest men that could 
 be thought of for such a bold attempt; yet these must do it, these weak 
 and foolish things must be instruments of confounding the wise and 
 strong, that, while Ben-hadad's boasting is punished, Ahab's may be 
 prevented and precluded, and the <I>excellency of the power may appear 
 to be of God.</I> 

 [3.] Ahab must himself so far testify his confidence in the word of God
 as to command in person, though, in the eye of reason, he exposed 
 himself to the utmost danger by it. But it is fit that those who have 
 the benefit of God's promises should enter upon them. Yet, 

 [4.] He is allowed to make use of what other forces he has at hand, to
 follow the blow, when these young men have broken the ice. All he had
 in Samaria, or within call, were but 7000 men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It is observable that it is the same number with theirs that he not
 <I>bowed the knee to Baal</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:18"><I>ch.</I> xix. 18</A>),
 
 though, it is likely, not the same men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The issue was accordingly. The proud Syrians were beaten, and the 
 poor despised Israelites were more than conquerors. The young men gave 
 an alarm to the Syrians just at noon, at high dinner-time, supported by 
 what little force they had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Ben-hadad despised them at first
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 but when they had, with unparalleled bravery and dexterity, <I>slain
 every one his man,</I> and so put the army into disorder, that proud 
 man durst not face them, but mounted immediately, drunk as he was, and 
 made the best of his way, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 See how God <I>takes away the spirit of princes,</I> and makes himself
 <I>terrible to the kings of the earth.</I> Now where are the silver and 
 gold he demanded of Ahab? Where are the handfuls of Samaria's dust?
 Those that are most secure are commonly least courageous. Ahab failed 
 not to improve this advantage, but <I>slew the Syrians with a great 
 slaughter,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22 And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto
 him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest:
 for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up
 against thee.
 &nbsp; 23 And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their
 gods <I>are</I> gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than
 we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we
 shall be stronger than they.
 &nbsp; 24 And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his
 place, and put captains in their rooms:
 &nbsp; 25 And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost,
 horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight
 against them in the plain, <I>and</I> surely we shall be stronger than
 they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.
 &nbsp; 26 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad
 numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 27 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all
 present, and went against them: and the children of Israel
 pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the
 Syrians filled the country.
 &nbsp; 28 And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of
 Israel, and said, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Because the Syrians have
 said, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> God of the hills, but he <I>is</I> not God of the
 valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into
 thine hand, and ye shall know that I <I>am</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 29 And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And
 <I>so</I> it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and
 the children of Israel slew of the Syrians a hundred thousand
 footmen in one day.
 &nbsp; 30 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and <I>there</I> a
 wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men <I>that were</I>
 left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner
 chamber.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of another successful campaign which Ahab, by 
 divine aid, made against the Syrians, in which he gave them a greater 
 defeat than in the former. Strange! Ahab idolatrous and yet victorious, 
 a persecutor and yet a conqueror! God has wise and holy ends in 
 suffering wicked men to prosper, and glorifies his own name 
 thereby.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Ahab is admonished by a prophet to prepare for another war, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 It should seem, he was now secure, and looked but a little way before
 him. Those that are careless of their souls are often as careless of 
 their outwards affairs; but the prophet (to whom God made known the 
 following counsels of the Syrians) told him they would renew their 
 attempt at the return of the year, hoping to retrieve the honour they 
 had lost and be avenged for the blow they had received. He therefore 
 bade him strengthen himself, put himself into a posture of defence, and 
 be ready to give them a warm reception. God had decreed the end, but 
 Ahab must use the means, else he tempts God: "Help thyself, strengthen 
 thyself, and God will help and strengthen thee." The enemies of God's 
 Israel are restless in their malice, and, though they may take some 
 breathing-time for themselves, yet they are still <I>breathing out 
 threatenings and slaughter</I> against the church. It concerns us 
 always to expect assaults from our spiritual enemies, and therefore to 
 mark and see what we do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Ben-hadad is advised by those about him concerning the operations 
 of the next campaign. 

 1. They advised him to <I>change his ground,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 They took it for granted that it was not Israel, but Israel's gods,
 that beat them (so great a regard was then universally had to invisible 
 powers); but they speak very ignorantly of Jehovah--that he was 
 <I>many,</I> whereas he is one and his name one,--that he was 
 <I>their</I> God only, a local deity, peculiar to that nation, whereas 
 he is the Creator and ruler of all the world,--and that he was a God 
 <I>of the hills</I> only, because David their great prophet had said, 
 <I>I will lift up my eyes to the hills whence cometh my help</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+121:1">Ps. cxxi. 1</A>),
 
 and that <I>his foundation was in the holy mountain</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:1,Ps+78:54">Ps. lxxxvii. 1; lxxviii. 54</A>),
 
 and much was said of his <I>holy hill</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+15:1,24:3">Ps. xv. 1; xxiv. 3</A>);

 supposing him altogether such a one as their imaginary deities, they
 fancied he was confined to his hills, and could not or would not come 
 down from them, and therefore an army in the valley would be below his 
 cognizance and from under his protection. Thus vain were the 
 <I>Gentiles in their imaginations</I> concerning God, so wretchedly 
 were <I>their foolish hearts darkened,</I> and, <I>professing 
 themselves to be wise, they became fools.</I> 

 2. They advised him to change his officers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>),

 not to employ the kings, who were commanders by birth, but captains
 rather, who were commanders by merit, who were inured to war, would not 
 affect to make a show like the kings, but would go through with 
 business. Let every man be employed in that which he is brought up to 
 and used to, and preferred to that which he is fit for. Syria, it 
 seems, was rich and populous, when it could furnish recruits 
 sufficient, after so great a defeat, <I>horse for horse, chariot for 
 chariot.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Both armies take the field. Ben-hadad, with his Syrians, encamps 
 near Aphek, in the tribe of Asher. It is probable that Asher was a city 
 in his own possession, one of those which his father had won 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),
 
 and the country about it was flat and level, and fit for his purpose,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Ahab, with his forces, posted himself at some distance over against
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 The disproportion of numbers was very remarkable. <I>The children of
 Israel,</I> who were cantoned in two battalions, looked like <I>two 
 little flocks of kids,</I> their numbers small, their equipage mean, 
 and the figure they made contemptible; <I>but the Syrians filled the 
 country</I> with their numbers, their noise, their chariots, their 
 carriages, and their baggage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Ahab is encouraged to fight the Syrians, notwithstanding their 
 advantages and confidence. A man of God is sent to him, to tell him 
 that this numerous army shall <I>all be delivered into his hand</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 but not for his sake; be it known to him, he is utterly unworthy for
 whom God will do this. God would not do it because Ahab had praised God 
 or prayed to him (we do not read that he did either), but because the 
 Syrians had blasphemed God, and had said, He is <I>the God of the hills 
 and not of the valleys;</I> therefore God will do it in his own 
 vindication, and to preserve the honour of his own name. If the Syrians 
 had said, "Ahab and his people have forgotten their God, and so put 
 themselves out of his protection, and therefore we may venture to 
 attack them," God would probably have delivered Israel into their 
 hands; but when they go upon a presumption so very injurious to the 
 divine omnipotence, and the honour of him who is Lord of all hosts, not 
 only in hills and valleys, but in heaven and earth, which they are 
 willingly ignorant of, they shall be undeceived, at the expense of that 
 vast army which is so much their pride and confidence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. After the armies had faced one another seven days (the Syrians, it 
 is likely, boasting, and the Israelites trembling), they engaged, and 
 the Syrians were totally routed, 100,000 men slain by the sword of 
 Israel in the field of battle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 and 27,000 men, that thought themselves safe <I>under the walls of
 Aphek,</I> a fortified city (from the walls of which the shooters might 
 annoy the enemy if they pursued them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+11:24">2 Sam. xi. 24</A>),

 found their bane where they hoped for protection: the wall fell upon
 them, probably overthrown by an earthquake, and, the cities of Canaan 
 being walled up to heaven, it reached a great way, and they were all 
 killed, or hurt, or overwhelmed with dismay. Ben-hadad, who thought his 
 city Aphek would hold out against the conquerors, finding it thus 
 unwalled, and the remnant of his forces dispirited and dispersed, had 
 nothing but secresy to rely upon for safety, and therefore hid himself 
 in <I>a chamber within a chamber,</I> lest the pursuers should seize 
 him. See how the greatest confidence often ends in the greatest 
 cowardice. "Now is the God of Israel the <I>God of the valleys</I> or 
 no?" He shall know now that he is forced <I>into an inner chamber to 
 hide himself,</I> see

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31 And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard
 that the kings of the house of Israel <I>are</I> merciful kings: let
 us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our
 heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will
 save thy life.
 &nbsp; 32 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and <I>put</I> ropes on
 their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy
 servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said,
 <I>Is</I> he yet alive? he <I>is</I> my brother.
 &nbsp; 33 Now the men did diligently observe whether <I>any thing would
 come</I> from him, and did hastily catch <I>it:</I> and they said, Thy
 brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad
 came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
 &nbsp; 34 And <I>Benhadad</I> said unto him, The cities, which my father
 took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets
 for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then <I>said
 Ahab,</I> I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a
 covenant with him, and sent him away.
 &nbsp; 35 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his
 neighbour in the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Smite me, I pray thee. And the
 man refused to smite him.
 &nbsp; 36 Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the
 voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me,
 a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him,
 a lion found him, and slew him.
 &nbsp; 37 Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee.
 And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 38 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way,
 and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.
 &nbsp; 39 And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he
 said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and,
 behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said,
 Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life
 be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
 &nbsp; 40 And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And
 the king of Israel said unto him, So <I>shall</I> thy judgment <I>be;</I>
 thyself hast decided <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 41 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and
 the king of Israel discerned him that he <I>was</I> of the prophets.
 &nbsp; 42 And he said unto him, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Because thou hast
 let go out of <I>thy</I> hand a man whom I appointed to utter
 destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy
 people for his people.
 &nbsp; 43 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and
 displeased, and came to Samaria.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is an account of what followed upon the victory which Israel 
 obtained over the Syrians.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Ben-hadad's tame and mean submission. Even in his inner chamber he 
 feared, and would, if he could, flee further, though none pursued. His 
 servants, seeing him and themselves reduced to the last extremity, 
 advised that they should surrender at discretion, and make themselves 
 prisoners and petitioners to Ahab for their lives, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 The servants will put their lives in their hands, and venture first,
 and their master will act according as they speed. Their inducement to 
 take this course is the great reputation the kings of Israel had for 
 clemency above any of their neighbours: "We have heard that they are 
 merciful kings, not oppressive to their subjects that are under their 
 power" (as governments then went, that of Israel was one of the most 
 easy and gentle), "and therefore not cruel to their enemies when they 
 lie at their mercy." Perhaps they had this notion of the kings of 
 Israel because they had heard that the God of Israel proclaimed his 
 name <I>gracious and merciful,</I> and they concluded their kings would 
 make their God their pattern. It was an honour to the kings of Israel 
 to be thus represented, as indeed every Israelite is then dressed as 
 becomes him when he <I>puts on bowels of mercies.</I> "They are 
 merciful kings, therefore we may hope to find mercy upon our 
 submission." This encouragement poor sinners have to repent and humble 
 themselves before God. "Have we not heard that the God of Israel is a 
 merciful God? Have we not found him so? Let us therefore rend our 
 hearts and return to him." 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:13">Joel ii. 13</A>.

 That is evangelical repentance which flows from an apprehension of the
 mercy of God in Christ; <I>there is forgiveness with him.</I> Two 
 things Ben-hadad's servants undertake to represent to Ahab:--

 1. Their master a penitent; for they <I>girded sackcloth on their
 loins,</I> as mourners, and <I>put ropes on their heads,</I> as 
 condemned criminals going to execution, pretending to be sorry that 
 they had invaded his country and disturbed his repose, and owning that 
 they deserved to be hanged for it. Here they are ready to do penance 
 for it, and throw themselves at the feet of him whom they had injured.
 Many pretend to repent of their wrong-doing, when it does not succeed, 
 who, if they had prospered in it, would have justified it and gloried 
 in it. 

 2. Their master a beggar, a beggar for his life: <I>Thy servant
 Ben-hadad saith, "I pray thee, let me live,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Though I live a perpetual exile from my own country, and captive in
 this, yet, upon any terms, <I>let me live.</I>" What a great change is 
 here,

 (1.) In his condition! How has he fallen from the height of power and 
 prosperity to the depths of disgrace and distress, and all the miseries 
 of poverty and slavery! See the uncertainty of human affairs; such 
 turns are they subject to that the spoke which was uppermost may soon 
 come to be undermost.

 (2.) In his temper--in the beginning of the chapter hectoring, 
 swearing, and threatening, and none more high in his demands, but here 
 crouching and whining and none more low in his requests! How meanly 
 does he beg hi life at the hand of him upon whom he had there been 
 trampling! The most haughty in prosperity are commonly most abject in 
 adversity: an even spirit will be the same in both conditions. See how 
 God glorified himself when he <I>looks upon proud men and abases them, 
 and hides them in the dust together,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:11-13">Job xl. 11-13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Ahab's foolish acceptance of his submission, and the league he
 suddenly made with him upon it. He was proud to be thus courted by him
 whom he had feared, and enquired for him with great tenderness: <I>Is
 he yet alive? He is my brother,</I> brother-king, though not
 brother-Israelite: and Ahab valued himself more upon his royalty than
 on his religion, and others accordingly. "<I>Is he thy brother,
 Ahab?</I> Did he use thee like a brother when he sent thee that
 barbarous message?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 Would he have called thee brother if he had been the conqueror? Would
 he now have called himself <I>thy servant</I> if he had not been 
 reduced to the utmost strait? Canst thou suffer thyself to be thus 
 imposed upon by a forced and counterfeit submission?" This word 
 <I>brother</I> they caught at

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 and were thereby encouraged to go and fetch him to the king. He that
 calls him <I>brother</I> will let him live. Let poor penitents hear 
 God, in his word, calling them <I>children</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:20">Jer. xxxi. 20</A>),

 catch at it, echo to it, and call him <I>Father.</I> Ben-hadad, upon
 his submission, shall not only be honourably conveyed (he <I>took him 
 up into the chariot</I>), but treated with as an ally

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 he <I>made a covenant with him,</I> not consulting God's prophets, or
 the elders of the land, or himself, concerning what was fit to be 
 insisted on, but, as if Ben-hadad had been conqueror, he shall make his 
 own terms. He might now have demanded some of Ben-hadad's cities, when 
 all of them lay at the mercy of his victorious army; but was content 
 with the restitution of his own. He might now have demanded the stores, 
 and treasures, and magazines of Damascus, to augment the wealth and 
 strength of his own kingdom, but was content with a poor liberty, at 
 his own expense, to build streets there, a point of honour and no 
 advantage, or no more than what the kings of Syria had had in Samaria, 
 though they had never had so much power as he had now to support the 
 demand of it. With this covenant he sent him away, without so much as 
 reproving him for his blasphemous reflections upon the God of Israel, 
 for whose honour Ahab had no concern. Note, There are those on whom 
 success is ill bestowed; they know not how to serve God, or their 
 generation, or even their own true interests, with their prosperity.
 <I>Let favour be shown to the wicked, yet will he not learn 
 righteousness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The reproof given to Ahab for his clemency to Ben-hadad and his 
 covenant with him. It was given him by a prophet, in the name of the 
 Lord, the Jews say by Micaiah, and not unlikely, for Ahab complains of 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:8"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 8</A>)

 that he used to <I>prophesy evil concerning him.</I> This prophet
 designed to reprove Ahab by a parable, that he might oblige him to 
 condemn himself, as Nathan and the woman of Tekoa did David. To make 
 his parable the more plausible, he finds it necessary to put himself 
 into the posture of a wounded soldier. 

 1. With some difficulty he gets himself wounded, for he would not wound
 himself with his own hands. He commanded one of his brother prophets, 
 his <I>neighbour,</I> or <I>companion</I> (for so the word signifies), 
 to smite him, and this in God's name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 but finds him not so willing to give the blow as he is to receive it;
 he refused to smite him: others, he thought, were forward enough to 
 smite prophets, they need not smite one another. We cannot but think it 
 was from a good principle he declined it. "If it must be done, let 
 another do it, not I; I cannot find it in my heart to strike my 
 friend." Good men can much more easily receive a wrongful blow than 
 give one; yet because he disobeyed an express command of God (which was 
 so much the worse if he was himself a prophet), like that other 
 disobedient prophet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:24"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 24</A>),

 he was presently <I>slain by a lion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 This was intended, not only to show, in general, how provoking
 disobedience is

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:6">Col. iii. 6</A>),

 but to intimate to Ahab (who no doubt was told the story) that if a
 good prophet were thus punished for sparing his friend and God's, when 
 God said, <I>Smite,</I> of much sorer punishment should a wicked king 
 be thought worthy, who spared his enemy and God's, when God said, 
 <I>Smite. Shall mortal man</I> pretend to <I>be more just than God, 
 more pure</I> or more compassionate <I>than his Maker?</I> We must be 
 merciful as he is merciful, and not otherwise. The next he met with 
 made no difficulty of smiting him (<I>Volentinon fit injuria</I>--<I>He 
 that asks for an injury is not wronged by it</I>) and did it so that he 
 <I>wounded him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 He fetched blood with the blow, probably in his face.

 2. Wounded as he was, and disguised with ashes that he might not be
 known to be a prophet, he made his application to the king in a story 
 wherein he charged himself with such a crime as the king was now guilty 
 of in sparing Ben-hadad, and waited for the king's judgment upon it. 
 The case in short is this--A prisoner taken in the battle was committed 
 to his custody by a man (we may suppose one that had authority over him 
 as his superior officer) with this charge, <I>If he be missing, thy 
 life shall be for his life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 The prisoner has made his escape through his carelessness. Can the
 chancery in the king's breast relieve him against his captain, who 
 demands his life in lieu of the prisoner's? "By no means," says the 
 king, "thou shouldst either not have undertaken the trust or been more 
 careful and faithful to it; there is no remedy (<I>Currat 
 lex</I>--<I>Let the law take its course</I>), thou hast forfeited thy
 bond, and execution must go out upon it: <I>So shall thy doom be, thou 
 thyself hast decided it.</I>" Now the prophet has what he would have, 
 puts off his disguise, and is known by Ahab himself to be a prophet

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>)

 and plainly tells him, "<I>Thou art the man.</I> Is it <I>my</I> doom?
 No, it is <I>thine; thou thyself hast decided it.</I> Out of thy own 
 mouth art thou judged. God, thy superior and commander-in-chief,
 delivered into thy hands one plainly marked for destruction both by his 
 own pride and God's providence, and thou hast not carelessly lost him, 
 but wittingly and willingly dismissed him, and so hast been false to 
 thy trust, and lost the end of thy victory; expect therefore no other 
 than that <I>thy life shall go for his life,</I> which thou hast 
 spared" (and so it did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:35"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 35</A>),

 "and thy <I>people for his people,</I> whom likewise thou hast spared,"
 and so they did afterwards,
