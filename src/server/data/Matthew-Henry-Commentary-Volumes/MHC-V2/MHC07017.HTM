 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All agree that what is related in this and the rest of the chapters to 
 the end of this book was not done, as the narrative occurs, after 
 Samson, but long before, even soon after the death of Joshua, in the 
 days of Phinehas the son of Eleazar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:28"><I>ch.</I> xx. 28</A>.

 But it is cast here into the latter part of the book that it might not
 interrupt the history of the Judges. That it might appear how happy the 
 nation was in the judges it is here shown how unhappy they were when 
 there was none.  
 
 I. Then idolatry began in the family of Micah,

 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:1-13"><I>ch.</I> xvii</A>.

 II. Then it spread itself into the tribe of Dan,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:1-31"><I>ch.</I> xviii</A>.

 III. Then villany was committed in Gibeah of Benjamin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:1-30"><I>ch.</I> xix</A>.

 IV. Then that whole tribe was destroyed for countenancing it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:1-48"><I>ch.</I> xx</A>.

 V. Then strange expedients were adopted to keep up that tribe,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+21:1-25"><I>ch.</I> xxi</A>.

 Therefore blessed be God for the government we are under! In this
 chapter we are told how Micah an Ephraimite furnished himself, 

 1. With an image for his god,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 2.  With a Levite, such a one as he was, for his priest,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name <I>was</I> Micah.
 &nbsp; 2 And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred <I>shekels</I> of
 silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and
 spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver <I>is</I> with me; I
 took it. And his mother said, Blessed <I>be thou</I> of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, my
 son.
 &nbsp; 3 And when he had restored the eleven hundred <I>shekels</I> of
 silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the
 silver unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> from my hand for my son, to make a graven
 image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto
 thee.
 &nbsp; 4 Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother
 took two hundred <I>shekels</I> of silver, and gave them to the
 founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and
 they were in the house of Micah.
 &nbsp; 5 And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod,
 and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his
 priest.
 &nbsp; 6 In those days <I>there was</I> no king in Israel, <I>but</I> every man
 did <I>that which was</I> right in his own eyes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 
 
 I. Micah and his mother quarrelling. 

 1. The son robs the mother. The old woman had hoarded, with long 
 scraping and saving, a great sum of money, 1100 pieces of silver. It is 
 likely she intended, when she died, to leave it to her son: in the mean 
 time it did her good to look upon it, and to count it over. The young 
 man had a family of children grown up, for he had one of age to be a 
 priest,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He knows where to find his mother's cash, thinks he has more need of it 
 than she has, cannot stay till she dies, and so takes it away privately 
 for his own use. Though it is a fault in parents to withhold from their 
 children that which is meet, and lead them into temptation to wish them 
 in their graves, yet even this will by no means excuse the wickedness 
 of those children that steal from their parents, and think all their 
 own that they can get from them, though by the most indirect methods.  
 
 2. The mother curses the son, or whoever had taken her money. It should 
 seem she suspected her son; for, when she cursed, she spoke in his cars 
 so loud, and with so much passion and vehemence, as made both his ears 
 to tingle. See what mischief the love of money makes, how it destroys 
 the duty and comfort of every relation. It was the love of money that 
 made Micah so undutiful to his mother as to rob her, and made her so 
 unkind and void of natural affection to her son as to curse him if he 
 had it and concealed it. Outward losses drive good people to their 
 prayers, but bad people to their curses. This woman's silver was her 
 god before it was made thither into a graven or a molten image, else 
 the loss of it would not have put her into such a passion as caused her 
 quite to forget and break through all the laws of decency and piety. It 
 is a very foolish thing for those that are provoked to throw their 
 curses about <I>as a madman that casteth fire-brands, arrows, and 
 death,</I> since they know not but they may light upon those that are 
 most dear to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Micah and his mother reconciled. 

 1. The son was so terrified with his mother's curses that he restored 
 the money. Though he had so little grace as to take it, he had so much 
 left as not to dare to keep it when his mother had sent a curse after 
 it.  He cannot believe his mother's money will do him any good without 
 his mother's blessing, nor dares he deny the theft when he is charged 
 with it, nor retain the money when it is demanded by the right owner. 
 It is best not to do evil, but it is next best, when it is done, to 
 undo it again by repentance, confession, and restitution. Let children 
 be afraid of having the prayers of their parents against them; for, 
 though the curse causeless shall not come, yet that which is justly 
 deserved may be justly feared, even though it was passionately and 
 indecently uttered. 

 2. The mother was so pleased with her son's repentance that she 
 recalled her curses, and turned them into prayers for her son's 
 welfare: <I>Blessed be thou of the Lord, my son.</I> When those that 
 have been guilty of a fault appear to be free and ingenuous in owning 
 it they ought to be commended for their repentance, rather than still 
 be condemned and upbraided for their fault.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Micah and his mother agreeing to turn their money into a god, and 
 set up idolatry in their family; and this seems to have been the first 
 instance of the revolt of any Israelite from God and his instituted 
 worship after the death of Joshua and the elders that out-lived him, 
 and is therefore thus particularly related. And though this was only 
 the worship of the true God by an image, against the <I>second</I> 
 commandment, yet this opened the door to the worship of other gods, 
 Baalim and the groves, against the <I>first and great</I> commandment. 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The mother's contrivance of this matter. When the silver was 
 restored she pretended she had <I>dedicated it to the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 
 either before it was stolen, and then she would have this thought to be 
 the reason why she was so much grieved at the loss of it and imprecated 
 evil on him that had taken it, because it was a dedicated and therefore 
 an accursed thing, or after it was stolen she had made a vow that, if 
 she could retrieve it, she would dedicate it to God, and then she would 
 have the providence that had so far favoured her as to bring it back to 
 her hands to be an owning of her vow. "Come," said she to her son, "the 
 money is mine, but thou hast a mind to it; let it be neither mine nor 
 thine, but let us both agree to make it into an image for a religious 
 use." Had she put it to a use that was indeed for the service and 
 honour of God, this would have been a good way of accommodating the 
 matter between them; but, as it was, the project was wicked. Probably 
 this old woman was one of those that came out of Egypt, and would have 
 such images made as she had seen there; now that she began to dote she 
 called to remembrance the follies of her youth, and perhaps told her 
 son that this way of worshipping God by images was, to her knowledge, 
 the old religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The son's compliance with her. It should seem, when she first 
 proposed the thing he stumbled at it, knowing what the second 
 commandment was; for, when she said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 she designed it for her son to make an image of, yet he restored it to 
 his mother (being loth to have a hand in making the image), and she 
 gave it to the founder and had the thing done, blaming him perhaps for 
 scrupling at it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 But, when the images were made, Micah, by his mother's persuasion, was 
 not only well reconciled to them, but greatly pleased and in love with 
 them; so strangely bewitching was idolatry, and so much supported by 
 <I>traditions received from their parents,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:18,Jer+44:17">1 Pet. i. 18; Jer. xliv. 17</A>.

 But observe how the old woman's covetousness prevailed, in part, above 
 her superstition. She had wholly dedicated the silver to make the 
 graven and molten images 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 all the 1100 pieces; but, when it came to be done, she made less than a 
 fifth part serve, even 200 <I>shekels,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 She thought that enough, and indeed it was too much to give for an 
 image that is a teacher of lies. Had it been devoted truly to the 
 honour of God, he would not thus have been put off with part of the 
 price, but would have signified his resentment of the affront, as he 
 did in the case of Ananias and Sapphira. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What was the corruption here introduced, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The man Micah had <I>a house of gods, a house of God,</I> so the LXX., 
 for so he thought it, as good as that at Shiloh, and better, because 
 his own, of his own inventing and at his own disposal; for people love 
 to have their religion under their girdle, to manage it as they please. 
 <I>A house of error,</I> so the Chaldee, for really it was so, a 
 deviation from the way of truth and an inlet to all deceit. Idolatry is 
 a great cheat, and one of the worst of errors. That which he aimed at 
 in the progress of his idolatry, whether he designed it at first or no, 
 was to mimic and rival both God's oracles and his ordinances.

 [1.] His oracles; for he made <I>teraphim,</I> little images which he 
 might advise with as there was occasion, and receive informations, 
 directions, and predictions from. What the <I>urim</I> and 
 <I>thummim</I> were to the prince and people these <I>teraphim</I> 
 should be to his family; yet he could not think that the true God would 
 own them, or give answers by them, and therefore depended upon such 
 demons as the heathen worshipped to inspire them and make them 
 serviceable to him. Thus, while the honour of Jehovah was pretended

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 yet, his institution being relinquished, these Israelites unavoidably 
 lapsed into downright idolatry and demon-worship. 

 [2.] His ordinances.  Some room or apartment in the house of Micah was 
 appointed for the temple or house of God; an ephod, or holy garment, 
 was provided for his priest to officiate in, in imitation of those used 
 at the tabernacle of God, and one of his sons he consecrated, probably 
 the eldest, to be his priest. And, when he had set up a graven or 
 molten image to represent the object of his worship, no marvel if a 
 priest of his own getting and his own making served to be the manager 
 of it. Here is no mention of any altar, sacrifice, or incense, in 
 honour of these silver gods, but, having a priest, it is probable he 
 had all these, unless we suppose that, at first, his gods were intended 
 only to be advised with, not to be adored, like Laban's teraphim; but 
 the beginning of idolatry, as of other sins, is <I>like the letting 
 forth of water:</I> break the dam, and you bring a deluge. Here 
 idolatry began, and it spread like a fretting leprosy. Dr. Lightfoot 
 would have us observe that as 1100 pieces of silver were here devoted 
 to the making of an idol, which ruined religion, especially in the 
 tribe of Dan (as we shall presently find), which was Samson's tribe, so 
 1100 pieces of silver were given by each Philistine lord for the ruin 
 of Samson.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What was the cause of this corruption 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>There was no king in Israel,</I> no judge or sovereign prince to 
 take cognizance of the setting up of these images (which, doubtless, 
 the country about soon resorted to), and to give orders for the 
 destroying of them, none to convince Micah of his error and to restrain 
 and punish him, to take this disease in time, by which the spreading of 
 the infection might have been happily prevented. Every man did that 
 which was <I>right in his own eyes,</I> and then they soon did that 
 which was <I>evil in the sight of the Lord.</I> When they were without 
 a king to keep good order among them, God's house was forsaken, his 
 priests were neglected, and all went to ruin among them. See what a 
 mercy government is, and what reason there is that not only <I>prayers 
 and intercessions, but giving of thanks,</I> should <I>be made for 
 kings and all in authority,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:1,2">1 Tim. ii. 1, 2</A>.

 Nothing contributes more, under God, to the support of religion in the
 world, than the due administration of those two great ordinances, 
 magistracy and ministry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah of the family
 of Judah, who <I>was</I> a Levite, and he sojourned there.
 &nbsp; 8 And the man departed out of the city from Beth-lehem-judah to
 sojourn where he could find <I>a place:</I> and he came to mount
 Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
 &nbsp; 9 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto
 him, I <I>am</I> a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where
 I may find <I>a place.</I>
 &nbsp; 10 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a
 father and a priest, and I will give thee ten <I>shekels</I> of silver
 by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the
 Levite went in.
 &nbsp; 11 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the
 young man was unto him as one of his sons.
 &nbsp; 12 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became
 his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
 &nbsp; 13 Then said Micah, Now know I that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will do me good,
 seeing I have a Levite to <I>my</I> priest.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of Micah's furnishing himself with a Levite for 
 his chaplain, either thinking his son, because the heir of his estate, 
 too good to officiate, or rather, because not of God's tribe, not good 
 enough.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What brought this Levite to Micah. By his mother's side he was of 
 the family of Judah, and lived at Bethlehem among his mother's 
 relations (for that was not a Levites' city), or, upon some other 
 account, as a stranger or inmate, sojourned there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Thence he went to <I>sojourn where he could find a place,</I> and in 
 his travels came to the house of Micah in Mount Ephraim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Now, 

 1.  Some think it was his unhappiness that he was under a necessity of 
 removing, either because he was persecuted and abused, or rather 
 neglected and starved, at Bethlehem. God had made plentiful provision 
 for the Levites, but the people withheld their dues, and did not help 
 them into the possession of the cities assigned to them; so that they 
 were reduced to straits, and no care was taken for their relief.  
 Israel's forsaking God began with forsaking the Levites, which 
 therefore they are warned against,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:19">Deut. xii. 19</A>.

 It is a sign religion is going to decay when good ministers are
 neglected and at a loss for a livelihood.  But, 

 2. It seems rather to have been his fault and folly, that he loved to 
 wander, threw himself out where he was, and forfeited the respect of 
 his friends, and, having a roving head, would go to seek his fortune, 
 as we say. We cannot conceive that things had yet come to such a pass 
 among them that a Levite should be poor, unless it was his own fault. 
 As those are fit to be pitied that would fix but may not, so those are 
 fit to be punished that might fix but will not. Unsettledness being, 
 one would think, a constant uneasiness, it is strange that any 
 Israelite, especially any Levite, should affect it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What bargain Micah made with him. Had he not been well enough 
 content with his son for his priest, he would have gone or sent abroad 
 to enquire out a Levite, but now he only takes hold of one that drops 
 into his hands, which showed that he had no great zeal in the matter. 
 It is probable that this rambling Levite had heard, in the country, of 
 Micah's house of <I>gods, his graven and molten image,</I> which, if he 
 had had any thing of the spirit of a Levite in him, would have brought 
 him thither to reprove Micah for his idolatry, to tell how directly 
 contrary it was to the law of God, and how it would bring the judgments 
 of God upon him; but instead of this, like a base and degenerate branch 
 of that sacred tribe, thither he goes to offer his service, with, 
 <I>Have you any work for a Levite?</I> for I am out of business, and 
 <I>go to sojourn where I may find a place;</I> all he aimed at was to 
 get bread, not to do good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 Micah courts him into his family
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and promises him, 

 1. Good preferment: <I>Be unto me a father and a priest.</I> Though a 
 young man, and taken up at the door, yet, if he take him for a priest, 
 he will respect him as a father, so far is he from setting him among 
 his servants. He asks not for his credentials, takes no time to enquire 
 how he behaved in the place of his last settlement, considers not 
 whether, though he was a Levite, yet he might not be of such a bad 
 character as to be a plague and scandal to his family, but thinks, 
 though he should be ever so great a rake, he might serve for a priest 
 to a graven image, like Jeroboam's priest of the <I>lowest of the 
 people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:31">1 Kings xii. 31</A>.

 No marvel if those who can make any thing serve for a god can also make
 any thing serve for a priest. 

 2. A tolerable maintenance. He will allow him <I>meat, and drink, and 
 clothes,</I> a <I>double suit,</I> so the word is in the margin, a 
 better and a worse, one for every day's wear and one for holy days, and 
 ten shekels, about twenty-five shillings, a year for spending money--a 
 poor salary in comparison of what God provided for the Levites that 
 behaved well; but those that forsake God's service will never better 
 themselves, nor find a better master.  The ministry is the best calling 
 but the worst trade in the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The Levite's settlement with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 He was <I>content to dwell with the man;</I> though his work was 
 superstitious and his wages were scandalous, he objected against 
 neither, but thought himself happy that he had lighted on so good a 
 house.  Micah, thinking himself holier than any of his neighbours, 
 presumed to consecrate this Levite, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 As if his building, furnishing, and endowing this chapel authorized 
 him, not only to appoint the person that should officiate there, but to 
 confer those orders upon him which he had no right to give nor the 
 other to receive.  And now he shows him respect as a father and 
 tenderness as a son, and is willing thus to make up the deficiency of 
 the coin he gave him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Micah's satisfaction in this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+17:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Now know I that the Lord will do me good</I> (that is, he hoped that
 his new establishment would gain reputation among his neighbours, which 
 would turn to his advantage, for he would share in the profit of his 
 altar; or, rather, he hoped that God would countenance and bless him in 
 all he put his hand unto) <I>because I have a Levite to be my 
 priest.</I> 

 1. He thought it was a sign of God's favour to him and his images that 
 he had so opportunely sent a Levite to his door. Thus those who please 
 themselves with their own delusions, if Providence unexpectedly bring 
 any thing to their hands that furthers them in their evil way, are too 
 apt to infer thence that God is pleased with them. 

 2.  He thought now that the error of his priesthood was amended all was 
 well, though he still retained his graven and molten image. Note, Many 
 deceive themselves into a good opinion of their state by a partial 
 reformation.  They think they are as good as they should be, because, 
 in some one particular instance, they are not so bad as they have been, 
 as if the correcting of one fault would atone for their persisting in 
 all the rest. 

 3. He thought the making of a Levite into a priest was a very 
 meritorious act, which really was a presumptuous usurpation, and every 
 provoking to God. Men's pride, and ignorance, and self-flattery, will 
 undertake, not only to justify, but magnify and sanctify, the most 
 daring impieties and invasions upon the divine prerogatives. With much 
 reason might Micah have said, "Now may I fear that God will curse me, 
 because I have debauched one of his own tribe, and drawn him into the 
 worship of a graven image;" yet for this he hopes God will do him good.  
 
 4. He thought that having a Levite in the house with him would of
 course entitle him to the divine favour. Carnal hearts are apt to build 
 too much upon their external privileges, and to conclude that God will 
 certainly do them good because they are born of godly parents, dwell in 
 praying families, are linked in society with those that are very good, 
 and sit under a lively ministry; whereas all this is but like having a 
 Levite to be their priest, which amounts to no security at all that God 
 will do them good, unless they be good themselves, and make a good use 
 of these advantages.</P>
