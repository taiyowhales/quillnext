 This chapter brings us again to the history of the kings of Israel, and 
 particularly of the family of Jehu. We have here an account of the 
 reign, 
 
 I. Of his son Jehoahaz, which continued seventeen years. 

 1. His bad character in general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 the trouble he was brought into

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:3">ver. 3</A>),

 and the low ebb of his affairs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:7">ver. 7</A>.

 2. His humiliation before God, and God's compassion towards him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:4,5,23">ver. 4, 5, and 23</A>.

 3. His continuance in his idolatry notwithstanding, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:6">ver. 6</A>.

 4. His death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.

 II. Of his grandson Joash, which continued sixteen years.  Here is a
 general account of his reign in the usual form 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:10-13">ver. 10-13</A>),

 but a particular account of the death of Elisha in his time.

 1.  The kind visit the king made him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:14">ver. 14</A>),

 the encouragement he gave the king in his wars with Syria,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:15-19">ver. 15-19</A>.

 2.  His death and burial 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:20">ver. 20</A>),

 and a miracle wrought by his bones,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:21">ver. 21</A>.

 And, lastly, the advantages Joash gained against the Syrians, according 
 to his predictions,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah
 king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel
 in Samaria, <I>and reigned</I> seventeen years.
 &nbsp; 2 And he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made
 Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
 &nbsp; 3 And the anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was kindled against Israel, and he
 delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into
 the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all <I>their</I> days.
 &nbsp; 4 And Jehoahaz besought the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hearkened unto
 him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of
 Syria oppressed them.
 &nbsp; 5 (And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out
 from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel
 dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.
 &nbsp; 6 Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of
 Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, <I>but</I> walked therein: and there
 remained the grove also in Samaria.)
 &nbsp; 7 Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty
 horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the
 king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust
 by threshing.
 &nbsp; 8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did,
 and his might, <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the
 chronicles of the kings of Israel?
 &nbsp; 9 And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in
 Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This general account of the reign of Jehoahaz, and of the state of 
 Israel during his seventeen years, though short, is long enough to let 
 us see two things which are very affecting and instructive:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The glory of Israel raked up in the ashes, buried and lost, and 
 turned into shame. How unlike does Israel appear here to what it had 
 been and might have been! How is its crown profaned and its honour laid 
 in the dust! 

 1. It was the honour of Israel that they worshipped the only living and
 true God, who is a Spirit, an eternal mind, and had rules by which to 
 worship him of his own appointment; but by <I>changing the glory of 
 their incorruptible God into the similitude of an ox, the truth of God 
 into a lie,</I> they lost this honour, and levelled themselves with the 
 nations that worshipped the work of their own hands. We find here that 
 the king <I>followed the sins of Jeroboam</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and the people departed <I>not from them, but walked therein,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 There could not be a greater reproach than these two idolized calves
 were to a people that were instructed in the service of God and 
 entrusted with the lively oracles. In all the history of the ten tribes 
 we never find the least shock given to that idolatry, but, in every 
 reign, still the calf was their god, and they separated themselves to 
 that shame. 

 2. It was the honour of Israel that they were taken under the special 
 protection of heaven; God himself was their defence, the shield of 
 their help and the sword of their excellency. Happy wast thou, O 
 Israel! upon this account. But here, as often before, we find them 
 stripped of this glory, and exposed to the insults of all their 
 neighbours. They by their sins provoked God to anger, and then he 
 <I>delivered them into the hands of Hazael and Benhadad,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 <I>Hazael oppressed Israel</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Surely never was any nation so often plucked and pillaged by their
 neighbours as Israel was. This the people brought upon themselves by 
 sin; when they had provoked God to pluck up their hedge, the goodness 
 of their land did but tempt their neighbours to prey upon them. So low 
 was Israel brought in this reign, by the many depredations which the 
 Syrians made upon them, that the militia of the kingdom and all the 
 force they could bring into the field were but <I>fifty horsemen, ten 
 chariots, and 10,000 footmen,</I> a despicable muster, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Have the thousands of Israel come to this?  <I>How has the gold become
 dim!</I> The debauching of a nation will certainly be the debasing of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Some sparks of Israel's ancient honour appearing in these ashes. It 
 is not quite forgotten, notwithstanding all these quarrels, that this 
 people is the Israel of God and he is the God of Israel. For, 

 1. It was the ancient honour of Israel that they were a praying people:
 and here we find somewhat of that honour revived; for Jehoahaz their 
 king, in his distress, <I>besought the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 applied for help, not to the calves (what help could they give him?)
 but to the Lord. It becomes kings to be beggars at God's door, and the 
 greatest of men to be humble petitioners at the footstool of his 
 throne. Need will drive them to it.  

 2. It was the ancient honour of Israel that they had <I>God nigh unto 
 them in all that which they called upon him for</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:7">Deut. iv. 7</A>),

 and so he was here. Though he might justly have rejected the prayer as
 an abomination to him, yet <I>the Lord hearkened unto Jehoahaz,</I> and 
 to his prayer for himself and for his people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and <I>he gave Israel a saviour</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 not Jehoahaz himself, for all his days Hazael oppressed Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),
 
 but his son, to whom, in answer to his father's prayers, God gave 
 success against the Syrians, so that he recovered the cities which they 
 had taken from his father, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 This gracious answer God gave to the prayer of Jehoahaz, not for his
 sake, or the sake of that unworthy people, but in remembrance of his 
 covenant with Abraham

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 which, in such exigencies as these, he had long since promised to have 
 respect to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:42">Lev. xxvi. 42</A>.

 See swift God is to show mercy, how ready to hear prayers, how willing
 to find out a reason to be gracious, else he would not look so far back 
 as that ancient covenant which Israel had so often broken and forfeited 
 all the benefit of. Let this invite and engage us for ever to him, and 
 encourage even those that have forsaken him to return and repent; for 
 <I>there is forgiveness with him, that he may be feared.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began
 Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, <I>and
 reigned</I> sixteen years.
 &nbsp; 11 And he did <I>that which was</I> evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
 who made Israel sin: <I>but</I> he walked therein.
 &nbsp; 12 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and
 his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah,
 <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
 of Israel?
 &nbsp; 13 And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his
 throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
 &nbsp; 14 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died.
 And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over
 his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of
 Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
 &nbsp; 15 And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took
 unto him bow and arrows.
 &nbsp; 16 And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the
 bow. And he put his hand <I>upon it:</I> and Elisha put his hands upon
 the king's hands.
 &nbsp; 17 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened <I>it.</I>
 Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria:
 for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have
 consumed <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 18 And he said, Take the arrows. And he took <I>them.</I> And he
 said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote
 thrice, and stayed.
 &nbsp; 19 And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou
 shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten
 Syria till thou hadst consumed <I>it:</I> whereas now thou shalt smite
 Syria <I>but</I> thrice.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Jehoash, or Joash, the son of Jehoahaz and grandson of 
 Jehu, upon the throne of Israel. Probably the house of Jehu intended 
 some respect to the house of David when they gave this heir-apparent to 
 the crown the same name with him that was then king of Judah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The general account here given of him and his reign is much the same 
 with what we have already met with, and has little in it remarkable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:10-13"><I>v.</I> 10-13</A>.

 He was none of the worst, and yet, because he kept up that ancient and
 politic idolatry of the house of Jeroboam, it is said, <I>He did that 
 which was evil in the sight of the Lord.</I> That one evil was enough 
 to leave an indelible mark of infamy upon his name; for, how little 
 evil soever men saw in it, it was, <I>in the sight of the Lord,</I> a 
 very wicked thing; and we are sure that his judgment is according to 
 truth. It is observable how lightly the inspired penman passes over his 
 acts, and his might wherewith he warred, leaving it to the common 
 historians to record them, while he takes notice only of the respect he 
 showed to Elisha. One good action shall make a better figure in God's 
 book than twenty great ones; and, in his account, it gains a man a much 
 better reputation to honour a prophet than to conquer a king and his 
 army.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The particular account of what passed between him and Elisha has 
 several things in it remarkable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Elisha fell sick, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) He lived long; for it was now about sixty years since he was first 
 called to be a prophet. It was a great mercy to Israel, and especially 
 to the sons of the prophets, that he was continued so long a burning 
 and shining light. Elijah finished his testimony in a fourth part of 
 that time. God's prophets have their day set them, some longer, others 
 shorter, as Infinite Wisdom sees fit.  

 (2.) All the latter part of his time, from the anointing of Jehu, which 
 was forty-five years before Joash began his reign, we find no mention 
 made of him, or of any thing he did, till we find him here upon his 
 death-bed. He might be useful to the last, and yet not so famous as he 
 had sometimes been. The time of his flourishing was less than the time 
 of his living. Let not old people complain of obscurity, but rather be 
 well pleased with retirement. 

 (3.) The spirit of Elijah rested on Elisha, and yet he was not sent for 
 to heaven in a fiery chariot, as Elijah was, but went the common road 
 out of the world, and was <I>visited with the visitation of all 
 men.</I> If God honour some above others, who yet are not inferior to 
 them in gifts or graces, who shall find fault? <I>May he not do what he 
 will with his own?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. King Joash visited him in his sickness, and <I>wept over him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This was an evidence of some good in him, that he had a value and
 affection for a faithful prophet; so far was he from hating and 
 persecuting him as a troubler of Israel that he loved and honoured him 
 as one of the greatest blessings of his kingdom, and lamented the loss 
 of him. There have been those who would not be obedient to the word of 
 God, and yet have the faithful ministers of it so manifested in their 
 consciences that they could not but have an honour for them. Observe 
 here,

 (1.) When the king heard of Elisha's sickness he came to visit him, and 
 to receive his dying counsel and blessing; and it was no disparagement 
 to him, though a king, thus to honour one whom God honoured. Note, It 
 may turn much to our spiritual advantage to attend the sick-beds and 
 death-beds of good ministers and other good men, that we may learn to 
 die, and may be encouraged in religion by the living comforts they have 
 from it in a dying hour.  

 (2.) Though Elisha was very old, had been a great while useful, and, in 
 the course of nature, could not continue long, yet the king, when he 
 saw him sick and likely to die, wept over him. The aged are most 
 experienced and therefore can worst be spared.  In many causes, one old 
 witness is worth ten young ones. 

 (3.) He lamented him in the same words with which Elisha had himself 
 lamented the removal of Elijah: <I>My father, my father.</I> It is 
 probable he had heard or read them in that famous story. Note, Those 
 that give just honours to the generation that goes before them are 
 often recompensed with the like from the generation that comes after 
 them. He that watereth, that watereth with tears, shall be watered, 
 shall be so watered, also himself, when it comes to his own turn, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:25">Prov. xi. 25</A>.

 (4.) This king was herein selfish; he lamented the loss of Elisha 
 because he was as the chariot and horsemen of Israel, and therefore 
 could be ill spared when Israel was so poor in chariots and horsemen, 
 as we find they were

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 when they had in all but fifty horsemen and ten chariots. Those who 
 consider how much good men contribute to the defence of a nation, and 
 the keeping off of God's judgments, will see cause to lament the 
 removal of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Elisha gave the king great assurances of his success against the 
 Syrians, Israel's present oppressors, and encouraged him to prosecute 
 the war against them with vigour. Elisha was aware that therefore he 
 was loth to part with him because he looked upon him as the great 
 bulwark of the kingdom against that common enemy, and depended much 
 upon his blessings and prayers in his designs against them. "Well," 
 says Elisha, "if that be the cause of your grief, let not that trouble 
 thee, for thou shalt be victorious over the Syrians when I am in my 
 grave. <I>I die, but God will surely visit you.</I> He has the residue 
 of the Spirit, and can raise up other prophets to pray for you." God's 
 grace is not tied to one hand. He can bury his workmen and yet carry on 
 his work. To animate the king against the Syrians he gives him a sign, 
 orders him to <I>take bow and arrows</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 to intimate to him that, in order to the deliverance of his kingdom 
 from the Syrians, he must put himself into a military posture and 
 resolve to undergo the perils and fatigues of war. God would be the 
 agent, but he must be the instrument. And that he should be successful 
 he gives him a token, by directing him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) To shoot an arrow towards Syria, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 The king, no doubt, knew how to manage a bow better than the prophet
 did, and yet, because the arrow now to be shot was to have its 
 significancy from the divine institution, as if he were now to be 
 disciplined, he received the words of command from the prophet: <I>Put 
 thy hand upon the bow</I>--<I>Open the window</I>--<I>Shoot.</I> Nay, 
 as if he had been a child that never drew a bow before, <I>Elisha put 
 his hands upon the king's hands,</I> to signify that in all his 
 expeditions against the Syrians he must look up to God for direction 
 and strength, must reckon his own hands not sufficient for him, but go 
 on in a dependence upon divine aid. <I>He teacheth my hands to war,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:34,144:1">Ps. xviii. 34; cxliv. 1</A>.

 The trembling hands of a dying prophet, as they signified the
 concurrence and communication of the power of God, gave this arrow more 
 force than the hands of the king in his full strength. The Syrians had 
 made themselves masters of the country that lay eastward,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:33"><I>ch.</I> x. 33</A>.

 Thitherward therefore the arrow was directed, and such an
 interpretation given by the prophet of the shooting of this arrow, 
 though shot in one respect at random, as made it, 

 [1.] A commission to the king to attack the Syrians, notwithstanding
 their power and possession. 

 [2.] A promise of success therein. It is the <I>arrow of the Lord's
 deliverance, even the arrow of deliverance from Syria.</I> It is God 
 that commands deliverance; and, when he will effect it, who can hinder? 
 The arrow of deliverance is his. He shoots out his arrows, and the work 
 is done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:14">Ps. xviii. 14</A>.

 "<I>Thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek,</I> where they are now
 encamped, or where they are to have a general rendezvous of their 
 forces, <I>till thou have consumed</I> those of them that are vexatious 
 and oppressive to thee and thy kingdom."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) To <I>strike with the arrows,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 The prophet having in God's name assured him of victory over the
 Syrians, he will now try him and see what improvement he will make of 
 his victories, whether he will push them on with more zeal than Ahab 
 did when Benhadad lay at his mercy. For the trial of this he bids him 
 <I>smite with the arrows on the ground:</I> "Believe them brought to 
 the ground by the <I>arrow of the Lord's deliverance,</I> and laid at 
 thy feet; and now show me what thou wilt do to them when thou hast them 
 down, whether thou wilt do as David did when God <I>gave him the necks 
 of his enemies, beat them small as the dust before the wind,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:40,42">Ps. xviii. 40, 42</A>.

 The king showed not that eagerness and flame which one might have
 expected upon this occasion, but smote thrice, and no more. Either out 
 of foolish tenderness to the Syrians, he smote as if he were afraid of 
 hurting them, at least of ruining them, willing to show mercy to those 
 that never did, nor ever would, show mercy to him or his people. Or, 
 perhaps, he smote thrice, and very coldly, because he thought it but a 
 silly thing, that it looked idle and childish for a king to beat the 
 floor with his arrows; and thrice was often enough for him to play the 
 fool merely to please the prophet. But, by contemning the sign, he lost 
 the thing signified, sorely to the grief of the dying prophet, who was 
 angry with him, and told him he should have smitten five or six times.  
 Not being straitened in the power and promise of God, why should he be 
 straitened in his own expectations and endeavours? Note, It cannot but 
 be a trouble to good men to see those they wish well to stand in their 
 own light and forsake their own mercies, to see them lose their 
 advantages against their spiritual enemies, and to give them 
 advantage.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20 And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the
 Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
 &nbsp; 21 And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that,
 behold, they spied a band <I>of men;</I> and they cast the man into
 the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and
 touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his
 feet.
 &nbsp; 22 But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of
 Jehoahaz.
 &nbsp; 23 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was gracious unto them, and had compassion on
 them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with
 Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither
 cast he them from his presence as yet.
 &nbsp; 24 So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned
 in his stead.
 &nbsp; 25 And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand
 of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out
 of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash
 beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

 I. The sepulchre of Elisha: he died in a good old age, and they buried 
 him; and what follows shows, 

 1. What power there was in his life to keep off judgments; for, as soon
 as he was dead, the bands of the Moabites invaded the land--not great 
 armies to face them in the field, but roving skulking bands, that 
 murdered and plundered by surprise. God has many ways to chastise a 
 provoking people. The king was apprehensive of danger only from the 
 Syrians, but, behold, the Moabites invade him.  Trouble comes sometimes 
 from that point whence we least feared it. The mentioning of this 
 immediately upon the death of Elisha intimates that the removal of 
 God's faithful prophets is a presage of judgments coming. When 
 ambassadors are recalled heralds may be expected.  

 2.  What power there was in his dead body: it communicated life to 
 another dead body, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 This great miracle, though very briefly related, was a decided proof of
 his mission and a confirmation of all his prophecies. It was also a 
 plain indication of another life after this.  When Elisha died, there 
 was not an end of him, for then he could not have done this. From 
 operation we may infer existence. By this it appeared that the Lord was 
 still the God of Elisha; therefore Elisha still lived, for <I>God is 
 not the God of the dead, but of the living.</I> And it may, perhaps, 
 have a reference to Christ, by whose death and burial the grave is made 
 to all believers a safe and happy passage to life. It likewise 
 intimated that though Elisha was dead, yet, in virtue of the promises 
 made by him, Israel's interests, though they seemed quite sunk and 
 lost, should revive and flourish again. The neighbours were carrying 
 the dead body of a man to the grave, and, fearing to fall into the 
 hands of the Moabites, a party of whom they saw at a distance near the 
 place where the body was to be interred, they laid the corpse in the 
 next convenient place, which proved to be Elisha's sepulchre. The dead 
 man, upon touching Elisha's bones, revived, and, it is likely, went 
 home again with his friends. Josephus relates the story otherwise, That 
 some thieves, having robbed and murdered an honest traveller, threw his 
 dead body into Elisha's grave, and it immediately revived. Elijah was 
 honoured <I>in</I> his departure. Elisha was honoured <I>after</I> his 
 departure. God thus dispenses honours as he pleases, but, one way or 
 other, the rest of all the saints will be glorious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:10">Isa. xi. 10</A>.

 It is good being near the saints and having our lot with them both in
 life and death.</P>

 II. The sword of Joash king of Israel; and we find it successful 
 against the Syrians. 
 
 1. The cause of his success was God's favour
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:23"><I>v.</I>  23</A>):

 <I>The Lord was gracious to them, had compassion on them</I> in their 
 miseries and <I>respect unto them.</I> The several expressions here of 
 the same import call upon us to observe and admire the triumphs of 
 divine goodness in the deliverance of such a provoking people. It was 
 of the Lord's mercies that they were not consumed, because he would not 
 destroy them as yet. He foresaw they would destroy themselves at last, 
 but as yet he would reprieve them, and give them space to repent.  The 
 slowness of God's processes against sinners must be construed to the 
 honour of his mercy, not the impeachment of his justice. 

 2.  The effect of his success was Israel's benefit. He recovered out of 
 the hands of Benhadad the cities of Israel which the Syrians were 
 possessed of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 This was a great kindness to the cities themselves, which were hereby
 brought from under the yoke of oppression, and to the whole kingdom, 
 which was much strengthened by the reduction of those cities.  Thrice 
 Joash beat the Syrians, just as often as he had struck the ground with 
 the arrows, and then a full stop was put to the course of his 
 victories. Many have repented, when it was too late, of their distrusts 
 and the straitness of their desires.</P>
