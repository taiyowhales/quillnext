 In this chapter we have the return of the ark to the land of Israel, 
 whither we are now gladly to attend it, and observe, 

 I. How the Philistines dismissed it, by the advice of their priests
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>),

 with rich presents to the God of Israel, to make an atonement for their
 sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>),

 and yet with a project to bring it back, unless Providence directed the
 kine, contrary to their inclination, to go to the land of Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.

 II. How the Israelites entertained it. 

 1. With great joy and sacrifices of praise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:12-18">ver. 12-18</A>.

 2. With an over-bold curiosity to look into it, for which many of them
 were struck dead, the terror of which moved them to send it forward to
 another city,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was in the country of the Philistines
 seven months.
 &nbsp; 2 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
 saying, What shall we do to the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>? tell us
 wherewith we shall send it to his place.
 &nbsp; 3 And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel,
 send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass
 offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you
 why his hand is not removed from you.
 &nbsp; 4 Then said they, What <I>shall be</I> the trespass offering which
 we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and
 five golden mice, <I>according to</I> the number of the lords of the
 Philistines: for one plague <I>was</I> on you all, and on your lords.
 &nbsp; 5 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of
 your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God
 of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you,
 and from off your gods, and from off your land.
 &nbsp; 6 Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and
 Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully
 among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
 &nbsp; 7 Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on
 which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and
 bring their calves home from them:
 &nbsp; 8 And take the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and lay it upon the cart; and
 put the jewels of gold, which ye return him <I>for</I> a trespass
 offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that
 it may go.
 &nbsp; 9 And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
 Beth-shemesh, <I>then</I> he hath done us this great evil: but if not,
 then we shall know that <I>it is</I> not his hand <I>that</I> smote us: it
 <I>was</I> a chance <I>that</I> happened to us.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The first words of the chapter tell us how long the captivity of the 
 ark continued--it was <I>in the country of the Philistines seven months.
 In the field of the Philistines</I> (so it is in the original), from 
 which some gather that, having tried it in all their cities, and found 
 it a plague to the inhabitants of each, at length they sent it into the 
 open fields, upon which mice sprang up out of the ground in great 
 multitudes, and destroyed the corn which was now nearly ripe and marred 
 the land. With that judgment they were plagued 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and yet it is not mentioned in the foregoing chapter; so God let them
 know that wherever they carried the ark, so long as they carried it 
 captive, they should find it a curse to them. <I>Cursed shalt thou be 
 in the city, and cursed in the field,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:16">Deut. xxviii. 16</A>.

 But, most take it to signify, as we render it, <I>The country of the
 Philistines.</I> Now, 

 1. Seven months Israel was punished with the absence of the ark, that
 special token of God's presence. How bare did the tabernacle look 
 without it!  How was the holy city now a desolation, and the holy land 
 a wilderness!  A melancholy time no doubt it was to the good people 
 among them, particularly to Samuel; but they had this to comfort 
 themselves with, as we have in the like distress when we are deprived 
 of the comfort of public ordinances, that, wherever the ark is, <I>the 
 Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven,</I> and by 
 faith and prayer we may have access with boldness to him there. We may 
 have God nigh unto us when the ark is at a distance. 

 2. Seven months the Philistines were punished with the presence of the
 ark; so long it was a plague to them, because they would not send it 
 home sooner. Note, Sinners lengthen out their own miseries by 
 obstinately refusing to part with their sins. Egypt's plagues would 
 have been fewer than ten if Pharaoh's heart had not been hardened not 
 to let the people go. But at length it is determined that the ark must 
 be sent back; there is no remedy, they are undone if they detain 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The priests and the diviners are consulted about it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 They were supposed to be best acquainted both with the rules of wisdom
 and with the rites of worship and atonement. And the Israelites being 
 their neighbours, and famed above all people for the institutions of 
 their religion, they had no doubt the curiosity to acquaint themselves 
 with their laws and usages; and therefore it was proper to ask them, 
 <I>What shall we do to the ark of Jehovah?</I> All nations have had a 
 regard to their priests, as the men whose lips keep knowledge. Had the 
 Philistines diviners? We have divines, of whom we should enquire 
 wherewith we shall <I>come before the Lord</I> and <I>bow ourselves 
 before the most high God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They give their advice very fully, and seem to be very unanimous in 
 it. It was a wonder they did not, as friends to their country, give it, 
 <I>ex officio--officially,</I> before they were asked. 

 1. They urge it upon them that it was absolutely necessary to send the
 ark back, from the example of Pharaoh and the Egyptians, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Some, it may be, were loth to yield, and were willing to try it out
 with the ark awhile longer, and to them they apply themselves: 
 <I>Wherefore do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh 
 did?</I> It seems they were well acquainted with the Mosaic history, 
 and could cite precedents out of it. This good use we should make of 
 the remaining records of God's judgments upon obstinate sinners, we 
 should by them be warned not to harden our hearts as they did. It is 
 much cheaper to learn by other people's experience than by our own. The 
 Egyptians were forced at last to let Israel go; therefore let the 
 Philistines yield in time to let the ark go.

 2. They advise that, when they sent it back, they should send a
 trespass-offering with it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Whatever the gods of other nations were, they knew the God of Israel
 was a jealous God, and how strict he was in his demands of 
 sin-offerings and trespass-offerings from his own people; and 
 therefore, since they found how highly he resented the affront of 
 holding his ark captive, those with whom he had such a quarrel must 
 <I>in any wise return him a trespass-offering,</I> and they could not 
 expect to be healed upon any other terms.  Injured justice demands 
 satisfaction. So far natural light instructed men. But when they began 
 to contrive what that satisfaction should be, they became wretchedly 
 vain in their imaginations. But those who by wilful sin have imprisoned 
 the truth in unrighteousness, as the Philistines did the ark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:18">Rom. i. 18</A>),

 may conclude that there is no making their peace with him whom they
 have thus injured but by a sin-offering; and we know but one that can 
 take away sin. 

 3. They direct that this trespass-offering should be an acknowledgement
 of the punishment of their iniquity, by which they might take shame to 
 themselves as conquered and yielding, and guilty before God, and might 
 <I>give glory to the God of Israel</I> as their mighty conqueror and 
 most just avenger, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 They must make images of the <I>emerods,</I> that is, of the swellings
 and sores with which they had been afflicted, so making the reproach of 
 that shameful disease perpetual by their own act and deed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:66">Ps. lxxviii. 66</A>),

 also images of the <I>mice that had marred the land,</I> owning thereby
 the almighty power of the God of Israel, who could chastise and humble 
 them, even in the day of their triumph, by such small and despicable 
 animals. These images must be made of gold, the most precious metal, to 
 intimate that they would gladly purchase their peace with the God of 
 Israel at any rate, and would not think it bought too dearly with gold, 
 <I>with much fine gold.</I> The <I>golden emerods</I> must be, in 
 number, five, according to the <I>number of the lords,</I> who, it is 
 likely, were all afflicted with them, and were content thus to own it; 
 it was advised that the <I>golden mice</I> should be five too, but, 
 because the whole country was infested with them, it should seem, upon 
 second thoughts, they sent more of them, <I>according to the number 
 both of the fenced cities and of the country villages,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Their priests reminded them that <I>one plague was on them all;</I>
 they could not blame one another, for they were all guilty, which they 
 were plainly told by being all plagued. Their proposal to offer a 
 trespass-offering for their offence was conformable enough to divine 
 revelation at that time; but to send such things as these for 
 trespass-offerings was very foreign, and showed them grossly ignorant 
 of the methods of reconciliation appointed by the law of Moses; for 
 there it appears all along that it is blood, and not gold, that makes 
 atonement for the soul.

 4. They encourage them to hope that hereby they would take an effectual
 course to get rid of the plague: <I>You shall be healed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 For, it seems, the disease obstinately resisted all the methods of cure
 their physicians had prescribed. "Let them therefore send back the ark, 
 and then," say they, "<I>It shall be known to you why his hand is not 
 removed from you,</I> that is, by this it will appear whether it is for 
 your detaining the ark that you are thus plagued; for, if it be, upon 
 your delivering it up the plague will cease." God has sometimes put his 
 people upon making such a trial, whether their reformation would not be 
 their relief.  <I>Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:10,Hag+2:18,19">Mal. iii. 10; Hag. ii. 18, 19</A>.

 Yet they speak doubtfully

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you;</I> as if now
 they began to think that the judgment might come from God's hand, and 
 yet not be removed immediately upon the restitution of the ark; however 
 that was the likeliest way to obtain mercy. Take away the cause and the 
 effect will cease. 

 5. Yet they put them in a way to make a further trial whether it was
 the hand of the God of Israel that had smitten them with these plagues 
 or no. They must, in honour of the ark, put it on a new cart or 
 carriage, to be drawn by two milch-cows, that had calves daily sucking 
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 unused to draw, and inclined to home, both for the sake of the crib
 where they were fed and of the calves they nourished, and, besides, 
 altogether unacquainted with the road that led towards the land of 
 Israel. They must have no one to lead or drive them, but must take 
 their own way, which, in all reason, one might expect, would be home 
 again; and yet, unless the God of Israel, after all the other miracles 
 he has wrought, will work one more, and by an invisible power lead 
 these cows, contrary to their natural instinct and inclination, to the 
 land of Israel, and particularly to Beth-shemesh, they will retract 
 their former opinion, and will believe it was not the hand of God that 
 smote them, but it was a chance that <I>happened to them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.
 
 Thus did God suffer himself to be tempted and prescribed to, after he
 had been otherwise affronted, by these uncircumcised Philistines. Would 
 they have been content that the honour of Dagon, their god, should be 
 put upon such an issue as this? See how willing bad men are to shift 
 off their convictions of the hand of God upon them, and to believe, 
 when they are in trouble, that it is <I>a chance that happens to 
 them;</I> and, if so, the rod has no voice which they are concerned to 
 hear or heed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them
 to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:
 &nbsp; 11 And they laid the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> upon the cart, and the
 coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.
 &nbsp; 12 And the kine took the straight way to the way of
 Beth-shemesh, <I>and</I> went along the highway, lowing as they went,
 and turned not aside <I>to</I> the right hand or <I>to</I> the left; and
 the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of
 Beth-shemesh.
 &nbsp; 13 And <I>they of</I> Beth-shemesh <I>were</I> reaping their wheat harvest
 in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark,
 and rejoiced to see <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 14 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite,
 and stood there, where <I>there was</I> a great stone: and they clave
 the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15 And the Levites took down the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the
 coffer that <I>was</I> with it, wherein the jewels of gold <I>were,</I> and
 put <I>them</I> on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered
 burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 16 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen <I>it,</I>
 they returned to Ekron the same day.
 &nbsp; 17 And these <I>are</I> the golden emerods which the Philistines
 returned <I>for</I> a trespass offering unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for Ashdod one,
 for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;
 &nbsp; 18 And the golden mice, <I>according to</I> the number of all the
 cities of the Philistines <I>belonging</I> to the five lords, <I>both</I>
 of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great
 <I>stone of</I> Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 <I>which stone remaineth</I> unto this day in the field of Joshua, the
 Bethshemite.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the Philistines dismissed the ark, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 They were made as glad to part with it as ever they had been to take
 it. As God had fetched Israel out of the house of bondage, so now he 
 fetched the ark out of its captivity, in such a manner as that <I>Egypt 
 was glad when they departed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:38">Ps. cv. 38</A>.

 1. They received no money or price for the ransom of it, as they hoped
 to do, even beyond a king's ransom.  Thus it is prophesied of Cyrus

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:13">Isa. xlv. 13</A>),

 <I>He shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward.</I> Nay, 

 2.  They gave jewels of gold, as the Egyptians did to the Israelites,
 to be rid of it. Thus the ark that was carried into the land of the 
 Philistines, a trophy of their victory, carried back with it trophies 
 of its own, and lasting monuments of the disgrace of the Philistines.  
 Note, God will be no loser in his glory, at last, by the successes of 
 the church's enemies against his ark, but will get himself honour from 
 those that seek to do dishonour to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How the kine brought it to the land of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They <I>took the straight way to Beth-shemesh,</I> the next city of the
 land of Israel, and a priests' city, <I>and turned not aside.</I> This 
 was a wonderful instance of the power of God over the brute-creatures, 
 and, all things considered, no less than a miracle, that cattle 
 unaccustomed to the yoke should draw so even, so orderly, and still go 
 forward,--that, without any driver, they should go from home, to which 
 all tame creatures have a natural inclination, and from their own 
 calves, to which they had a natural affection,--that, without any 
 director, they should go the straight road to Beth-shemesh, a city 
 eight or ten miles off, never miss the way, never turn aside into the 
 fields to feed themselves, nor turn back home to feed their calves.  
 They went on lowing for their young ones, by which it appeared that 
 they had not forgotten them, but that nature was sensible of the 
 grievance of going from them; the power of the God of nature therefore 
 appeared so much the greater, in overruling one of the strongest 
 instincts of nature. These two kine, says Dr. Lightfoot, knew their 
 owner, their great owner

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:3">Isa. i. 3</A>),

 whom Hophni and Phinehas knew not, to which I may add they brought home
 the ark to shame the stupidity of Israel, that made no attempt to fetch 
 it home. God's providence is conversant about the motions even of 
 brute-creatures, and serves its own purposes by them. The lords of the 
 Philistines, with a suitable retinue no doubt, went after them, 
 wondering at the power of the God of Israel; and thus those who thought 
 to triumph over the ark were made to go like menial servants after 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How it was welcomed to the land of Israel: <I>The men of 
 Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat-harvest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 They were going on with their worldly business, and were in no care
 about the ark, made no enquiries what had become of it; if they had, it 
 is likely they might have had private intelligence beforehand of its 
 coming, and might have gone to meet it, and conduct it into their own 
 border. But they were as careless as the people that <I>ceiled their 
 own houses</I> and <I>let God's house lie waste.</I> Note, God will in 
 his own time effect the deliverance of his church, not only though it 
 be fought against by its enemies, but though it be neglected by its 
 friends. Some observe that the returning ark found the men of 
 Beth-shemesh, not idling or sporting in the streets of the city, but 
 busy, reaping their corn in their fields, and well employed. Thus the 
 tidings of the birth of Christ were brought to the shepherds when they 
 were <I>keeping their flock by night.</I> The devil visits idle men 
 with his temptations. God visits industrious men with his favours. The 
 same invisible hand that directed the kine to the land of Israel 
 brought them into the field of Joshua, and in that field they stood, 
 some think for the owner's sake, on whom, being a very good man, they 
 suppose God designed to put this honour. I rather think it was for the 
 sake of the great stone in that field, which was convenient to put the 
 ark upon, and which is spoken of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:14,15,18"><I>v.</I> 14, 15, 18</A>.
 
 Now,

 1. When the reapers <I>saw the ark, they rejoiced</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 their joy for that was greater than the joy of harvest, and therefore
 they left their work to bid it welcome. When the Lord turned again the 
 captivity of his ark they were <I>like men that dream; then was their 
 mouth filled with laughter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:1,2">Ps. cxxvi. 1, 2</A>.

 Though they had not zeal and courage enough to attempt the rescue or
 ransom of it, yet, when it did come, they bade it heartily welcome.  
 Note, The return of the ark, and the revival of holy ordinances, after 
 days of restraint and trouble, cannot but be matter of great joy to 
 every faithful Israelite.  

 3. They offered up the kine for a burnt-offering, to the honour of God,
 and made use of the wood of the cart for fuel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Probably the Philistines intended these, when they sent them, to be a
 part of their trespass-offering, to make atonement, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:3,7"><I>v.</I> 3, 7</A>.

 However, the men of Beth-shemesh looked upon it as proper to make this
 use of them, because it was by no means fit that ever they should be 
 put to any other use; never shall that cart carry any common thing that 
 has once carried that sacred symbol of the divine presence: and the 
 kine had been under such an immediate guidance of heaven that God had, 
 as it were, already laid claim to them; they were servants to him, and 
 therefore must be sacrifices to him, and no doubt were accepted, though 
 females, whereas, in strictness, every burnt-offering was to be a male.

 3. They deposited the ark, with a chest of jewels that the Philistines
 presented, upon the great stone in the open field, a cold lodging for 
 the ark of the Lord and a very mean one; yet better so than in Dagon's 
 temple, or in the hands of the Philistines. It is desirable to see the 
 ark in its habitation in all the circumstances of solemnity and 
 splendour; but better have it upon a great stone, and in the fields of 
 the wood, than be without it. The intrinsic grandeur of instituted 
 ordinances ought not to be diminished in our eyes by the meanness and 
 poverty of the place where they are administered. As the burning of the 
 cart and cows that brought home the ark might be construed to signify 
 their hopes that it should never be carried away again out of the land 
 of Israel, so the setting of it upon a great stone might signify their 
 hopes that it should be established again upon a firm foundation. The 
 church is built upon a rock. 

 4. They offered the sacrifices of thanksgiving to God, some think upon
 the great stone, more probably upon an altar of earth made for the 
 purpose, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 And, the case being extraordinary, the law for offering at the altar in
 the court of the tabernacle was dispensed with, and the more easily
 because Shiloh was now dismantled; God himself had forsaken it, and the
 ark, which was its chief glory, they had with them here.  Beth-shemesh,
 though it lay within the lot of the tribe of Dan, yet belonged to
 Judah, so that this accidental bringing of the ark hither was an
 indication of its designed settlement there, in process of time; for,
 when God <I>refused the tabernacle of Joseph, he chose the tribe of
 Judah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:67,68">Ps. lxxviii. 67, 68</A>.

 It was one of those cities which were assigned out of the lot of Judah
 to the <I>sons of Aaron,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:16">Josh. xxi. 16</A>.

 Whither should the ark go but to a priests' city? And it was well they
 had those of that sacred order ready (for though they are here called
 <I>Levites,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>,

 yet it should seem they were priests) both to take down the ark and to
 offer the sacrifices.

 5. The lords of the Philistines returned to Ekron, much affected, we
 may suppose, with what they had seen of the glory of God and the zeal 
 of the Israelites, and yet not reclaimed from the worship of Dagon; for 
 how seldom <I>has a nation changed its gods, though they were no 
 gods!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:11">Jer. ii. 11</A>.
 
 Though they cannot but think the God of Israel <I>glorious in holiness
 and fearful in praises,</I> yet they are resolved they will think 
 Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, at least as good as he, and to him they 
 will cleave because he is theirs. 

 6. Notice is taken of the continuance of the great stone in the same
 place; there it is <I>unto this day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 because it remained a lasting memorial of this great event, and served
 to support the traditional history by which it was transmitted to 
 posterity. The fathers would say to the children, "This is the stone 
 upon which the ark of God was set when it came out of the Philistines' 
 hands, a thing never to be forgotten."</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 1. The sin of the men of Beth-shemesh: <I>They looked into the ark of
 the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Every Israelite had heard great talk of the ark, and had been possessed
 with a profound veneration for it; but they had been told that it was 
 lodged within a veil, and even the high priest himself might not look 
 upon it but once a year, and then through a cloud of incense. Perhaps 
 this made many say (as we are apt to covet that which is forbidden) 
 what a great deal they would give for a sight of it.  Some of these 
 Beth-shemites, we may suppose, for that reason, <I>rejoiced to see the 
 ark</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 more than for the sake of the public. Yet this did not content them;
 they might see it, but they would go further, they would take off the 
 covering, which it is likely was nailed or screwed on, and look into 
 it, under pretence of seeing whether the Philistines had not taken the 
 two tables out of it or some way damaged them, but really to gratify a 
 sinful curiosity of their own, which intruded into those things that 
 God had thought fit to conceal from them. Note, It is a great affront 
 to God for vain men to pry into and meddle with the secret things which 
 belong not to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:29,Col+2:18">Deut. xxix. 29; Col. ii. 18</A>.

 We were all ruined by an ambition of forbidden knowledge. That which
 made this looking into the ark a great sin was that it proceeded from a 
 very low and mean opinion of the ark. The familiarity they had with it 
 upon this occasion bred contempt and irreverence. Perhaps they presumed 
 upon their being priests; but the dignity of the ministerial office 
 will be so far from excusing that it will aggravate a careless and 
 irreverent treatment of holy things. They should, by their example, 
 have taught others to keep their distance and look upon the ark with a 
 holy awe.  Perhaps they presumed upon the kind entertainment they had 
 given the ark, and the sacrifices they had now offered to welcome it 
 home with, for which they thought the ark was indebted to them, and 
 they might be allowed to repay themselves with the satisfaction of 
 looking into it. But let no man think that his service done for God 
 will justify him in any instance of disrespect or irreverence towards 
 the things of God. Or it may be they presumed upon the present mean 
 circumstances the ark was in, newly come out of captivity, and 
 unsettled; now that it stood upon a cold stone, they thought they might 
 make free with it; they should never have such another opportunity of 
 being familiar with it. It is an offence to God if we think meanly of 
 his ordinances because of the meanness of the manner of their 
 administration. Had they looked with an understanding eye upon the ark, 
 and not judged purely by outward appearance, they would have thought 
 that the ark never shone with greater majesty than it did not. It had 
 triumphed over the Philistines, and come out of its house of bondage 
 (like Christ out of the grave) by its own power; had they considered 
 this, they would not have looked into it thus, as a common chest. 

 2.  Their punishment for this sin: <I>He smote the men of Beth-shemesh,
 many of them, with a great slaughter.</I> How jealous is God for the 
 honour of his ark! He will not suffer it to be profaned.  <I>Be not 
 deceived, God is not mocked.</I> Those that will not fear his goodness, 
 and reverently use the tokens of his grace, shall be made to feel his 
 justice, and sink under the tokens of his displeasure. Those that pry 
 into what is forbidden, and come too near to holy fire, will find it is 
 at their peril. <I>He smote</I> 50,070 <I>men.</I> This account of the 
 numbers smitten is expressed in a very unusual manner in the original, 
 which, besides the improbability that there should be so many guilty 
 and so many slain, occasions many learned men to question whether we 
 take the matter aright. In the original it is, <I>He smote in</I> (or 
 among) <I>the people three score and ten men, fifty thousand men.</I> 
 The Syriac and Arabic read it, <I>five thousand and seventy men.</I> 
 The Chaldee reads it, <I>seventy men of the elders, and fifty thousand 
 of the common people.  Seventy men as valuable as</I> 50,000, so some, 
 because they were priests. Some think the seventy men were the 
 Beth-shemites that were slain for looking into the ark, and the 50,000 
 were those that were slain by the ark, in the land of the Philistines.  
 <I>He smote seventy men,</I> that is, <I>fifty out of a thousand,</I> 
 which was one in twenty, a half decimation; so some understand it. The 
 Septuagint read it much as we do, <I>he smote seventy men, and fifty 
 thousand men.</I> Josephus says only seventy were smitten. 

 3. The terror that was struck upon the men of Beth-shemesh by this
 severe stroke. They said, as well they might, <I>Who is able to stand 
 before this holy Lord God?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Some think this expresses their murmuring against God, as if he had
 dealt hardly and unjustly with them. Instead of quarrelling with 
 themselves and their own sins, they quarrelled with God and his 
 judgments; as <I>David was displeased,</I> in a case not much 
 dissimilar,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:8,9">2 Sam. vi. 8, 9</A>.

 I rather think it intimates their awful and reverent adoration of God,
 as the Lord God, as a holy Lord God, and as a God before whom none is 
 able to stand.  This they infer from that tremendous judgment, "Who is 
 able to stand before the God of the ark?" To stand before God to 
 worship him (blessed be his name) is not impossible; we are through 
 Christ invited, encouraged, and enabled to do it, but to stand before 
 God to contend with him we are not able. Who is able to stand before 
 the throne of his immediate glory, and look full upon it? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:16">1 Tim. vi. 16</A>.
 
 Who is able to stand before the tribunal of his enflexible justice, and
 make his part good there? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:3,143:2">Ps. cxxx. 3; cxliii. 2</A>.

 Who is able to stand before the arm of his provoked power, and either
 resist or bear the strokes of it? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:7">Ps. lxxvi. 7</A>.

 4. Their desire, hereupon, to be rid of the ark. They asked, <I>To whom
 shall he go up from us?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 They should rather have asked, "How may we make our peace with him, and
 recover his favour?"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:6,7">Mic. vi. 6, 7</A>.
 
 But they begin to be as weary of the ark as the Philistines had been,
 whereas, if they had treated it with due reverence, who knows but it 
 might have taken up its residence among them, and they had all been 
 blessed for the ark's sake? But thus, when the word of God works with 
 terror on sinners' consciences, they, instead of taking the blame and 
 shame to themselves, quarrel with the word, and put it from them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:10">Jer. vi. 10</A>.

 They sent messengers to the elders of Kirjath-jearim, a strong city
 further up in the country, and begged of them to come and fetch the ark 
 up thither,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 They durst not touch it to bring it thither themselves, but stood aloof
 from it as a dangerous thing. Thus do foolish men run from one extreme 
 to the other, from presumptuous boldness to slavish shyness. 
 Kirjath-jearim, that is, <I>the city of woods,</I> belonged to Judah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:9,60">Josh. xv. 9, 60</A>.

 It lay in the way from Beth-shemesh to Shiloh, so that when they sent
 to them to fetch it, we may suppose, they intended that the elders of 
 Shiloh should fetch it thence, but God intended otherwise. Thus was it 
 sent from town to town, and no care taken of it by the public, a sign 
 that there was no king in Israel.</P>
