 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the
 house of Judah and Benjamin a hundred and fourscore thousand
 chosen <I>men,</I> which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that
 he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
 &nbsp; 2  But the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came to Shemaiah the man of God,
 saying,
 &nbsp; 3  Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to
 all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
 &nbsp; 4  Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against
 your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is
 done of me. And they obeyed the words of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and returned
 from going against Jeroboam.
 &nbsp; 5  And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence
 in Judah.
 &nbsp; 6  He built even Beth-lehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,
 &nbsp; 7  And Beth-zur, and Shoco, and Adullam,
 &nbsp; 8  And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,
 &nbsp; 9  And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,
 &nbsp; 10  And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which <I>are</I> in Judah and
 in Benjamin fenced cities.
 &nbsp; 11  And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them,
 and store of victual, and of oil and wine.
 &nbsp; 12  And in every several city <I>he put</I> shields and spears, and
 made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his
 side.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 How the ten tribes deserted the house of David we read in the foregoing 
 chapter. They had formerly sat loose to that family 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:1,2">2 Sam. xx. 1, 2</A>),
 
 and now they quite threw it off, not considering how much it would
 weaken the common interest and take Israel down from that pitch of 
 glory at which it had arrived in the last reign. But thus the 
 <I>kingdom</I> must be corrected as well as the <I>house</I> of David. 
 
 1. Rehoboam at length, like a bold man, raises an army, with a design
 to reduce the revolters, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Judah and Benjamin were not only resolved to continue their allegiance
 to him, but ready to give him the best assistance they could for the 
 recovery of his right. Judah was his own tribe, that owned him some 
 years before the rest did; Benjamin was the tribe in which Jerusalem, 
 or the greatest part of it, stood, which perhaps was one reason why 
 that tribe clave to him. 

 2. Yet, like a conscientious man, when God forbade him to prosecute
 this design, in obedience to him he let it fall, either because he 
 reverenced the divine authority or because he knew that he should not 
 prosper if he should go contrary to God's command, but instead of 
 retrieving what was lost would be in danger of losing what he had. It 
 is dangerous undertaking any thing, but especially undertaking a war, 
 contrary to the will of God. God calls him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>Rehoboam the son of Solomon,</I> to intimate that this was
 determined for the sin of Solomon, and it would be to no purpose to 
 oppose a decree that had gone forth. They <I>obeyed the words of the 
 Lord;</I> and though it looked mean, and would turn to their reproach 
 among their neighbours, yet, because God would have it so, they laid 
 down their arms. 

 3. Like a discreet man, he fortified his own country.  He saw it was to
 no purpose to think of reducing those that had revolted. A few good 
 words might have prevented their defection, but now all the forces of 
 his kingdom cannot bring them back. The think is done, and so it must 
 rest; it is his wisdom to make the best of it.  Perhaps the same young 
 counsellors that had advised him to answer them roughly urged him to 
 fight them, notwithstanding the divine inhibition; but he had paid 
 dearly enough for being advised by them, and therefore now, we may 
 suppose, his aged and experienced counsellors were hearkened to, and 
 they advised him to submit to the will of God concerning what was lost, 
 and to make it his business to keep what he had. It was probably by 
 their advice that,

 (1.) He fortified his frontiers, and many of the principal cities of
 his kingdom, which, in Solomon's peaceable reign, no care had been 
 taken for the defence of. 

 (2.) He furnished them with good stores of victuals and arms, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 Because God forbade him to fight, he did not therefore sit down
 sullenly, and say that he would do nothing for the public safety if he 
 might not do that, but prudently provided against an attack. Those that 
 may not be conquerors, yet may be builders.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And the priests and the Levites that <I>were</I> in all Israel
 resorted to him out of all their coasts.
 &nbsp; 14  For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and
 came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast
 them off from executing the priest's office unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 15  And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the
 devils, and for the calves which he had made.
 &nbsp; 16  And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set
 their hearts to seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to
 sacrifice unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of their fathers.
 &nbsp; 17  So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam
 the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they
 walked in the way of David and Solomon.
 &nbsp; 18  And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the
 son of David to wife, <I>and</I> Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son
 of Jesse;
 &nbsp; 19  Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.
 &nbsp; 20  And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which
 bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
 &nbsp; 21  And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all
 his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and
 threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and
 threescore daughters.)
 &nbsp; 22  And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, <I>to
 be</I> ruler among his brethren: for <I>he thought</I> to make him king.
 &nbsp; 23  And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children
 throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every
 fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he
 desired many wives.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How Rehoboam was strengthened by the accession of the priests and 
 Levites, and all the devout and pious Israelites, to him, even all that 
 were true to their God and their religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Jeroboam cast them off, that is, he set up such a way of worship as 
 he knew they could not in conscience comply with, which obliged them to 
 withdraw from his altar, and at the same time he would not allow them 
 to go up to Jerusalem to worship at the altar there; so that he totally 
 <I>cast them off from executing the priest's office,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 And very willing he was that they should turn themselves out of their
 places, that room might be made for those mean and scandalous persons 
 whom he <I>ordained priests for the high places,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:31">1 Kings xii. 31</A>.

 No marvel if he that cast off God cast off his ministers; they were not
 for his purpose, would not do whatever he might bid them do, would not 
 <I>serve his gods, nor worship the golden image which he had set 
 up.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They thereupon <I>left their suburbs and possessions,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Out of the lot of each tribe the Levites had cities allowed them, where
 they were comfortable provided for and had opportunity of doing much 
 good. But now they were driven out of all their cities except those in 
 Judah and Benjamin. One would think their maintenance well settled, and 
 yet they lost it. It was a comfort to them that the law so often 
 reminded them that the <I>Lord was their inheritance,</I> and so they 
 should find him when they were turned out of their house and 
 possessions. But why did they leave their possessions?

 (1.) Because they saw they could do no good among their neighbours, in
 whom (now that Jeroboam set up his calves) the old proneness to
 idolatry revived.

 (2.) Because they themselves would be in continual temptation to some
 base compliances, and in danger of being drawn insensibly to that which 
 was evil. If we pray, in sincerity, not to be led into temptation, we 
 shall get and keep as far as we can out of the way of it. 

 (3.) Because, if they retained their integrity, they had reason to
 expect persecution from Jeroboam and his sons. The priests they made 
 for the devils would not let the Lord's priests be long among them. No 
 secular advantages whatsoever should draw us thither, or detain us 
 there, where we are in danger of making shipwreck of faith and a good 
 conscience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They <I>came to Judah and Jerusalem</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 and <I>presented themselves to Rehoboam,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>,

 <I>margin.</I> Where should God's priests and Levites be, but where his
 altar was?  Thither they came because it was their business to attend 
 at the times appointed.

 (1.) It was a mercy to them that they had a place of refuge to flee to, 
 and that when Jeroboam cast them off there were those so near that 
 would entertain them, and bid them welcome, and they were not forced 
 into the lands of the heathen.

 (2.) It was an evidence that they loved their work better than their 
 maintenance, in that they <I>left their suburbs and possessions in the 
 country</I> (where they might have lived at ease upon their own), 
 because they were restrained from serving God there, and cast 
 themselves upon God's providence and the charity of their brethren in 
 coming to a place where they might have the free enjoyment of God's 
 ordinances, according to his institution. Poverty in the way of duty is 
 to be chosen rather than plenty in the way of sin. Better live upon 
 alms, or die in a prison, with a good conscience, than roll in wealth 
 and pleasure with a prostituted one.

 (3.) It was the wisdom and praise of Rehoboam and his people that they 
 bade them welcome, though they crowded themselves perhaps to make room 
 for them.  Conscientious refugees will bring a blessing along with them 
 to the countries that entertain them, as they leave a curse behind them 
 with those that expel them. <I>Open the gates, that the righteous 
 nation, which keepeth truth, may enter in;</I> it will be good policy. 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:1,2">Isa. xxvi. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. When the priests and Levites came to Jerusalem all the devout pious 
 Israelites of every tribe followed them. Such as <I>set their hearts to 
 seek the Lord God of Israel,</I> that made conscience of their duty to 
 God and were sincere and resolute in it, left the inheritance of their 
 fathers and went and took houses in Jerusalem, that they might have 
 free access to the altar of God and be out of the temptation to worship 
 the calves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) That is best for us which is best for our souls; and, in all our
 choices, advantages for religion must take place of all outward 
 conveniences.

 (2.) Where God's faithful priests are his faithful people should be. If
 Jeroboam cast off God's ministers, every true-born Israelite will think 
 himself obliged to own them and stand by them. <I>Forsake not the 
 Levite,</I> the out-cast Levite, <I>as long as thou livest.</I> When 
 <I>the ark removes do you remove and go after it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:3">Josh. iii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They <I>strengthened the kingdom of Judah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 not only by the addition of so many persons to it, who, it is likely,
 brought what they could of their effects with them, but by their piety 
 and their prayers they procured a blessing upon the kingdom which was a 
 sanctuary to them. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:5">Zech. xii. 5</A>.

 It is the interest of a nation to protect and encourage religion and
 religious people, and adds more than any thing to its strength. They 
 made him and his people <I>strong three years;</I> for so long they 
 <I>walked in the way of David and Solomon,</I> their <I>good</I> way. 
 But when they forsook that, and so threw themselves out of God's favour 
 and protection, the best friends they had could no longer help to 
 strengthen them. We retain our strength while we cleave to God and our 
 duty, and no longer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How Rehoboam was weakened by indulging himself in his pleasures. He 
 <I>desired many wives,</I> as his father did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 yet, 

 1. In <I>this</I> he was more wise than his father, that he does not
 appear to have married strange wives. The wives mentioned here were not 
 only daughters of Israel, but of the family of David; one was a 
 descendant from Eliab, David's brother

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 another from Absalom, probably that Absalom who was David's son

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 another from Jerimoth, David's son. 

 2. In <I>this</I> he was more happy than his father, that he had many
 sons and daughters; whereas we read not of more than one son that his 
 father had. One can scarcely imagine that he had no more; but, if he 
 had, they were not worth mentioning; whereas several of Rehoboam's sons 
 are here named

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>)

 as men of note, and such active men that he thought it his wisdom to
 <I>disperse them throughout the countries of Judah and Benjamin</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 either, 

 (1.) That they might not be rivals with his son Abijah, whom he
 designed for his successor, or rather,

 (2.) Because he could repose a confidence in them for the preserving of
 the public peace and safety, could trust them with fenced cities, which 
 he took care to have well victualled, that they might stand him in 
 stead in case of an invasion. After-wisdom is better than none at all; 
 nay, they say, "Wit is never good till it is bought;" though he was 
 dearly bought with the loss of a kingdom.</P>
