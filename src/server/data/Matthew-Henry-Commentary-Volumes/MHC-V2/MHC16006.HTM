 The cries of oppressed poverty being stilled, we are now to enquire how
 the building of the wall goes forward, and in this chapter we find it
 carried on with vigour and finished with joy, notwithstanding the
 restless attempts of the gates of hell to hinder it. How the Jews'
 enemies were baffled in their design to put a stop to it by force we
 read before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+4:1-23"><I>ch.</I> iv.</A>

 Here we find how their endeavours to drive Nehemiah off from it were
 frustrated. 

 I. When they courted him to an interview, with design to do him a
 mischief, he would not stir, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. When they would have made him believe his undertaking was
 represented as seditious and treasonable, he regarded not the 
 insinuation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.

 III. When they hired pretended prophets to advise him to retire into
 the temple for his own safety, still he kept his ground, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:10-14">ver. 10-14</A>.

 IV.  Notwithstanding the secret correspondence that was kept up between
 them and some false and treacherous Jews, the work was finished in a
 short time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:15-19">ver. 15-19</A>.

 Such as these were the struggles between the church and its enemies.  
 But great is God's cause and it will be prosperous and victorious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem
 the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had
 builded the wall, and <I>that</I> there was no breach left therein;
 (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)
 &nbsp; 2  That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us
 meet together in <I>some one of</I> the villages in the plain of Ono.
 But they thought to do me mischief.
 &nbsp; 3  And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I <I>am</I> doing a great
 work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease,
 whilst I leave it, and come down to you?
 &nbsp; 4  Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I
 answered them after the same manner.
 &nbsp; 5  Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the
 fifth time with an open letter in his hand;
 &nbsp; 6  Wherein <I>was</I> written, It is reported among the heathen, and
 Gashmu saith <I>it, that</I> thou and the Jews think to rebel: for
 which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their
 king, according to these words.
 &nbsp; 7  And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at
 Jerusalem, saying, <I>There is</I> a king in Judah: and now shall it
 be reported to the king according to these words. Come now
 therefore, and let us take counsel together.
 &nbsp; 8  Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done
 as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.
 &nbsp; 9  For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be
 weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, <I>O
 God,</I> strengthen my hands.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two plots upon Nehemiah we have here an account of, how cunningly they 
 were laid by his enemies and how happily frustrated by God's good 
 providence and his prudence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A plot to trepan him into a snare. The enemies had an account of the
 good forwardness the work was in, that all the breaches of the wall 
 were made up, so that they considered it as good as done, though at 
 that time the <I>doors of the gates</I> were off the hinges 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);
 
 they must therefore now or never, by one bold stroke, take off
 Nehemiah. They heard how well guarded he was, so that there was no 
 attacking him upon the spot; they will therefore try by all the arts of 
 wheedling to get him among them. Observe, 

 1. With what hellish subtlety they courted him to meet them, not in any
 city, lest that should excite a suspicion that they intended to secure 
 him, but in a village in the lot of Benjamin: "<I>Come, let us meet 
 together</I> to consult about the common interests of our provinces." 
 Or they would have him think that they coveted his friendship, and 
 would be glad to be better acquainted with him, in order to a good 
 understanding between them and the settling of a good correspondence. 
 <I>But they thought to do him a mischief.</I> It is probable that he 
 had some secret intelligence given him that they designed to imprison 
 or murder him; or he knew them so well that, without breach of charity, 
 he concluded they aimed at his life, and therefore, when they <I>spoke 
 fair, he believed them not.</I> 

 2. See with what heavenly wisdom he declined the motion. His <I>God did
 instruct him</I> to give them that prudent answer by messengers of his 
 own: "<I>I am doing a great work,</I> am very busy, and am loth to let 
 the work stand still while I leave it to <I>come down to you,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 His care was that the work might not cease; he knew it would if he left
 it ever so little; and <I>why should it cease while I come down to 
 you?</I> He says nothing of his jealousies, nor reproaches them for 
 their treacherous design, but gives them a good reason and one of the 
 true reasons why he would not come. Compliment must always give way to 
 business. Let those that are tempted to idle merry meetings by their 
 vain companions thus answer the temptation, "We have work to do, and 
 must not neglect it." Four times they attacked him with the same 
 solicitation, and he as often returned the same answer, which, we may 
 suppose, was very vexatious to them; for really it was the ceasing of 
 the work that they aimed at, and it would make them despair of breaking 
 the undertaking to see the undertaker so intent upon it. <I>I answered 
 them</I> (says he) <I>after the same manner,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Note, We must never suffer ourselves to be overcome by the greatest
 importunity to do any thing sinful or imprudent; but, when we are 
 attacked with the same temptation, must still resist it with the same 
 reason and resolution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A plot to terrify him from his work. Could they but drive him off, 
 the work would cease of course. This therefore Sanballat attempts, but 
 in vain. 

 1. He endeavours to possess Nehemiah with an apprehension that his
 undertaking to build the walls of Jerusalem was generally represented 
 as factious and seditious, and would be resented accordingly at court, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.

 The best men, even in their most innocent and excellent performances,
 have lain under this imputation. This is written to him in <I>an open 
 letter,</I> as a thing generally known and talked of, that it was 
 reported among the nations, and Gashmu will aver it for truth, that 
 Nehemiah was aiming to make himself king and to shake off the Persian 
 yoke. Note, It is common for that which is the sense only of the 
 malicious to be falsely represented by them as the sense of the many. 
 Now Sanballat pretends to inform Nehemiah of this as a friend, that he 
 might hasten to court to clear himself, or stay his proceedings, for 
 fear they should be thus misconstrued; at least, upon this surmise, he 
 urges him to give him the meeting--"<I>Let us take counsel together</I> 
 how to quell the report," hoping by this means either to take him off, 
 or at least to take him off from his business.  Thus were his words 
 <I>softer than oil,</I> and yet <I>war was in his heart,</I> and he 
 hoped, like Judas, to kiss and kill. But surely in vain is the net 
 spread in the sight of any bird. Nehemiah was soon aware what they 
 aimed at, to <I>weaken their hands from the work</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 and therefore not only denied that such things were true, but that they
 were reported; he was better known than to be thus suspected.  

 2. Thus he escaped the snare and kept his ground, nor would he be
 frightened by winds and clouds from sowing and reaping. Suppose it was 
 thus reported, we must never omit known duty merely for fear it should 
 be misconstrued; but, while we keep a good conscience, let us trust God 
 with our good name. But indeed it was not thus reported. God's people, 
 though sufficiently loaded with reproach, yet are not really so low in 
 reputation as some would have them thought to be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the midst of his complaint of their malice, in endeavouring to 
 frighten him, and so weaken his hands, he lifts up his heart to Heaven 
 in this short prayer: <I>Now therefore, O God! strengthen my hands.</I> 
 It is the great support and relief of good people that in all their 
 straits and difficulties they have a good God to go to, from whom, by 
 faith and prayer, they may fetch in grace to silence their fears and 
 <I>strengthen their hands</I> when their enemies are endeavouring to 
 fill them with fears and weaken their hands. When, in our Christian 
 work and warfare, we are entering upon any particular services or 
 conflicts, this is a good prayer for us to put up: "I have such a duty 
 to do, such a temptation to grapple with; <I>now therefore, O God!  
 strengthen my hands.</I>" Some read it, not as a prayer, but as a holy 
 resolution (for <I>O God</I> is supplied in our translation): <I>Now 
 therefore I will strengthen my hands.</I> Note, Christian fortitude 
 will be sharpened by opposition. Every temptation to draw us from duty 
 should quicken us so much the more to duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of
 Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who <I>was</I> shut up; and he said,
 Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and
 let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay
 thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
 &nbsp; 11  And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who <I>is there,</I>
 that, <I>being</I> as I <I>am,</I> would go into the temple to save his
 life? I will not go in.
 &nbsp; 12  And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he
 pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had
 hired him.
 &nbsp; 13  Therefore <I>was</I> he hired, that I should be afraid, and do
 so, and sin, and <I>that</I> they might have <I>matter</I> for an evil
 report, that they might reproach me.
 &nbsp; 14  My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to
 these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of
 the prophets, that would have put me in fear.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Jews' enemies leave no stone unturned, no way untried, to take 
 Nehemiah off from building the wall about Jerusalem. In order to this 
 they had tried to fetch him into the country to them, but in vain; now 
 they try to drive him into the temple for his own safety; let him be 
 any where but at his work. Observing him to be a cautious man, they 
 will endeavour to gain their point by making him cowardly.  
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How basely the enemies managed this temptation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That which they designed was to bring Nehemiah to do a foolish 
 thing, that they might laugh at him, and insult over him for doing it, 
 and so lessen his interest and influence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>That I should be afraid,</I> and so they might have <I>matter for an
 evil report,</I> and <I>might reproach me.</I> This was indeed doing 
 the devil's work, who is men's tempter that he may be their accuser, 
 draws men to sin that he may glory in their shame. The greatest 
 mischief our enemies can do us is to frighten us from our duty and 
 bring us to do what is sinful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The tools they made use of were a pretended prophet and prophetess, 
 whom they hired to persuade Nehemiah to quit his work and retire for 
 his own safety. The pretended prophet was Shemaiah, of whom it is said 
 that he was <I>shut up</I> in his own house, either under pretence of 
 retirement for meditation and to consult the mind of God or to give 
 Nehemiah a sign in like manner to make himself a recluse. It should 
 seem, Nehemiah had a value for him, for he went to his house to consult 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Other prophets there were, and one prophetess, Noadiah
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 that were in the interest of the Jews' enemies, pensioners to them and
 traitors to their country. Whether they pretended to inspiration does 
 not appear; they do not say, <I>Thus saith the Lord,</I> as the false 
 prophets of old did; if not so, yet they would be thought to excel in 
 divine knowledge, and human prudence, and to have uncommon measures of 
 insight and foresight, and were therefore consulted in difficult cases, 
 as prophets had been. These the enemies feed to be of counsel for them. 
 Let us hence take occasion to lament,

 (1.) The wickedness of such bad men as these prophets, that ever any
 should be so perfidious as to betray the cause of God and their country 
 even under the pretence of communion with God and concern for their 
 country.

 (2.) The unhappiness of such good men as Nehemiah, who are in danger of
 being imposed upon by such cheats, and to whom no temptation comes with 
 more force than that which comes under a colour of religion, of 
 revelation and devotion, and is brought by the hand of prophets.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The pretence was plausible. These prophets suggested to Nehemiah 
 that the enemies would come and slay him, <I>in the night</I> they 
 would slay him, which he had reason enough to believe was true; they 
 would, if they could, if they durst. They pretended to be much 
 concerned for his safety. The people would be all undone if any harm 
 should come to him; and therefore they very gravely advised him to hide 
 himself in the temple till the danger was over; that was a strong and 
 sacred place, where he would be under the special protection of Heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:5">Ps. xxvii. 5</A>.

 If Nehemiah had been prevailed upon to do this, immediately the people
 would both have left off their work and thrown down their arms, and 
 every one would have shifted for his own safety; and then the enemies 
 might easily, and without opposition, have demolished the works, broken 
 down the wall again, and so gained their point. Though 
 self-preservation is a fundamental principle of the law of nature, yet 
 that is not always the best and wisest counsel which pretends to go 
 upon that principle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See how bravely Nehemiah vanquished this temptation, and came off a 
 conqueror.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He immediately resolved not to yield to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 See here,

 (1.) What his reasonings are: "<I>Should such a man as I flee?</I>
 Shall I desert God's work, or discourage my own workmen whom I have 
 employed and encouraged? Shall I be over-credulous of report, and 
 over-solicitous about my own life? I that am the governor, on whom so 
 many eyes are, both of friends and foes? Another might flee, but not I.  
 <I>Who is there that being as I am,</I> in my post of honour, and 
 power, and trust, would go into the temple, and lurk there, when 
 business is to be done, yea, though it were to save his life?" Note, 
 When we are tempted to sin we should remember who and what we are, that 
 we may not do any thing unbecoming us, and the profession we make.  
 <I>It is not for kings, O Lemuel!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:4">Prov. xxxi. 4</A>.

 (2.) What was the result of his reasonings. He is at a point: "I will
 not go in. I will rather die at my work than live in an inglorious 
 retreat from it." Note, Holy courage and magnanimity will engage us, 
 whatever it cost us, never to <I>decline a good work,</I> nor ever to 
 <I>do a bad one.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was immediately aware of what was the rise of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>I perceived that God had not sent him,</I> that he gave this
 advice, not by any divine direction, ordinary or extraordinary, but 
 with a design against me." The wickedness of such mercenary wretches 
 will sooner or later be brought to light. Two things Nehemiah says he 
 dreaded in that which he was advised to:--

 (1.) Offending God: <I>That I should be afraid, and do so, and sin.</I>
 Note, Sin is that which above any thing we should dread; and a good
 preservative it is against sin to be afraid of nothing but sin. 

 (2.) Shaming himself: <I>That they might reproach me.</I> Note, Next to
 the sinfulness of sin we should dread the scandalousness of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He humbly begs of God to reckon with them for their base designs 
 upon him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>My God, think thou upon Tobiah,</I> and the rest of them,
 <I>according to their works.</I> As, when he had mentioned his own good 
 services, he did not covetously or ambitiously prescribe to God what 
 reward he should give him, but modestly prayed, <I>Think upon me, my 
 God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:19"><I>ch.</I> v. 19</A>),

 so here he does not revengefully imprecate any particular judgment upon
 his enemies, but refers the matter to God.  "Thou knowest their hearts, 
 and art the avenger of falsehood and wrong; take cognizance of this 
 cause; judge between me and them, and take what way and time thou 
 mayest please to call them to an account for it." Note, Whatever 
 injuries are done us we must not avenge ourselves, but commit our cause 
 to him that judgeth righteously.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <I>day</I> of
 <I>the month</I> Elul, in fifty and two days.
 &nbsp; 16  And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard
 <I>thereof,</I> and all the heathen that <I>were</I> about us saw <I>these
 things,</I> they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they
 perceived that this work was wrought of our God.
 &nbsp; 17  Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters
 unto Tobiah, and <I>the letters</I> of Tobiah came unto them.
 &nbsp; 18  For <I>there were</I> many in Judah sworn unto him, because he
 <I>was</I> the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son
 Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
 &nbsp; 19  Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my
 words to him. <I>And</I> Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Nehemiah is here finishing the wall of Jerusalem, and yet still has 
 trouble created him by his enemies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Tobiah, and the other adversaries of the Jews, had the mortification 
 to see the wall built up, notwithstanding all their attempts to hinder 
 it. The wall was begun and finished <I>in fifty-two days,</I> and yet 
 we have reason to believe they rested on the sabbaths, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Many were employed, and there was room for them; what they did they did
 cheerfully, and minded their business because they loved it. The 
 threats of their enemies, which were intended to weaken them, it is 
 likely, quickened them to go on with their work the more vigorously, 
 that they might get it done before the enemy came. Thus <I>out of the 
 eater came forth meat.</I> See what a great deal of work may be done in 
 a little time if we would set about it in earnest and keep close to 
 it.When the enemies heard that the wall was finished before they 
 thought it was well begun, and, when they doubted not but to put a stop 
 to it, they were <I>much cast down in their own eyes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 1.  They were ashamed of their own confidence that they should <I>cause
 the work to cease;</I> they were crest-fallen upon the disappointment. 
 
 2.  They envied the prosperity and success of the Jews, grieved to see
 the walls of Jerusalem built, while, it may be, the kings of Persia had 
 not permitted them thus to fortify the cities of Samaria. When Cain 
 envied his brother his <I>countenance fell,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:5">Gen. iv. 5</A>.

 3. They despaired of ever doing them the mischief they designed them,
 of bringing them down and making a prey of them; and well they might, 
 for they perceived, by the wonderful success, <I>that the work was 
 wrought of God.</I> Even these heathens had so much sense as,

 [1.] To see a special providence of God conversant about the affairs of
 the church when they did remarkably prosper. They <I>said among the 
 heathen, The Lord has done great things for them;</I> it is his doing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:2">Ps. cxxvi. 2</A>.

 God fighteth for Israel and worketh with them. 

 [2.] To believe that God's work would be perfect. When the perceived
 that the <I>work was of God</I> they expected no other than that it 
 would go on and prosper.  

 [3.] To conclude that, if it were of God, it was to no purpose to think
 of opposing it; it would certainly prevail and be victorious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Nehemiah had the vexation, notwithstanding this, to see some of his 
 own people treacherously corresponding with Tobiah and serving his 
 interest; and a great grief and discouragement, no doubt, it was to 
 him. 

 1. Even of the nobles of Judah there were those who had so little sense
 of honour and their country's good as to communicate with Tobiah by 
 letter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 They wrote with all the freedom and familiarity of friends to him, and
 welcomed his letters to them. Could nobles do a thing so mean?  Nobles 
 of Judah so wicked a thing? It seems great men are not always wise, not 
 always honest.

 2. Many in Judah were in a strict but secret confederacy with him to
 advance the interest of his country, though it would certainly be the 
 ruin of their own. They were <I>sworn unto him,</I> not as their 
 prince, but as their friend and ally, because both he and his son had 
 married daughters of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 See the mischief of marrying with strangers; for one heathen that was
 converted by it ten Jews were perverted.  When once they became akin to 
 Tobiah they soon became sworn to him. A sinful love leads to a sinful 
 league.

 3. They had the impudence to court Nehemiah himself into a friendship
 with him: "<I>They reported his good deeds before me,</I> represented 
 him as an intelligent gentleman and well worthy my acquaintance, an 
 honest gentleman and one that I might confide in." We are indeed 
 required to <I>speak ill of no man,</I> but never to speak well of bad 
 men.  <I>Those that forsake the law praise the wicked,</I>

 uttered Nehemiah's words to him, perverting them, no doubt, and putting 
 false constructions upon them, which furnished Tobiah with matter for 
 letters to put him in fear and so drive him from his work and 
 discourage him in it. Thus were all their thoughts against him for 
 evil, yet God thought upon him for good.</P>
