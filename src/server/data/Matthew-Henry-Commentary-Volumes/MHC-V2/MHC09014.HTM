 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We left the host of Israel in a very ill posture, in the close of the 
 foregoing chapter; we saw in them no wisdom, nor strength, nor 
 goodness, to give us ground to expect any other than that they should 
 all be cut off by the army of the Philistines; yet here we find that 
 infinite power which works without means, and that infinite goodness 
 which gives without merit, glorified in a happy turn to their affairs, 
 that still Samuel's words may be made good: "The Lord will not forsake 
 his people, for his great name's sake," 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:22"><I>ch.</I> xii. 22</A>.

 In this chapter we have, 

 I. The host of the Philistines trampled upon, and triumphed over, by
 the faith and courage of Jonathan, who unknown to his father 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:1-3">ver.  1-3</A>),

 with his armour-bearer only, made a brave attack upon them, encouraging 
 himself in the Lord his God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>.

 He challenged them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:8-12">ver. 8-12</A>),

 and, upon their acceptance of the challenge, charged them with such
 fury, or rather such faith, that he put them to flight, and set them
 one against another

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:13-14">ver. 13-15</A>),

 which gave opportunity to Saul and his forces, with other Israelites,
 to follow the blow, and gain a victory,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:16-23">ver. 16-23</A>.

 II. The host of Israel troubled and perplexed by the rashness and folly
 of Saul, who adjured the people to eat no food till night, which 

 1.  Brought Jonathan to a pr&aelig;munire,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:24-30">ver. 24-30</A>.

 2.  Was a temptation to the people, when the time of their fast had
 expired, to eat with the blood,, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:31-35">ver. 31-35</A>.

 Jonathan's error, through ignorance, had like to have been his death,
 but the people rescued him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:36-46">ver. 36-46</A>.

 III. In the close we have a general account of Saul's exploits

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:47,48">ver. 47, 48</A>)

 and of his family,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul
 said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go
 over to the Philistines' garrison, that <I>is</I> on the other side.
 But he told not his father.
 &nbsp; 2 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a
 pomegranate tree which <I>is</I> in Migron: and the people that <I>were</I>
 with him <I>were</I> about six hundred men;
 &nbsp; 3 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of
 Phinehas, the son of Eli, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s priest in Shiloh, wearing an
 ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.
 &nbsp; 4 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over
 unto the Philistines' garrison, <I>there was</I> a sharp rock on the
 one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the
 one <I>was</I> Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
 &nbsp; 5 The forefront of the one <I>was</I> situate northward over against
 Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.
 &nbsp; 6 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour,
 Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these
 uncircumcised: it may be that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will work for us: for
 <I>there is</I> no restraint to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to save by many or by few.
 &nbsp; 7 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that <I>is</I> in thine
 heart: turn thee; behold, I <I>am</I> with thee according to thy
 heart.
 &nbsp; 8 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto <I>these</I>
 men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.
 &nbsp; 9 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we
 will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.
 &nbsp; 10 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up:
 for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath delivered them into our hand: and this <I>shall
 be</I> a sign unto us.
 &nbsp; 11 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of
 the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews
 come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
 &nbsp; 12 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his
 armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a
 thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me:
 for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.
 &nbsp; 13 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet,
 and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan;
 and his armourbearer slew after him.
 &nbsp; 14 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his
 armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an
 half acre of land, <I>which</I> a yoke <I>of oxen might plow.</I>
 &nbsp; 15 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among
 all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also
 trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We must here take notice,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the goodness of God in restraining the Philistines, who had a 
 vast army of valiant men in the field, from falling upon that little 
 handful of timorous trembling people that Saul had with him, whom they 
 would easily have swallowed up at once. It is an invisible power that 
 sets bounds to the malice of the church's enemies, and suffers them not 
 to do that which we should think there is nothing to hinder them 
 from.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the weakness of Saul, who seems here to have been quite at a 
 loss, and unable to help himself. 

 1. He pitched his tent under a tree, and had but 600 men with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Where were now the 3000 men he had chosen, and put such a confidence
 in?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:2"><I>ch.</I>  xiii. 2</A>.

 Those whom he trusted too much to failed him when he most needed them.
 He durst not stay in Gibeah, but got into some obscure place, in the 
 uttermost part of the city, under a pomegranate-tree, under 
 <I>Rimmon</I> (so the word is), <I>Ha-Rimmon,</I> that Rimmon near 
 Gibeah, in the caves of which those 600 Benjamites that escaped his 
 themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:47">Judg. xx. 47</A>.

 Some think that there Saul took shelter, so mean and abject was his
 spirit, now that he had fallen under God's displeasure, every hour 
 expecting the Philistines upon him, and thereby the accomplishment of 
 Samuel's threatening,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:14"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 14</A>.

 Those can never think themselves safe that see themselves cast out of
 God's protection. 

 2. Now he sent for a priest, and the ark, a priest from Shiloh, and the
 ark from Kirjath-jearim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:3,18"><I>v.</I> 3, 18</A>.

 Saul had once offended by offering sacrifice himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:9"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 9</A>.
 
 Now he resolves never to fall into that error again, and therefore
 sends for a priest, and hopes to compromise the matter with God 
 Almighty by a particular reformation, as many do whose hearts are 
 unhumbled and unchanged. Samuel, the Lord's prophet, had forsaken him, 
 but he thinks he can make up that loss by commanding Ahiah, the Lord's 
 priest, to attend him, and <I>he</I> will not make him stay for him nor 
 reprove him, as Samuel had done, but will do just as he bids him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 Many love to have such ministers as will be what they would have them
 to be, and prophesy smooth things to them; and their caressing them 
 because they are priests, they hope, will atone for their enmity to 
 those ministers that deal faithfully and plainly with them. He will 
 also have the ark brought, perhaps to upbraid Samuel, who in the days 
 of his government, for aught that appears, had not made any public use 
 of it; or in hopes that this would make up the deficiency of his 
 forces; one would have supposed that they would never bring the ark 
 into the camp again, since, the last time, it not only did not save 
 them, but did itself fall into the Philistines' hands. But it is common 
 for those that have lost the substance of religion to be most fond of 
 the shadows of it, as here is a deserted prince courting a deserted 
 priest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Of the bravery and piety of Jonathan, the son of Saul, who was 
 much fitter than the father to wear the crown. "A sweet imp (says 
 bishop Hall) out of a crab-stock."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He resolved to go <I>incognito</I>--<I>unknown to any one,</I> into
 the camp of the Philistines; he did not acquaint his father with his 
 design, for he knew he would forbid him; nor the people, for he knew 
 they would all discourage him, and, because he resolved not to heed 
 their objections, he resolved not to hear them, nor ask their advice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:1,3"><I>v.</I> 1, 3</A>.

 Nor had he so great an opinion of the priest as to consult him, but,
 being conscious of a divine impulse putting him upon it, he threw 
 himself into the mouth of danger, in hope of doing service to his 
 country. The way of access to the enemies' camp is described

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>)
 
 as being peculiarly difficult, and their natural entrenchments
 impregnable, yet this does not discourage him; the strength and 
 sharpness of the rocks do but harden and whet his resolutions. Great 
 and generous souls are animated by opposition and take a pleasure in 
 breaking through it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He encouraged his armour-bearer, a young man that attended him, to 
 go along with him in the daring enterprise, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Come, and let us</I> put our lives in our hands, <I>and go over to
 the</I> enemies' <I>garrison,</I> and try what we can do to put them 
 into confusion." See whence he draws his encouragements.

 (1.) "They are uncircumcised, and have not the seal of the covenant in
 their flesh, as we have. Fear not, we shall do well enough with them, 
 for they are not under the protection of God's covenant as we are, 
 cannot call him theirs as we can, by the sign of circumcision." If such 
 as are enemies to us are also strangers to God, we need not fear them.

 (2.) "God is able to make us two victorious over their unnumbered
 regiments. <I>There is no restraint in the Lord,</I> no limitation to 
 the holy One of Israel, but it is all one to him <I>to save by many or 
 by few.</I>" This is a true easily granted in general, that it is all 
 alike to Omnipotence what the instruments are by which it works; and 
 yet it is not so easy to apply it to a particular case; when we are but 
 few and feeble then to believe that God can not only save us, but save 
 by us, this is an instance of faith, which, wherever it is, shall 
 obtain a good report. Let this strengthen the weak and encourage the 
 timid: let it be pleaded with God for the enforcing of our petitions 
 and with ourselves for the silencing of our fears: <I>It is nothing 
 with God to help, whether with many or with those that have no 
 power,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+14:11">2 Chron. xiv. 11</A>.

 (3.) "Who knows but he that can use us for his glory will do it? <I>It
 may be the Lord will work for us,</I> work with us, work a sign or 
 miracle for us." So the Chaldee. We may encourage ourselves with hope 
 that God will appear for us, though we have not ground on which to 
 build an assurance. An active faith will venture far in God's cause 
 upon an <I>it may be.</I> Jonathan's armour-bearer, or esquire, as if 
 he had learned to carry, not his arms only, but his heart, promised to 
 stand by him and to follow him whithersoever he went, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 We have reason to think that Jonathan felt a divine impulse and
 impression putting him upon this bold adventure, in which he was 
 encouraged by his servant's concurrence, otherwise the danger was so 
 great which he ran upon that he would have tempted God rather than 
 trusted him. And perhaps he had an actual regard to that word of Joshua

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+23:10">Josh. xxiii. 10</A>),
 
 <I>One man of you shall chase a thousand,</I> borrowed from Moses,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:30">Deut. xxxii. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How bold soever his resolution was, he resolved to follow Providence 
 in the execution of it, which, he believed, would guide him <I>with its 
 eye</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:8">Ps. xxxii. 8</A>),

 and which therefore he would carefully attend and take hints of
 direction from. See how he put himself upon Providence, and resolved to 
 be determined by it. "Come" (says he to his confidant), "we will 
 discover ourselves to the enemy, as those that are not afraid to look 
 them in the face

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and then, if they be so cautious as to bid us stand, we will advance no
 further, taking it for an intimation of Providence that God would have 
 us act defensively, and we will prepare as well as we can to give them 
 a warm reception

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 but if they be so presumptuous as to challenge us, and the first
 sentinel we meet with bid us march on, we will push forward, and make 
 as brisk an onset, assuredly gathering thence that it is the will of 
 God we should act offensively, and then not doubting but he will 
 <I>stand by us,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 And upon this issue he puts it, firmly believing, as we all should,

 (1.) That God has the governing of the hearts and tongues of all men,
 even of those that know him not, nor have any regard to him, and serves 
 his own purposes by them, though they mean not so, neither do their 
 hearts think so. Jonathan knew God could discover his mind to him if he 
 pleased, and would do it, since he depended upon him, as surely by the 
 mouth of a Philistine as by the mouth of a priest.

 (2.) That God will, some way or other, direct the steps of those that
 <I>acknowledge him in all their ways,</I> and seek unto him for 
 direction, with full purpose of heart to follow it. Sometimes we find 
 most comfort in that which is least our own doing, and into which we 
 have been led by the unexpected, but well observed, turns of 
 Providence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Providence gave him the sign he expected, and he answered the 
 signal. He and his armour-bearer did not surprise the Philistines when 
 they were asleep, but discovered themselves to them by day-light, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 The guards of the Philistines,

 (1.) Disdained them, upbraided them with the cowardice of many of their
 people, and looked upon them to be of the regiment of sneakers: 
 <I>Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of their holes.</I> If some of 
 Christ's soldiers play the coward, others that play the man may perhaps 
 be upbraided with it.

 (2.) They defied them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Come, and we will show you a thing,</I> as if they came like
 children to gaze about them; but meaning, as Goliath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:44"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 44</A>),

 that they would <I>give them as meat to the fowls of the air.</I> They
 bantered them, not doubting but to make a prey of them.  This greatly 
 emboldened Jonathan. With it he encouraged his servant; he had spoken 
 with uncertainty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>It may be the Lord will work for us;</I> but now he speaks with
 assurance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:12"><I>v.</I>  12</A>):

 <I>The Lord has delivered them,</I> not into our hands (he sought not
 his own glory), but <I>into the hand of Israel,</I> for he aimed at 
 nothing but the advantage of the public. His faith being thus 
 strengthened, no difficulty can stand before him; he climbs up the rock 
 upon all four

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 though he has nothing to cover him, nor any but his own servant to
 second him, nor any human probability of any thing but death before 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. The wonderful success of this daring enterprise. The Philistines, 
 instead of falling upon Jonathan, to slay him, or take him prisoner, 
 fell before him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 unaccountably, upon the first blows he gave.  They fell, that is,

 (1.) They were many of them slain by him and his armour-bearer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 Twenty Philistines fell presently. It was not so much the name of
 Jonathan that made them yield so tamely (though some think that this 
 had become terrible to them, since he smote one of their garrisons,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:3"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 3</A>),

 but it was God's right hand and his arm that got him this victory. 

 (2.) The rest were put to flight, and fell foul upon one another

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):
 
 <I>There was trembling in the host.</I> There was no visible cause for
 fear; they were so numerous, bold, and advantageously posted; the 
 Israelites had fled before them; not an enemy made head against them, 
 but one gentleman and his man; and yet they shook like an aspen-leaf. 
 The consternation was general: they all trembled; even <I>the 
 spoilers,</I> those that had been most bold and forward, shared in the 
 common fright, the joints of their loins were loosed, and their knees 
 smote one against another, and yet none of them could tell why or 
 wherefore. It is called <I>a trembling of God</I> (so the original 
 phrase is), signifying not only, as we render it, a very great 
 trembling, which they could not resist nor reason themselves clear of, 
 but that it was supernatural, and came immediately from the hand of 
 God. He that made the heart knows how to make it tremble.  To complete 
 the confusion, even the earth quaked, and made them ready to fear that 
 it would sink under them. Those that will not fear the eternal God, he 
 can make afraid of a shadow. See

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
 behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down
 <I>one another.</I>
 &nbsp; 17 Then said Saul unto the people that <I>were</I> with him, Number
 now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered,
 behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer <I>were</I> not <I>there.</I>
 &nbsp; 18 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For
 the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 19 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that
 the noise that <I>was</I> in the host of the Philistines went on and
 increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.
 &nbsp; 20 And Saul and all the people that <I>were</I> with him assembled
 themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's
 sword was against his fellow, <I>and there was</I> a very great
 discomfiture.
 &nbsp; 21 Moreover the Hebrews <I>that</I> were with the Philistines before
 that time, which went up with them into the camp <I>from the
 country</I> round about, even they also <I>turned</I> to be with the
 Israelites that <I>were</I> with Saul and Jonathan.
 &nbsp; 22 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in
 mount Ephraim, <I>when</I> they heard that the Philistines fled, even
 they also followed hard after them in the battle.
 &nbsp; 23 So the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> saved Israel that day: and the battle passed
 over unto Beth-aven.

 We have here the prosecution and improvement of the wonderful 
 advantages which Jonathan and his armour-bearer gained against the 
 Philistines.</P>

 <I>every man's sword was against his fellow.</I> When they fled for
 fear, instead of turning back upon those that chased them, they 
 reckoned those only their enemies that stood in their way, and treated 
 them accordingly. The Philistines were very secure, because all the 
 swords and spears were in their hands.  Israel had none except what 
 Saul and Jonathan had. But now God showed them the folly of that 
 confidence, by making their own swords and spears the instruments of 
 their own destruction, and more fatal in their own hands than if they 
 had been in the hands of Israel. See the like done,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:22,2Ch+20:23">Judg. vii. 22; 2 Chron. xx. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The Israelites were hereby animated against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Notice was soon taken of it by the watchmen of Saul, those that 
 stood sentinel at Gibeah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 They were aware that the host of the enemy was in great confusion, and
 that a great slaughter was made among them, and yet, upon search, they 
 found none of their own forces absent, but only Jonathan and his 
 servant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 which no doubt greatly animated them, and assured them that it could be
 no other than the Lord's doing, when there was no more of man's doing 
 than what those two could do against a great host.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Saul began to enquire of God, but soon desisted. His spirit had not 
 come down so far as to allow him to consult Samuel, though, it is 
 probable, he was near him; for we read 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:15"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 15</A>)

 that he had come to Gibeah of Benjamin; but he called for the ark 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 desiring to know whether it would be safe for him to attack the
 Philistines, upon the disorder they perceived them to be in. Many will 
 consult God about their safety that would never consult him about their 
 duty. But, perceiving by his scouts that the noise in the enemy's camp 
 increased, he commanded the priest that officiated to break off 
 abruptly: "<I>Withdraw thy hand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 consult no more, wait no longer for an answer." He was very unwise
 indeed if (as some think) he forbade him to lift up his hands in 
 prayer; for when Joshua was actually engaged with Amalek Moses 
 continued still to lift up his hands. It is rather a prohibition to his 
 enquiring of the Lord, either,

 (1.) Because now he thought he did not need an answer, the case was
 plain enough. And yet the more evident it was that God did all the more 
 reason he had to enquire whether he would give him leave to do any 
 thing. Or, 

 (2.) Because now he would not stay for it; he was in such haste to
 fight a falling enemy that he would not stay to make and end of his 
 devotions, nor hear what answer God would give him. A little thing will 
 divert a vain and carnal mind from religious exercises. He that 
 believeth will not make haste, such haste as this, nor reckon any 
 business so urgent as not to allow time to take God along with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He, and all the little force he had, made a vigorous attack upon the 
 enemy; and all the people <I>were cried together</I> (so the word is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 for want of the silver trumpets wherewith God appointed them to sound
 an alarm in the day of battle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:9">Num. x. 9</A>.

 They summoned them together by shouting, and their number was not so
 great but that they might soon be got together. And now they seem bold 
 and brave when the work is done to their hands. Our Lord Jesus had 
 conquered our spiritual enemies, routed and dispersed them, so that we 
 are cowards indeed if we will not stand to our arms when it is only to 
 pursue the victory and to divide the spoil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Every Hebrew, even those from whom one would least have expected it, 
 now turned his hand against the Philistines. 

 (1.) Those that had deserted and gone over to the enemy, and were among
 them, now fought against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Some think, they were such as had been taken prisoners by them, and now
 they were goads in their sides.  It rather seems that they went in to 
 them voluntarily, but, now that they saw them falling, recovered the 
 hearts of Israelites, and did valiantly for their country.

 (2.) Those that had fled their colours, and hid themselves in the
 mountains, returned to their posts, and joined in with the pursuers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 hoping by their great zeal and officiousness, now that the danger was
 over and the victory sure, to atone for their former cowardice. It was 
 not much to their praise to appear now, but it would have been more 
 their reproach if they had not appeared. Those that are remiss and 
 faint-hearted indeed that will not act in the cause of God when they 
 see it victorious, as well as righteous. Thus all hands were at work 
 against the Philistines, and every Israelite slew as many as he could, 
 without sword or spear; yet it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 it <I>was the Lord that saved Israel that day.</I> He did it by them,
 for without him they could do nothing. <I>Salvation is of the 
 Lord.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had
 adjured the people, saying, Cursed <I>be</I> the man that eateth <I>any</I>
 food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So
 none of the people tasted <I>any</I> food.
 &nbsp; 25 And all <I>they of</I> the land came to a wood; and there was
 honey upon the ground.
 &nbsp; 26 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the
 honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the
 people feared the oath.
 &nbsp; 27 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people
 with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that
 <I>was</I> in his hand, and dipped it in a honeycomb, and put his
 hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
 &nbsp; 28 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father
 straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed <I>be</I> the
 man that eateth <I>any</I> food this day. And the people were faint.
 &nbsp; 29 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I
 pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a
 little of this honey.
 &nbsp; 30 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day
 of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not
 been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
 &nbsp; 31 And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to
 Aijalon: and the people were very faint.
 &nbsp; 32 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and
 oxen, and calves, and slew <I>them</I> on the ground: and the people
 did eat <I>them</I> with the blood.
 &nbsp; 33 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have
 transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.
 &nbsp; 34 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say
 unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his
 sheep, and slay <I>them</I> here, and eat; and sin not against the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every
 man his ox with him that night, and slew <I>them</I> there.
 &nbsp; 35 And Saul built an altar unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: the same was the
 first altar that he built unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the distress of the children of Israel, even 
 in the day of their triumphs. Such alloys are all present joys subject 
 to. And such obstructions does many a good cause meet with, even when 
 it seems most prosperous, through the mismanagement of instruments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Saul forbade the people, under the penalty of a curse, to taste any 
 food that day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 Here we will suppose,

 1. That as king he had power to put his soldiers under this interdict,
 and to bind it on with a curse; and therefore they submitted to it, and 
 God so far owned it as to discover, by the lot, that Jonathan was the 
 delinquent that had meddled with the accursed thing (though 
 ignorantly), on which account God would not be at that time enquired of 
 by them. 

 2. That he did it with a good intention, lest the people, who perhaps
 had been kept for some time at short allowance, when they found plenty 
 of victuals in the deserted camp of the Philistines, should fall 
 greedily upon that, and so lose time in pursing the enemy, and some of 
 them, it may be, glut themselves to such a degree as not to be fit for 
 any more service that day. To prevent this, he forbade them to taste 
 any food, and laid himself, it is likely, under the same restraint. And 
 yet his making this severe order was,

 (1.) Impolitic and very unwise; for, if it gained time, it lost
 strength, for the pursuit.

 (2.) It was imperious, and disobliging to the people, and worse than
 <I>muzzling the mouth of the ox when he treads out the corn.</I> To 
 forbid them to feast would have been commendable, but to forbid them so 
 much as to taste, though ever so hungry, was barbarous.

 (3.) It was impious to enforce the prohibition with a curse and an
 oath. Had he no penalty less than an anathema wherewith to support his 
 military discipline? Death for such a crime would have been too much, 
 but especially death with a curse.  Though superiors may chide and 
 correct, they may not curse their inferiors; our rule is, <I>Bless, and 
 curse not.</I> When David speaks of an enemy he had that loved cursing 
 perhaps he meant Saul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+109:17,18">Ps. cix. 17, 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The people observed his order, but it had many inconveniences 
 attending it. 

 1. The soldiers were tantalized; for, in their pursuit of the enemy, it
 happened that they went through a wood so full of wild honey that it 
 dropped from the trees upon the ground, the Philistines having perhaps, 
 in their flight, broken in upon the honeycombs, for their own 
 refreshment, and left them running. Canaan flowed with honey, and here 
 is an instance of it. They sucked honey out of <I>the rock, the flinty 
 rock</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:13">Deut. xxxii. 13</A>);

 yet, for fear of the curse, they did not so much as taste the honey, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 Those are worthy of the name of Israelites that can deny themselves and
 their own appetites even when they are most craving, and the delights 
 of sense most tempting, for fear of guilt and a curse, and the table 
 becoming a snare. Let us never feed ourselves, much less feast 
 ourselves, without fear.

 2.  Jonathan fell under the curse through ignorance. He heard not of
 the charge his father had given; for, having bravely forced the lines, 
 he was then following the chase, and therefore might justly be looked 
 upon as exempted from the charge and intended in it. But it seems it 
 was taken for granted, and he himself did not object against it 
 afterwards, that it extended to him, though absent upon so good an 
 occasion. He, not knowing any peril in it, took up a piece of a 
 honey-comb, upon the end of his staff, and sucked it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 and was sensibly refreshed by it: <I>His eyes were enlightened,</I>
 which began to grow dim through hunger and faintness; it made his 
 countenance look pleasant and cheerful, for it was such as a stander-by 
 might discern

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>See how my eyes have been enlightened.</I> He thought no harm, nor
 feared any, till one of the people acquainted him with the order, and 
 then he found himself in a snare. Many a good son has been thus 
 entangled and distressed, in more ways than one, by the rashness of an 
 inconsiderate father. Jonathan, for his part, lost the crown he was 
 heir to by his father's folly, which, it may be, this was an ill omen 
 of. 

 3. The soldiers were faint, and grew feeble, in the pursuit of the
 Philistines. Jonathan foresaw this would be the effect of it; their 
 spirits would flag, and their strength would fail, for want of 
 sustenance.  Such is the nature of our bodies that they soon grow unfit 
 for service if they be not supplied with fresh recruits. Daily work 
 cannot be done without daily bread, which our Father in heaven 
 graciously gives us. It is <I>bread</I> that <I>strengthens man's 
 heart;</I> therefore Jonathan reasoned very well, <I>If the people had 
 eaten freely,</I> there would have been <I>a much greater slaughter</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>);

 but, as it was, they were <I>very faint, too much fatigued</I> (so the
 Chaldee), and began to think more of their meat than of their work. 

 4.  The worst effect of all was that at evening, when the restraint was
 taken off and they returned to their food again, they were so greedy 
 and eager upon it that they ate the flesh with the blood, expressly 
 contrary to the law of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 Two hungry meals, we say, make the third a glutton; it was so here.
 They would not stay to have their meat either duly killed (for they 
 slew the cattle upon the ground, and did not hang them up, as they used 
 to do, that the blood might all run out of them) or duly dressed, but 
 fell greedily upon it before it was half boiled or half roasted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 
 Saul, being informed of it, reproved them for the sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>You have transgressed;</I> but did not, as he should have done,
 reflect upon himself as having been accessory to it, and having <I>made 
 the Lord's people to transgress.</I> To put a stop to this 
 irregularity, Saul ordered them to set up a great stone before him, and 
 let all that had cattle to kill, for their present use, bring them 
 thither, and kill them under his eye upon that stone

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),
 
 and the people did so
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 so easily were they restrained and reformed when their prince took care
 to do his part. If magistrates would but use their power as they might, 
 people would be made better than they are with more ease than is 
 imagined.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. On this occasion Saul built an altar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>),

 that he might offer sacrifice, either by way of acknowledgment of the
 victory they had obtained or by the way of atonement for the sin they 
 had been guilty of. <I>The same was the first altar that he built,</I> 
 and perhaps the rolling of the great stone to kill the beasts on 
 reminded him of converting it into an altar, else he would not have 
 thought of it. Saul was turning aside from God, and yet now he began to 
 build altars, being most zealous (as many are) for the form of 
 godliness when he was denying the power of it. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:14">Hos. viii. 14</A>,

 <I>Israel has forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples.</I> Some read
 it, <I>He began to build that altar;</I> he laid the first stone, but 
 was so hasty to pursue his victory that he could not stay to finish 
 it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>36  And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by
 night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not
 leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good
 unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto
 God.
 &nbsp; 37 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the
 Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But
 he answered him not that day.
 &nbsp; 38 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the
 people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.
 &nbsp; 39 For, <I>as</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be
 in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But <I>there was</I> not a
 man among all the people <I>that</I> answered him.
 &nbsp; 40 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and
 Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said
 unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.
 &nbsp; 41 Therefore Saul said unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, Give a
 perfect <I>lot.</I> And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people
 escaped.
 &nbsp; 42 And Saul said, Cast <I>lots</I> between me and Jonathan my son.
 And Jonathan was taken.
 &nbsp; 43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
 Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with
 the end of the rod that <I>was</I> in mine hand, <I>and,</I> lo, I must
 die.
 &nbsp; 44 And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt
 surely die, Jonathan.
 &nbsp; 45 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
 wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: <I>as</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground;
 for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued
 Jonathan, that he died not.
 &nbsp; 46 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the
 Philistines went to their own place.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Saul's boasting against the Philistines. He proposed, as soon as his 
 soldiers had got their suppers, to pursue them all night, and <I>not 
 leave a man of them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 Here he showed much zeal, but little discretion; for his army, thus
 fatigued, could as ill spare a night's sleep as a meal's meat. But it 
 is common for rash and foolish men to consider nobody but themselves, 
 and, so that they might but have their humour, not to care what 
 hardships they put upon those that are under them.  However, the people 
 were so obsequious to their king that they would by no means oppose the 
 motion, but resolved to make the best of it, and, if he will go on, 
 they will follow him: <I>Do whatsoever seemeth good to thee.</I> Only 
 the priest thought it convenient to go on with the devotions that were 
 broken off abruptly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and to consult the oracle: <I>Let us draw near hither unto God.</I>
 Princes and great men have need of such about them as will thus be 
 their remembrancers, wherever they go, to take God along with them. 
 And, when the priest proposed it, Saul could not for shame reject the 
 proposal, but <I>asked counsel of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>):

 "<I>Shall I go down after the Philistines?</I> And shall I speed?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His falling foul on his son Jonathan: and the rest of this 
 paragraph is wholly concerning him: for, while he is prosecuted, the 
 Philistines make their escape. We know not what mischief may ensue upon 
 on rash resolve.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God, by giving an intimation of his displeasure, put Saul upon 
 searching for an accursed thing. When, by the priest, he consulted the 
 oracle, God <I>answered him not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 Note, When God denies our prayers it concerns us to enquire what the
 sin is that has provoked him to do so. <I>Let us see where the sin 
 is,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 For God's ear is not heavy that it cannot hear, but it is sin that
 separates between us and him. If God turns away our prayer, we have 
 reason to suspect it is for some iniquity regarding our hearts, which 
 we are concerned to find out, that we may put it away, may mortify it, 
 and put it to death. Saul swears by his Maker that whoever was the 
 Achan that troubled the camp, by eating the forbidden fruit, should 
 certainly die, though it were Jonathan himself, that is, though ever so 
 dear to himself and the people, little thinking that Jonathan was the 
 man

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 <I>He shall surely die,</I> the curse shall be executed upon him. But
 none of the people answered him, that is, none of those who knew 
 Jonathan had broken the order would inform against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Jonathan was discovered by lot to be the offender. Saul would have 
 lots cast between himself and Jonathan on the one side, and the people 
 on the other, perhaps because he was as confident of Jonathan's 
 innocency in this matter as of his own, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 The people, seeing him in a heat, durst not gainsay any thing he
 proposed, but acquiesced: <I>Do as seemeth good unto thee.</I> Before 
 he cast lots, he prayed that <I>God would give a perfect lot</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 that is, make a full discovery of this matter, or, as it is in the
 margin, that he would show the innocent. This was with an air of 
 impartial justice. Judges should desire that truth may come out, 
 whoever may suffer by it. Lots should be cast with prayer, because they 
 are a solemn appeal to Providence, and by them we beg of God to direct 
 and determine us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:24">Acts i. 24</A>),

 for which reason some have condemned games that depend purely upon lot
 or chance as making too bold with a sacred thing. Jonathan at length 
 was taken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>),

 Providence designing hereby to countenance and support a lawful
 authority, and to put an honour upon the administration of public 
 justice in general, reserving another way to bring off one that had 
 done nothing worthy of death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Jonathan ingenuously confesses the fact, and Saul, with an angry 
 curse, passes sentence upon him. Jonathan denies not the truth, nor 
 goes about to conceal it, only he thinks it hard that he must <I>die 
 for it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 He might very fairly have pleaded his invincible ignorance of the law,
 or have insisted upon his merit, but he submitted to the necessity with 
 a great and generous mind: "God's and my father's will be done:" thus 
 he showed as much valour in receiving the messengers of death himself 
 as in sending them among the Philistines.  It is as brave to yield in 
 some cases as it is in other cases to fight.  Saul is not mollified by 
 his filial submission nor the hardness of his case; but as one that 
 affected to be thought firm to his word, and much more to his oath; 
 even when it bound him hardest, with another imprecation he gives 
 judgment upon Jonathan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>):

 "<I>God do so and more also</I> to me if I do not execute the law upon
 thee, <I>for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.</I>"

 (1.) He passed this sentence too hastily, without consulting the
 oracle. Jonathan had a very good plea in arrest of the judgment. What 
 he had done was not <I>malum in se</I>--<I>bad in itself;</I> and, as 
 for the prohibition of it, he was ignorant of that, so that he could 
 not be charged with rebellion or disobedience.

 (2.) He did it in fury. Had Jonathan been worthy to die, yet it would
 have become a judge, much more a father, to pass sentence with 
 tenderness and compassion, and not with such an air of triumph, like a 
 man perfectly divested of all humanity and natural affection.  Justice 
 is debased when it is administered with wrath and bitterness.

 (3.) He backed it with a curse upon himself if he did not see the
 sentence executed; and this curse did return upon his own head. 
 Jonathan escaped, but God did so to Saul, and more also; for he was 
 rejected of God and made anathema. Let none upon any occasion dare to 
 use such imprecations as these, lest God say Amen to them, and <I>make 
 their own tongues to fall upon them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:8">Ps. lxiv. 8</A>.

 This stone will return upon him that rolleth it. Yet we have reason to
 think that Saul's bowels yearned toward Jonathan, so that he really 
 punished himself, and very justly, when he seemed so severe upon 
 Jonathan. God made him feel the smart of his own rash edict, which 
 might make him fear being again guilty of the like. By all these 
 vexatious accidents God did likewise correct him for his presumption in 
 offering sacrifice without Samuel. An expedition so ill begun could not 
 end without some rebukes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The people rescued Jonathan out of his father's hands, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.
 
 Hitherto they had expressed themselves very observant of Saul. What
 seemed good to him they acquiesced in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:36,40"><I>v.</I> 36, 40</A>.

 But, when Jonathan is in danger, Saul's word is no longer a law to
 them, but with the utmost zeal they oppose the execution of his 
 sentence: "<I>Shall Jonathan die</I>--that blessing, that darling, of 
 his country? Shall that life be sacrificed to a punctilio of law and 
 honour which was so bravely exposed for the public service, and to 
 which we owe our lives and triumphs? No, we will never stand by and see 
 him thus treated whom God delights to honour." It is good to see 
 Israelites zealous for the protection of those whom God has made 
 instruments of public good. Saul had sworn that Jonathan should die, 
 but they oppose their oath to his, and swear he shall not die: "<I>As 
 the Lord liveth there shall not</I> only not his head, but not <I>a 
 hair of his head fall to the ground;</I>" they did not rescue him by 
 violence, but by reason and resolution; and Josephus says they made 
 their prayer to God that he might be loosed from the curse. They 
 pleaded for him that <I>he has wrought with God this day;</I> that is, 
 "he has owned God's cause, and God has owned his endeavours, and 
 therefore his life is too precious to be thrown away upon a nicety." We 
 may suppose Saul had not so perfectly forgotten the relation of a 
 father but that he was willing enough to have Jonathan rescued, and 
 well pleased to have that done which yet he would not do himself: and 
 he that knows the heart of a father knows not how to blame him.</P>

 5. The design against the Philistines is quashed by this incident 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>):

 <I>Saul went up from following them,</I> and so an opportunity was lost
 of completing the victory. When Israel's shields are clashing with one 
 another the public safety and service suffer by it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>47  So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all
 his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children
 of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and
 against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he
 vexed <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 48 And he gathered a host, and smote the Amalekites, and
 delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.
 &nbsp; 49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and
 Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters <I>were these;</I> the
 name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:
 &nbsp; 50 And the name of Saul's wife <I>was</I> Ahinoam, the daughter of
 Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host <I>was</I> Abner, the
 son of Ner, Saul's uncle.
 &nbsp; 51 And Kish <I>was</I> the father of Saul; and Ner the father of
 Abner <I>was</I> the son of Abiel.
 &nbsp; 52 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days
 of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he
 took him unto him.

 Here is a general account of Saul's court and camp. 

 1. Of his court and family, the names of his sons and daughters

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>),

 and of his wife and his cousin-german that was general of his army, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>.
 
 There is mention of another wife of Saul's

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:8">2 Sam. xxi. 8</A>),

 Rizpah, a secondary wife, and of the children he had by her. 

 2. Of his camp and military actions. 

 (1.) How he levied his army: <I>When he saw any strong valiant man,</I>
 that was remarkably fit for service, <I>he took him unto him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>),

 as Samuel had told them the manner of the king would be

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:11"><I>ch.</I> viii. 11</A>);

 and, if he must have a standing army, it was his prudence to fill it up
 with the ablest men he could make choice of.  

 (2.) How he employed his army. He guarded his country against the 
 insults of its enemies on every side, and prevented their incursions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:47,48"><I>v.</I> 47, 48</A>.

 It is supposed that he acted only defensively against those that used
 to invade the borders of Israel; <I>and whithersoever he turned 
 himself,</I> as there was occasion, <I>he vexed them,</I> by checking 
 and disappointing them.  But the enemies he struggled most with were 
 the Philistines, with whom he had <I>sore war all his days,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>.

 He had little reason to be proud of his royal dignity, nor had any of
 his neighbours cause to envy him, for he had little enjoyment of 
 himself after he took the kingdom.  He could not vex his enemies 
 without some vexation to himself, such thorns are crowns quilted 
 with.</P>
