 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Into the book of the wars of the Lord the story of this chapter must be 
 brought, but it looks as sad and uncomfortable as any article in all 
 that history; for there is nothing in it that looks in the least bright 
 or pleasant but the pious zeal of Israel against the wickedness of the 
 men of Gibeah, which made it on their side a just and holy war; but 
 otherwise the obstinacy of the Benjamites in protecting their 
 criminals, which was the foundation of the war, the vast loss which the 
 Israelites sustained in carrying on the war, and (though the righteous 
 cause was victorious at last) the issuing of the war in the almost 
 utter extirpation of the tribe of Benjamin, make it, from first to 
 last, melancholy. And yet this happened soon after the glorious 
 settlement of Israel in the land of promise, upon which one would have 
 expected every thing to be prosperous and serene. In this chapter we 
 have, 

 I. The Levite's cause heard in a general convention of the tribes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.
 
 II. A unanimous resolve to avenge his quarrel upon the men of Gibeah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 III. The Benjamites appearing in defence of the criminals, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:12-17">ver.  12-17</A>.
 
 IV. The defeat of Israel in the first and second day's battle,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:18-25">ver. 18-25</A>.

 V. Their humbling themselves before God upon that occasion,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:26-28">ver.  26-28</A>.

 VI. The total rout they gave the Benjamites in the third engagement, by
 a stratagem, by which they were all cut off, except 600 men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:29-48">ver. 29-48</A>.

 And all this the effect of the indignities done to one poor Levite and 
 his wife; so little do those that do iniquity consider what will be the 
 end thereof.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the
 congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to
 Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in Mizpeh.
 &nbsp; 2 And the chief of all the people, <I>even</I> of all the tribes of
 Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of
 God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
 &nbsp; 3 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of
 Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel,
 Tell <I>us,</I> how was this wickedness?
 &nbsp; 4 And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain,
 answered and said, I came into Gibeah that <I>belongeth</I> to
 Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.
 &nbsp; 5 And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house
 round about upon me by night, <I>and</I> thought to have slain me: and
 my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.
 &nbsp; 6 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
 throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they
 have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
 &nbsp; 7 Behold, ye <I>are</I> all children of Israel; give here your
 advice and counsel.
 &nbsp; 8 And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any
 <I>of us</I> go to his tent, neither will we any <I>of us</I> turn into his
 house.
 &nbsp; 9 But now this <I>shall be</I> the thing which we will do to Gibeah;
 <I>we will go up</I> by lot against it;
 &nbsp; 10 And we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the
 tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand
 out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they
 may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all
 the folly that they have wrought in Israel.
 &nbsp; 11 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city,
 knit together as one man.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A general meeting of all the congregation of Israel to examine the 
 matter concerning the Levite's concubine, and to consider what was to 
 be done upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 It does not appear that they were summoned by the authority of any one 
 common head, but they came together by the consent and agreement, as it 
 were, of one common heart, fired with a holy zeal for the honour of God 
 and Israel. 

 1. The place of their meeting was <I>Mizpeh;</I> they gathered together 
 unto the Lord there, for Mizpeh was so very near to Shiloh that their 
 encampment might very well be supposed to reach from Mizpeh to Shiloh. 
 Shiloh was a small town, and therefore, when there was a general 
 meeting of the people to represent themselves before God, they chose 
 Mizpeh for their head-quarters, which was the next adjoining city of 
 note, perhaps because they were not willing to give that trouble to 
 Shiloh which so great an assembly would occasion, it being the resident 
 of the priests that attended the tabernacle. 

 2. The persons that met were all Israel, from Dan (the city very lately 
 so called,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:29"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 29</A>)

 in the north to Beersheba in the south, with the land of Gilead (that
 is, the tribes on the other side Jordan), all <I>as one man,</I> so 
 unanimous were they in their concern for the public good. Here was an 
 assembly of the people of God, not a convocation of the Levites and 
 priests, though a Levite was the person principally concerned in the 
 cause, but an assembly of the people, to whom the Levite referred 
 himself with an <I>Appello populum--I appeal to the people.</I> The 
 <I>people of God were</I> 400,000 <I>footmen that drew the sword,</I> 
 that is, were armed and disciplined, and fit for service, and some of 
 them perhaps such as had <I>known the wars of Canaan,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+3:1"><I>ch.</I> iii. 1</A>.

 In this assembly of all Israel, the chief (or corners) of the people
 (for rulers are the corner-stones of the people, that keep all 
 together) presented themselves as the representatives of the rest. They 
 rendered themselves at their respective posts, at the head of the 
 thousands and hundreds, the fifties and tens, over which they presided; 
 for so much order and government, we may suppose, at least, they had 
 among them, though they had no general or commander-in-chief. So that 
 here was,

 (1.) A general congress of the states for counsel. The chief of the 
 people presented themselves, to lead and direct in this affair. 

 (2.) A general rendezvous of the militia for action, all that drew 
 sword and were men of war

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 not hirelings nor pressed men, but the best freeholders, that went at 
 their own charge. Israel were above 600,000 when they came into Canaan, 
 and we have reason to think they were at this time much increased, 
 rather than diminished; but then all between twenty and sixty were 
 military men, now we may suppose more than the one half exempted from 
 bearing arms to cultivate the land; so that these were as the trained 
 bands. The militia of the two tribes and a half were 40,000

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+4:13">Josh. iv. 13</A>),
 
 but the tribes were many more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Notice given to the tribe of Benjamin of this meeting 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>They heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpeh.</I> 
 Probably they had a legal summons sent them to appear with their 
 brethren, that the cause might be fairly debated, before any 
 resolutions were taken up upon it, and so the mischiefs that followed 
 would have been happily prevented; but the notice they had of this 
 meeting rather hardened and exasperated them than awakened them to 
 think of the things that belonged to their peace and honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A solemn examination of the crime charged upon the men of Gibeah. 
 A very horrid representation of it had been made by the report of the 
 messengers that were sent to call them together, but it was fit it 
 should be more closely enquired into, because such things are often 
 made worse than really they were; a committee therefore was appointed 
 to examine the witnesses (upon oath, no doubt) and to report the 
 matter. It is only the testimony of the Levite himself that is here 
 recorded, but it is probable his servant, and the old man, were 
 examined, and gave in their testimony, for that more than one were 
 examined appears by the original 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 which is, <I>Tell you us;</I> and the law was that none should be put 
 to death, much less so many, upon the testimony of one witness only. 
 The Levite gives a particular account of the matter: that he came into 
 Gibeah only as a traveller to lodge there, not giving the least shadow 
 of suspicion that he designed them any ill turn 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and that the men of Gibeah, even those that were of substance among 
 them, that should have been a protection to the stranger within their 
 gates, riotously set upon the house where he lodged, and <I>thought to 
 slay him;</I> he could not, for shame relate the demand which they, 
 without shame, made, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:22"><I>ch.</I> xix. 22</A>.

 They declared their sin as Sodom, even the sin of Sodom, but his
 modesty would not suffer him to repeat it; it was sufficient to say 
 they would have slain him, for he would rather have been slain than 
 have submitted to their villany; and, if they had got him into their 
 hands, they would have abused him to death, witness what they had done 
 to his concubine: They have <I>forced her that she is dead,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 And, to excite in his countrymen an indignation at this wickedness, he 
 had sent pieces of the mangled body to all the tribes, which had 
 fetched them together to bear their testimony against the <I>lewdness 
 and folly committed in Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 All lewdness is folly, but especially lewdness in Israel. For those to 
 defile their own bodies who have the honourable seal of the covenant in 
 their flesh, for those to defy the divine vengeance to whom it is so 
 clearly revealed from heaven--Nabal is their name, and folly is with 
 them. He concludes his declaration with an appeal to the judgment of 
 the court

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>You are all children of Israel,</I> and therefore you <I>know law 
 and judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:13">Esth. i. 13</A>.

 "You are a holy people to God, and have a dread of every thing which 
 will dishonour God and defile the land; you are of the same community, 
 members of the same body, and therefore likely to feel from the 
 distempers of it; you are children of Israel, that ought to take 
 particular care of the Levites, God's tribe, among you, and therefore 
 give your advice and counsel what is to be done."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The resolution they came to hereupon, which was that, being now
 together, they would not disperse till they had seen vengeance taken 
 upon this wicked city, which was the reproach and scandal of their 
 nation. Observe, 

 1. Their zeal against the lewdness that was committed.  They would not 
 return to their houses, how much soever their families and their 
 affairs at home wanted them, till they had vindicated the honour of God 
 and Israel, and recovered with their swords, if it could not be had 
 otherwise, that satisfaction for the crime which the justice of the 
 nation called for,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 By this they showed themselves children of Israel indeed, that they
 preferred the public interest before their private concerns. 

 2. Their prudence in sending out a considerable body of their forces to 
 fetch provisions for the rest,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 One of ten, and he chosen by lot, 40,000 in all, must go to their 
 respective countries, whence they came, to fetch bread and other 
 necessaries for the subsistence of this great army; for when they came 
 from home they took with them provisions only for a journey to Mizpeh, 
 not for an encampment (which might prove long) before Gibeah. This was 
 to prevent their scattering to forage for themselves, for, if they had 
 done this, it would have been hard to get them all together again, 
 especially all in so good a mind. Note, When there appears in people a 
 pious zeal for any good work it is best to strike while the iron is 
 hot, for such zeal is apt to cool quickly if the prosecution of the 
 work be delayed. Let it never be said that we left that good work to be 
 done to-morrow which we could as well have done to-day. 

 3. Their unanimity in these counsels, and the execution of them. The 
 resolution was voted, <I>Nemine contradicente--Without a dissenting 
 voice</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 it was one and all; and, when it was put in execution, they were 
 <I>knit together as one man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This was their glory and strength, that the several tribes had no 
 separate interests when the common good was concerned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of
 Benjamin, saying, What wickedness <I>is</I> this that is done among
 you?
 &nbsp; 13 Now therefore deliver <I>us</I> the men, the children of Belial,
 which <I>are</I> in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put
 away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not
 hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel:
 &nbsp; 14 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together
 out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the
 children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 15 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out
 of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside
 the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred
 chosen men.
 &nbsp; 16 Among all this people <I>there were</I> seven hundred chosen men
 lefthanded; every one could sling stones at a hair <I>breadth,</I>
 and not miss.
 &nbsp; 17 And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four
 hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these <I>were</I> men of
 war.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The fair and just demand which the tribes of Israel, now encamped, 
 sent to the tribe of Benjamin, to deliver up the malefactors of Gibeah 
 to justice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 If the tribe of Benjamin had come up, as they ought to have done, to 
 the assembly, and agreed with them in their resolution, there would 
 have been none to deal with but the men of Gibeah only, but they, by 
 their absence, taking part with the criminals, application must be made 
 to them all. The Israelites were zealous against the wickedness that 
 was committed, yet they were discreet in their zeal, and did not think 
 it would justify them in falling upon the whole tribe of Benjamin 
 unless they, by refusing to give up the criminals, and protecting them 
 against justice, should make themselves guilty, <I>ex post 
 facto</I>--<I>as accessaries after the fact.</I> They desire them to 
 consider how great the wickedness was that was committed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and that it was done among them: and how necessary it was therefore 
 that they should either punish the malefactors with death themselves, 
 according to the law of Moses, or deliver them up to the general 
 assembly, to be so much the more publicly and solemnly punished, that 
 evil might be put away from Israel, the national guilt removed, the 
 infection stopped by cutting off the gangrened part, and national 
 judgments prevented; for the sin was so very like that of the Sodomites 
 that they might justly fear, if they did not punish it, God would rain 
 hail from heaven upon them, as he did, not only upon Sodom, but the 
 neighbouring cities. If the Israelites had not made this reasonable 
 demand, they would have had much more reason to lament the following 
 desolations of Benjamin. All methods of accommodation must be used 
 before we go to war or go to law.  The demand was like that of Joab's 
 to Abel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:20,21">2 Sam. xx. 20, 21</A>.

 "Only deliver up the traitor, and we will lay down our arms." On these
 terms, and no other, God will be at peace with us, that we part with 
 our sins, that we mortify and crucify our lusts, and then all shall be 
 well; his anger will be turned away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The wretched obstinacy and perverseness of the men of Benjamin, who 
 seem to have been as unanimous and zealous in their resolutions to 
 stand by the criminals as the rest of the tribes were to punish them, 
 so little sense had they of their honour, duty, and interest. 

 1. They were so prodigiously vile as to patronise the wickedness that 
 was committed: They <I>would not hearken to the voice of their 
 brethren</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 either because those of that tribe were generally more vicious and 
 debauched at this time than the rest of the tribes, and therefore would 
 not bear to have that punished in others of which they knew themselves 
 guilty (some of the most fruitful and pleasant parts of Canaan fell to 
 the lot of this tribe; their land, like that of Sodom, was <I>as the 
 garden of the Lord,</I> which perhaps helped to make the inhabitants, 
 like the men of Sodom, wicked, and <I>sinners before the Lord 
 exceedingly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:10,13">Gen. xiii. 10, 13</A>),

 or because (as bishop Patrick suggests) they took it ill that the other
 tribes should meddle with their concerns; they would not do that which 
 they knew was their duty because they were reminded of it by their 
 brethren, by whom they scorned to be taught and controlled. If there 
 were any wise men among them that would have complied with the demand 
 made, yet they were overpowered by the majority, who thus made the 
 crime of the men of Gibeah their own. Thus we have <I>fellowship with 
 the unfruitful works of darkness</I> if we say <I>A confederacy</I> 
 with those that have, and make ourselves guilty of other men's sins by 
 countenancing and defending them. It seems there is no cause so bad but 
 it will find some patrons, some advocates, to appear for it; but <I>woe 
 be to those by whom such offences come.</I> Those will have a great 
 deal to answer for that obstruct the course of necessary justice, and 
 strengthen the hands of the wicked, by saying, <I>O wicked man! thou 
 shalt not die.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They were so prodigiously vain and presumptuous as to make head 
 against the united force of all Israel. Never, surely, were men so 
 wretchedly infatuated as they were when they took up arms in 
 opposition, 

 (1.) To so good a cause as Israel had. How could they expect to prosper 
 when they fought against justice, and consequently against the just God 
 himself, against those that had the high priest and the divine oracle 
 on their side, and so acted in downright rebellion against the sacred 
 and supreme authority of the nation. 

 (2.) To so great a force as Israel had. The disproportion of their 
 numbers was much greater than that,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:31,32">Luke xiv. 31, 32</A>,

 where he that had but 10,000 durst not meet him that came against him
 with 20,000, and therefore desired conditions of peace. There the enemy 
 was but two to one, here above fifteen to one; yet they despised 
 conditions of peace. All the forces they could bring into the field 
 were but 26,000 men, besides 700 men of Gibeah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 yet with these they will dare to face 400,000 men of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 Thus sinners are infatuated to their own ruin, and provoke him to 
 jealousy who is infinitely stronger than they,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:22">1 Cor. x. 22</A>.

 But it should seem they depended upon the skill of their men to make up
 what was wanting in numbers, especially a regiment of slingers, 700 
 men, who, though left-handed, were so dexterous at slinging stones that 
 they would not be a hair's breadth beside their mark, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 But these good marksmen were very much out in their aim when they 
 espoused this bad cause. <I>Benjamin</I> signifies <I>the son of the 
 right hand,</I> yet we find his posterity left-handed.</P>

 I. Before their first engagement they asked counsel of God concerning 
 the order of their battle and were directed, and yet they were sorely 
 beaten. They did not think it was proper to ask of God whether they 
 should go up at all against Benjamin (the case was plain enough, the 
 men of Gibeah must be punished for their wickedness, and Israel must 
 inflict the punishment or it will not be done), but "Who shall go 
 first?" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 that is, "Who shall be general of our army?" for, which soever tribe 
 was appointed to go first, the prince of that tribe must be looked upon 
 as commander-in-chief of the whole body. For, if they had meant it of 
 the order of their march only, it would have been proper to ask, "Who 
 shall go next?" and then, "Who next?" But, if they know that Judah must 
 go first, they know they must all observe the orders of the prince of 
 that tribe. This honour was done to Judah because our Lord Jesus was to 
 spring from that tribe, who was in all things to have the pre-eminence. 
 The tribe that went up first had the most honourable post, but withal 
 the most dangerous, and probably lost most in the engagement. Who would 
 strive for precedency that sees the peril of it? Yet though Judah, that 
 strong and valiant tribe, goes up first, and all the tribes of Israel 
 attend them, <I>little Benjamin</I> (so he is called, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:27">Ps. lxviii. 27</A>),

 is too hard for them all. The whole army lays siege to Gibeah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The Benjamites advance to raise the siege, and the army prepares to 
 give them a warm reception,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 But between the Benjamites that attacked them in the front with
 incredible fury, and the men of Gibeah that sallied out upon their 
 rear, they were put into confusion and lost 22,000 men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Here were no prisoners taken, for there was no quarter given, but all 
 put to the sword.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Before their second engagement they again <I>asked counsel of 
 God,</I> and more solemnly than before; for they <I>wept before the 
 Lord until evening</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 lamenting the loss of so many brave men, especially as it was a token 
 of God's displeasure and would give occasion to the Benjamites to 
 triumph in the success of their wickedness. Also at this time they did 
 not ask who should go up first, but whether they should go up at all. 
 The intimate a reason why they should scruple to do it, especially now 
 that Providence had frowned upon them, because Benjamin was their 
 brother, and a readiness to lay down their arms if God should so order 
 them. God bade them go up; he allowed the attempt, for, though Benjamin 
 was their brother, he was a gangrened member of their body and must be 
 cut off. Upon this they encouraged themselves, perhaps more in their 
 own strength than in the divine commission, and made a second attempt 
 upon the forces of the rebels, in the same place where the former 
 battle was fought 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 with the hope of retrieving their credit upon the same spot of ground 
 where they had lost it, which they would not superstitiously change, as 
 if there were any thing unlucky in the place. But they were this second 
 time repulsed, with the loss of 18,000 men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 The former day's loss and this amounted to 40,000, which was just a 
 tenth part of the whole army, and the same number that they had drawn 
 out by lot to fetch victuals, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They decimated themselves for that service, and now God again decimated 
 them for the slaughter. But what shall we say to these things, that so 
 just and honourable a cause should thus be put to the worst once and 
 again? Were they not fighting God's battle against sin? Had they not 
 his commission? What, and yet miscarry thus! 

 1. God's judgments are a great deep, and his way is in the sea. 
 <I>Clouds and darkness are</I> often <I>round about</I> him, <I>but 
 judgment and justice are</I> always <I>the habitation of his 
 throne.</I> We may be sure of the righteousness, when we cannot see the 
 reasons, of God's proceedings. 

 2.  God would hereby show them, and us in them, that <I>the race is not 
 to the swift nor the battle to the strong,</I> that we are not to 
 confide in numbers, which perhaps the Israelites did with too much 
 assurance.  We must never lay the weight on an arm of flesh, which only 
 the Rock of ages will bear. 

 3. God designed hereby to correct Israel for their sins. They did well 
 to show such a zeal against the wickedness of Gibeah: but <I>were there 
 not with them, even with them, sins against the Lord their God?</I> 
 Those must be made to know their own iniquity that are forward in 
 condemning the iniquity of others.  Some think it was a rebuke to them 
 for not witnessing against the idolatry of Micah and the Danites, by 
 which their religion was corrupted, as they now did against the 
 lewdness of Gibeah and the Benjamites, by which the public peace was 
 disturbed, though God had particularly ordered them to levy war upon 
 idolaters,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+13:12-18">Deut. xiii. 12</A>,

 &c.

 4. God would hereby teach us not to think it strange if a good cause
 should suffer defeat fore a while, nor to judge of the merits of it by 
 the success of it. The interest of grace in the heart, and of religion 
 in the world, may be foiled, and suffer great loss, and seem to be 
 quite run down, but judgment will be brought forth to victory at last. 
 <I>Vincimur in pr&aelig;lio, sed non in bello--We are foiled in a battle, but
 not in the whole campaign.</I> Right may fall, but it shall arise.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>26 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went
 up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there
 before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and fasted that day until even, and offered
 burnt offerings and peace offerings before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 27 And the children of Israel enquired of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, (for the
 ark of the covenant of God <I>was</I> there in those days,
 &nbsp; 28 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood
 before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to
 battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I
 cease? And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver
 them into thine hand.
 &nbsp; 29 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.
 &nbsp; 30 And the children of Israel went up against the children of
 Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against
 Gibeah, as at other times.
 &nbsp; 31 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people,
 <I>and</I> were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of
 the people, <I>and</I> kill, as at other times, in the highways, of
 which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah
 in the field, about thirty men of Israel.
 &nbsp; 32 And the children of Benjamin said, They <I>are</I> smitten down
 before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let
 us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.
 &nbsp; 33 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and
 put themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers in wait of
 Israel came forth out of their places, <I>even</I> out of the meadows
 of Gibeah.
 &nbsp; 34 And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of
 all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil
 <I>was</I> near them.
 &nbsp; 35 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children
 of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five
 thousand and a hundred men: all these drew the sword.
 &nbsp; 36 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for
 the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they
 trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.
 &nbsp; 37 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and
 the liers in wait drew <I>themselves</I> along, and smote all the city
 with the edge of the sword.
 &nbsp; 38 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel
 and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with
 smoke rise up out of the city.
 &nbsp; 39 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin
 began to smite <I>and</I> kill of the men of Israel about thirty
 persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us,
 as <I>in</I> the first battle.
 &nbsp; 40 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a
 pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold,
 the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.
 &nbsp; 41 And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin
 were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.
 &nbsp; 42 Therefore they turned <I>their backs</I> before the men of Israel
 unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and
 them which <I>came</I> out of the cities they destroyed in the midst
 of them.
 &nbsp; 43 <I>Thus</I> they inclosed the Benjamites round about, <I>and</I>
 chased them, <I>and</I> trode them down with ease over against Gibeah
 toward the sunrising.
 &nbsp; 44 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these
 <I>were</I> men of valour.
 &nbsp; 45 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock
 of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand
 men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two
 thousand men of them.
 &nbsp; 46 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and
 five thousand men that drew the sword; all these <I>were</I> men of
 valour.
 &nbsp; 47 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto
 the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.
 &nbsp; 48 And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of
 Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the
 men of <I>every</I> city, as the beast, and all that came to hand:
 also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a full account of the complete victory which the 
 Israelites obtained over the Benjamites in the third engagement: the 
 righteous cause was victorious at last, when the managers of it amended 
 what had been amiss; for, when a good cause suffers, it is for want of 
 good management. Observe then how the victory was obtained, and how it 
 was pursued.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the victory was obtained. Two things they had trusted too much 
 to in the former engagements--the goodness of their cause and the
 superiority of their numbers. It was true that they had both right and 
 strength on their side, which were great advantages; but they depended 
 too much upon them, to the neglect of those duties to which now, this 
 third time, when they see their error, they apply themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were previously so confident of the goodness of their cause 
 that they thought it needless to address themselves to God for his 
 presence and blessing. They took it for granted that God would bless 
 them, nay, perhaps they concluded that he owed them his favour, and 
 could not in justice withhold it, since it was in defence of virtue 
 that they appeared and took up arms. But God having shown them that he 
 was under no obligation to prosper their enterprise, that he neither 
 needed them nor was tied to them, that they were more indebted to him 
 for the honour of being ministers of his justice than he to them for 
 the service, now they became humble petitioners for success. Before 
 they only consulted God's oracle, <I>Who shall go up first?</I> And, 
 <I>Shall we go up?</I> But now they implored his favour, fasted and 
 prayed, and <I>offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),
 
 to make an atonement for sin and an acknowledgment of their dependence 
 upon God, and as an expression of their desire towards him. We cannot 
 expect the presence of God with us, unless we thus seek it in the way 
 he has appointed. And when they were in this frame, and thus sought the 
 Lord, then he not only ordered them to go up against the Benjamites the 
 third time, but gave them a promise of victory: <I>Tomorrow I will 
 deliver them into thy hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:28"><I>v.</I>  28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They were previously so confident of the greatness of their strength 
 that they thought it needless to use any art, to lay any ambush, or 
 form a stratagem, not doubting but to conquer purely by a strong hand; 
 but now they saw it was requisite to use some policy, as if they had an 
 enemy to deal with them that had been superior in number; accordingly, 
 they set <I>liers in wait</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 and gained their point, as their fathers did before Ai

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+8:1-35">Josh. viii.</A>),

 stratagems of that kind being most likely to take effect after a
 previous defeat, which has flushed the enemy, and made the pretended 
 flight the less suspected. The management of this artifice is here very 
 largely described. The assurance God had given them of success in this 
 day's action, instead of making them remiss and presumptuous, set all 
 heads and hands on work for the effecting of what God had promised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Observe the method they took. The body of the army faced the city 
 of Gibeah, as they had done before, advancing towards the gates, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 
 The Benjamites, the body of whose army was now quartered at Gibeah, 
 sallied out upon them, and charged them with great bravery. The 
 besiegers gave back, retired with precipitation, as if their hearts
 failed them upon the sight of the Benjamites, which they were willing 
 to believe, proudly imagining that by their former success they had 
 made themselves very formidable. Some loss the Israelites sustained in 
 this counterfeit flight, about thirty men being cut off in their rear, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:31,39"><I>v.</I> 31, 39</A>.

 But, when the Benjamites were all drawn out of the city, the ambush 
 seized the city

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),
 
 gave a signal to the body of the army
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:38,40"><I>v.</I> 38, 40</A>),

 which immediately turned upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 and, it should seem, another considerable party that was posted at 
 Baal-tamar came upon them at the same time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>);

 so that the Benjamites were quite surrounded, which put them into the 
 greatest consternation that could be. A sense of guilt now disheartened 
 them, and the higher their hopes had been raised the more grievous was 
 this confusion. At first <I>the battle was sore</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 the Benjamites fought with fury; but, when they saw what a snare they 
 were drawn into, they thought one pair of heels (as we say) was worth 
 two pair of hands, and they made the best of their way <I>towards the 
 wilderness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:42"><I>v.</I>  42</A>);

 but in vain: <I>the battle overtook them,</I> and, to complete their 
 distress, <I>those who came out of the cities of Israel,</I> that 
 waited to see the event of the battle, joined with their pursuers, and 
 helped to cut them off.  Every man's hand was against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Observe in this story, 

 [1.] That the Benjamites, in the beginning of the battle, were 
 confident that the day was their own: <I>They are smitten down before 
 us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:32,39"><I>v.</I> 32, 39</A>.

 Sometimes God suffers wicked men to be lifted up in successes and 
 hopes, that their fall may be the sorer. See how short their joy is, 
 and their triumphing but for a moment. <I>Let not him that girdeth on 
 the harness boast,</I> except he has reason to boast in God. 

 [2.] Evil was near them and they did not know it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.
 
 But

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>)

 they saw, when it was too late to prevent it, <I>that evil had come 
 upon them.</I> What evils may at any time be near us we cannot tell, 
 but the less they are feared the heavier they fall. Sinners will not be 
 persuaded to see evil near them, but how dreadful will it be when it 
 comes and there is no escaping!

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:3">1 Thess. v. 3</A>.
 
 [3.] Though the men of Israel played their parts so well in this
 engagement, yet the victory is ascribed to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>The Lord smote Benjamin before Israel.</I> The battle was his, and 
 so was the success. 

 [4.] They <I>trode down the men of Benjamin with ease</I> when God 
 fought against them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 It is an easy thing to trample upon those who have made God their 
 enemy. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:3">Mal. iv. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How the victory was prosecuted and improved in a military execution 
 done upon these sinners against their own souls. 

 1. Gibeah itself, that nest of lewdness, was destroyed in the first 
 place. The ambush that entered the city by surprise <I>drew themselves 
 along,</I> that is, dispersed themselves into the several parts of it, 
 which they might easily do, now that all the men of war had sallied out 
 and very presumptuously left it defenceless; and they smote all they 
 found, even women and children, <I>with the sword</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 and set fire to the city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.
 
 Sin brings ruin upon cities. 

 2. The army in the field was quite routed and cut off: 18,000 men of 
 valour lay dead upon the spot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 3. Those that escaped from the field were pursued, and cut off in their 
 flight, to the number of 7000, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:45"><I>v.</I>  45</A>.

 It is to no purpose to think of out-running divine vengeance.  <I>Evil 
 pursues sinners,</I> and it will overtake them. 

 4. Even those that tarried at home were involved in the ruin. They 
 <I>let their sword devour for ever,</I> not considering that <I>it 
 would be bitterness in the latter end,</I> as Abner pleads long after, 
 when he was at the head of an army of Benjamites, probably with an eye 
 to this very story,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+2:25,26">2 Sam. ii. 25, 26</A>.
 
 They put to the sword all that breathed, and set fire to <I>all the
 cities,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>.

 So that of all the tribe of Benjamin, for aught that appears, there 
 remained none alive but 600 men that took shelter in the rock Rimmon, 
 and lay close there four months, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.
 
 Now, 

 (1.) It is difficult to justify this severity as it was Israel's act. 
 The whole tribe of Benjamin was culpable; but must they therefore be 
 treated as devoted Canaanites? That it was done in the heat of war, 
 that this was the way of prosecuting victories which the sword of 
 Israel had been accustomed to, that the Israelites were extremely 
 exasperated against the Benjamites for the slaughter they had made 
 among them in the two former engagements, will go but a little way to 
 excuse the cruelty of this execution. It is true they had sworn that 
 whosoever did not come up to Mizpeh should be <I>put to death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+21:5"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 5</A>.

 But that, if it was a justifiable oath, yet extended only to the men of
 war; the rest were not expected to come. Yet,

 (2.) It is easy to justify the hand of God in it. Benjamin had sinner
 against him, and God had threatened that, if they forgot him, they
 should <I>perish as the nations</I> that were before them perished

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:20">Deut. viii. 20</A>),

 who were all in this manner cut off.

 (3.) It is easy likewise to improve it for warning against the
 beginnings of sin: they are <I>like the letting forth of water, 
 therefore leave it off before it be meddled with,</I> for we know not 
 <I>what will be in the end thereof.</I> The eternal ruin of souls will 
 be worse, and more fearful, than all these desolations of a tribe. This 
 affair of Gibeah is twice spoken of by the prophet Hosea as the 
 beginning of the corruption of Israel and a pattern to all that 
 followed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:9">Hos. ix. 9</A>):

 <I>They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah;</I> 
 and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+10:9">Hos. x. 9</A>),

 <I>Thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah;</I> and it is added that 
 <I>the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not</I> 
 (that is, did not <I>at first</I>) overtake them.</P>
