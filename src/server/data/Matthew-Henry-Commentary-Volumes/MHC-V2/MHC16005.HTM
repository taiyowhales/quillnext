 How bravely Nehemiah, as a wise and faithful governor, stood upon his
 guard against the attacks of enemies abroad, we read in the foregoing
 chapter. Here we have him no less bold and active to redress grievances
 at home, and, having kept them from being destroyed by their enemies,
 to keep them from destroying one another. Here is,

 I. The complaint which the poor made to him of the great hardships
 which the rich (of whom they were forced to borrow money) put upon
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. The effectual course which Nehemiah took both to reform the
 oppressors and to relieve the oppressed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:6-13">ver. 6-13</A>.

 III. The good example which he himself, as governor, set them of
 compassion and tenderness,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives
 against their brethren the Jews.
 &nbsp; 2  For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters,
 <I>are</I> many: therefore we take up corn <I>for them,</I> that we may
 eat, and live.
 &nbsp; 3  <I>Some</I> also there were that said, We have mortgaged our
 lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of
 the dearth.
 &nbsp; 4  There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the
 king's tribute, <I>and that upon</I> our lands and vineyards.
 &nbsp; 5  Yet now our flesh <I>is</I> as the flesh of our brethren, our
 children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our
 sons and our daughters to be servants, and <I>some</I> of our
 daughters are brought unto bondage <I>already:</I> neither <I>is it</I> in
 our power <I>to redeem them;</I> for other men have our lands and
 vineyards.

 We have here the tears of the oppressed, which Solomon considered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:1">Eccl. iv. 1</A>.

 Let us consider them as here they are dropped before Nehemiah, whose
 office it was, as governor, to <I>deliver the poor and needy, and rid 
 them out of the hand of the wicked</I> oppressors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:4">Ps. lxxxii. 4</A>.

 Hard times and hard hearts made the poor miserable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The times they lived in were hard. There was a dearth of corn 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 probably for want of rain, with which God had chastised their neglect
 of his house

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:9-11">Hag. i. 9-11</A>)

 and the non-payment of their church-dues, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:9,10">Mal. iii. 9, 10</A>.

 Thus foolish sinful men bring God's judgments upon themselves, and then
 fret and complain of them. When the markets are high, and provisions 
 scarce and dear, the poor soon feel from it, and are pinched by it. 
 Blessed be God for the mercy, and God deliver us from the sin, of 
 <I>fulness of bread,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:49">Ezek. xvi. 49</A>.

 That which made the scarcity here complained of the more grievous was
 that their <I>sons and their daughters were many,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The families that were most necessitous were most numerous; here were
 the mouths, but where was the meat? Some have estates and no children 
 to inherit them; others have children and no estates to leave them. 
 Those who have both have reason to be thankful; those who have neither 
 may the more easily be content. Those who have great families and 
 little substance must learn to live by faith in God's providence and 
 promise; and those who have little families and great substance must 
 <I>make their abundance a supply for the wants of others.</I> But this 
 was not all: as corn was dear, so the taxes were high; the king's 
 tribute must be paid, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 This mark of their captivity still remained upon them.  Perhaps it was
 a poll-money that was required, and then, their sons and their 
 daughters being many, it rose the higher. The more they had to maintain 
 (a hard case!) the more they had to pay. Now, it seems, they had not 
 wherewithal of their own to buy corn and pay taxes, but were 
 necessitated to borrow. Their families came poor out of Babylon; they 
 had been at great expense in building them houses, and had not yet got 
 up their strength when these new burdens came upon them. The straits of 
 poor housekeepers who make hard shift to get an honest livelihood, and 
 sometimes want what is fitting for them and their families, are well 
 worthy the compassionate consideration of those who either with their 
 wealth or with their power are in a capacity to help them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The persons they dealt with were hard. Money must be had, but it 
 must be borrowed; and those that lent them money, taking advantage of 
 their necessity, were very hard upon them and made a prey of them. 

 1.  They exacted interest from them at twelve per cent, the hundredth
 part every month,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 If men borrow large sums to trade with, to increase their stocks, or to
 purchase land, there is no reason why the lender should not share with 
 the borrower in his profit; or if to spend upon their lusts, or repair 
 what they have so spent, why should they not pay for their 
 extravagances? But if the poor borrow to maintain their families, and 
 we be able to help them, it is certain we ought either to lend freely 
 what they have occasion for, or (if they be not likely to repay it) to 
 give freely something towards it. Nay, 

 2. They forced them to mortgage to them their lands and houses for the
 securing of the money

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and not only so, but took the profits of them for interest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:5,11"><I>v.</I> 5, compare <I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 that by degrees they might make themselves masters of all they had. Yet
 this was not the worst. 

 3. They took their children for bond-servants, to be enslaved or sold
 at pleasure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 This they complain of most sensibly, as that which touched them in a
 tender part, and they aggravate it with this: "<I>Our children are as 
 their children,</I> as dear to us as theirs are to them; not only of 
 the same human nature, and entitled to the honours and liberties of 
 that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:10,Job+31:15">Mal. ii. 10; Job xxxi. 15</A>),

 but of the same holy nation, free-born Israelites, and dignified with
 the same privileges.  Our flesh carries in it the sacred seal of the 
 covenant of circumcision, as well <I>as the flesh of our brethren;</I> 
 yet our heirs must be their slaves, and <I>it is not in our power to 
 redeem them.</I>" This they made a humble remonstrance of to Nehemiah, 
 not only because they saw he was a great man that could relieve them, 
 but a good man that would. Whither should the injured poor flee for 
 succour but <I>to the shields of the earth?</I> Whither but to the 
 chancery, to the charity, in the royal breast, and those deputed by it 
 for relief against the <I>summum jus</I>--<I>the extremity of the 
 law?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Lastly, We will leave Nehemiah hearing the complaint, and enquiring 
 into the truth of the complainants' allegations (for the clamours of 
 the poor are not always just), while we sit down and look,

 (1.) With a gracious compassion upon the oppressed, and lament the
 hardships which many in the world are groaning under; putting our souls 
 into their souls' stead, and remembering in our prayers and succours 
 those that are burdened, as burdened with them.

 (2.) With a gracious indignation at the oppressors, and abhorrence of
 their pride and cruelty, who drink the tears, the blood, of those they 
 have under their feet. But let those who show no mercy expect 
 <I>judgment without mercy.</I> It was an aggravation of the sin of 
 these oppressing Jews that they were themselves so lately delivered out 
 of the house of bondage, which obliged them in gratitude to <I>undo the 
 heavy burdens,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
 &nbsp; 7  Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and
 the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his
 brother. And I set a great assembly against them.
 &nbsp; 8  And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our
 brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye
 even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held
 they their peace, and found nothing <I>to answer.</I>
 &nbsp; 9  Also I said, It <I>is</I> not good that ye do: ought ye not to
 walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the
 heathen our enemies?
 &nbsp; 10  I likewise, <I>and</I> my brethren, and my servants, might exact
 of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.
 &nbsp; 11  Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands,
 their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the
 hundredth <I>part</I> of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the
 oil, that ye exact of them.
 &nbsp; 12  Then said they, We will restore <I>them,</I> and will require
 nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the
 priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according
 to this promise.
 &nbsp; 13  Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man
 from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this
 promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the
 congregation said, Amen, and praised the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. And the people did
 according to this promise.

 It should seem the foregoing complaint was made to Nehemiah at the time 
 when he had his head and hands as full as possible of the public 
 business about building the wall; yet, perceiving it to be just, he did 
 not reject it because it was unseasonable; he did not chide the 
 petitioners, nor fall into a passion with them, for disturbing him when 
 they saw how much he had to do, a fault which men of business are too 
 often guilty of; nor did he so much as adjourn the hearing of the cause 
 or proceedings upon it till he had more leisure. The case called for 
 speedy interposition, and therefore he applied himself immediately to 
 the consideration of it, knowing that, let him build Jerusalem's walls 
 ever so high, so thick, so strong, the city could not be safe while 
 such abuses as these were tolerated. Now observe, What method he took 
 for the redress of this grievance which was so threatening to the 
 public.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He <I>was very angry</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 he expressed a great displeasure at it, as a very bad thing. Note, It
 well becomes rulers to show themselves angry at sin, that by the anger 
 itself they may be excited to their duty, and by the expressions of it 
 others may be deterred from evil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He <I>consulted with himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 By this it appears that his anger was not excessive, but kept within
 bounds, that, though his spirit was provoked, he did not say or do any 
 thing unadvisedly. Before he rebuked the nobles, he consulted with 
 himself what to say, and when, and how. Note, Reproofs must be given 
 with great consideration, that what is well meant may not come short of 
 its end for want of being well managed. It is the <I>reproof of 
 instruction</I> that <I>giveth life.</I> Even wise men lose the benefit 
 of their wisdom sometimes for want of consulting with themselves and 
 taking time to deliberate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He <I>rebuked the nobles and rulers,</I> who were the monied men, 
 and whose power perhaps made them the more bold to oppress. Note, Even 
 nobles and rulers, if they do that which is evil, ought to be told of 
 it by proper persons. Let no man imagine that his dignity sets him 
 above reproof.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He set a great assembly against them. He called the people together 
 to be witnesses of what he said, and to bear their testimony (which the 
 people will generally be forward to do) against the oppressions and 
 extortions their rulers were guilty of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Ezra and Nehemiah were both of them very wise, good, useful men, yet,
 in cases not unlike, there was a great deal of difference between their 
 management: when Ezra was told of the sin of the rulers in marrying 
 strange wives he rent his clothes, and wept, and prayed, and was hardly 
 persuaded to attempt a reformation, fearing it to be impracticable, for 
 he was a man of a mild tender spirit; when Nehemiah was told of as bad 
 a thing he kindled immediately, reproached the delinquents, incensed 
 the people against them, and never rested till, by all the rough 
 methods he could use, he forced them to reform; for he was a man of a 
 hot and eager spirit. Note,

 1. Very holy men may differ much from each other in their natural
 temper and in other things that result from it. 

 2. God's work may be done, well done, and successfully, and yet
 different methods taken in the doing of it, which is a good reason why 
 we should neither arraign the management of others nor make our own a 
 standard. There are diversities of operation, but the same Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He fairly reasoned the case with them, and showed them the evil of 
 what they did. The regular way of reforming men's lives is to 
 endeavour, in the first place, to convince their consciences. Several 
 things he offered to their consideration, which are so pertinent and 
 just that it appeared he had consulted with himself. He lays it before 
 them, 

 1. That those whom they oppressed were their brethren: <I>You exact
 every one of his brother.</I> It was bad enough to oppress strangers, 
 but much worse to oppress their poor brethren, from whom the divine law 
 did not allow them to <I>take any usury,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+23:19,20">Deut. xxiii. 19, 20</A>.

 2. That they were but lately redeemed <I>out of the hand of the
 heathen.</I> The body of the people were so by the wonderful providence 
 of God; some particular persons among them were so, who, besides their 
 share in the general captivity, were in servitude to heathen masters, 
 and ransomed at the charge of Nehemiah and other pious and 
 well-disposed persons. "Now," says he, "have we taken all this pains to 
 get their liberty out of the hands of the heathen, and shall their own 
 rulers enslave them? What an absurd thing is this! Must we be at the 
 same trouble and expense to redeem them from you as we were to redeem 
 them from Babylon?" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Those whom God by his grace has made free ought not to be again brought
 under <I>a yoke of bondage,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:1,1Co+7:23">Gal. v. 1; 1 Cor. vii. 23</A>.

 3. That it was a great sin thus to oppress the poor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>It is not good that you do;</I> though you get money by it, you
 contract guilt by it, and <I>ought you not to walk in the fear of 
 God?</I> Certainly you ought, for you profess religion, and relation to 
 him; and, if you do walk in the fear of God, you will not be either 
 covetous of worldly gain or cruel towards your brethren." Those that 
 walk in the fear of God will not dare to do a wicked thing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:13,14,23">Job xxxi. 13, 14, 23</A>.

 4.  That it was a great scandal, and a reproach to their profession.
 "Consider <I>the reproach of the heathen our enemies,</I> enemies to 
 us, to our God, and to our holy religion. They will be glad of any 
 occasion to speak against us, and this will give them great occasion; 
 they will say, These Jews, that profess so much devotion to God, see 
 how barbarous they are one to another." Note,

 (1.) All that profess religion should be very careful that they do
 nothing to expose themselves to the reproach of those that are without, 
 lest religion be wounded through their sides.

 (2.) Nothing exposes religion more to the reproach of its enemies than
 the worldliness and hard-heartedness of the professors of it.

 5. That he himself had set them a better example
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 which he enlarges upon afterwards,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:14-19"><I>v.</I> 14</A>,

 &c. Those that rigorously insist upon their right themselves will with
 a very ill grace persuade others to recede from theirs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He earnestly pressed them not only not to make their poor 
 neighbours any more such hard bargains, but to restore that which they 
 had got into their hands, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 See how familiarly he speaks to them: <I>Let us leave off this
 usury,</I> putting himself in, as becomes reprovers, though far from 
 being any way guilty of the crime. See how earnestly, and yet humbly, 
 he persuades them: <I>I pray you</I> leave off; and <I>I pray you</I> 
 restore. Though he had authority to command, yet, <I>for love's sake, 
 he rather beseeches.</I> See how particularly he presses them to be 
 kind to the poor, to give them up their mortgages, put them again in 
 possession of their estates, remit the interest, and give them time to 
 pay in the principal. He urged them to their loss, yet, urging them to 
 their duty, it would be, at length, to their advantage. What we 
 charitably forgive will be remembered and recompensed, as well as what 
 we charitably give.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. He laid them under all the obligations possible to do what he 
 pressed them to. 
 
 1. He got a promise from them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>We will restore them.</I> 

 2. He sent for the priests to give them their oath that they would
 perform this promise; now that their convictions were strong, and they 
 seemed resolved, he would keep them to it. 

 3. He bound them by a solemn curse or execration, hoping that would
 strike some awe upon them: <I>So let God shake out every man that 
 performeth not this promise,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 This was a threatening that he would certainly do so, to which the
 people said <I>Amen,</I> as to those curses at Mount Ebal

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:1-26">
 Deut. xxvii.</A>),

 that their throats might be cut with their own tongues if they should
 falsify their engagement, and that by the dread of that they might be 
 kept to their promise. With this <I>Amen</I> the people <I>praised the 
 Lord;</I> so far were they from promising with regret that they 
 promised with all possible expressions of joy and thankfulness. Thus 
 David, when he took God's vows upon him,<I> sang and gave praise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:12">Ps. lvi. 12</A>.

 This cheerfulness in promising was well, but that which follows was
 better: <I>They did according to this promise,</I> and adhered to what 
 they had done, not as their ancestors in a like case, who re-enslaved 
 those whom a little before they had released,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:10,11">Jer. xxxiv. 10, 11</A>.

 Good promises are good things, but good performances are all in
 all.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their
 governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto
 the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, <I>that is,</I>
 twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the
 governor.
 &nbsp; 15  But the former governors that <I>had been</I> before me were
 chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine,
 beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare

 God.

 bought we any land: and all my servants <I>were</I> gathered thither

 Nehemiah had mentioned his own practice, as an inducement to the nobles 
 not to burden the poor, no, not with just demands; here he relates more 
 particularly what his practice was, not inn pride or vain-glory, nor to 
 pass a compliment upon himself, but as an inducement both to his 
 successors and to the inferior magistrates to be as tender as might be 
 of the people's ease.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He intimates what had been the way of his predecessors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 He does not name them, because what he had to say of them was not to
 their honour, and in such a case it is good to spare names; but the 
 people knew how chargeable they had been, and how dearly the country 
 paid for all the benefit of their government. The government allowed 
 them <I>forty shekels of silver,</I> which was nearly five pounds (so 
 much a day, it is probable); but, besides that, they obliged the people 
 to furnish them with <I>bread and wine,</I> which they claimed as 
 perquisites of their office; and not only so, but they suffered their 
 servants to squeeze the people, and to get all they could out of them.  
 Note,

 1. It is no new thing for those who are in public places to seek 
 themselves more than the public welfare, any, and to serve themselves 
 by the public loss. 

 2. Masters must be accountable for all the acts of fraud and injustice,
 violence and oppression, which they connive at in their servants.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He tells us what had been his own way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In general, he had not done as the former governors did; he would
 not, he durst not, <I>because of the fear of God.</I> He had an awe of 
 God's majesty and a dread of his wrath. And, 

 (1.) The fear of God restrained him from oppressing the people.  Those
 that truly fear God will not dare to do any thing cruel or unjust.

 (2.) It was purely that which restrained him. He was thus generous, not
 that he might have praise of men, or serve a turn by his interest in 
 the people, but purely for conscience' sake, because of the fear of 
 God. This will not only be a powerful, but an acceptable principle both 
 of justice and charity. What a good hand his predecessors made of their 
 place appeared by the estates they raised; but Nehemiah, for his part, 
 got nothing, except the satisfaction of doing good: <I>Neither bought 
 we any land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Say not then that he was a bad husband, but that he was a good 
 governor, who aimed not to feather his own nest. Let us <I>remember the 
 words of the Lord,</I> how he said, <I>It is more blessed to give than 
 to receive,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:35">Acts xx. 35</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. More particularly, observe here, 

 (1.) How little Nehemiah received of what he might have required. He
 did the work of the governor, but he did not <I>eat the bread of the 
 governor</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 did not require it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 So far was he from extorting more than his due that he never demanded
 that, but lived upon what he had got in the king of Persia's court and 
 his own estate in Judea: the reason he gives for this piece of 
 self-denial is, <I>Because the bondage was heavy upon the people.</I> 
 He might have used the common excuse for rigour in such cases, that it 
 would be a wrong to his successors not to demand his dues; but let them 
 look to themselves: he considered the afflicted state of the Jews, and, 
 while they groaned under so much hardship, he could not find it in his 
 heart to add to their burden, but would rather lessen his own estate 
 than ruin them. note, In our demands we must consider not only the 
 justice of them, but the ability of those on whom we make them; where 
 there is nothing to be had we know who loses his right.

 (2.) How much he gave which he might have withheld. 

 [1.] His servants' work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The servants of princes think themselves excused from labour; but
 Nehemiah's servants, by his order no doubt, were <I>all gathered to the 
 work.</I> Those that have many servants should contrive how they may do 
 good with them and keep them well employed.

 [2.] His own meat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 He kept a very good table, not on certain days, but constantly; he had
 many honourable guests, at least 150 of his own countrymen, persons of 
 the first rank, besides strangers that came to him upon business; and 
 he had plentiful provisions for his guests, beef, and mutton, and fowl, 
 and all sorts of wine. Let those in public places remember that they 
 were preferred to do good, not to enrich themselves; and let people in 
 humbler stations learn to <I>use hospitality one to another without 
 grudging,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:9">1 Pet.  iv. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He concludes with a prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Think upon me, my God, for good.</I> 

 1. Nehemiah here mentions what he had <I>done for this people,</I> not
 in pride, as boasting of himself, nor in passion, as upbraiding them, 
 nor does it appear that he had occasion to do it in his own 
 vindication, as Paul had to relate his like self-denying tenderness 
 towards the Corinthians, but to shame the rulers out of their 
 oppressions; let them learn of him to be neither greedy in their 
 demands nor paltry in their expenses, and then they would have the 
 credit and comfort of their liberality, as he had. 

 2. He mentions it to God in prayer, not as if he thought he had hereby
 merited any favour from God, as a debt, but to show that he looked not 
 for any recompence of his generosity from men, but depended upon God 
 only to make up to him what he had lost and laid out for his honour; 
 and he reckoned the favour of God reward enough. "If God do but 
 <I>think upon me for good,</I> I have enough." His thoughts to us-ward 
 are our happiness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:5">Ps. xl. 5</A>.

 He refers it to God to recompense him in such a manner as he pleased.
 "If men forget me, let my God think on me, and I desire no more."</P>
