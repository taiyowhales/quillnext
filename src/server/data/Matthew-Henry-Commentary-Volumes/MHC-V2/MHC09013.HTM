 Those that desired a king like all the nations fancied that, when they
 had one, they should look very great and considerable; but in this
 chapter we find it proved much otherwise. While Samuel was joined in
 commission with Saul things went well,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:7"><I>ch.</I> xi. 7</A>.

 But, now that Saul began to reign alone, all went to decay, and
 Samuel's words began to be fulfilled: "You shall be consumed, both you
 and your king;" for never was the state of Israel further gone in a
 consumption than in this chapter. 

 I. Saul appears here a very silly prince.

 1. Infatuated in his counsels,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 2. Invaded by his neighbours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 3. Deserted by his soldiers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:6,7">ver.  6, 7</A>.

 4.  Disordered in his own spirit, and sacrificing in confusion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.

 5. Chidden by Samuel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:11-13">ver.  11-13</A>.

 6. Rejected of God from being king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:14">ver. 14</A>.

 II. The people appear hear a very miserable people.  

 1.  Disheartened and dispersed, ver. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:6,7">6, 7</A>.

 2.  Diminished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>.

 3.  Plundered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:17,18">ver.  17, 18</A>.

 4. Disarmed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:19-23">ver.  19-23</A>.

 This they got by casting off God's government, and making themselves
 like the nations: all their glory departed from them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over
 Israel,
 &nbsp; 2 Saul chose him three thousand <I>men</I> of Israel; <I>whereof</I> two
 thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Beth-el, and a
 thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest
 of the people he sent every man to his tent.
 &nbsp; 3 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that <I>was</I>
 in Geba, and the Philistines heard <I>of it.</I> And Saul blew the
 trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
 &nbsp; 4 And all Israel heard say <I>that</I> Saul had smitten a garrison
 of the Philistines, and <I>that</I> Israel also was had in abomination
 with the Philistines. And the people were called together after
 Saul to Gilgal.
 &nbsp; 5 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight
 with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen,
 and people as the sand which <I>is</I> on the sea shore in multitude:
 and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from
 Beth-aven.
 &nbsp; 6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for
 the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves
 in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and
 in pits.
 &nbsp; 7 And <I>some of</I> the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad
 and Gilead. As for Saul, he <I>was</I> yet in Gilgal, and all the
 people followed him trembling.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are not told wherein it was that the people of Israel offended God, 
 so as to forfeit his presence and turn his hand against them, as Samuel 
 had threatened 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:15"><I>ch.</I> xii. 15</A>);

 but doubtless they left God, else he would not have left them, as here
 it appears he did; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Saul was very weak and impolitic, and did not order his affairs with 
 discretion. <I>Saul was the son of one year</I> (so the first words are 
 in the original), a phrase which we make to signify the date of his 
 reign, but ordinarily it signifies the date of one's birth, and 
 therefore some understand it figuratively--he was as innocent and good
 as a child of a year old; so the Chaldee paraphrase: he was <I>without 
 fault, like the son of a year.</I> But, if we admit a figurative sense, 
 it may as well intimate that he was ignorant and imprudent, and as 
 unfit for business as a child of a year old: and the subsequent 
 particulars make this more accordant with his character than the 
 former. But we take it rather, as our own translation has it, <I>Saul 
 reigned one year,</I> and nothing happened that was considerable, it 
 was a year of no action; but in his second year he did as follows:--

 1.  he chose a band of 3000 men, of whom he himself commanded 2000, and
 his son Jonathan 1000, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The rest of the people he dismissed to their tents. If he intended
 these only for the guard of his person and his honorary attendants, it 
 was impolitic to have so many, if for a standing army, in apprehension 
 of danger from the Philistines, it was no less impolitic to have so 
 few; and perhaps the confidence he put in this select number, and his 
 disbanding the rest of that brave army with which he had lately beaten 
 the Ammonites

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:8-11"><I>ch.</I> xi. 8-11</A>),

 was looked upon as an affront to the kingdom, excited general disgust,
 and was the reason he had so few at his call when he had occasion for 
 them. The prince that relies on a particular party weakens his own 
 interest in the whole community. 

 2. He ordered his son Jonathan to surprise and destroy the garrison of
 the Philistines that lay near him in Geba, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 I wish there were no ground for supposing that this was a violation or
 infraction of some articles with the Philistines, and that it was done 
 treacherously and perfidiously. The reason why I suspect it is because 
 it is said that, for doing it, <I>Israel was had in abomination,</I> 
 or, as the word is, <I>did stink with the Philistines</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 as men void of common honesty and whose word could not be relied on. If
 it was so, we will lay the blame, not on Jonathan who did it, but on 
 Saul, his prince and father, who ordered him to do it, and perhaps kept 
 him in ignorance of the truth of the matter. Nothing makes the name of 
 Israel odious to those that are without so much as the fraud and 
 dishonesty of those that are called by that worthy name. If professors 
 of religion cheat and over-reach, break their word and betray their 
 trust, religion suffers by it, and is <I>had in abomination with the 
 Philistines.</I> Whom may one trust if not an Israelite, one that, it 
 is expected, should be <I>without guile?</I> 

 3. When he had thus exasperated the Philistines, then he began to raise
 forces, which, if he had acted wisely, he would have done before. When 
 the Philistines had a vast army ready to pour in upon him, to avenge 
 the wrong he had done them, then was he <I>blowing the trumpet through 
 the land,</I> among a careless, if not a disaffected people, saying, 
 <I>Let the Hebrews hear</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and so as many as thought fit came to Saul to Gilgal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 But now the generality, we may suppose, drew back (either in dislike of
 Saul's politics or in dread of the Philistines' power), who, if he had 
 summoned them sooner, would have been as ready at his beck as they were 
 when he marched against the Ammonites. We often find that after-wit 
 would have done much better before and have prevented much 
 inconvenience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Never did the Philistines appear in such a formidable body as they 
 did now, upon this provocation which Saul gave them. We may suppose 
 they had great assistance from their allies, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 besides 6000 horse, which in those times, when horses were not so much
 used in war as they are now, was a great body, they had an incredible 
 number of chariots, 30,000 in all: most of them, we may suppose, were 
 carriages for the bag and baggage of so vast an army, not chariots of 
 war. But their foot was <I>innumerable as the sand of the 
 sea-shore,</I> so jealous were they for the honour of their nation and 
 so much enraged at the baseness of the Israelites in destroying their 
 garrison. If Saul had asked counsel of God before he had given the 
 Philistines this provocation, he and his people might the better have 
 borne this threatening trouble which they had now brought on themselves 
 by their own folly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Never were the people of Israel so faint-hearted, so sneaking, so 
 very cowardly, as they were now. Some considerable numbers, it may be, 
 came to Saul to Gilgal; but, hearing of the Philistines' numbers and 
 preparations, their spirits sunk within them, some think because they 
 did not find Samuel there with Saul. Those that, awhile ago, were weary 
 of him, and wished for a king, now had small joy of their king unless 
 they could see him under Samuel's direction. Sooner or later, men will 
 be made to see that God and his prophets are their best friends. Now 
 that they saw the Philistines making war upon them, and Samuel not 
 coming in to help them, they knew not what to do; <I>men's hearts 
 failed them for fear.</I> And. 

 1. Some absconded. Rather than run upon death among the Philistines,
 they buried themselves alive in caves and thickets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 See what work sin makes; it exposes men to perils, and then robs them
 of their courage and dispirits them. A single person, by faith, can 
 say, <I>I will not be afraid of</I> 10,000

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:6">Ps. iii. 6</A>);

 but here thousands of degenerate Israelites tremble at the approach of
 a great crowd of Philistines. Guilt makes men cowards. 
 
 2. Others fled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 They <I>went over Jordan to the land of Gilead,</I> as far as they
 could from the danger, and to a place where they had lately been 
 victorious over the Ammonites. Where they had triumphed they hoped to 
 be sheltered. 

 3. Those that staid with Saul <I>followed him trembling,</I> expecting
 no other than to be cut off, and having their hands and hearts very 
 much weakened by the desertion of so many of their troops. And perhaps 
 Saul himself, though he had so much honour as to stand his ground, yet 
 had no courage to spare wherewith to inspire his trembling 
 soldiers.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that
 Samuel <I>had appointed:</I> but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the
 people were scattered from him.
 &nbsp; 9 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
 offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.
 &nbsp; 10 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of
 offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went
 out to meet him, that he might salute him.
 &nbsp; 11 And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because
 I saw that the people were scattered from me, and <I>that</I> thou
 camest not within the days appointed, and <I>that</I> the Philistines
 gathered themselves together at Michmash;
 &nbsp; 12 Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me
 to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: I
 forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.
 &nbsp; 13 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast
 not kept the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, which he commanded
 thee: for now would the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> have established thy kingdom upon
 Israel for ever.
 &nbsp; 14 But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath sought
 him a man after his own heart, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath commanded him
 <I>to be</I> captain over his people, because thou hast not kept
 <I>that</I> which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Saul's offence in offering sacrifice before Samuel came.  Samuel, 
 when he anointed him, had ordered him to tarry for him seven days in 
 Gilgal, promising that, at the end of those days, he would be sure to 
 come to him, and both offer sacrifices for him and direct him what he 
 should do. This we had

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:8"><I>ch.</I> x. 8</A>.

 Perhaps that order, though inserted there, was given him afterwards, or
 was given him as a general rule to be observed in every public congress 
 at Gilgal, or, as is most probable, though not mentioned again, was 
 lately repeated with reference to this particular occasion; for it is 
 plain that Saul himself understood it as obliging him from God now to 
 stay till Samuel came, else he would not have made so many excuses as 
 he did for not staying, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This order Saul broke. He staid till the seventh day, yet had not
 patience to wait till the end of the seventh day. Perhaps he began to 
 reproach Samuel as false to his word, careless of his country, and 
 disrespectful of his prince, and thought it more fit that Samuel should 
 wait for him than he for Samuel. However,

 1. He presumed to offer sacrifice without Samuel, and nothing appears
 to the contrary but that he did it himself, though he was neither 
 priest nor prophet, as if, because he was a king, he might do any 
 thing, a piece of presumption which king Uzziah paid dearly for,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+26:16-23">2 Chron. xxvi. 16</A>,

 &c.

 2.  He determined to engage the Philistines without Samuel's
 directions, though he had promised to <I>show him what he should 
 do.</I> So self-sufficient Saul was that he thought it not worth while 
 to stay for a prophet of the Lord, either to pray for him or to advise 
 him. This was Saul's offence, and that which aggravated it was, 

 (1.) That for aught that appears, he did not send any messenger to
 Samuel, to know his mind, to represent the case to him, and to receive 
 fresh directions from him, though he had enough about him that were 
 swift enough of foot at this time.

 (2.) That when Samuel came he rather seemed to boast of what he had
 done than to repent of it; for he <I>went forth to salute him,</I> as 
 his brother-sacrificer, and seemed pleased with the opportunity he had 
 of letting Samuel know that he needed him not, but could do well enough 
 without him. He went out to <I>bless him,</I> so the word is, as if he 
 now thought himself a complete priest, empowered to bless as well as 
 sacrifice, whereas he should have gone out to be blessed by him.

 (3.) That he charged Samuel with breach of promise: <I>Thou camest not
 within the days appointed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and therefore if any thing was amiss Samuel must bear the blame, who
 was God's minister; whereas he did come according to his word, before 
 the seven days had expired. Thus the <I>scoffers of the latter days</I> 
 think the promise of Christ's coming is broken, because he does not 
 come in their time, though it is certain he will come at the set time.

 (4.) That when he was charged with disobedience he justified himself in
 what he had done, and gave no sign at all of repentance for it. It is 
 not sinning that ruins men, but sinning and not repenting, falling and 
 not getting up again. See what excuses he made, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 He would have this act of disobedience pass,

 [1.] For an instance of his prudence. The people were most of them
 scattered from him, and he had no other way than this to keep those 
 with him that remained and to prevent their deserting too. If Samuel 
 neglected the public concerns, he would not. 

 [2.] For an instance of his piety. He would be thought very devout, and
 in great care not to engage the Philistines till he had by prayer and 
 sacrifice engaged God on his side: "<I>The Philistines,</I>" said he, 
 "<I>will come down upon me, before I have made my supplication to the 
 Lord,</I> and then I am undone. What! go to war before I have said my 
 prayers!" Thus he covered his disobedience to God's command with a 
 pretence of concern for God's favour. Hypocrites lay a great stress 
 upon the external performances of religion, thinking thereby to excuse 
 their neglect of the <I>weightier matters of the law.</I> And yet, 
 lastly, He owns it went against his conscience to do it: <I>I forced 
 myself and offered a burnt-offering,</I> perhaps boasting that he had 
 broken through his convictions and got the better of them, or at least 
 thinking this extenuated his fault, that he knew he should not have 
 done as he did, but did it with reluctancy. Foolish man! to think that 
 God would be well pleased with sacrifices offered in direct opposition 
 both to his general and particular command.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The sentence passed upon Saul for this offence. Samuel found him 
 standing by his burnt-offering, but, instead of an answer of peace, was 
 sent to him with heavy tidings, and let him know that <I>the sacrifice 
 of the wicked is abomination to the Lord,</I> much more when he brings 
 it, as Saul did, <I>with a wicked mind.</I> 

 1. He shows him the aggravations of his crime, and says to this king,
 <I>Thou art wicked,</I> which it is not for any but a prophet of the 
 Lord to say, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:18">Job xxxiv. 18</A>.

 He charges him with being an enemy to himself and his interest--<I>Thou
 hast done foolishly,</I> and a rebel to God and his 
 government--"<I>Thou hast not kept the commandment of the Lord thy 
 God,</I> that commandment wherewith he intended to try thy obedience." 
 Note, Those that disobey the commandments of God do foolishly for 
 themselves. Sin is folly, and sinners are the greatest fools.

 2. He reads his doom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>Thy kingdom shall not continue</I> long to thee or thy family; God
 has his eye upon another, <I>a man after his own heart,</I> and not 
 like thee, that will have thy own will and way." The sentence is in 
 effect the same with <I>Mene tekel,</I> only now there seems room left 
 for Saul's repentance, upon which this sentence would have been 
 reversed; but, upon the next act of disobedience, it was made 
 irreversible,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+15:29"><I>ch.</I> xv. 29</A>.

 And now, better a thousand times he had continued in obscurity tending
 his asses than to be enthroned and so soon dethroned. But was not this 
 hard, to pass so severe a sentence upon him and his house for a single 
 error, an error that seemed so small, and in excuse for which he had so 
 much to say? No, <I>The Lord is righteous in all his ways</I> and does 
 no man any wrong, <I>will be justified when he speaks and clear when he 
 judges.</I> By this, 

 (1.) He shows that there is no sin little, because no little god to sin
 against; but that every sin is a forfeiture of the heavenly kingdom, 
 for which we stood fair.

 (2.) He shows that disobedience to an express command, though in a
 small matter, is a great provocation, as in the case of our first 
 parents.

 (3.) He warns us to <I>take heed of our spirits,</I> for that which to
 men may seem but a small offence, yet to him that knows from what 
 principle and with what disposition of mind it is done, may appear a 
 heinous crime.

 (4.) God, in rejecting Saul for an error seemingly little, sets off, as
 by a foil, the lustre of his mercy in forgiving such great sins as 
 those of David, Manasseh, and others.

 (5.) We are taught hereby how necessary it is that we <I>wait on our
 God continually.</I> Saul lost his kingdom for want of two or three 
 hours' patience.</P>

 Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people <I>that were</I> present with
 him, about six hundred men.
 &nbsp; 16 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people <I>that were</I>
 present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the
 Philistines encamped in Michmash.
 &nbsp; 17 And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in
 three companies: one company turned unto the way <I>that leadeth
 to</I> Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:
 &nbsp; 18 And another company turned the way <I>to</I> Beth-horon: and
 another company turned <I>to</I> the way of the border that looketh to
 the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 19 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of
 Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make <I>them</I>
 swords or spears:
 &nbsp; 20 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to
 sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and
 his mattock.
 &nbsp; 21 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters,
 and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.
 &nbsp; 22 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was
 neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people
 that <I>were</I> with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with
 Jonathan his son was there found.

 of Michmash.

 Here, 

 1. Samuel departs in displeasure. Saul has set up for himself, and now
 he is left to himself: <I>Samuel gat him from Gilgal</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and it does not appear that he either prayed with Saul or directed him.
 Yet in going up to Gibeah of Benjamin, which was Saul's city, he 
 intimated that he had not quite abandoned him, but waited to do him a 
 kindness another time. Or he went to the college of the prophets there, 
 to pray for Saul when he did not think fit to pray with him. 

 2. Saul goes after him to Gibeah, and there musters his army, and finds
 his whole number to be but 600 men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 Thus were they for their sin <I>diminished and brought low.</I>

 3. The Philistines ravage the country, and put all the adjacent parts
 under contribution. The body of their army, or standing camp (as it is 
 called in the margin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 lay in an advantageous pass at Michmash, but thence they sent out three
 separate parties or detachments that took several ways, to plunder the 
 country, and bring in provisions for the army, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 By these the land of Israel was both terrified and impoverished, and
 the Philistines were animated and enriched. This the sin of Israel 
 brought upon them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:24">Isa. xlii. 24</A>.

 4. The Israelites that take the field with Saul are unarmed, having
 only slings and clubs, not a sword or spear among them all, except what 
 Saul and Jonathan themselves have,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:19,22"><I>v.</I> 19, 22</A>.

 See here,

 (1.) How politic the Philistines were, when they had power in their
 hands, and did what they pleased in Israel. They put down all the 
 smiths' shops, transplanted the smiths into their own country, and 
 forbade any Israelite, under severe penalties, to exercise the trade or 
 mystery of working in brass or iron, though they had rich mines of both

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:9">Deut. viii. 9</A>)

 in such plenty that it was said of Asher, <I>his shoes shall be iron
 and brass,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:25">Deut. xxxiii. 25</A>.

 This was subtilely done of the Philistines, for hereby they not only
 prevented the people of Israel from making themselves weapons of war 
 (by which they would be both disused to military exercises and 
 unfurnished when there was occasion), but obliged them to a dependence 
 upon them even for the instruments of husbandry; they must go to them, 
 that is, to some or other of their garrisons, which were dispersed in 
 the country, to have all their iron-work done, and no more might an 
 Israelite do than use a file 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+13:20,21"><I>v.</I>  20, 21</A>),

 and no doubt the Philistines' smiths brought the Israelites long bills
 for work done.

 (2.) How impolitic Saul was, that did not, in the beginning of his
 reign, set himself to redress this grievance.  Samuel's not doing it 
 was very excusable; he fought with other artillery; thunder and 
 lightning, in answer to his prayer, were to him instead of sword and 
 spear; but for Saul, that pretended to be a king like the kings of the 
 nations, to leave his soldiers without swords and spears, and take no 
 care to provide them, especially when he might have done it out of the 
 spoils of the Ammonites whom he conquered in the beginning of his 
 reign, was such a piece of negligence as could by no means be excused. 
 
 (3.) How slothful and mean-spirited the Israelites were, that suffered
 the Philistines thus to impose upon them and had no thought nor spirit 
 to help themselves. It was reckoned very bad with them when there was 
 <I>not a shield or spear found among</I> 40,000 <I>in Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:8">Judg. v. 8</A>),

 and it was not better now, when there was never an Israelite with a
 sword by his side but the king and his son, never a soldier, never a 
 gentleman; surely they were reduced to this, or began to be so, in 
 Samuel's time, for we never find him with sword or spear in his hand. 
 If they had not been dispirited, they could not have been disarmed, but 
 it was sin that made them naked to their shame.</P>
