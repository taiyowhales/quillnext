 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went
 northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over
 to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to
 go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.
 &nbsp; 2 And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great
 strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye
 delivered me not out of their hands.
 &nbsp; 3 And when I saw that ye delivered <I>me</I> not, I put my life in
 my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up
 unto me this day, to fight against me?
 &nbsp; 4 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and
 fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because
 they said, Ye Gileadites <I>are</I> fugitives of Ephraim among the
 Ephraimites, <I>and</I> among the Manassites.
 &nbsp; 5 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the
 Ephraimites: and it was <I>so,</I> that when those Ephraimites which
 were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said
 unto him, <I>Art</I> thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;
 &nbsp; 6 Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said
 Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce <I>it</I> right. Then
 they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there
 fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.
 &nbsp; 7 And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the
 Gileadite, and was buried in <I>one of</I> the cities of Gilead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here Is, 

 I. The unreasonable displeasure of the men of Ephraim against Jephthah, 
 because he had not called them in to his assistance against the 
 Ammonites, that they might share in the triumphs and spoils,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 Pride was at the bottom of the quarrel.  Only by that comes contention. 
 Proud men think all the honours lost that go beside themselves, and 
 then <I>who can stand before envy?</I> The Ephraimites had the same 
 quarrel with Gideon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:1"><I>ch.</I> viii. 1</A>),

 who was of Manasseh on their side Jordan, as Jephthah was of Manasseh
 on the other side Jordan. Ephraim and Manasseh were hearer akin than 
 any other of the tribes, being both the sons of Joseph, and yet they 
 were more jealous one of another than any other of the tribes. Jacob 
 having crossed hands, and given Ephraim the preference, looking as far 
 forward as the kingdom of the ten tribes, which Ephraim was the head 
 of, after the revolt from the house of David, that tribe, not content 
 with that honour in the promise, was displeased if Manasseh had any 
 honour done it in the mean time. It is a pity that kindred or 
 relationship, which should be an inducement to love and peace, should 
 be ever an occasion (as it often proves) of strife and discord. <I>A 
 brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city, and 
 contentions among brethren are as the bars of a castle.</I> The anger 
 of the Ephraimites at Jephthah was, 

 1. Causeless and unjust. Why <I>didst thou not call us to go with
 thee?</I> For a good reason.  Because it was the men of Gilead that had 
 made him their captain, not the men of Ephraim, so that he had no 
 authority to call them. Had his attempt miscarried for want of their 
 help, they might justly have blamed him for not desiring it. But when 
 the work was done, and done effectually, the Ammonites being subdued 
 and Israel delivered, there was no harm done, though their hands were 
 not employed in it. 

 2.  It was cruel and outrageous. They get together in a tumultuous 
 manner, pass over Jordan as far as Mizpeh in Gilead, where Jephthah 
 lived, and no less will satisfy their fury but they will burn his house 
 and him in it. <I>Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce.</I> Those 
 resentments that have the least reason for them have commonly the most 
 rage in them. Jephthah was now a conqueror over the common enemies of 
 Israel, and they should have come to congratulate him, and return him 
 the thanks of their tribe for the good services he had done; but we 
 must not think it strange if we receive ill from those from whom we 
 deserve well. Jephthah was now a mourner for the calamity of his family 
 upon his daughter's account, and they should have come to condole with 
 him and comfort him; but barbarous men take a pleasure in adding 
 affliction to the afflicted. In this world, the end of one trouble 
 often proves the beginning of another; nor must we ever <I>boast as 
 though we had put off the harness.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jephthah's warm vindication of himself. He did not endeavour to 
 pacify them, as Gideon had done in the like case; the Ephraimites were 
 now more outrageous than they were them, and Jephthah had not so much 
 of a meek and quiet spirit as Gideon had.  Whether they would be 
 pacified or no, Jephthah takes care,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To justify himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 He makes it out that they had no cause at all to quarrel with him, for,

 (1.) It was not in pursuit of glory that he had engaged in this war, 
 but for the necessary defence of his country, with which the children 
 of Ammon greatly strove. 

 (2.) He had invited the Ephraimites to come and join with him, though 
 he neither needed them nor was under any obligation to pay that respect 
 to them, but they had declined the service: <I>I called you, and you 
 delivered me not out of their hands.</I> Had that been true which they 
 charged him with, yet it would not have been a just ground of quarrel; 
 but it seems it was false, and, as the matter of fact now appears, he 
 had more cause to quarrel with them for deserting the common interests 
 of Israel in a time of need. It is no new thing for those who are 
 themselves most culpable to be most clamorous in accusing the innocent. 
 
 (3.) The enterprise was very hazardous, and they had more reason to 
 pity him than to be angry with him: <I>I put my life in my hands,</I> 
 that is, "exposed myself to the utmost peril in what I did, having so 
 small an army," The honour they envied was bought dearly enough; they 
 needed not to grudge it to him; few of them would have ventured so far 
 for it.  

 (4.) He does not take the glory of the success to himself (that would
 have been invidious), but gives it all to God: "<I>The Lord delivered 
 them into my hands.</I> If God was pleased so far to make use of me for 
 his glory, why should you be offended at that? Have you any reason to 
 <I>fight against me?</I> Is not that in effect to fight against God, in 
 whose hand I have been only an unworthy instrument?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When this just answer (though not so soft an answer as Gideon's) did 
 not prevail to turn away their wrath, he took care both to defend 
 himself from their fury and to chastise their insolence with the sword, 
 by virtue of his authority as Israel's judge. 

 (1.) The Ephraimites had not only quarrelled with Jephthah, but, when 
 his neighbours and friends appeared to take his part, they had abused 
 them, and given them foul language; for I adhere to our translation, 
 and so take it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They said in scorn, "You Gileadites that dwell here on the other side 
 Jordan are but fugitives of Ephraim, the scum and dregs of the tribes 
 of Joseph, of which Ephraim is the chief, the refuse of the family, and 
 are so accounted among the Ephraimites and among the Manassites. Who 
 cares for you? All your neighbours know what you are, no better than 
 fugitives and vagabonds, separated from your brethren, and driven 
 hither into a corner." The Gileadites were as true Israelites as any 
 other, and at this time had signalized themselves, both in the choice 
 of Jephthah and in the war with Ammon, above all the families of 
 Israel, and yet are most basely and unjustly called <I>fugitives.</I> 
 It is an ill thing to fasten names or characters of reproach upon 
 persons or countries, as is common, especially upon those that lie 
 under outward disadvantages: it often occasions quarrels that prove of 
 ill consequence, as it did here. See likewise what a mischievous thing 
 an abusive tongue is, that calls ill names, and gives scurrilous 
 language: it <I>sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire 
 of hell</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:6">Jam. iii. 6</A>),

 and many a time cuts the throat of him that uses it, as it did here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:8">Ps. lxiv. 8</A>.

 If these Ephraimites could have denied themselves the poor satisfaction
 of calling the Gileadites <I>fugitives,</I> they might have prevented a 
 great deal of bloodshed; for <I>grievous words stir up anger,</I> and 
 who knows how great a matter a little of that fire may kindle?

 (2.) This affront raises the Gileadites' blood, and the indignity done 
 to themselves, as well as to their captain, must be revenged. 

 [1.] They routed them in the field,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:4"><I>v.</I>  4</A>.

 They fought with Ephraim, and, Ephraim being but a rude unheaded 
 rabble, smote Ephraim, and put them to flight. 

 [2.] They cut off their retreat, and so completed their revenge,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 The Gileadites, who perhaps were better acquainted with the passages of 
 Jordan than the Ephraimites were, secured them with strong guards, who 
 were ordered to slay every Ephraimite that offered to pass the river.  
 Here was, <I>First,</I> Cruelty enough in the destruction of them. 
 Sufficient surely was <I>the punishment which was inflicted by 
 many;</I> when they were routed in the field, there needed not this 
 severity to cut off all that escaped.  Shall the sword devour for ever? 
 Whether Jephthah is to be praised for this I know not; perhaps he saw 
 it to be a piece of necessary justice.  <I>Secondly,</I> Cunning enough 
 in the discovery of them. It seems the Ephraimites, though they spoke 
 the same language with other Israelites, yet had got a custom in the 
 dialect of their country to pronounce the Hebrew letter <I>Shin</I> 
 like <I>Samech,</I> and they had so strangely used themselves to it 
 that they could not do otherwise, no, not to save their lives. We learn 
 to speak by imitation; those that first used <I>s</I> for <I>sh,</I> 
 did it either because it was shorter or because it was finer, and their 
 children learnt to speak like them, so that you might know an 
 Ephraimite by it; as in England we know a west-country man or a 
 north-country man, nay, perhaps a Shropshire man, and a Cheshire man, 
 by his pronunciation. <I>Thou art a Galilean, and thy speech betrays 
 thee.</I> By this the Ephraimites were discovered. If they took a man 
 that they suspected to be an Ephraimite, but he denied it, they bade 
 him say <I>Shibboleth;</I> but either he <I>could not,</I> as our 
 translation reads it, or he did not heed, or frame, or direct himself, 
 as some read, to pronounce it aright, but said <I>Sibboleth,</I> and so 
 was known to be an Ephraimite, and was slain immediately. 
 <I>Shibboleth</I> signifies a <I>river or stream:</I> "Ask leave to go 
 over Shibboleth, the river." Those that were thus cut off made up the 
 whole number of slaughtered Ephraimites forty-two thousand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Thus another mutiny of that angry tribe was prevented.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Now let us observe the righteousness of God in the punishment of 
 these proud and passionate Ephraimites, which in several instances 
 answered to their sin. 

 (1.) They were proud of the honour of their tribe, gloried in this, 
 that they were Ephraimites; but how soon were they brought to be 
 ashamed or afraid to own their country! <I>Art thou an Ephraimite?</I> 
 No, now rather of any tribe than that. 

 (2.) They had gone in a rage over Jordan to burn Jephthah's house with 
 fire, but now they came back to Jordan as sneakingly as they had passed 
 it furiously, and were cut off from ever returning to their own houses. 
 
 (3.) They had upbraided the Gileadites with the infelicity of their
 country, lying at such a distance, and now they suffered by an 
 infirmity peculiar to their own country, in not being able to pronounce 
 <I>Shibboleth.</I> 

 (4.) They had called the Gileadites, unjustly, fugitives, and now they 
 really and in good earnest became fugitives themselves; and in the 
 Hebrew the same word 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 is used of the Ephraimites that escaped, or that fled, which they had 
 used in scorn of the Gileadites, calling them <I>fugitives.</I> He that 
 rolls the stone of reproach unjustly upon another, let him expect that 
 it will justly return upon himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Here is the end of Jephthah's government. He judged Israel but six 
 years, and then died, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Perhaps the death of his daughter sunk him so that he never looked up 
 afterwards, but it shortened his days, and he went to his grave 
 mourning.</P>

 &nbsp; 9 And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, <I>whom</I> he sent
 abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons.
 And he judged Israel seven years.
 &nbsp; 10 Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.
 &nbsp; 11 And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he
 judged Israel ten years.
 &nbsp; 12 And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in
 the country of Zebulun.
 &nbsp; 13 And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 14 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on
 threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.
 &nbsp; 15 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was
 buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the
 Amalekites.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a short account of the short reigns of three more of the 
 judges of Israel, the first of whom governed but seven years, the 
 second ten, and the third eight. <I>For the transgression of a land, 
 many are the princes thereof,</I> many in a short time, successively 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:2">Prov. xxviii. 2</A>),

 good men being removed in the beginning of their usefulness and by the 
 time that they have applied themselves to their business.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Ibzan of Bethlehem, most probably Bethlehem of Judah, David's city, 
 not that in Zebulun, which is only mentioned once, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:15">Josh. xix. 15</A>.

 He ruled but seven years, but by the number of his children, and his
 disposing of them all in marriage himself, it appears that he lived 
 long; and probably the great increase of his family, and the numerous 
 alliances he made, added to his personal merits, made him the more fit 
 to be either chosen by the people as Jephthah was, or called of God 
 immediately, as Gideon was, to be Israel's judge, to keep up and carry 
 on the work of God among them. That which is remarkable concerning him 
 is, 

 1. That he had many children, sixty in all, a quiver full of these
 arrows. Thus was Bethlehem of old famous for increase, the very city 
 where <I>he</I> was to be born whose spiritual seed should be <I>as the 
 stars of heaven.</I> 

 2. That he had an equal number of each sex, thirty sons and thirty 
 daughters, a thing which does not often happen in the same family, yet, 
 in the great family of mankind, he that at first made two, male and 
 female, by his wise providence preserves a succession of both in some 
 sort of equality as far as is requisite to the keeping up of the 
 generations of men upon earth. 

 3. That he took care to marry them all.  His daughters he sent abroad,
 <I>et maritis dedit,</I> so the vulgar Latin adds--<I>he provided 
 husbands for them;</I> and, as it were in exchange, and both ways, 
 strengthening his interest, he <I>took in thirty daughters from abroad 
 for his sons.</I> The Jews say, Every father owes three things to his 
 son: to teach him to read the law, give him a trade, and get him a 
 wife. What a difference was there between Ibzan's family and that of 
 his immediate predecessor Jephthah! Ibzan has sixty children and all 
 married, Jephthah but one, a daughter, that dies or lives unmarried. 
 Some are increased, others are diminished: both are the Lord's 
 doing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Elon of Zebulun, in the north of Canaan, was next raised up to 
 preside in public affairs, to administer justice, and to reform abuses. 
 Ten years he continued a blessing to Israel, and then died, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.
 
 Dr. Lightfoot computes that in the beginning of his time the forty 
 years' oppression by the Philistines began (spoken of
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:1"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 1</A>),

 and about that time Samson was born. Probably, his residence being in
 the north, the Philistines who bordered upon the southern parts of 
 Canaan took the opportunity of making incursions upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Abdon, of the tribe of Ephraim, succeeded, and in him that 
 illustrious tribe begins to recover its reputation, having not afforded 
 any person of note since Joshua; for Abimelech the Shechemite was 
 rather a scandal to it. This Abdon was famous for the multitude of his 
 offspring 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 he had forty sons and thirty grandsons, all of whom he lived to see 
 grown up, and they rode on seventy ass-colts either as judges and 
 officers or as gentlemen and persons of distinction. It was a 
 satisfaction to him thus to see his children's children, but it is 
 feared he did not see peace upon Israel, for by this time the 
 Philistines had begun to break in upon them. Concerning this, and the 
 rest of these judges that have ever so short an account given of them, 
 yet notice is taken where they were buried 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:7,10,12,15"><I>v.</I> 7, 10, 12, 15</A>),

 perhaps because the inscriptions upon their monuments (for such were
 anciently used,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+23:17">2 Kings xxiii. 17</A>)

 would serve for the confirmation and enlargement of their story, and
 might be consulted by such as desired further information concerning 
 them. Peter, having occasion to speak of David, says, <I>His sepulchre 
 is with us unto this day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:29">Acts ii. 29</A>.

 Or it is intended for the honour of the places where they laid their
 bones, but may be improved for the lessening of our esteem of all 
 worldly glory, of which death and the grave will stain the pride. These 
 judges, that were as gods to Israel, died like men, and all their 
 honour was laid in the dust.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is very strange that in the history of all these judges, some of 
 whose actions are very particularly related, there is not so much as 
 once mention made of the high priest, or any other priest or Levite, 
 appearing either for counsel or action in any public affair, from 
 Phinehas 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+20:28">Judg. xx. 28</A>)

 to Eli, which may well be computed 250 years; only the names of the
 high priests at that time are preserved,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+6:4-7,Ezr+7:35">1 Chron. vi. 4-7; and Ezra vii. 3-5</A>.

 How can this strange obscurity of that priesthood for so long a time,
 now in the beginning of its days, agree with that mighty splendour with 
 which it was introduced and the figure which the institution of it 
 makes in the law of Moses? Surely it intimates that the institution was 
 chiefly intended to be typical, and that the great benefits that seemed 
 to be promised by it were to be chiefly looked for in its antitype, the 
 everlasting priesthood of our Lord Jesus, in comparison of the superior 
 glory of which that priesthood had no glory,
