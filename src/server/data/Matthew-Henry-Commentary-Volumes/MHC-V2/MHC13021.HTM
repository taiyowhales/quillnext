 As this rehearsal makes no mention of David's sin in the matter of 
 Uriah, so neither of the troubles of his family that followed upon it; 
 not a word of Absalom's rebellion, or Sheba's. But David's sin, in 
 numbering the people, is here related, because, in the atonement made 
 for that sin, an intimation was given of the spot of ground on which 
 the temple should be built. Here is, 

 I. David's sin, in forcing Joab to number the people,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. David's sorrow for what he had done, as soon as he perceived the
 sinfulness of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.

 III. The sad dilemma (or trilemma rather) he was brought to, when it
 was put to him to choose how he would be punished for this sin, and 
 what rod he would be beaten with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>.

 IV. The woeful havoc which was made by the pestilence in the country,
 and the narrow escape which Jerusalem had from being laid waste by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:14-17">ver. 14-17</A>.

 V. David's repentance, and sacrifice, upon this occasion, and the
 staying of the plaque thereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:18-30">ver. 18-30</A>.

 This awful story we met with, and meditated upon,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to
 number Israel.
 &nbsp; 2  And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go,
 number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of
 them to me, that I may know <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 3  And Joab answered, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> make his people a hundred times
 so many more as they <I>be:</I> but, my lord the king, <I>are</I> they not
 all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing?
 why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?
 &nbsp; 4  Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab.
 Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came
 to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 5  And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David.
 And all <I>they of</I> Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred
 thousand men that drew sword: and Judah <I>was</I> four hundred
 threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.
 &nbsp; 6  But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the
 king's word was abominable to Joab.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Numbering the people, one would think, was no bad thing. Why should not 
 the shepherd know the number of his flock? But God sees not as man 
 sees. It is plain it was wrong in David to do it, and a great 
 provocation to God, because he did it in the pride of his heart; and 
 there is no sin that has in it more of contradiction and therefore more 
 of offence to God than pride. The sin was David's; he alone must bear 
 the blame of it. But here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How active the tempter was in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David</I> to do it. Is
 is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:1">2 Sam. xxiv. 1</A>)

 that <I>the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he moved
 David</I> to do it. The righteous judgments of God are to be observed 
 and acknowledged even in the sins and unrighteousness of men. We are 
 sure that God is not the author of sin--he <I>tempts no man;</I> and 
 therefore, when it is said that he moved David to do it, it must be 
 explained by what is intimated here, that, for wise and holy ends, he 
 permitted the devil to do it. Here we trace this foul stream to its 
 foundation. That Satan, the enemy of God and all good, should <I>stand 
 up against Israel,</I> is not strange; it is what he aims at, to weaken 
 the strength, diminish the numbers, and eclipse the glory of God's 
 Israel, to whom he is <I>Satan,</I> a sworn <I>adversary.</I> But that 
 he should influence David, the man of God's own heart to do a wrong 
 thing, may well be wondered at. One would think him one of those whom 
 the wicked one touches not. No, even the best saints, till they come to 
 heaven, must never think themselves out of the reach of Satan's 
 temptations. Now, when Satan meant to do Israel a mischief, what course 
 did he take? He did not <I>move God against them to destroy them</I> 
 (as Job, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:3"><I>ch.</I> ii. 3</A>),

 but he provoked David, the best friend they had, to number them, and so
 to offend God, and set him against them. Note, 

 1. The devil does us more mischief by tempting us to sin against our
 God than he does by accusing us before our God. He destroys none but by 
 their own hands, 

 2. The greatest spite he can do to the church of God is to tempt the
 rulers of the church to pride; for none can conceive the fatal 
 consequences of that sin in all, especially in church-rulers. <I>You
 shall not be so,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:26">Luke xxii. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How passive the instrument was. Joab, the person whom David 
 employed, was an active man in public business; but to this he was 
 perfectly forced, and did it with the greatest reluctance 
 imaginable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He put in a remonstrance against it before he began it. No man more 
 forward that he in any thing that really tended to the honour of the 
 king or the welfare of the kingdom; but in this matter he would gladly 
 be excused. For, 

 (1.) It was a needless thing. There was not occasion at all for it. God
 had promised to multiply them, and he needed not question the 
 accomplishment of that promise. They were all his servants, and he 
 needed not doubt of their loyalty and affection to him. Their number 
 was as much his strength as he could desire.

 (2.) It was a dangerous thing. In doing it he might be a cause of
 trespass to Israel, and might provoke God against them. This Joab 
 apprehended, and yet David himself did not. The most learned in the 
 laws of God are not always the most quick-sighted in the application of 
 those laws.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was quite weary of it before he had done it; for <I>the king's 
 word was abominable to Joab,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Time was when whatever king David did <I>pleased all the people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:36">2 Sam. iii. 36</A>.

 But now there was a general disgust at these orders, which confirmed
 Joab in his dislike of them, so that, though the produce of this muster
 was really very great, yet he had no heart to perfect it, but left two 
 tribes unnumbered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>),

 two considerable ones, Levi and Benjamin, and perhaps was not very
 exact in numbering the rest, because he did not do it with any 
 pleasure, which might be one occasion of the difference between the 
 sums here and

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 8  And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I
 have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the
 iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
 &nbsp; 9  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,
 &nbsp; 10  Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I offer thee
 three <I>things:</I> choose thee one of them, that I may do <I>it</I> unto
 thee.
 &nbsp; 11  So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Choose thee
 &nbsp; 12  Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed
 before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh
 <I>thee;</I> or else three days the sword of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, even the
 pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> destroying
 throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself
 what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.
 &nbsp; 13  And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall
 now into the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for very great <I>are</I> his mercies:
 but let me not fall into the hand of man.
 &nbsp; 14  So the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of
 Israel seventy thousand men.
 &nbsp; 15  And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as
 he was destroying, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> beheld, and he repented him of the
 evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay
 now thine hand. And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> stood by the
 threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
 &nbsp; 16  And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in
 his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders
 <I>of Israel, who were</I> clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their
 faces.
 &nbsp; 17  And David said unto God, <I>Is it</I> not I <I>that</I> commanded the
 people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done
 evil indeed; but <I>as for</I> these sheep, what have they done? let
 thine hand, I pray thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God, be on me, and on my
 father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be
 plagued.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David is here under the rod for numbering the people, that rod of 
 correction which drives out the foolishness that is bound up in the 
 heart, the foolishness of pride. Let us briefly observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he was corrected. If God's dearest children do amiss, they must 
 expect to smart for it. 

 1. He is given to understand that God is displeased; and that it is no
 small uneasiness to so good a man as David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 God takes notice of, and is displeased with, the sins of his people;
 and no sin is more displeasing to him than pride of heart: nor is 
 anything more humbling, and grieving, and mortifying to a gracious 
 soul, than to see itself under God's displeasure.

 2. He is put to his choice whether he will be punished by war, famine,
 or pestilence; for punished he must be, and by one of these. Thus, for 
 his further humiliation, he is put into a strait, a great strait, and 
 has the terror of all the three judgments impressed upon his mind, no 
 doubt to his great amazement, while he is considering which he shall 
 choose.

 3. He hears of 70,000 of his subjects who in a few hours were struck
 dead by the pestilence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He was proud of the multitude of his people, but divine Justice took a
 course to make them fewer. Justly is that taken from us, weakened, or 
 embittered to us, which we are proud of. David must have the people 
 numbered: <I>Bring me the number of them,</I> says he, <I>that I may 
 know it.</I> But now God numbers them after another manner, <I>numbers 
 to the sword,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:12">Isa. lxv. 12</A>.

 And David had another number of them brought, more to his confusion
 than was to his satisfaction, namely, the number of the slain--a black 
 bill of mortality, which is a drawback to his muster-roll. 

 4. He sees the destroying angel, with his sword drawn against
 Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This could not but be very terrible to him, as it was a visible
 indication of the anger of Heaven, and threatened the utter destruction 
 of that beloved city. Pestilences make the greatest devastations in the 
 most populous places. The sight of an angel, though coming peaceably 
 and on a friendly errand, has made even mighty men to tremble; how 
 dreadful then must this sight be of an angel with a drawn sword in his 
 hand, a flaming sword, like that of the cherubim, which turned every 
 way to keep the way of the tree of life! While we lie under the wrath
 of God the holy angels are armed against us, though we see them not as 
 David did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he bore the correction. 

 1. He made a very penitent confession of his sin, and prayed earnestly
 for the pardon of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Now he owned that he had sinned, had sinned greatly, had done
 foolishly, very foolishly; and he entreated that, however he might be 
 corrected for it, the iniquity of it might be done away.

 2. He accepted the punishment of his iniquity: "Let thy hand be <I>on
 me, and on my father's house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 I submit to the rod, only let me be the sufferer, for I am the sinner;
 mine is the guilty head at which the sword should be pointed."

 3. He cast himself upon the mercy of God (though he knew he was angry
 with him) and did not entertain any hard thoughts of him. However it 
 be, <I>Let us fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies are 
 great,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Good men, even when God frowns upon them, think well of him. <I>Though
 he slay me, yet will I trust in him.</I> 

 4. He expressed a very tender concern for the people, and it went to
 his heart to see them plagued for his transgression: <I>These sheep, 
 what have they done?</I></P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Then the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Gad to say to David,
 that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in the
 threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
 &nbsp; 19  And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in
 the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 20  And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons
 with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
 &nbsp; 21  And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and
 went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with
 <I>his</I> face to the ground.
 &nbsp; 22  Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of <I>this</I>
 threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be
 stayed from the people.
 &nbsp; 23  And Ornan said unto David, Take <I>it</I> to thee, and let my
 lord the king do <I>that which is</I> good in his eyes: lo, I give
 <I>thee</I> the oxen <I>also</I> for burnt offerings, and the threshing
 instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give
 it all.
 &nbsp; 24  And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it
 for the full price: for I will not take <I>that</I> which <I>is</I> thine
 for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.
 &nbsp; 25  So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of
 gold by weight.
 &nbsp; 26  And David built there an altar unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and offered
 burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt
 offering.
 &nbsp; 27  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded the angel; and he put up his sword
 again into the sheath thereof.
 &nbsp; 28  At that time when David saw that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had answered him
 in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed
 there.
 &nbsp; 29  For the tabernacle of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which Moses made in the
 wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, <I>were</I> at that
 season in the high place at Gibeon.
 &nbsp; 30  But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he
 was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the controversy concluded, and, upon David's repentance, 
 his peace made with God. <I>Though thou wast angry with me, thy anger 
 is turned away.</I> 

 1. A stop was put to the progress of the execution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 When David repented of the sin God repented of the judgment, and
 ordered the destroying angel to <I>stay his hand</I> and <I>sheath his 
 sword,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 2. Direction was given to David to rear an altar in the threshing-floor
 of Ornan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 The angel commanded the prophet Gad to bring David this direction. The
 same angel that had, in God's name, carried on the war, is here forward 
 to set on foot the treaty of peace; for angels do not desire the woeful 
 day. The angel could have given this order to David himself; but he 
 chose to do it by his seer, that he might put an honour upon the 
 prophetic office. Thus the revelation of Jesus Christ was notified by 
 the angel to John, and by him to the churches. The commanding of David 
 to build an altar was a blessed token of reconciliation; for, if God 
 had been pleased to kill him, he would not have appointed, because he 
 would not have accepted, a sacrifice at his hands.

 3. David immediately made a bargain with Ornan for the threshing-floor;
 for he would not serve God at other people's charge. Ornan generously
 offered it to him gratis, not only in complaisance to the king, but 
 because he had himself <I>seen the angel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 which so terrified him that he and his four sons hid themselves, as
 unable to bear the brightness of his glory and afraid of his drawn 
 sword. Under these apprehensions he was willing to do anything towards 
 making the atonement. Those that are duly sensible of the terrors of 
 the Lord will do all they can, in their places, to promote religion, 
 and encourage all the methods of reconciliation for the turning away of 
 God's wrath. 

 4. God testified his acceptance of David's offerings on this altar; He
 <I>answered him from heaven by fire,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 To signify that God's anger was turned away from him, the fire that
 might justly have fastened upon the sinner fastened upon the sacrifice 
 and consumed that; and, upon this, the destroying sword was returned 
 into its sheath. Thus Christ was made sin and a curse for us, and it 
 pleased the Lord to bruise him, that through him God might be to us, 
 not a consuming fire, but a reconciled Father.

 5. He continued to offer his sacrifices upon this altar. The brazen
 altar which Moses made was at Gibeon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 and there all the sacrifices of Israel were offered; but David was so
 terrified at the sight of the sword of the angel that he <I>could not 
 go thither,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 The business required haste, when the plague was begun. Aaron must go
 quickly, nay, he must <I>run,</I> to make atonement,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:46,47">Num. xvi. 46, 47</A>.

 And the case here was no less urgent; so that David had not time to go
 to Gibeon: nor durst he leave the angel with his sword drawn over 
 Jerusalem, lest the fatal stroke should be given before he came back.
 And therefore God, in tenderness to him, bade him build an altar in 
 that place, dispensing with his own law concerning one altar because of 
 the present distress, and accepting the sacrifices offered on this new 
 altar, which was not set up in opposition to that, but in concurrence 
 with it. The symbols of unity were not so much insisted on as unity 
 itself. Nay, when the present distress was over (as it should seem), 
 David, as long as he lived, sacrificed there, though the altar at 
 Gibeon was still kept up; for God had owned the sacrifices that were 
 here offered and had testified his acceptance of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 On those administrations in which we have experienced the tokens of
 God's presence, and have found that he is with us of a truth, it is 
 good to continue our attendance. "Here God had graciously met me, and 
 therefore I will still expect to meet with him."</P>
