 In this chapter we have an account of the solemn passover which 
 Hezekiah kept in the first year of his reign. 

 I. The consultation about it, and the resolution he and his people came
 to for the observance of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:2-5">ver. 2-5</A>.

 II. The invitation he sent to Judah and Israel to come and keep it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:1,6">ver. 1, 6-12</A>.

 III. The joyful celebration of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:13-27">ver. 13-27</A>.

 By this the reformation, set on foot in the foregoing chapter, was
 greatly advanced and established, and that nail in God's holy place 
 clenched.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters
 also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God
 of Israel.
 &nbsp; 2  For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
 congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second
 month.
 &nbsp; 3  For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests
 had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the
 people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 4  And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
 &nbsp; 5  So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout
 all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to
 keep the passover unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel at Jerusalem: for
 they had not done <I>it</I> of a long <I>time in such sort</I> as it was
 written.
 &nbsp; 6  So the posts went with the letters from the king and his
 princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the
 commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn
 again unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he
 will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the
 hand of the kings of Assyria.
 &nbsp; 7  And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren,
 which trespassed against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of their fathers, <I>who</I>
 therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.
 &nbsp; 8  Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers <I>were, but</I> yield
 yourselves unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and enter into his sanctuary, which he
 hath sanctified for ever: and serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, that the
 fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.
 &nbsp; 9  For if ye turn again unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, your brethren and your
 children <I>shall find</I> compassion before them that lead them
 captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God <I>is</I> gracious and merciful, and will not turn away
 <I>his</I> face from you, if ye return unto him.
 &nbsp; 10  So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
 Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to
 scorn, and mocked them.
 &nbsp; 11  Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun
 humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 12  Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to
 do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A passover resolved upon. That annual feast was instituted as a 
 memorial of the bringing of the children of Israel out of Egypt.  It 
 happened that the reviving of the temple service fell within the 
 appointed days of that feast, the seventeenth day of the first month: 
 this brought that forgotten solemnity to mind. "What shall we do," says 
 Hezekiah, "about the passover? It is a very comfortable ordinance, and 
 has been long neglected. How shall we revive it? The time has elapsed 
 for this year; we cannot go about it immediately; the congregation is 
 thin, the people have not notice, the priests are not prepared, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Must we defer it till another year?" Many, it is likely, were for
 deferring it; but Hezekiah considered that by that time twelve-month 
 the good affections of the people would cool, and it would be too long 
 to want the benefit of the ordinance; and therefore, finding a proviso 
 in the law of Moses that particular persons who were unclean in the 
 first month might keep the passover the fourteenth day of the second 
 month and be accepted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:11">Num. ix. 11</A>),

 he doubted not but that it might be extended to the congregation.
 Whereupon they resolved to keep the passover <I>in the second 
 month.</I> Let the circumstance give way to the substance, and let not 
 the thing itself be lost upon a nicety about the time. It is good 
 striking while the iron is hot, and taking people when they are in a 
 good mind. Delays are dangerous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A proclamation issued out to give notice of this passover and to 
 summon the people to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. An invitation was sent to the ten revolted tribes to stir them up to 
 come and attend this solemnity. Letters were written to Ephraim and 
 Manasseh to invite them to Jerusalem to keep this passover 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 not with any political design, to bring them back to the house of
 David, but with a pious design to bring them back to the Lord God of 
 Israel.  "Let them take whom they will for their king," says Hezekiah, 
 "so they will but take him for their God." The matters in difference 
 between Judah and Israel, either upon a civil or sacred account, shall 
 not hinder but that if the people of Israel will sincerely return to 
 the Lord their God Hezekiah will bid them as welcome to the passover as 
 any of his own subjects. Expresses are sent post throughout all the 
 tribes of Israel with memorials earnestly pressing the people to take 
 this opportunity of returning to the God from whom they had revolted. 
 Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The contents of the circular letters that were despatched upon the 
 occasion, in which Hezekiah discovers a great concern both for the 
 honour of God and for the welfare of the neighbouring kingdom, the 
 prosperity of which he seems passionately desirous of, though he not 
 only received no toll, tribute, or custom, from it, but it had often, 
 and not long since, been vexatious to his kingdom. This is rendering 
 good for evil.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] What it is which he presses them to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Yield yourselves unto the Lord.</I> Before you can come into
 communion with him you must come into covenant with him." <I>Give the 
 hand to the Lord</I> (so the word is), that is, "Consent to take him 
 for your God." A bargain is confirmed by giving the hand. "Strike this 
 bargain. Join yourselves to him in an everlasting covenant. 
 <I>Subscribe with the hand</I> to be his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:5">Isa. xliv. 5</A>.

 Give him your hand, in token of giving him your heart.  Lay your hand
 to his plough.  Devote yourselves to his service, to work for him. 
 <I>Yield to him,</I>" that is, "Come up to his terms, come under his 
 government, stand it not out any longer against him." "<I>Yield to 
 him,</I> to be absolutely and universally at his command, at his 
 disposal, to be, and do, and have, and suffer, whatever he pleases. In 
 order to this, be not <I>stiff-necked as your fathers were;</I> let not 
 your corrupt and wicked wills rise up in resistance of and rebellion 
 against the will of God.  Say not that you will do what you please, but 
 resolve to do what he pleases." There is in the carnal mind a 
 stiffness, an obstinacy, an unaptness to comply with God.  We have it 
 from our fathers; it is bred in the bone with us. This must be 
 conquered; and the will that had in it a spirit of contradiction must 
 be melted into the will of God; and to his yoke the neck that was an 
 iron sinew must be bowed and fitted.  In pursuance of this resignation 
 to God, he presses them <I>to enter into his sanctuary,</I> that is, to 
 attend upon him in that place which he had chosen, to put his name 
 there, and serve him in the ordinances which he had appointed.  "The 
 doors of the sanctuary are now opened, and you have liberty to enter; 
 the temple service is now revived, and you are welcome to join in it." 
 The king says, <I>Come;</I> the princes and priests say, <I>Come; 
 whosoever will, let him come.</I> This he calls

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)
 
 <I>turning to the Lord God;</I> for they had forsaken him, and
 worshipped other gods. <I>Repent now, and be converted.</I> Thus those 
 who through grace have turned to God themselves should do all they can 
 to bring others back to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] What arguments he uses to persuade them to do this. <I>First,</I> 
 "You are children of Israel, and therefore stand related, stand 
 obliged, to the God of Israel, from whom you have revolted." 
 <I>Secondly,</I> "The God you are called to return to is the God of 
 Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, a God in covenant with your first fathers, 
 who served him and yielded themselves to him; and it was their honour 
 and happiness that they did so." <I>Thirdly,</I> "Your late fathers 
 that forsook him and trespassed against him have been given up to 
 desolation; their apostasy and idolatry have been their ruin, as you 
 see 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 let their harms be your warnings." <I>Fourthly,</I> "You yourselves are
 but a <I>remnant</I> narrowly <I>escaped out of the hands of the kings 
 of Assyria</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and therefore are concerned to put yourselves under the protection of
 the God of your fathers, that you be not quite swallowed up." 
 <I>Fifthly,</I> "This is the only way of <I>turning away the fierceness 
 of God's anger from you</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 which will certainly consume you if you continue stiff-necked."
 <I>Lastly,</I> "If you return to God in a way of duty, he will return 
 to you in a way of mercy." This he begins with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 and concludes with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 In general, "You will find him <I>gracious and merciful,</I> and one
 that <I>will not turn away his face from you,</I> if you seek him, 
 notwithstanding the provocations you have given him." Particularly, 
 "You may hope that he will turn again the captivity of your brethren 
 that are carried away, and bring them back to their own land." Could 
 any thing be expressed more pathetically, more movingly?  Could there 
 be a better cause, or could it be better pleaded?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The entertainment which Hezekiah's messengers and message met 
 with. It does not appear that Hoshea, who was now king of Israel, took 
 any umbrage from, or gave any opposition to, the dispersing of these 
 proclamations through his kingdom, nor that he forbade his subjects to 
 accept the invitation. He seems to have left them entirely to their 
 liberty. They might go to Jerusalem to worship if they pleased; for, 
 though he did evil, yet <I>not like the kings of Israel that were 
 before him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:2">2 Kings  xvii. 2</A>.

 He saw ruin coming upon his kingdom, and, if any of his subjects would
 try this expedient to prevent it, they had his full permission. But, 
 for the people, 

 [1.] The generality of them slighted the call and turned a deaf ear to 
 it. The messengers went from city to city, some to one and some to 
 another, and used pressing entreaties with the people to come up to 
 Jerusalem to keep the passover; but they were so far from complying 
 with the message that they abused those that brought it, <I>laughed 
 them to scorn, and mocked them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 not only refused, but refused with disdain. Tell them of the God of
 Abraham!  they knew him not, they had other gods to serve, Baal and 
 Ashtaroth.  Tell them of the sanctuary! their high places were as good. 
 Tell them of God's mercy and wrath! they neither dreaded the one nor 
 desired the other. No marvel that the king's messengers were thus 
 despitefully used by this apostate race when God's messengers were so, 
 his servants the prophets, who produced credentials from him.  The 
 destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes was now at hand. It was 
 but two or three years after this that the king of Assyria laid siege 
 to Samaria, which ended in the captivity of those tribes. Just before 
 this they had not only a king of their own that permitted them to 
 return to God's sanctuary, but a king of Judah that earnestly invited 
 them to do it.  Had they generally accepted this invitation, it might 
 have prevented their ruin; but their contempt of it hastened and 
 aggravated it, and left them inexcusable.

 [2.] Yet there were some few that accepted the invitation. The message, 
 though to some it was a <I>savour of death unto death,</I> was to 
 others a <I>savour of life unto life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 In the worst of times God has had a remnant; so he had here, many of
 Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun (here is no mention of any out of Ephraim, 
 though some of that tribe are mentioned,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 <I>humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem,</I> that is, were sorry
 for their sins and submitted to God.  Pride keeps men from yielding 
 themselves to the Lord; when that is brought down, the work is 
 done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A command was given to the men of Judah to attend this solemnity; 
 and they universally obeyed it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They did it with one heart, were all of a mind in it, and <I>the hand
 of God gave</I> them that <I>one heart;</I> for it is in the day of 
 power that Christ's subjects are made willing. It is God that works 
 both <I>to will</I> and <I>to do.</I> When people, at any time, 
 manifest an unexpected forwardness to do that which is good, we must 
 acknowledge that hand of God in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the
 feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great
 congregation.
 &nbsp; 14  And they arose and took away the altars that <I>were</I> in
 Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and
 cast <I>them</I> into the brook Kidron.
 &nbsp; 15  Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth <I>day</I> of the
 second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and
 sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into
 the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 16  And they stood in their place after their manner, according
 to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the
 blood, <I>which they received</I> of the hand of the Levites.
 &nbsp; 17  For <I>there were</I> many in the congregation that were not
 sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing
 of the passovers for every one <I>that was</I> not clean, to sanctify
 <I>them</I> unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 18  For a multitude of the people, <I>even</I> many of Ephraim, and
 Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet
 did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But
 Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> pardon every one
 &nbsp; 19  <I>That</I> prepareth his heart to seek God, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of his
 fathers, though <I>he be</I> not <I>cleansed</I> according to the
 purification of the sanctuary.
 &nbsp; 20  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The time appointed for the passover having arrived, a very great 
 congregation came together upon the occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preparation they made for the passover, and good preparation it 
 was: <I>They took away</I> all <I>the</I> idolatrous <I>altars</I> that 
 were found, not only in the temple, but <I>in Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 Before they kept the feast, they cast out this old leaven. The best
 preparation we can make for the gospel passover is to cast away our 
 iniquities, our spiritual idolatries.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The celebration of the passover. In this the people were so forward 
 and zealous that the priests and Levites blushed to see themselves 
 out-done by the commonalty, to see them more ready to bring sacrifices 
 than they were to offer them. This put them upon sanctifying themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 that the work might not stand still for want of hands to carry it on.
 The notice we take of the zeal of others should make us ashamed of our 
 own coldness, and quicken us not only to do our duty, but to do it 
 well, and to sanctify ourselves to it. They did according to the duty 
 of their place

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 sprinkling <I>the blood upon the altar,</I> which was a type of Christ
 our passover sacrificed for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The irregularities they were guilty of in this solemnity. The 
 substance was well managed, and with a great deal of devotion; but, 
 besides that it was a month out of time, 

 1. The <I>Levites killed the passover,</I> which should have been done
 by the priests only, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 They also assisted more than the law ordinarily allowed in offering the
 other sacrifices, particularly those that were for the purifying of the 
 unclean, many of which there was now occasion for. Some think that it 
 was the offerers' work, not the priests', that the Levites had here the 
 charge of. Ordinarily every man killed his lamb, but now for those that 
 were under any ceremonial pollution the Levites killed it.

 2. Many were permitted to eat the passover who were not purified
 according to the strictness of the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 This was the second month, and there was not warrant to put them off
 further to the third month, as, if it had been the first month, the law 
 would have permitted them to eat it the second. And they were loth to 
 forbid them communicating at all, lest they should discourage new 
 converts, and send those away complaining whom they desired to send 
 away rejoicing.  Grotius observes from this that ritual institutions 
 must give way, not only to a public necessity, but to a public benefit 
 and advantage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Hezekiah's prayer to God for the forgiveness of this irregularity. 
 It was his zeal that had called them together in such haste, and he 
 would not that any should fare the worse for being straitened of time 
 in their preparation. He therefore thought himself concerned to be an 
 intercessor for those that <I>ate the passover otherwise than it was 
 written,</I> that there might not be wrath upon them from the Lord. His 
 prayer was,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A short prayer, but to the purpose: <I>The good Lord pardon every 
 one</I> in the congregation that has fixed, engaged, or <I>prepared, 
 his heart</I> to those services, though the ceremonial preparation be 
 wanting. Note, 

 (1.) The great thing required in our attendance upon God in solemn 
 ordinances is that we <I>prepare our hearts to seek him,</I> that we be 
 sincere and upright in all we do, that the inward man be engaged and 
 employed in it, and that we make heart-work of it; it is all nothing 
 without this. <I>Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward part.</I> 
 Hezekiah does not pray that this might be dispensed with, nor that the 
 want of other things might be pardoned where there was not this. For 
 <I>this</I> is the <I>one thing needful,</I> that we <I>seek God,</I> 
 his favour, his honour, and that we set our hearts to do it.  

 (2.) Where this sincerity and fixedness of heart are there may still be 
 many defects and infirmities, both the frame of the spirit and the 
 performance of the service may be short of <I>the purification of the 
 sanctuary.</I> Corruptions may not be so fully conquered, thoughts not 
 so closely fixed, affections not so lively, faith not so operative, as 
 they should be. Here is a defect in sanctuary purification. There is 
 nothing perfect under the sun, nor <I>a just man that doeth good, and 
 sinneth not.</I> 

 (3.) These defects need pardoning healing grace; for omissions in duty 
 are sins as well as omissions of duty. If God should deal with us in 
 strict justice according to the best of our performances, we should be 
 undone. 

 (4.) The way to obtain pardon for our deficiencies in duty, and all the
 iniquities of our holy things, is to seek it of God by prayer; it is
 not so a pardon of course but that it must be obtained by petition 
 through the blood of Christ. 

 (5.) In this prayer we must take encouragement from the goodness of 
 God: <I>The good Lord pardon;</I> for, when he proclaimed his goodness, 
 he insisted most upon this branch of it, <I>forgiving iniquity, 
 transgression, and sin.</I> 

 (6.) It is the duty of those that have the charge of others, not only 
 to look to themselves, but to those also that are under their charge, 
 to see wherein they are wanting, and to pray for them, as Hezekiah 
 here. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:5">Job i. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A successful prayer: <I>The Lord hearkened to Hezekiah,</I> was well 
 pleased with his pious concern for the congregation, and, in answer to 
 his prayer, <I>healed the people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 not only did not lay their sin to their charge, but graciously accepted

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem
 kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great
 gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> day by
 day, <I>singing</I> with loud instruments unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 22  And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that
 taught the good knowledge of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and they did eat
 throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and
 making confession to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of their fathers.
 &nbsp; 23  And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven
 days: and they kept <I>other</I> seven days with gladness.
 &nbsp; 24  For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a
 thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave
 to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep:
 and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
 &nbsp; 25  And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the
 Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and
 the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt
 in Judah, rejoiced.
 &nbsp; 26  So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of
 Solomon the son of David king of Israel <I>there was</I> not the like
 in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 27  Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people:
 and their voice was heard, and their prayer came <I>up</I> to his holy
 dwelling place, <I>even</I> unto heaven.

 After the passover followed the feast of unleavened bread, which 
 continued seven days. How that was observed we are here told, and every 
 thing in this account looks pleasant and lively. 

 1. Abundance of sacrifices were offered to God in peace-offerings, by
 which they both acknowledged and implored the favour of God, and on 
 part of which the offerers feasted with their friends during these 
 seven days

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 in token of their communion with God and the comfort they took in his
 favour and their reconciliation to him. To keep up this part of the 
 service, that God's altar might be abundantly regaled with the fat and 
 blood and his priests and people with the flesh of the peace-offerings, 
 Hezekiah gave out of his own stock 1000 bullocks and 7000 sheep, and 
 the princes, excited by his pious example, gave the same number of 
 bullocks and a greater number of sheep, and all for peace-offerings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 By this God was honoured, the joy of the festival was kept up, and the
 strangers were encouraged to come again to Jerusalem. It was generously 
 done of the king and the princes thus plentifully to entertain the 
 whole congregation; but what is a great estate good for but that it 
 puts men into a capacity of doing so much the more good?  Christ 
 feasted those that followed him. I believe neither Hezekiah nor his 
 princes were the poorer at the year's end for this their pious 
 liberality.

 2. Many good prayers were put up to God with the peace-offerings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 They <I>made confession to the Lord God of their fathers,</I> in which
 the intent and meaning of the peace-offerings were directed and 
 explained. When the priests sprinkled the blood and burnt the fat they 
 made confession, so did the people when they feasted on their part.  
 They made a religious confession of their relation to God and 
 dependence upon him, a penitent confession of their sins and 
 infirmities, a thankful confession of God's mercies to them, and a 
 supplicatory confession of their wants and desires; and, in all these, 
 they had an eye to God as <I>the God of their fathers,</I> a God in 
 covenant with them. 

 3. There was a great deal of good preaching.  The Levites (whose office
 it was,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:10">Deut. xxxiii. 10</A>)

 <I>taught the people the good knowledge of the Lord,</I> read and
 opened the scriptures, and instructed the congregation concerning God 
 and their duty to him; and great need there was of this, after so long 
 a famine of the word as there had been in the last reign. Hezekiah did 
 not himself preach, but he <I>spoke comfortably to the Levites</I> that 
 did, attended their preaching, commended their diligence, and assured 
 them of his protection and countenance. Hereby he encouraged them to 
 study hard and take pains, and put a reputation upon them, that the 
 people might respect and regard them the more. Princes and magistrates, 
 by owning and encouraging faithful and laborious preachers, greatly 
 serve the interest of God's kingdom among men. 

 4. They sang psalms every day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>The Levites and priests praised the Lord day by day,</I> both with
 songs and musical instruments, thus expressing their own and exciting 
 one another's joy in God and thankfulness to him.  Praising God should 
 be much of our work in our religious assemblies. 

 5.  Having kept the seven days of the feast in this religious manner,
 they had so much comfort in the service that they <I>kept other seven 
 days,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 They did not institute any new modes of worship, but repeated and
 continued the old. The case was extraordinary: they had been long 
 without the ordinance; guilt had been contracted by the neglect of it; 
 they had now got a very great congregation together, and were in a 
 devout serious frame; they knew not when they might have such another 
 opportunity, and therefore could not now find in their hearts to 
 separate till they had doubled the time.  Many of them were a great way 
 from home, and had business in the country to look after, for, this 
 being the second month, they were in the midst of their harvest; yet 
 they were in no haste to return: the zeal of God's house made them 
 forget their secular affairs. How unlike those who snuffed at God's 
 service, and said, <I>What a weariness is it!</I> Or those who asked, 
 <I>When will the sabbath be gone?</I> The servants of God should abound 
 in his work. 

 6. All this they did <I>with gladness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>);

 they all rejoiced, and particularly <I>the strangers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 <I>So there was great joy in Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 Never was the like since the dedication of the temple in Solomon's
 time. Note, Holy duties should be performed with holy gladness; we 
 should be forward to them, and take pleasure in them, relish the 
 sweetness of communion with God, and look upon it as matter of 
 unspeakable joy and comfort that we are thus favoured and have such 
 earnests of everlasting joy. 

 7. The congregation was at length dismissed with a solemn blessing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 (1.) The priests pronounced it; for it was part of their office to 
 <I>bless the people</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:22,23">Num. vi. 22, 23</A>),

 in which they were both the people's mouth to God by way of prayer and
 God's mouth to the people by way of promise; for their blessing 
 included both. In it they testified both their desire of the people's 
 welfare and their dependence upon God and that word of his grace to 
 which they commended them. What a comfort is it to a congregation to be 
 sent home thus crowned!

 (2.) God said <I>Amen</I> to it. The voice of the priests, when they 
 <I>blessed the people, was heard in heaven</I> and came up to the 
 <I>habitation of God's holiness.</I> When they pronounced the blessing 
 God commanded it, and perhaps gave some sensible token of the 
 ratification of it. The prayer that comes up to heaven in a cloud of 
 incense will come down again to this earth in showers of blessings.</P>
