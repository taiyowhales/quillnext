 In the description of the lots of Judah and Benjamin we have an account 
 both of the borders that surrounded them and of the cities contained in 
 them. In that of Ephraim and Manasseh we have the borders, but not the 
 cities; in this chapter Simeon and Dan are described by their cities 
 only, and not their borders, because they lay very much within Judah, 
 especially the former; the rest have both their borders described and 
 their cities names, especially frontiers. Here is, 

 I. The lot of Simeon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:1-9">ver.  1-9</A>.

 II. Of Zebulun, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:10-16">ver. 10-16</A>.

 III. Of Issachar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:17-23">ver. 17-23</A>.
 
 IV.  Of Asher, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:24-31">ver. 24-31</A>.

 V. Of Naphtali, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:32-39">ver. 32-39</A>.
 
 VI. Of Dan,

 Lastly, The inheritance assigned to Joshua himself and his own family,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And the second lot came forth to Simeon, <I>even</I> for the tribe
 of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their
 inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.
 &nbsp; 2 And they had in their inheritance Beer-sheba, or Sheba, and
 Moladah,
 &nbsp; 3 And Hazar-shual, and Balah, and Azem,
 &nbsp; 4 And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,
 &nbsp; 5 And Ziklag, and Beth-marcaboth, and Hazar-susah,
 &nbsp; 6 And Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their
 villages:
 &nbsp; 7 Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their
 villages:
 &nbsp; 8 And all the villages that <I>were</I> round about these cities to
 Baalath-beer, Ramath of the south. This <I>is</I> the inheritance of
 the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.
 &nbsp; 9 Out of the portion of the children of Judah <I>was</I> the
 inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the
 children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children
 of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Simeon's lot was drawn after Judah's, Joseph's, and Benjamin's, because 
 Jacob had put that tribe under disgrace; yet it is put before the two 
 younger sons of Leah and the three sons of the handmaids. Not one 
 person of note, neither judge nor prophet, was of this tribe, that we 
 know of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The situation of their lot was within that of Judah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 and was taken from it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 It seems, those that first surveyed the land thought it larger than it
 was, and that it would have held out to give every tribe in proportion 
 as large a share as they had carved out for Judah; but, upon a more 
 strict enquiry, it was found that it would not reach

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>The part of the children of Judah was too much for them,</I> more
 than they needed, and more, as it proved, than fell to their share. Yet 
 God did not by the lot lessen it, but left it to their prudence and 
 care afterwards to discover and rectify the mistake, which when they 
 did, 

 1. The men of Judah did not oppose the taking away of the cities again,
 which by the first distribution fell within their border, when they 
 were convinced that they had more than their proportion. In all such 
 cases errors must be excepted and a review admitted if there be 
 occasion. Though, in strictness, what fell to their lot was their right 
 against all the world, yet they would not insist upon it when it 
 appeared that another tribe would want what they had to spare. Note, We 
 must look on the things of others, and not on our own only. The 
 abundance of some must supply the wants of others, that there may be 
 somewhat of an equality, for which there may be equity where there is 
 not law. 

 2. That which was thus taken off from Judah to be put into a new lot 
 Providence directed to the tribe of Simeon, that Jacob's prophecy 
 concerning this tribe might be fulfilled, <I>I will divide them in 
 Jacob.</I> The cities of Simeon were scattered in Judah, with which 
 tribe they were surrounded, except on that side towards the sea.  This 
 brought them into a confederacy with the tribe of Judah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:3">Judg. i. 3</A>),

 and afterwards was a happy occasion of the adherence of many of this
 tribe to the house of David, at the time of the revolt of the ten 
 tribes to Jeroboam.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+15:9">2 Chron. xv. 9</A>,

 <I>out of Simeon they fell to</I> Asa <I>in abundance.</I> It is good
 being in a good neighbourhood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The cities within their lot are here named. Beersheba, or Sheba, 
 for these names seem to refer to the same place, is put first. Ziklag, 
 which we read of in David's story, is one of them. What course they 
 took to enlarge their borders and make room for themselves we find

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun
 according to their families: and the border of their inheritance
 was unto Sarid:
 &nbsp; 11 And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and
 reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that <I>is</I> before
 Jokneam;
 &nbsp; 12 And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the
 border of Chisloth-tabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and
 goeth up to Japhia,
 &nbsp; 13 And from thence passeth on along on the east to
 Gittah-hepher, to Ittah-kazin, and goeth out to Remmon-methoar to
 Neah;
 &nbsp; 14 And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon:
 and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthah-el:
 &nbsp; 15 And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and
 Beth-lehem: twelve cities with their villages.
 &nbsp; 16 This <I>is</I> the inheritance of the children of Zebulun
 according to their families, these cities with their villages.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is the lot of Zebulun, who, though born of Leah after Issachar, 
 yet was blessed by Jacob and Moses before him; and therefore it was so 
 ordered that his lot was drawn before that of Issachar, north of which 
 it lay and south of Asher. 

 1. The lot of this tribe was washed by the great sea on the west, and
 by the sea of Tiberias on the east, answering Jacob's prophecy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:13">Gen. xlix. 13</A>),

 <I>Zebulun shall be a haven of ships,</I> trading ships on the great
 sea and fishing ships on the sea of Galilee. 

 2.  Though there were some places in this tribe which were made famous 
 in the Old Testament, especially <I>Mount Carmel,</I> on which the 
 famous trial was between God and Baal in Elijah's time, yet it was made 
 much more illustrious in the New Testament; for within the lot of this 
 tribe was Nazareth, where our blessed Saviour spent so much of his time 
 on earth, and from which he was called <I>Jesus of Nazareth,</I> and 
 <I>Mount Tabor</I> on which he was transfigured, and that coast of the 
 sea of Galilee on which Christ preached so many sermons and wrought so 
 many miracles.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 <I>And</I> the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children
 of Issachar according to their families.
 &nbsp; 18 And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and
 Shunem,
 &nbsp; 19 And Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath,
 &nbsp; 20 And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,
 &nbsp; 21 And Remeth, and En-gannim, and En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez;

 Beth-shemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan:
 sixteen cities with their villages.

 Issachar according to their families, the cities and their
 villages.

 The lot of Issachar ran from Jordan in the east to the great sea in the 
 west, Manasseh on the south, and Zebulun on the north. A numerous 
 tribe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:25">Num. xxvi. 25</A>.
 
 Tola, one of the judges, was of this tribe,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:1">Judg. x. 1</A>.
 
 So was Baasha, one of the kings of Israel,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:27">1 Kings xv. 27</A>.

 The most considerable places in this tribe were, 

 1. Jezreel, in which was Ahab's palace, and near it Naboth's vineyard.
 
 2. Shunem, where lived that good Shunamite that entertained Elisha. 

 3.  The river Kishon, on the banks of which, in this tribe, Sisera was
 beaten by Deborah and Barak. 

 4. The mountains of Gilboa, on which Saul and Jonathan were slain,
 which were not far from Endor, where Saul consulted the witch.

 5. The valley of Megiddo, where Josiah was slain near Hadad-rimmon,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24 And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of
 Asher according to their families.
 &nbsp; 25 And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and
 Achshaph,
 &nbsp; 26 And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to
 Carmel westward, and to Shihor-libnath;
 &nbsp; 27 And turneth toward the sunrising to Beth-dagon, and reacheth
 to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthah-el toward the north side
 of Beth-emek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand,
 &nbsp; 28 And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, <I>even</I> unto
 great Zidon;
 &nbsp; 29 And <I>then</I> the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong
 city Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings
 thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:
 &nbsp; 30 Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with
 their villages.
 &nbsp; 31 This <I>is</I> the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
 Asher according to their families, these cities with their
 villages.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The lot of Asher lay upon the coast of the great sea. We read not of 
 any famous person of this tribe but Anna the prophetess, who was a 
 constant resident in the temple at the time of our Saviour's birth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:36">Luke ii. 36</A>.

 Nor were there many famous places in this tribe. Aphek (mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>)
 
 was the place near which Benhadad was beaten by Ahad,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:30">1 Kings xx. 30</A>.

 But close adjoining to this tribe were the celebrated sea-port towns of 
 Tyre and Sidon, which we read so much of. Tyre is called here <I>that 
 strong city</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 but Bishop Patrick thinks it was not the same Tyre that we read of
 afterwards, for that was built on an island; this old strong city was 
 on the continent. And it is conjectured by some that into these two 
 strong-holds, Sidon and Tzor, or Tyre, many of the people of Canaan 
 fled and took shelter when Joshua invaded them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>32 The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, <I>even</I>
 for the children of Naphtali according to their families.
 &nbsp; 33 And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim,
 and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings
 thereof were at Jordan:
 &nbsp; 34 And <I>then</I> the coast turneth westward to Aznoth-tabor, and
 goeth out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the
 south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah
 upon Jordan toward the sunrising.
 &nbsp; 35 And the fenced cities <I>are</I> Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath,
 Rakkath, and Chinnereth,
 &nbsp; 36 And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,
 &nbsp; 37 And Kedesh, and Edrei, and En-hazor,
 &nbsp; 38 And Iron, and Migdal-el, Horem, and Beth-anath, and
 Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.
 &nbsp; 39 This <I>is</I> the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
 Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their
 villages.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Naphtali lay furthest north of all the tribes, bordering on Mount 
 Libanus. The city of Leshem, or Liash, lay on the utmost edge of it to 
 the north, and therefore when the Danites had made themselves masters 
 of it, and called it <I>Dan,</I> the length of Canaan from north to 
 south was reckoned from Dan to Beersheba. It had Zebulun on the south, 
 Asher on the west, and Judah upon Jordan, probably a city of that name, 
 and so distinguished from the tribe of Judah on the east. It was in the 
 lot of this tribe, near the waters of Merom, that Joshua fought and 
 routed Jabin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:1-14">
 <I>ch.</I> xi. 1</A>.

 &c. In this tribe stood Capernaum and
 Bethsaida, on the north end of the sea of Tiberias, in which Christ did 
 so many mighty works; and the mountain (as is supposed) on which Christ 
 preached,

 &nbsp; 42 And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,
 &nbsp; 43 And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,

 &nbsp; 47 And the coast of the children of Dan went out <I>too little</I>
 for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against
 Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and
 possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after
 the name of Dan their father.

 Dan, though commander of one of the four squadrons of the camp of 
 Israel, in the wilderness, that which brought up the rear, yet was last 
 provided for in Canaan, and his lot fell in the southern part of 
 Canaan, between Judah on the east and the land of the Philistines on 
 the west, Ephraim on the north and Simeon on the south. Providence 
 ordered this numerous and powerful tribe into a post of danger, as best 
 able to deal with those vexatious neighbours the Philistines, and so it 
 was found in Samson.  Here is an account, 

 1. Of what fell to this tribe by lot, Zorah, and Eshtaol, and the camp 
 of Dan thereabouts, of which we read in the story of Samson. And near 
 there was the valley of Eshcol, whence the spies brought the famous 
 bunch of grapes. Japho, or Joppa was in this lot. 

 2. Of what they got by their own industry and valour, which is 
 mentioned here

 <FONT SIZE=+1>49 When they had made an end of dividing the land for
 inheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an
 inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:
 &nbsp; 50 According to the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> they gave him the city
 which he asked, <I>even</I> Timnath-serah in mount Ephraim: and he
 built the city, and dwelt therein.
 &nbsp; 51 These <I>are</I> the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and
 Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes
 of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in
 Shiloh before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, at the door of the tabernacle of the
 congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Before this account of the dividing of the land is solemnly closed up, 
 in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:51">last verse</A>,

 which intimates that the thing was done to the satisfaction of all,
 here is an account of the particular inheritance assigned to Joshua.

 1. He was last served, though the eldest and greatest man of all 
 Israel, and who, having commanded in the conquest of Canaan, might have 
 demanded the first settlement in it for himself and his family. But he 
 would make it to appear that in all he did he sought the good of his 
 country, and not any private interest of his own. He was content to be 
 unfixed till he saw them all settled; and herein is a great example to 
 all in public places to prefer the common welfare before their 
 particular satisfaction. Let the public be first served. 

 2. He had his lot <I>according to the word of the Lord.</I> It is 
 probable that, when God by Moses told Caleb what inheritance he should 
 have

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+14:9"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 9</A>),

 he gave the like promise to Joshua, which he had an eye to in making
 his election: this made his portion doubly pleasant, that he had it, 
 not as the rest by common providence, but by special promise. 

 3. He chose it in Mount Ephraim, which belonged to his own tribe, with
 which he thereby put himself in common, when he might by prerogative 
 have chosen his inheritance in some other tribe, as suppose that of 
 Judah, and thereby have distinguished himself from them. Let no man's 
 preferment or honour make him ashamed of his family or country, or 
 estrange him from it. The tabernacle was set up in the lot of Ephraim, 
 and Joshua would forecast not to be far from that. 

 4.  The <I>children of Israel</I> are said to <I>give it to him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+19:49"><I>v.</I>  49</A>),
