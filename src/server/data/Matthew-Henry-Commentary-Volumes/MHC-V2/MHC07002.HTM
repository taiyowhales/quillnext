 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And an angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and
 said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto
 the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will
 never break my covenant with you.
 &nbsp; 2 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this
 land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my
 voice: why have ye done this?
 &nbsp; 3 Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before
 you; but they shall be <I>as thorns</I> in your sides, and their gods
 shall be a snare unto you.
 &nbsp; 4 And it came to pass, when the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake these
 words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up
 their voice, and wept.
 &nbsp; 5 And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they
 sacrificed there unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was the privilege of Israel that they had not only a law in general 
 sent them from heaven, once for all, to direct them into and keep them 
 in the way of happiness, but that they had particular messages sent 
 them from heaven, as there was occasion, for reproof, for correction, 
 and for instruction in righteousness, when at any time they turned 
 aside out of that way. Besides the written word which they had before 
 them to read, they often <I>heard a word behind them, saying, This is 
 the way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:21">Isa. xxx. 21</A>.

 Here begins that way of God's dealing with them. When they would not
 hear Moses, let it be tried whether they will hear the prophets. In 
 these verses we have a very awakening sermon that was preached to them 
 when they began to cool in their religion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preacher was an <I>angel of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 not a prophet, not Phinehas, as the Jews conceit; gospel ministers are
 indeed called <I>angels of the churches,</I> but the Old-Testament 
 prophets are never called angels of the Lord; no doubt this was a 
 messenger we from heaven. Such extraordinary messengers we sometimes 
 find in this book employed in the raising up of the judges that 
 delivered Israel, as Gideon and Samson; and now, to show how various 
 are the good offices they do for God's Israel, here is one sent to 
 preach to them, to prevent their falling into sin and trouble. This 
 extraordinary messenger was sent to command, if possible, the greater 
 regard to the message, and to affect the minds of a people whom nothing 
 seemed to affect but what was sensible. The learned bishop Patrick is 
 clearly of opinion that this was not a created angel, but the Angel of 
 the covenant, the same that appeared to Joshua as <I>captain of the 
 hosts of the Lord,</I> who was God himself. Christ himself, says Dr.  
 Lightfoot; who but God and Christ could say, <I>I made you to go up out 
 of Egypt?</I> Joshua had lately admonished them to take heed of 
 entangling themselves with the Canaanites, but they regarded not the 
 words of a dying man; the same warning therefore is here brought them 
 by the living God himself, the Son of God appearing as an angel. If 
 they slight his servants, surely they will reverence his Son. This 
 angel of the Lord is said to come up from Gilgal, perhaps not walking 
 on the earth, but flying swiftly, as the angel Gabriel did to Daniel, 
 in the open firmament of heaven; but, whether walking or flying, he 
 seemed to come from Gilgal for a particular reason. Gilgal was long 
 their headquarters after they came into Canaan, many signal favours 
 they had there received from God, and there the covenant of 
 circumcision was renewed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:5">Mic. vi. 5</A>),

 of all which it was designed they should be reminded by his coming from
 Gilgal. The remembrance of <I>what we have received and heard</I> will 
 prepare us for a warning to hold fast, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:2,3">Rev. iii. 2, 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The persons to whom this sermon was preached were <I>all the 
 children of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 A great congregation for a great preacher! They were assembled either
 for war, each tribe sending in its forces for some great expedition, or 
 rather for worship, and then the place of their meeting must be Shiloh, 
 where the tabernacle was, at which they were all to come together three 
 times a year. When we attend upon God in instituted ordinances we may 
 expect to hear from him, and to receive his gifts at \ his own gates. 
 The place is called <I>Bochim</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 because it gained that name upon this occasion.  All Israel needed the
 reproof and warning here given, and therefore it is spoken to them 
 all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The sermon itself is short, but very close. God here tells them 
 plainly, 
 
 1. What he had done for them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He had brought them out of Egypt, a land of slavery and toil, into
 Canaan, a land of rest, liberty, and plenty. The miseries of the one 
 served as a foil to the felicities of the other. God had herein been 
 kind to them, true to the oath sworn to their fathers, had given such 
 proofs of his power as left them inexcusable if they distrusted it, and 
 such engagements to his service as left them inexcusable if they 
 deserted it. 

 2. What he had promised them: <I>I said, I will never break my covenant 
 with you.</I> When he took them to be his peculiar people, it was not 
 with any design to cast them off again, or to change them for another 
 people at his pleasure; let them but be faithful to him, and they 
 should find him unchangeably constant to them. He told them plainly 
 that the covenant he entered into with them should never break, unless 
 it broke on their side. 

 3. What were his just and reasonable expectations from them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 that being taken into covenant with God they should make no league with
 the Canaanites, who were both his enemies and theirs,--that having set
 up his altar they should throw down their altars, lest they should be a 
 temptation to them to serve their gods. Could any thing be demanded 
 more easy? 

 4. How they had in this very thing, which he had most insisted on, 
 disobeyed him: "But you have not in so small a matter obeyed my voice." 
 In contempt of their covenant with God, and their confederacy with each 
 other in that covenant, they made leagues of friendship with the 
 idolatrous devoted Canaanites, and connived at their altars, though 
 they stood in competition with God's. "<I>Why have you done this?</I> 
 What account can you give of this perverseness of yours at the bar of 
 right reason? What apology can you make for yourselves, or what excuse 
 can you offer?" Those that throw off their communion with God, and have 
 fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, know not what they do 
 now, and will have nothing to say for themselves in the day of account 
 shortly. 

 5. How they must expect to smart by and by for this their folly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Their tolerating the Canaanites among them would,

 (1.) Put a period to their victories: "<I>You</I> will not drive them
 out," says God, "and therefore <I>I</I> will not;" thus their sin was 
 made their punishment. Thus those who indulge their lusts and 
 corruptions, which they should mortify, forfeit the grace of God, and 
 it is justly withdrawn from them. If we will not resist the devil, we 
 cannot expect that God should tread him under our feet.

 (2.) It would involve them in continual troubles. "They shall be thorns
 in your sides to gore you, which way soever you turn, always doing you 
 one mischief or other." Those deceive themselves who expect advantage 
 by friendship with those that are enemies to God.

 (3.) It would (which was worst of all) expose them to constant
 temptation and draw them to sin. "Their gods" (their 
 <I>abominations,</I> so the Chaldee) "will be a snare to you; you will 
 find yourselves wretchedly entangled in an affection to them, and it 
 will be your ruin," so some read it. Those that approach sin are justly 
 left to themselves to fall into sin and to perish in it. God often 
 makes men's sin their punishment; and thorns and snares are <I>in the 
 way of the froward,</I> who will walk contrary to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The good success of this sermon is very remarkable: The people 
 <I>lifted up their voice and wept,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 1. The angel had told them of their sins, for which they thus expressed
 their sorrow: the lifted up their voice in confession of sin, crying 
 out against their own folly and ingratitude, and wept, as those that 
 were both ashamed of themselves and angry at themselves, as having 
 acted so directly contrary both to their reason and to their interest. 
 
 2. The angel had threatened them with the judgments of God, of which 
 they thus expressed their dread: they lifted up their voice in prayer 
 to God to turn away his wrath from them, and wept for fear of that 
 wrath. They relented upon this alarm, and their hearts melted within 
 them, and trembled at the word, and not without cause. This was good, 
 and a sign that the word they heard made an impression upon them: it is 
 a wonder sinners can ever read their Bible with dry eyes. But this was 
 not enough; they wept, but we do not find that they reformed, that they 
 went home and destroyed all the remains of idolatry and idolaters among 
 them. Many are melted under the word that harden again before they are 
 cast into a new mould. However, this general weeping,

 (1.) Gave a new name to the place

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 they called it <I>Bochim, Weepers,</I> a good name for our religious
 assemblies to answer. Had they kept close to God and their duty, no 
 voice but that of singing would have been heard in their congregation; 
 but by their sin and folly the had made other work for themselves, and 
 now nothing is to be heard but the voice of weeping.

 (2.) It gave occasion for a solemn sacrifice: They <I>sacrificed there
 unto the Lord,</I> having (as is supposed) met at Shiloh, where God's 
 altar was. They offered sacrifice to turn away God's wrath, and to 
 obtain his favour, and in token of their dedication of themselves to 
 him, and to him only, making a covenant by this sacrifice. The disease 
 being thus taken in time, and the physic administered working so well, 
 one would have hoped a cure might be effected. But by the sequel of the 
 story it appears to have been too deeply rooted to be wept out.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel
 went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.
 &nbsp; 7 And the people served the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> all the days of Joshua, and
 all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all
 the great works of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that he did for Israel.
 &nbsp; 8 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, died,
 <I>being</I> a hundred and ten years old.
 &nbsp; 9 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
 Timnath-heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the
 hill Gaash.
 &nbsp; 10 And also all that generation were gathered unto their
 fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which
 knew not the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, nor yet the works which he had done for
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 11 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and served Baalim:
 &nbsp; 12 And they forsook the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of their fathers, which
 brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods,
 of the gods of the people that <I>were</I> round about them, and bowed
 themselves unto them, and provoked the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to anger.
 &nbsp; 13 And they forsook the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.
 &nbsp; 14 And the anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was hot against Israel, and he
 delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and
 he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that
 they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
 &nbsp; 15 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was
 against them for evil, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had said, and as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had
 sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.
 &nbsp; 16 Nevertheless the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> raised up judges, which delivered them
 out of the hand of those that spoiled them.
 &nbsp; 17 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they
 went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them:
 they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in,
 obeying the commandments of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; <I>but</I> they did not so.
 &nbsp; 18 And when the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> raised them up judges, then the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was
 with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their
 enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them
 and vexed them.
 &nbsp; 19 And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, <I>that</I> they
 returned, and corrupted <I>themselves</I> more than their fathers, in
 following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them;
 they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn
 way.
 &nbsp; 20 And the anger of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was hot against Israel; and he
 said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant
 which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my
 voice;
 &nbsp; 21 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of
 the nations which Joshua left when he died:
 &nbsp; 22 That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep
 the way of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to walk therein, as their fathers did keep
 <I>it,</I> or not.
 &nbsp; 23 Therefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> left those nations, without driving them
 out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The beginning of this paragraph is only a repetition of what account we 
 had before of the people's good character during the government of 
 Joshua, and of his death and burial 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:29,30">Josh. xxiv. 29, 30</A>),

 which comes in here again only to make way for the following account,
 which this chapter gives, of their degeneracy and apostasy. The angel 
 had foretold that the Canaanites and their idols would be a snare to 
 Israel; now the historian undertakes to show that they were so, and, 
 that this may appear the more clear, he looks back a little, and takes 
 notice, 

 1. Of their happy settlement in the land of Canaan. Joshua, having
 distributed this land among them, dismissed them to the quiet and 
 comfortable possession of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>He sent them away,</I> not only every tribe, but <I>every man to his
 inheritance,</I> no doubt giving them his blessing. 

 2. Of their continuance in the faith and fear of God's holy name as 
 long as Joshua lived, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 As they went to their possessions with good resolutions to cleave to
 God, so they persisted for some time in these good resolutions, as long 
 as they had good rulers that set them good examples, gave them good 
 instructions, and reproved and restrained the corruptions that crept in 
 among them, and as long as they had fresh in remembrance the great 
 things God did for them when he brought them into Canaan: those that 
 had seen these wonders had so much sense as to believe their own eyes, 
 and so much reason as to serve that God who had appeared so gloriously 
 on their behalf; but those that followed, because they had not seen, 
 believed not.

 3. Of the death and burial of Joshua, which gave a fatal stroke to the
 interests of religion among the people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 Yet so much sense they had of their obligations to him that they did
 him honour at his death, and buried him in <I>Timnath-heres;</I> so it 
 is called here, not, as in Joshua, <I>Timnath-serah. Heres</I> 
 signifies the <I>sun,</I> a representation of which, some think, was 
 set upon his sepulchre, and gave name to it, in remembrance of the 
 sun's standing still at his word. So divers of the Jewish writers say; 
 but I much question whether an image of the sun would be allowed to the 
 honour of Joshua at that time, when, by reason of men's general 
 proneness to worship the sun, it would be in danger of being abused to 
 the dishonour of God.

 4. Of the rising of a new generation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 All that generation in a few years wore off, their good instructions
 and examples died and were buried with them, and there arose another 
 generation of Israelites who had so little sense of religion, and were 
 in so little care about it, that, notwithstanding all the advantages of 
 their education, one might truly say that they knew not the Lord, knew 
 him not aright, knew him not as he had revealed himself, else they 
 would not have forsaken him.  They were so entirely devoted to the 
 world, so intent upon the business of it or so indulgent of the flesh 
 in ease and luxury, that they never minded the true God and his holy 
 religion, and so were easily drawn aside to false gods and their 
 abominable superstitions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 And so he comes to give us a general idea of the series of things in 
 Israel during the time of the judges, the same repeated in the same 
 order.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The people of Israel forsook the God of Israel, and gave that 
 worship and honour to the dunghill deities of the Canaanites which was 
 due to him alone. <I>Be astonished, O heavens! at this, and wonder, O 
 earth! Hath a nation,</I> such a nation, so well fed, so well taught, 
 <I>changed its God,</I> such a God, a God of infinite power, unspotted 
 purity, inexhaustible goodness, and so very jealous of a competitor, 
 for stocks and stones that could do neither good nor evil? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:11,12">Jer. ii. 11, 12</A>.

 Never was there such an instance of folly, ingratitude, and
 perfidiousness. Observe how it is described here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:11-13"><I>v.</I> 11-13</A>.

 In general, <I>they did evil,</I> nothing could be more evil, that is,
 more provoking to God, nor more prejudicial to themselves, and it was 
 <I>in the sight of the Lord;</I> all evil is before him, but he takes 
 special notice of the sin of having any other god. In particular,

 1. They <I>forsook the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, and again <I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 this was one of the two great evils they were guilty of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:13">Jer. ii. 13</A>.
 
 They had been joined to the Lord in covenant, but now they forsook him,
 as a wife <I>treacherously departs from her husband.</I> "They forsook 
 the worship of the Lord," so the Chaldee: for those that forsake the 
 worship of God do in effect forsake God himself. It aggravated this 
 that he was <I>the God of their fathers,</I> so that they were <I>born 
 in his house,</I> and therefore bound to serve him; and that he 
 <I>brought them out of the land of Egypt,</I> he <I>loosed their 
 bonds,</I> and upon that account also they were obliged to serve him.  
 
 2. When they forsook the only true God they did not turn atheists, nor
 were they such fools as to say, <I>There is no God;</I> but they 
 followed other gods: so much remained of pure nature as to own a God, 
 yet so much appeared of corrupt nature as to multiply gods, and take up 
 with any, and to follow the fashion, not the rule, in religious 
 worship. Israel had the honour of being a peculiar people and dignified 
 above all others, and yet so false were they to their own privileges 
 that they were fond of the gods <I>of the people that were round about 
 them.</I> Baal and Ashtaroth, he-gods and she-gods; they made their 
 court to sun and moon, Jupiter and Juno. <I>Baalim</I> signifies 
 <I>lords,</I> and <I>Ashtaroth blessed ones,</I> both plural, for when 
 they forsook Jehovah, who is one, they had gods many and lords many, as 
 a luxuriant fancy pleased to multiply them. Whatever they took for 
 their gods, they served them and bowed down to them, gave honour to 
 them and begged favours from them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The God of Israel was hereby provoked to anger, and delivered them 
 up into the hand of their enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 He was wroth with them, for he is a jealous God and true to the honour
 of his own name; and the way he took to punish them for their apostasy 
 was to make those their tormentors whom they yielded to as their 
 tempters. They made themselves as mean and miserable by forsaking God 
 as they would have been great and happy if they had continued faithful 
 to him.

 1. The scale of victory turned against them. After they forsook God,
 whenever they took the sword in hand they were as sure to be beaten as 
 before they had been sure to conquer. Formerly their enemies could not 
 stand before them, but, wherever they went, the hand of the Lord was 
 for them; when they began to cool in their religion, God suspended his 
 favour, stopped the progress of their successes, and would not drive 
 out their enemies any more

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 only suffered them to keep their ground; but now, when they had quite
 revolted to idolatry, the war turned directly against them, and they 
 <I>could not any longer stand before their enemies.</I> God would 
 rather give the success to those that had never known nor owned him 
 than to those that had done both, but had now deserted him.  Wherever 
 they went, they might perceive that God himself had <I>turned to be 
 their enemy, and fought against them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:10">Isa. lxiii. 10</A>.

 2. The balance of power then turned against them of course. Whoever
 would might spoil them, whoever would might oppress them. God sold them 
 into the hands of their enemies; not only he delivered them up freely, 
 as we do that which we have sold, but he did it upon a valuable 
 consideration, that he might get himself honour as a jealous God, who 
 would not spare even his own peculiar people when they provoked him. He 
 sold them as insolvent debtors are sold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:25">Matt. xviii. 25</A>),

 by their sufferings to make some sort of reparation to his glory for
 the injury it sustained by their apostasy. Observe how their 
 punishment,

 (1.) Answered what they had done.  They served the gods of <I>the
 nations that were round about them,</I> even the meanest, and God made 
 then serve the princes of the nations that were round about them, even 
 the meanest. He that is company for every fool is justly made a fool of 
 by every company.

 (2.) How it answered what God has spoken. The hand of heaven was thus
 turned against them, <I>as the Lord had said,</I> and <I>as the Lord 
 had sworn</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 referring to the curse and death set before them in the covenant, with
 the blessing and life. Those that have found God true to his promises 
 may thence infer that he will be as true to his threatenings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The God of infinite mercy took pity on them in their distresses, 
 though they had brought themselves into them by their own sin and 
 folly, and wrought deliverance for them. Nevertheless, though their 
 trouble was the punishment of their sin and the accomplishment of God's 
 word, yet they were in process of time saved out of their trouble, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:16-18"><I>v.</I> 16-18</A>.

 Here observe,

 1. The inducement of their deliverance. It came purely from God's pity
 and tender compassion; the reason was fetched from within himself.  It 
 is not said, <I>It repented them because of their iniquities</I> (for 
 it appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>,

 that many of them continued unreformed), but, <I>It repented the Lord
 because of their groanings;</I> though it is not so much the burden of 
 sin as the burden of affliction that they are said to groan under. It 
 is true they deserved to perish for ever under his curse, yet, this 
 being the day of his patience and our probation, he does not stir up 
 all his wrath. He might in justice have abandoned them, but he could 
 not for pity do it.

 2. The instruments of their deliverance. God did not send angels from
 heaven to rescue them, nor bring in any foreign power to their aid, but 
 raised up judges from among themselves, as there was occasion, men to 
 whom God gave extraordinary qualifications for, and calls to, that 
 special service for which they were designed, which was to reform and 
 deliver Israel, and whose great attempts he crowned with wonderful 
 success: <I>The Lord was with the judges</I> when he raised them up, 
 and so they became saviours. Observe,

 (1.) In the days of the greatest degeneracy and distress of the church
 there shall be some whom God will either find or make to redress its 
 grievances and set things to rights.

 (2.) God must be acknowledged in the seasonable rising up of useful men
 for public service. He endues men with wisdom and courage, gives them 
 hearts to act and venture. All that are in any way the blessings of 
 their country must be looked upon as the gifts of God. 

 (3.) Whom God calls he will own, and give them his presence; whom he
 raises up he will be with.

 (4.) The judges of a land are its saviours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The degenerate Israelites were not effectually and thoroughly 
 reformed, no, not by their judges, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:17-19"><I>v.</I> 17-19</A>.

 1. Even while their judges were with them, and active in the work of
 reformation, there were those that <I>would not hearken to their 
 judges,</I> but at that very time <I>went a whoring after other 
 gods,</I> so mad were they upon their idols, and so obstinately <I>bent 
 to backslide.</I> They had been espoused to God, but broke the 
 marriage-covenant, and went a whoring after these gods.  Idolatry is 
 spiritual adultery, so vile, and base, and perfidious a thing is it, 
 and so hardly are those reclaimed that are addicted to it. 

 2. Those that in the times of reformation began to amend <I>yet turned
 quickly out of the way</I> again, and became as bad as ever. The way 
 they turned out of was that which their godly ancestors walked in, and 
 set them out in; but they soon started from under the influence both of 
 their fathers' good example and of their own good education. The wicked 
 children of godly parents do so, and will therefore have a great deal 
 to answer for. However, <I>when the judge was dead,</I> they looked 
 upon the dam which checked the stream of their idolatry as removed, and 
 then it flowed down again with so much the more fury, and the next age 
 seemed to be rather the worse for the attempts that had been made 
 towards reformation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 <I>They corrupted themselves more than their fathers,</I> strove to
 outdo them in multiplying strange gods and inventing profane and 
 impious rites of worship, as it were in contradiction to their 
 reformers. <I>They ceased not</I> from, or, as the word is, <I>they 
 would not let fall,</I> any of their own doings, grew not ashamed of 
 those idolatrous services that were most odious nor weary of those that 
 were most barbarous, would not so much as diminish one step of their 
 hard and stubborn way. Thus those that have forsaken the good ways of 
 God, which they have once known and professed, commonly grow most 
 daring and desperate in sin, and have their hearts most hardened.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. God's just resolution hereupon was still to continue the rod over 
 them, 

 1. Their sin was sparing the Canaanites, and this in contempt and
 violation of the covenant God had made with them and the commands he 
 had given them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 2. Their punishment was that the Canaanites were spared, and so they
 were beaten with their own rod. They were not all delivered into the 
 hand of Joshua while he lived, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Our Lord Jesus, though he <I>spoiled principalities and powers,</I> yet
 did not complete his victory at first. <I>We see not yet all things put 
 under him;</I> there are remains of Satan's interest in the church, as 
 there were of the Canaanites in the land; but our Joshua lives for 
 ever, and will in the great day perfect his conquest. After Joshua's 
 death, little was done for a long time against the Canaanites: Israel 
 indulged them, and grew familiar with them, and therefore God would not 
 drive them out any more,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 If they will have such inmates as these among them, let them take them,
 and see what will come of it. God chose their delusions,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:4">Isa. lxvi. 4</A>.

 Thus men cherish and indulge their own corrupt appetites and passions,
 and, instead of mortifying them, make provision for them, and therefore
 God justly leaves them to themselves under the power of their sins,
 which will be their ruin. <I>So shall their doom be; they themselves
 have decided it.</I> These remnants of the Canaanites were left to
 prove Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 <I>whether they would keep the way of the Lord or not;</I> not that God
 might know them, but that they might know themselves. It was to try,

 (1.) Whether they could resist the temptations to idolatry which the 
 Canaanites would lay before them. God had told them they could not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:4">Deut. vii. 4</A>.

 But they thought they could. "Well," said God, "I will try you;" and,
 upon trial, it was found that the tempters' charms were far too strong 
 for them. God has told us how deceitful and desperately wicked our 
 hearts are, but we are not willing to believe it till by making bold 
 with temptation we find it too true by sad experience.

 (2.) Whether they would make a good use of the vexations which the 
 remaining natives would give them, and the many troubles they would 
 occasion them, and would thereby be convinced of sin and humbled for 
 it, reformed, and driven to God and their duty, whether by continual 
 alarms from them they would be kept in awe and made afraid of provoking 
 God.</P>
