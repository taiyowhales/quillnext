 So sad was the character both of the princes and people of Israel, as 
 described in the foregoing chapter, that one might have expected God 
 would cast off a people that had so cast him off; but, as an evidence 
 to the contrary, never was Israel so blessed with a good prophet as 
 when it was so plagued with a bad king. Never was king so bold to sin 
 as Ahab; never was prophet so bold to reprove and threaten as Elijah, 
 whose story begins in this chapter and is full of wonders. Scarcely any 
 part of the Old-Testament history shines brighter than this history of 
 the spirit and power of Elias; he only, of all the prophets, had the 
 honour of Enoch, the first prophet, to be translated, that he should 
 not see death, and the honour of Moses, the great prophet, to attend 
 our Saviour in his transfiguration. Other prophets prophesied and 
 wrote, he prophesied and acted, but wrote nothing; but his actions cast 
 more lustre on his name than their writings did on theirs. In this 
 chapter we have, 

 I. His prediction of a famine in Israel, through the want of rain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:1">ver. 1</A>.
 
 II. The provision made for him in that famine,

 1.  By the ravens at the brook Cherith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:2-7">ver. 2-7</A>.

 2. When that failed, by the widow at Zarephath, who received him in the 
 name of a prophet and had a prophet's reward; for

 (1.) He multiplied her meal and her oil, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:8-16">ver. 8-16</A>.

 (2.) He raised her dead son to life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:17-24">ver. 17-24</A>.

 Thus his story begins with judgments and miracles, designed to awaken
 that stupid generation that had to deeply corrupted themselves.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Elijah the Tishbite, <I>who was</I> of the inhabitants of
 Gilead, said unto Ahab, <I>As</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel liveth,
 before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years,
 but according to my word.
 &nbsp; 2 And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto him, saying,
 &nbsp; 3 Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by
 the brook Cherith, that <I>is</I> before Jordan.
 &nbsp; 4 And it shall be, <I>that</I> thou shalt drink of the brook; and I
 have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
 &nbsp; 5 So he went and did according unto the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for
 he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that <I>is</I> before Jordan.
 &nbsp; 6 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning,
 and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
 &nbsp; 7 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,
 because there had been no rain in the land.

 The history of Elijah begins somewhat abruptly. Usually, when a prophet 
 enters, we have some account of his parentage, are told whose son he 
 was and of what tribe; but Elijah drops (so to speak) out of the 
 clouds, as if, like Melchisedek, he were without father, without 
 mother, and without descent, which made some of the Jews fancy that he 
 was an angel sent from heaven; but the apostle has assured us that 
 <I>he was a man subject to like passions as we are</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:17">James v. 17</A>),
 
 which perhaps intimates, not only that he was liable to the common
 infirmities of human nature, but that, by his natural temper, he was a 
 man of strong passions, more hot and eager than most men, and therefore 
 the more fit to deal with the daring sinners of the age he lived in: so 
 wonderfully does God suit men to the work he designs them for. Rough 
 spirits are called to rough services. The reformation needed such a man 
 as Luther to break the ice. Observe, 

 1. The prophet's name: <I>Elijahu--"My God Jehovah is he</I>" (so it 
 signifies), "is he who sends me and will own me and bear me out, is he 
 to whom I would bring Israel back and who alone can effect that great 
 work." 

 2. His country: He was <I>of the inhabitants of Gilead,</I> on the 
 other side Jordan, either of the tribe of Gad or the half of Manasseh, 
 for Gilead was divided between them; but whether a native of either of 
 those tribes is uncertain. The obscurity of his parentage was no 
 prejudice to his eminency afterwards. We need not enquire whence men 
 are, but what they are: if it be a good thing, no matter though it come 
 out of Nazareth.  Israel was sorely wounded when God sent them this 
 balm from Gilead and this physician thence. He is called a 
 <I>Tishbite</I> from Thisbe, a town in that country. Two things we have 
 an account of here in the beginning of his story:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he foretold a famine, a long and grievous famine, with which 
 Israel should be punished for their sins. That fruitful land, for want 
 of rain, should be turned into barrenness, for the iniquity of those 
 that dwelt therein. He went and told Ahab this; did not whisper it to 
 the people, to make them disaffected to the government, but proclaimed 
 it to the king, in whose power it was to reform the land, and so to 
 prevent the judgment. It is probable that he reproved Ahab for his 
 idolatry and other wickedness, and told him that unless he repented and 
 reformed this judgment would be brought upon his land. There should be 
 <I>neither dew nor rain for some years,</I> none but <I>according to my 
 word,</I> that is, "Expect none till you hear from me again." The 
 apostle teaches us to understand this, not only of the word of 
 prophecy, but the word of prayer, which turned the key of the clouds, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:17,18">James v. 17, 18</A>.

 He prayed earnestly (in a holy indignation at Israel's apostasy, and a
 holy zeal for the glory of God, whose judgments were defied) <I>that it 
 might not rain;</I> and, according to his prayers, the heavens became 
 as brass, till he <I>prayed again that it might rain.</I> In allusion 
 to this story it is said of God's witnesses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:6">Rev. xi. 6</A>),

 <I>These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of
 their prophecy.</I> Elijah lets Ahab know,

 1. That <I>the Lord Jehovah</I> is the <I>God of Israel,</I> whom he 
 had forsaken. 

 2. That he is a <I>living God,</I> and not like the gods he worshipped, 
 which were dead dumb idols. 

 3. That he himself was God's servant in office, and a messenger sent 
 from him: "It is he <I>before whom I stand,</I> to minister to him," or
 "whom I now represent, in whose stead I stand, and in whose name I
 speak, in defiance of the prophets of Baal and the groves." 

 4. That, notwithstanding the present peace and prosperity of the
 kingdom of Israel, God was displeased with them for their idolatry and 
 would chastise them for it by the want of rain (which, when he withheld 
 it, it was not in the power of the gods they served to bestow; for 
 <I>are there any of the vanities of the heathen that can give rain?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:22">Jer. xiv. 22</A>),

 which would effectually prove their impotency, and the folly of those
 who left the living God, to make their court to such as could do 
 neither good nor evil; and this he confirms with a solemn oath--<I>As 
 the Lord God of Israel liveth,</I> that Ahab might stand the more in 
 awe of the threatening, the divine life being engaged for the 
 accomplishment of it.

 5. He lets Ahab know what interest he had in heaven: It shall be 
 <I>according to my word.</I> With what dignity does he speak when he 
 speaks in God's name, as one who well understood that commission of a 
 prophet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+1:10">Jer. i. 10</A>),

 <I>I have set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms.</I> See the
 power of prayer and the truth of God's word; for he performeth the 
 counsel of his messengers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he was himself taken care of in that famine. 

 1. How he was hidden. God bade him <I>go and hide himself by the brook 
 Cherith,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This was intended, not so much for his preservation, for it does not 
 appear that Ahab immediately sought his life, but as a judgment to the 
 people, to whom, if he had publicly appeared, he might have been a 
 blessing both by his instructions and his intercession, and so have 
 shortened the days of their calamity; but God had determined it should 
 last three years and a half, and therefore, so long, appointed Elijah 
 to abscond, that he might not be solicited to revoke the sentence, the 
 execution of which he had said should be <I>according to his word.</I> 
 When God <I>speaks concerning a nation, to pluck up and destroy,</I> he 
 finds some way or other to remove those that would stand in the gap to 
 turn away his wrath. It bodes ill to a people when good men and good 
 ministers are ordered to hide themselves. When God intended to <I>send 
 rain upon the earth</I> then he bade Elijah go and <I>show himself to 
 Ahab,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:1"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 1</A>.

 For the present, in obedience to the divine command, he went and dwelt
 all alone in some obscure unfrequented place, where he was not 
 discovered, probably among the reeds of the brook. If Providence calls 
 us to solitude and retirement, it becomes us to acquiesce; when we 
 cannot be useful we must be patient, and when we cannot work for God we 
 must sit still quietly for him. 

 2. How he was fed. Though he could not work there, having nothing to do 
 but to meditate and pray (which would help to prepare him for his 
 usefulness afterwards), yet he shall eat, for he is in the way of his 
 duty, and <I>verily he shall be fed, in the day of famine he shall be 
 satisfied.</I> When the woman, the church, is <I>driven into the 
 wilderness,</I> care it taken that she be fed and nourished there, 
 time, times, and half a time, that is, three years and a half, which 
 was just the time of Elijah's concealment. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:6,14">Rev. xii. 6, 14</A>.

 Elijah must drink of the brook, and the ravens were appointed to
 <I>bring him meat</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)
 
 and did so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Here,

 (1.) The provision was plentiful, and good, and constant, bread and 
 flesh twice a day, daily bread and food convenient. We may suppose that 
 he fared not so sumptuously as the prophets of the groves, who <I>did 
 eat at Jezebel's table</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:19"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 19</A>),

 and yet better than the rest of the Lord's prophets, whom Obadiah fed
 with bread and water, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:4"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 4</A>.

 It ill becomes God's servants, especially his servants the prophets, to
 be nice and curious about their food and to affect dainties and 
 varieties; if nature be sustained, no matter though the palate be not 
 pleased; instead of envying those who have daintier fare, we should 
 think how many there are, better than we, who live comfortably upon 
 coarser fare and would be glad of our leavings. Elijah had but one meal 
 brought him at a time, every morning and every evening, to teach him 
 not to take thought for the morrow. Let those who have but from hand to 
 mouth learn to live upon Providence, and trust it for <I>the bread of 
 the day in the day;</I> thank God for bread this day, and let to-morrow 
 bring bread with it. 

 (2.) The caterers were very unlikely; the <I>ravens</I> brought it to 
 him. Obadiah, and others in Israel that had not bowed the knee to Baal, 
 would gladly have entertained Elijah; but he was a man by himself, and 
 must be red in an extraordinary way. He was a figure of John the 
 baptist, whose meat was locusts and wild honey. God could have sent 
 angels to minister to him, as he did afterwards

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:5"><I>ch.</I> xix. 5</A>)

 and as he did to our Saviour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:11">Matt. iv. 11</A>),

 but he chose to send by winged messengers of another nature, to show
 that when he pleases he can serve his own purposes by the meanest 
 creatures as effectually as by the mightiest. If it be asked whence the 
 ravens had this provision, how and where it was cooked, and whether 
 they came honestly by it, we must answer, as Jacob did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:20">Gen. xxvii. 20</A>),
 
 <I>The Lord our God brought it to them,</I> whose the earth is and the
 fulness thereof, the world and those that dwell therein. But why 
 ravens? 

 [1.] They are birds of prey, ravenous devouring creatures, more likely 
 to have taken his meat from him, or to have picked out his eyes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:17">Prov. xxx. 17</A>);

 but thus Samson's riddle is again unriddled, <I>Out of the eater comes
 forth meat.</I>

 [2.] They are unclean creatures.<I>Every raven after his kind</I> was, 
 by the law, forbidden to be eaten 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+11:15">Lev. xi. 15</A>),

 yet Elijah did not think the meat they brought ever the worse for that,
 but ate and gave thanks, asking no question for conscience' sake. 
 Noah's dove was to him a more faithful messenger than his raven; yet 
 here the ravens are faithful and constant to Elijah.

 [3.] Ravens feed on insects and carrion themselves, yet they brought 
 the prophet man's meat and wholesome food. It is a pity that those who 
 bring the bread of life to others should themselves take up with 
 <I>that which is not bread.</I>

 [4.] Ravens could bring but a little, and broken meat, yet Elijah was 
 content with such things as he had, and thankful that the was fed, 
 though not feasted.

 [5.] Ravens neglect their own young ones, and do not feed them; yet 
 when God pleases they shall feed his prophet. Young lions and young 
 ravens may lack, and suffer hunger, but not those that fear the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:10">Ps. xxxiv. 10</A>.

 [6.] Ravens are themselves fed by special providence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:41,Ps+147:9">Job xxxviii. 41; Ps. cxlvii. 9</A>),

 and now they fed the prophet. Have we experienced God's special
 goodness to us and ours? Let us reckon ourselves obliged thereby to be 
 kind to those that are his, for his sake. Let us learn hence, 
 <I>First,</I> To acknowledge the sovereignty and power of God over all 
 the creatures; he can make what use he pleases of them, either for 
 judgment or mercy. <I>Secondly,</I> To encourage ourselves in God in 
 the greatest straits, and never to distrust him. He that could furnish 
 a table in the wilderness, and make ravens purveyors, cooks, and 
 servitors to his prophet, is able to supply all our need according to 
 his riches in glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus does Elijah, for a great while, <I>eat his morsels alone,</I> and 
 his provision of water, which he has in an ordinary way from the brook, 
 fails him before that which he has by miracle. The powers of nature are 
 limited, but not the powers of the God of nature. Elijah's brook dried 
 up 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 <I>because there was no rain.</I> If the heavens fail, earth fails of
 course; such are all our creature-comforts; we lose them when we most 
 need them, like the brooks in summer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:15">Job vi. 15</A>.

 But there is <I>a river which makes glad the city of God</I> and which
 never runs dry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:4">Ps. xlvi. 4</A>),

 <I>a well of water that springs up to eternal life.</I> Lord, give us
 that living water!</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8 And the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came unto him, saying,
 &nbsp; 9 Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which <I>belongeth</I> to Zidon, and
 dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to
 sustain thee.
 &nbsp; 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the
 gate of the city, behold, the widow woman <I>was</I> there gathering
 of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee,
 a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
 &nbsp; 11 And as she was going to fetch <I>it,</I> he called to her, and
 said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.
 &nbsp; 12 And she said, <I>As</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God liveth, I have not a
 cake, but a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a
 cruse: and, behold, I <I>am</I> gathering two sticks, that I may go in
 and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
 &nbsp; 13 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go <I>and</I> do as thou hast
 said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring <I>it</I>
 unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.
 &nbsp; 14 For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, The barrel of meal
 shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the
 day <I>that</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sendeth rain upon the earth.
 &nbsp; 15 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and
 she, and he, and her house, did eat <I>many</I> days.
 &nbsp; 16 <I>And</I> the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse
 of oil fail, according to the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which he spake by
 Elijah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the further protection Elijah was taken 
 under, and the further provision made for him in his retirement. <I>At 
 destruction and famine he shall laugh</I> that has God for his friend 
 to guard and maintain him. The brook Cherith is dried up, but God's 
 care of his people, and kindness to them, never slacken, never fail, 
 but are still the same, are still continued and drawn out to those that 
 know him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:10">Ps. xxxvi. 10</A>.

 When the brook was dried up Jordan was not; why did not God send him
 thither? Surely because he would show that he has a variety of ways to 
 provide for his people and is not tied to any one.  God will now 
 provide for him where he shall have some company and opportunity of 
 usefulness, and not be, as he had been, buried alive.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The place he is sent to, to <I>Zarephath,</I> or <I>Sarepta,</I> a 
 city of Sidon, out of the borders of the land of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Our Saviour takes notice of this as an early and ancient indication of
 the favour of God designed for the poor Gentiles, in the fulness of 
 time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:25,26">Luke iv. 25, 26</A>.

 <I>Many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias,</I> and some, it is
 likely, that would have bidden him welcome to their houses; yet he is 
 sent to honour and bless with his presence a city of Sidon, a Gentile 
 city, and so becomes (says Dr. Lightfoot) <I>the first prophet of the 
 Gentiles.</I> Israel had corrupted themselves with the idolatries of 
 the nations and become worse than they; justly therefore is <I>the 
 casting off of them the riches of the world.</I> Elijah was hated and 
 driven out by his countrymen; therefore, lo, he turns to the Gentiles, 
 as the apostles were afterwards ordered to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+18:6">Acts xviii. 6</A>.

 But why to a city of Sidon? Perhaps because the worship of Baal, which
 was now the crying sin of Israel, came lately thence with Jezebel, who 
 was a Sidonian

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:31"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 31</A>);

 therefore thither he shall go, that thence may be fetched the destroyer
 of that idolatry, "Even out of Sidon have I called my prophet, my 
 reformer." Jezebel was Elijah's greatest enemy; yet, to show her the 
 impotency of her malice, God will find a hiding-place for him even in 
 her country. Christ never went among the Gentiles except once <I>into 
 the coast of Sidon,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:21">Matt. xv. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The person that is appointed to entertain him, not one of the rich 
 merchants or great men, of Sidon, not such a one as Obadiah, that was 
 governor of Ahab's house and fed the prophets; but a poor widow woman, 
 destitute and desolate, is commanded (that is, is made both able and 
 willing) to sustain him. It is God's way, and it is his glory, to make 
 use of the <I>weak and foolish things of the world</I> and put honour 
 upon them. He is, in a special manner, the widows' God, and feeds them, 
 and therefore they must study what they shall render to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The provision made for him there. Providence brought the widow 
 woman to meet him very opportunely at the gate of the city 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 and, by what is here related of what passed between Elijah and her, we
 find,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Her case and character; and it appears, 

 (1.) That she was very poor and necessitous. She had nothing to live 
 upon but a handful of meal and a little oil, needy at the best, and 
 now, by the general scarcity, reduced to the last extremity. When she 
 has eaten the little she has, for aught she yet sees, she must die for 
 want, she and her son, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 She had no fuel but the sticks she gathered in the streets, and, having
 no servant, she must gather them herself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 being thus more in a condition to receive alms than give entertainment.
 To her Elijah was sent, that he might still live upon Providence as 
 much as he did when the ravens fed him. It was in compassion to the low 
 estate of his handmaiden that God sent the prophet to her, not to beg 
 of her, but to board with her, and he would pay well for his table.

 (2.) That she was very humble and industrious.  He found her gathering 
 sticks, and preparing to bake her own bread, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:10,12"><I>v.</I> 10, 12</A>.

 Her mind was brought to her condition, and she complained not of the
 hardship she was brought to, nor quarrelled with the divine Providence 
 for withholding rain, but accommodated herself to it as well as she 
 could.  Such as are of this temper in a day of trouble are best 
 prepared for honour and relief from God.

 (3.) That she was very charitable and generous. When this stranger 
 desired her to go and fetch him some water to drink, she readily went, 
 at the first word, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 She objected not to the present scarcity of it, nor asked him what he 
 would give her for a draught of water (for now it was worth money), nor 
 hinted that he was a stranger, an Israelite, with whom perhaps the 
 Sidonians cared not for having any dealings, any more than the 
 Samaritans,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:9">John iv. 9</A>.

 She did not excuse herself on account of her weakness through famine,
 or the urgency of her own affairs, did not tell him she had something 
 else to do than to go on his errands, but left off gathering the sticks 
 for herself to fetch water for him, which perhaps she did the more 
 willingly, being moved with the gravity of his aspect. We should be 
 ready to do any office of kindness even to strangers; if we have not 
 wherewith to give to the distressed, we must be the more ready to work 
 for them. A cup of cold water, though it cost us no more than the 
 labour of fetching, shall in no wise lose its reward. 

 (4.) That she had a great confidence in the word of God. It was a great
 trial for her faith and obedience when, having gold the prophet how low 
 her stock of meal and oil was and that she had but just enough for 
 herself and her son, he bade her <I>make a cake for him,</I> and make 
 <I>his</I> first, and then <I>prepare for herself and her son.</I> If 
 we consider, it will appear as great a trial as could be in so small a 
 matter. "Let the children first be served" (might she have said); 
 "charity begins at home. I cannot be expected to give, having but 
 little, and not knowing, when that is gone, where to obtain more." She 
 had much more reason than Nabal to ask, "Shall I take my meat and my 
 oil and <I>give it to one that I know not whence he is?</I>" Elijah, it 
 is true, made mention of <I>the God of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 but what was that to a Sidonian? Or if she had a veneration for the
 name <I>Jehovah,</I> and valued the God of Israel as the true God, yet 
 what assurance had she that this stranger was his prophet or had any 
 warrant to speak in his name? It was easy for a hungry vagrant to 
 impose upon her. But she gets over all these objections, and obeys the 
 precept in dependence upon the promise: She <I>went and did according 
 to the saying of Elijah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 <I>O woman! great was thy faith;</I> one has not found the like, <I>no,
 not in Israel:</I> all things considered, it exceeded that of the widow 
 who, when she had but two mites, cast them into the treasury. She took 
 the prophet's word, that she should not lose by it, but it should be 
 repaid with interest.  Those that can venture upon the promise of God 
 will make no difficulty of exposing and emptying themselves in his 
 service, by giving him his dues out of a little and giving him his part 
 first. Those that deal with God must deal upon trust; seek first his 
 kingdom, and then other things shall be added. By the law, the 
 first-fruits were God's, the tithe was taken out first, and the 
 heave-offering of their dough was first offered,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+15:20,21">Num. xv. 20, 21</A>.

 But surely the increase of this widow's faith, to such a degree as to 
 enable her thus to deny herself and to depend upon the divine promise, 
 was as great a miracle in the kingdom of grace as the increase of her 
 oil was in the kingdom of providence. Happy are those who can thus, 
 against hope, believe and obey in hope.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The care God took of her guest: <I>The barrel of meal wasted not, 
 nor did the cruse of oil fail,</I> but still as they took from them 
 more was added to them by the divine power, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Never did corn or olive so increase in the growing (says bishop Hall)
 as these did in the using; but the <I>multiplying of the seed sown</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:10">2 Cor. ix. 10</A>)

 in the common course of providence is an instance of the power and
 goodness of God not to be overlooked because common. The meal and the 
 oil multiplied, not in the hoarding, but in the spending; for <I>there 
 is that scattereth and yet increaseth.</I> When God blesses a little, 
 it will go a great way, even beyond expectation; as, on the contrary, 
 though there be abundance, if he blow upon it, it comes to little, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:9,2:16">Hag. i. 9; ii. 16</A>.

 (1.) This was a maintenance for the prophet. Still miracles shall be 
 his daily bread. Hitherto he had been fed with bread and flesh, now he 
 was fed with bread and oil, which they used as we do butter. Manna was 
 both, for the <I>taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:8">Num. xi. 8</A>.

 This Elijah was thankful for, though he had been used to flesh twice a
 day and now had none at all. Those that cannot live without flesh, once 
 a day at least, because they have been used to it, could not have 
 boarded contentedly with Elijah, no, not to live upon a miracle.

 (2.) It was a maintenance for <I>the poor widow and her son,</I> and a 
 recompence to her for entertaining the prophet.  There is nothing lost 
 by being kind to God's people and ministers; she that received a 
 prophet had a prophet's reward; she gave him house-room, and he repaid 
 her with food for her household. Christ has promised to those who open 
 their doors to him that he will come in to them, and <I>sup with 
 them,</I> and <I>they with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:20">Rev. iii. 20</A>.

 Like Elijah here, he brings to those who bid him welcome, not only his
 own entertainment, but theirs too. See how the reward answered the 
 service. She generously made one cake for the prophet, and was repaid 
 with many for herself and her son. When Abraham offers his only son to 
 God he is told he shall be the father of multitudes. What is laid out 
 in piety or charity is let out to the best interest, upon the best 
 securities. One poor meal's meat this poor widow gave the prophet, and, 
 in recompence of it, <I>she and her son did eat many days</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 above two years, in a time of general scarcity; and to have their food
 from God's special favour, and to eat it in such good company as 
 Elijah's, made it more than doubly sweet. It is promised to those that 
 trust in God that they <I>shall not be ashamed in the evil time, but in 
 the days of famine they shall be satisfied,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 And it came to pass after these things, <I>that</I> the son of
 the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness
 was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
 &nbsp; 18 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O
 thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to
 remembrance, and to slay my son?
 &nbsp; 19 And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out
 of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and
 laid him upon his own bed.
 &nbsp; 20 And he cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and said, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God, hast
 thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by
 slaying her son?
 &nbsp; 21 And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and
 cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and said, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God, I pray thee, let
 this child's soul come into him again.
 &nbsp; 22 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the
 child came into him again, and he revived.
 &nbsp; 23 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the
 chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and
 Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.
 &nbsp; 24 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou
 <I>art</I> a man of God, <I>and</I> that the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in thy mouth
 <I>is</I> truth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further recompence made to the widow for her kindness to 
 the prophet; as if it were a small thing to be kept alive, her son, 
 when dead, is restored to life, and so restored to her. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sickness and death of the child. For aught that appears he was 
 her only son, the comfort of her widowed estate. He was fed 
 miraculously, and yet that did not secure him from sickness and death. 
 <I>Your fathers did eat manna, and are dead,</I> but <I>there is bread 
 of which a man may eat and not die,</I> which was given for the life of 
 the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:49,50">John vi. 49, 50</A>.

 The affliction was to this widow as a thorn in the flesh, lest she
 should be lifted up above measure with the favours that were done her 
 and the honours that were put upon her. 

 1. She was nurse to a great prophet, was employed to sustain him, and 
 had strong reason to think the Lord would do her good; yet now she 
 loses her child. Note, We must not think it strange if we meet with 
 very sharp afflictions, even when we are in the way of duty, and of 
 eminent service to God. 

 2. She was herself nursed by miracle, and kept a good house without 
 charge or care, by a distinguishing blessing from heaven; and in the 
 midst of all this satisfaction she was thus afflicted. Note, When we 
 have the clearest manifestations of God's favour and good-will towards 
 us, even then we must prepare for the rebukes of Providence. Our 
 mountain never stands so strong but it may be moved, and therefore, in 
 this world, we must always rejoice with trembling.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Her pathetic complaint to the prophet of this affliction. It should 
 seem, the child died suddenly, else she would have applied to Elijah, 
 while he was sick, for the cure of him; but being dead, dead in her 
 bosom, she expostulates with the prophet upon it, rather to give vent 
 to her sorrow than in any hope of relief, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 1. She expresses herself passionately: <I>What have I to do with thee, 
 O thou man of God?</I> How calmly had she spoken of her own and her 
 child's death when she expected to die for want 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 --<I>that we may eat, and die!</I> Yet now that her child dies, and not
 so miserably as by famine, she is extremely disturbed at it. We may 
 speak lightly of an affliction at a distance, but when it <I>toucheth 
 us we are troubled,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:5">Job iv. 5</A>.

 Then she spoke deliberately, now in haste; the death of her child was
 now a surprise to her, and it is hard to keep our spirits composed when 
 troubles come upon us suddenly and unexpectedly, and in the midst of 
 our peace and prosperity. She calls him <I>a man of God,</I> and yet 
 quarrels with him as if he had occasioned the death of her child, and 
 is ready to which she had never seen him, forgetting past mercies and 
 miracles: "What have I done against thee?" (so some understand it), 
 "Wherein have I offended thee, or been wanting in my duty? <I>Show me 
 wherefore thou contendest with me.</I>"

 2. Yet she expresses herself penitently: "<I>Hast thou come to call my 
 sin to</I> thy <I>remembrance,</I> as the cause of the affliction, and 
 so to call it to <I>my</I> remembrance, as the effect of the 
 affliction?" Perhaps she knew of Elijah's intercession against Israel, 
 and, being conscious to herself of sin, perhaps her former worshipping 
 of Baal the god of the Sidonians, she apprehends he had made 
 intercession against her. Note,

 (1.) When God removes our comforts from use he remembers our sins 
 against us, perhaps the iniquities of our youth, though long since 
 past, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:26">Job xiii. 26</A>.
 
 Our sins are the death of our children.

 (2.) When God thus remembers our sins against us he designs thereby to 
 make us remember them against ourselves and repent of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The prophet's address to God upon this occasion. He gave no answer 
 to her expostulation, but brought it to God, and laid the case before 
 him, not knowing what to say to it himself. He took the dead child from 
 the mother's bosom to his own bed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Probably he had taken a particular kindness to the child, and found the
 affliction his own more than by sympathy. He retired to his chamber, 
 and,

 1. He humbly reasons with God concerning the death of the child, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 He sees death striking by commission from God: <I>Thou hast brought
 this evil</I> for is there any evil of this kind in the city, in the 
 family, and the Lord has not done it? He pleads the greatness of the 
 affliction to the poor mother: "It is <I>evil upon the widow;</I> thou 
 art the widow's God, and dost not usually bring evil upon widows; it is 
 affliction added to the afflicted." He pleads his own concern: "It is 
 the widow <I>with whom I sojourn;</I> wilt thou, that art my God, bring 
 evil upon one of the best of my benefactors? I shall be reflected upon, 
 and others will be afraid of entertaining me, if I bring death into the 
 house where I come." 

 2. He earnestly begs of God to restore the child to life again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 We do not read before this of any that were raised to life; yet Elijah, 
 by a divine impulse, prays for the resurrection of this child, which 
 yet will not warrant us to do the like. David expected not, by fasting 
 and prayer, to bring his child back to life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:23">2 Sam. xii. 23</A>),

 but Elijah had a power to work miracles, which David had not. He
 <I>stretched himself upon the child,</I> to affect himself with the 
 case and to show how much he was affected with it and how desirous he 
 was of the restoration of the child--he would if he could put life into 
 him by his own breath and warmth; also to give a sign of what God would 
 do by his power, and what he does by his grace, in raising dead souls 
 to a spiritual life; the Holy Ghost comes upon them, overshadows them, 
 and puts life into them. He is very particular in his prayer: <I>I pray 
 thee let this child's soul come into him again,</I> which plainly 
 supposes the existence of the soul in a state of separation from the 
 body, and consequently its immortality, which Grotius thinks God 
 designed by this miracle to give intimation and evidence of, for the 
 encouragement of his suffering people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The resurrection of the child, and the great satisfaction it gave 
 to the mother: the child revived, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 See the power of prayer and the power of him that hears prayer, who
 <I>kills and makes alive.</I> Elijah brought him to his mother, who, we 
 may suppose, could scarcely believe her own eyes, and therefore Elijah 
 assures her it is her own: "It is <I>thy son that liveth;</I> see it is 
 thy own, and not another," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 The good woman hereupon cries out, <I>Now I know that thou art a man of 
 God;</I> though she knew it before, by the increase of her meal, yet 
 the death of her child she took so unkindly that she began to question 
 it (a good man surely would not serve her so); but now she was 
 abundantly satisfied that he had both the power and goodness of a man 
 of God, and will never doubt of it again, but give up herself to the 
 direction of his word and the worship of the God of Israel. Thus the 
 death of the child (like that of Lazarus,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:4">John xi. 4</A>)

 was for the glory of God and the honour of his prophet.</P>
