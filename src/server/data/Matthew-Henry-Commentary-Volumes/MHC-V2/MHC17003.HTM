 A very black and mournful scene here opens, and which threatens the 
 ruin of all the people of God. Were there not some such dark nights, 
 the light of the morning would not be so welcome. 

 I. Haman is made the king's favourite, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. Mordecai refuses to give him the honour he demands, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>.

 III. Haman, for his sake, vows to be revenged upon all the Jews, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 IV. He, upon a malicious suggestion, obtains an order from the king to
 have the all massacred upon a certain day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:7-13">ver. 7-13</A>.

 V.  This order is dispersed through the kingdom,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son
 of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat
 above all the princes that <I>were</I> with him.
 &nbsp; 2  And all the king's servants, that <I>were</I> in the king's gate,
 bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded
 concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did <I>him</I> reverence.
 &nbsp; 3  Then the king's servants, which <I>were</I> in the king's gate,
 said unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's
 commandment?
 &nbsp; 4  Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he
 hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether
 Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he
 <I>was</I> a Jew.
 &nbsp; 5  And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him
 reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.
 &nbsp; 6  And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they
 had showed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to
 destroy all the Jews that <I>were</I> throughout the whole kingdom of
 Ahasuerus, <I>even</I> the people of Mordecai.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Haman advanced by the prince, and adored thereupon by the people. 
 Ahasuerus had lately laid Esther in his bosom, but she had no such 
 interest in him as to get her friends preferred, or to prevent the 
 preferring of one who she knew was an enemy to her people. When those 
 that are good become great they still find that they cannot do good, 
 nor prevent mischief, as they would. This Haman was an Agagite (an 
 Amalekite, says Josephus), probably of the descendants of Agag, a 
 common name of the princes of Amalek, as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:7">Num. xxiv. 7</A>.

 Some think that he was by birth a prince, as Jehoiakim was, whose seat
 was set above the rest of the captive kings

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:28">2 Kings xxv. 28</A>),

 as Haman's here was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The king took a fancy to him (princes are not bound to give reasons for
 their favours), made him his favourite, his confidant, his 
 prime-minister of state. Such a commanding influence the court then had 
 that (contrary to the proverb) those whom it blessed the country 
 blessed too; for all men adored this rising sun, and the king's 
 servants were particularly commanded <I>to bow before him and to do him 
 reverence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and they did so. I wonder what the king saw in Haman that was
 commendable or meritorious; it is plain that he was not a man of honour 
 or justice, of any true courage or steady conduct, but proud, and 
 passionate, and revengeful; yet was he promoted, and caressed, and 
 there was none so great as he. Princes' darlings are not always 
 worthies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Mordecai adhering to his principles with a bold and daring 
 resolution, and therefore refusing to reverence Haman as the rest of 
 the king's servants did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He was urged to it by his friends, who reminded him of the king's
 commandment, and consequently of the danger he incurred if he refused 
 to comply with it; it was as much as his life was worth, especially 
 considering Haman's insolence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 They <I>spoke daily to him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 to persuade him to conform, but all in vain: he hearkened not to them,
 but told them plainly that he was a Jew, and could not in conscience do 
 it. Doubtless his refusal, when it came to be taken notice of and made 
 the subject of discourse, was commonly attributed to pride and envy, 
 that he would not pay respect to Haman because, on the score of his 
 alliance to Esther, he was not himself as much promoted, or to a 
 factious seditious spirit and a disaffection to the king and his 
 government; those that would make the best of it looked upon it as his 
 weakness, or his want of breeding, called it a humour, and a piece of 
 affected singularity. It does not appear that any one scrupled at 
 conforming to it except Mordecai; and yet his refusal was pious, 
 conscientious, and pleasing to God, for the religion of a Jew forbade 
 him, 

 1. To give such extravagant honours as were required to any mortal man,
 especially so wicked a man as Haman was. In the apocryphal chapters of 
 this book

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+13:12-14"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 12-14</A>)

 Mordecai is brought in thus appealing to God in this matter: <I>Thou
 knowest, Lord, that it was neither in contempt nor pride, nor for any 
 desire of glory, that I did not bow down to proud Haman, for I could 
 have been content with good will, for the salvation of Israel, to kiss 
 the soles of his feet; but I did this that I might not prefer the glory 
 of man above the glory of God, neither will I worship any but thee.</I> 
 
 2. He especially thought it a piece of injustice to his nation to give
 such honour to an Amalekite, one of that devoted nation with which God 
 had sworn that he would have perpetual war 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:16">Exod. xvii. 16</A>)

 and concerning which he had given that solemn charge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:17">Deut. xxv. 17</A>),

 <I>Remember what Amalek did.</I> Though religion does by no means 
 destroy good manners, but teaches us to render <I>honour to whom 
 honour</I> is due, yet it is the character of a citizen of Zion that 
 not only in his heart, but <I>in his eyes,</I> such a <I>vile person as 
 Haman was is contemned,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+15:4">Ps. xv. 4</A>.

 Let those who are governed by principles of conscience be steady and
 resolute, however censured or threatened, as Mordecai was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Haman meditating revenge. Some that hoped thereby to curry favour 
 with Haman took notice to him of Mordecai's rudeness, waiting to see 
 whether he would bend or break, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Haman then observed it himself, and was <I>full of wrath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 A meek and humble man would have slighted the affront, and have said,
 "Let him have his humour; what am I the worse for it?" But it makes 
 Haman's proud spirit rage, and fret, and boil, within him, so that he 
 becomes uneasy to himself and all about him. It is soon resolved that 
 Mordecai must die. The head must come off that will not bow to Haman; 
 if he cannot have his honours, he will have his blood. It is as penal 
 in this court not to worship Haman as it was in Nebuchadnezzar's not to 
 worship the golden image which he had set up. Mordecai is a person of 
 quality, in a post of honour, and own cousin to the queen; and yet 
 Haman thinks his life nothing towards a satisfaction for the affront: 
 thousands of innocent and valuable lives must be sacrificed to his 
 indignation; and therefore he vows the destruction of all the people of 
 Mordecai, for his sake, because his being a Jew was the reason he gave 
 why he did not reverence Haman.  Herein appear Haman's intolerable 
 pride, insatiable cruelty, and the ancient antipathy of an Amalekite to 
 the Israel of God. Saul the son of Kish, a Benjamite, spared Agag, but 
 Mordecai the son of Kish, a Benjamite

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+2:5"><I>ch.</I> ii. 5</A>),

 shall find no mercy with this Agagite, whose design is to <I>destroy
 all the Jews throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 which, I suppose, would include those that had returned to their own
 land, for that was now a province of his kingdom.  <I>Come and let us 
 cut them off from being a nation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:4">Ps. lxxxiii. 4</A>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  In the first month, that <I>is,</I> the month Nisan, in the
 twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that <I>is,</I> the
 lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, <I>to</I>
 the twelfth <I>month,</I> that <I>is,</I> the month Adar.
 &nbsp; 8  And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people
 scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the
 provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws <I>are</I> diverse from all
 people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it <I>is</I> not
 for the king's profit to suffer them.
 &nbsp; 9  If it please the king, let it be written that they may be
 destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the
 hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring
 <I>it</I> into the king's treasuries.
 &nbsp; 10  And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto
 Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.
 &nbsp; 11  And the king said unto Haman, The silver <I>is</I> given to thee,
 the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.
 &nbsp; 12  Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of
 the first month, and there was written according to all that
 Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the
 governors that <I>were</I> over every province, and to the rulers of
 every people of every province according to the writing thereof,
 and <I>to</I> every people after their language; in the name of king
 Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's ring.
 &nbsp; 13  And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's
 provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews,
 both young and old, little children and women, in one day, <I>even</I>
 upon the thirteenth <I>day</I> of the twelfth month, which is the
 month Adar, and <I>to take</I> the spoil of them for a prey.
 &nbsp; 14  The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in
 every province was published unto all people, that they should be
 ready against that day.
 &nbsp; 15  The posts went out, being hastened by the king's
 commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And
 the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was
 perplexed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Haman values himself upon that bold and daring thought, which he 
 fancied well became his great spirit, of destroying all the Jews--an
 undertaking worthy of its author, and which he promised himself would 
 perpetuate his memory. He doubts not but to find desperate and bloody 
 hands enough to cut all their throats if the king will but give him 
 leave. How he obtained leave, and commission to do it, we are here 
 told. He had the king's ear, let him alone to manage him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He makes a false and malicious representation of Jews, and their 
 character, to the king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The enemies of God's people could not give them such bad treatment as
 they do if they did not first give them a bad name. He would have the 
 king believe,

 1. That the Jews were a despicable people, and that it was not for his
 credit to harbour them:"<I>A certain people there is,</I>" without 
 name, as if nobody knew whence they came and what they were; "they are 
 not incorporated, <I>but scattered abroad and dispersed in all the 
 provinces</I> as fugitives and vagabonds on the earth, and inmates in 
 all countries, the burden and scandal of the places where they live." 
 
 2. That they were a dangerous people, and that it was not safe to
 harbour them. "They have laws and usages of their own, and conform not 
 to the statutes of the kingdom and the customs of the country; and 
 therefore they may be looked upon as disaffected to the government and 
 likely to infect others with their singularities, which may end in a 
 rebellion." It is no new thing for the best of men to have such 
 invidious characters as these given of them; if it be no sin to kill 
 them, it is no sin to belie them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He bids high for leave to destroy them all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He knew there were many that hated the Jews, and would willingly fall
 upon them if they might but have a commission: <I>Let it be written</I> 
 therefore <I>that they may be destroyed.</I> Give but orders for a 
 general massacre of all the Jews, and Haman will undertake it shall be 
 easily done. If the king will gratify him in this matter, he will make 
 him a present of <I>ten thousand talents,</I> which shall be <I>paid 
 into the king's treasuries.</I> This, he thought, would be a powerful 
 inducement to the king to consent, and would obviate the strongest 
 objection against him, which was that the government must needs sustain 
 loss in its revenues by the destruction of so many of its subjects; so 
 great a sum, he hoped, would be equivalent for that. Proud and 
 malicious men will not stick at the expenses of their revenge, nor 
 spare any cost to gratify it. Yet no doubt Haman knew how to re-imburse 
 himself out of the spoil of the Jews, which his janizaries were to 
 seize for him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and so to make them bear the charges of their own ruin; while he
 himself hoped to be not only a saver but a gainer by the bargain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He obtains what he desired, a full commission to do what he would 
 with the Jews, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 The king was so inattentive to business, and so bewitched with Haman,
 that he took no time to examine the truth of his allegations, but was 
 as willing as Haman could wish to believe the worst concerning the 
 Jews, and therefore he gave them up into his hands, as lambs to the 
 lion: <I>The people are thine, do with them as it seemeth good unto 
 thee.</I> He does not say, "Kill them, slay them" (hoping Haman's own 
 cooler thoughts would abate the rigour of that sentence and induce him 
 to sell them for slaves); but "Do what thou wilt with them." And so 
 little did he consider how much he should lose in his tribute, and how 
 much Haman would gain in the spoil, that he gave him withal the ten 
 thousand talents: <I>The silver is thine.</I> Such an implicit 
 confidence likewise he had in Haman, and so perfectly had he abandoned 
 all care of his kingdom, that he gave Haman his ring, his privy-seal, 
 or sign-manual, wherewith to confirm whatever edict he pleased to draw 
 up for this purpose. Miserable is the kingdom that is at the disposal 
 of such a head as this, which has one ear only, and a nose to be led 
 by, but neither eyes nor brains, nor scarcely a tongue of its own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He then consults with his soothsayers to find out a lucky day for 
 the designed massacre, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The resolve was taken up in the first month, in the twelfth year of the
 king, when Esther had been his wife about five years. Some day or other 
 in that year must be pitched upon; and, as if he doubted not but that 
 Heaven would favour his design and further it, he refers it to <I>the 
 lot,</I> that is, to the divine Providence, to choose the day for him; 
 but that, in the decision, proved a better friend to the Jews than to 
 him, for the lot fell upon <I>the twelfth month,</I> so that Mordecai 
 and Esther had eleven months to turn themselves in for the defeating of 
 the design, or, if they could not defeat it, space would be left for 
 the Jews to make their escape and shift for their safety. Haman, though 
 eager to have the Jews cut off, yet will submit to the laws of his 
 superstition, and not anticipate the supposed fortunate day, no, not to 
 gratify his impatient revenge. Probably he was in some fear lest the 
 Jews should prove too hard for their enemies, and therefore durst not 
 venture on such a hazardous enterprise but under the smiles of a good 
 omen. This may shame us, who often acquiesce not in the directions and 
 disposals of Providence when they cross our desires and intentions. He 
 that believeth the lot, much more that believeth the promise, will not 
 make haste. But see how God's wisdom serves its own purposes by men's 
 folly.  Haman has appealed to the lot, and to the lot he shall go, 
 which, by adjourning the execution, gives judgment against him and 
 breaks the neck of the plot.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The bloody edict is hereupon drawn up, signed, and published, giving 
 orders to the militia of every province to be ready against <I>the 
 thirteenth day of the twelfth month,</I> and, on that day, to murder 
 all the Jews, men, women, and children, and seize their effects, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>.

 Had the decree been to banish all the Jews and expel them out of the
 king's dominions, it would have been severe enough; but surely never 
 any act of cruelty appeared so barefaced as this, to <I>destroy, to 
 kill, and to cause to perish, all the Jews,</I> appointing them <I>as 
 sheep for the slaughter</I> without showing any cause for so doing. No 
 crime is laid to their charge; it is not pretended that they were 
 obnoxious to the public justice, nor is any condition offered, upon 
 performance of which they might have their lives spared; but die they 
 must, without mercy. Thus have the church's enemies thirsted after 
 blood, the <I>blood of the saints and the martyrs of</I> Jesus, and 
 drunk of it till they have been perfectly intoxicated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:6">Rev. xvii. 6</A>);

 yet still, like <I>the horse-leech,</I> they cry, <I>Give, give.</I>
 This cruel offer is ratified with the king's seal, directed to the 
 king's lieutenants, and drawn up in the king's name, and yet the king 
 knows not what he does. Posts are sent out, with all expedition, to 
 carry copies of the decree to the respective provinces, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 See how restless the malice of the church's enemies is: it will spare
 no pains; it will lose no time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The different temper of the court and city hereupon. 

 1. The court was very merry upon it: <I>The king and Haman sat down to
 drink,</I> perhaps to drink "Confusion to all the Jews." Haman was 
 afraid lest the king's conscience should smite him for what he had done 
 and he should begin to wish it undone again, to prevent which he 
 engrossed him to himself, and kept him drinking. This cursed method 
 many take to drown their convictions, and harden their own hearts and 
 the hearts of others in sin. 

 2. The city was very sad upon it (and the other cities of the kingdom,
 no doubt, when they had notice of it): <I>The city Shushan was 
 perplexed,</I> not only the Jews themselves, but all their neighbours 
 that had any principles of justice and compassion. It grieved them to 
 see their king so abused, to see <I>wickedness in the place of 
 judgment</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16">Eccl. iii. 16</A>),

 to see men that lived peaceably treated so barbarously; and what would
 be the consequences of it to themselves they knew not. But the king and 
 Haman cared for none of these things.  Note, It is an absurd and 
 impious thing to indulge ourselves in mirth and pleasure when the 
 church is in distress and the public are perplexed.</P>
