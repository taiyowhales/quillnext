 Israel have now got over Jordan, and the waters which had opened before 
 them, to favour their march forward, are closed again behind them, to 
 forbid their retreat backward. They have now got footing in Canaan, and 
 must apply themselves to the conquest of it, in order to which this 
 chapter tells us, 
 
 I. How their enemies were dispirited,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. What was done at their first landing to assist and encourage them.

 1. The covenant of circumcision was renewed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:2-9">ver. 2-9</A>.

 2. The feast of the passover was celebrated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:10">ver. 10</A>.

 3. Their camp was victualled with the corn of the land, whereupon the
 manna ceased,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:11,12">ver.  11, 12</A>.

 4. The captain of the Lord's host himself appeared to Joshua to animate
 and direct him,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites,
 which <I>were</I> on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of
 the Canaanites, which <I>were</I> by the sea, heard that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had
 dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel,
 until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was
 there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 2 At that time the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp
 knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second
 time.
 &nbsp; 3 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the
 children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
 &nbsp; 4 And this <I>is</I> the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the
 people that came out of Egypt, <I>that were</I> males, <I>even</I> all the
 men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came
 out of Egypt.
 &nbsp; 5 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all
 the people <I>that were</I> born in the wilderness by the way as they
 came forth out of Egypt, <I>them</I> they had not circumcised.
 &nbsp; 6 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the
 wilderness, till all the people <I>that were</I> men of war, which
 came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the
 voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: unto whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sware that he would not
 shew them the land, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> sware unto their fathers that
 he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
 &nbsp; 7 And their children, <I>whom</I> he raised up in their stead, them
 Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had
 not circumcised them by the way.
 &nbsp; 8 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the
 people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they
 were whole.
 &nbsp; 9 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away
 the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the
 place is called Gilgal unto this day.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A vast show, no doubt, the numerous camp of Israel made in the plains 
 of Jericho, where now they had pitched their tents. <I>Who can count 
 the dust of Jacob?</I> That which had long been the <I>church in the 
 wilderness has now come up from the wilderness, leaning upon her 
 beloved, and looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the 
 sun, and terrible as an army with banners.</I> How terrible she was in 
 the eyes of her enemies we are here told, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 How fair and clear she was made in the eyes of her friends, by the
 rolling away of the reproach of Egypt, we are told in the following 
 verses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the fright which the Canaanites were put into by their 
 miraculously passing over Jordan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The news of it was soon dispersed all the country over, not only as a
 prodigy in itself, but as an alarm to all the kings and kingdoms of 
 Canaan.  Now, as when Babylon was taken, <I>One post runs to meet 
 another, and one messenger to meet another,</I> to carry the amazing 
 tidings to every corner of their land,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+51:31">Jer. li. 31</A>.

 And here we are told what impressions the tidings made upon the kings
 of this land: <I>Their heart melted</I> like wax before the fire, 
 <I>neither was there spirit in them any more.</I> This intimates that, 
 though the heart of the people generally had fainted before (as Rahab 
 owned,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:9"><I>ch.</I> ii. 9</A>),

 yet the kings had till now kept up their spirits pretty well, had
 promised themselves that, being in possession, their country populous, 
 and their cities fortified, they should be able to make their part good 
 against the invaders; but when they heard not only that they had come 
 over Jordan, and that this defence of their country was broken through, 
 but that they had come over by a miracle, the God of nature manifestly 
 fighting for them, <I>their hearts failed them</I> too, they gave up 
 the cause for gone, and were now at their wits' end.  And, 

 1. They had reason enough to be afraid; Israel itself was a formidable
 body, and much more so when God was its head, a God of almighty power. 
 What can make head against them if Jordan be driven back before them? 
 
 2. God impressed these fears upon them, and dispirited them, as he had
 promised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:27">Exod. xxiii. 27</A>),

 <I>I will send my fear before thee.</I> God can make the wicked to fear
 <I>where no fear is</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:5">Ps. liii. 5</A>),

 much more where there is such cause for fear as was here. He that made
 the soul can, when he pleases, make his sword thus to approach to it 
 and kill it with his terrors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The opportunity which this gave to the Israelites to circumcise 
 those among them that were uncircumcised: <I>At that time</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 when the country about them was in that great consternation, God
 ordered Joshua to circumcise the children of Israel, for at that time 
 it might be done with safety even in an enemy's country; their hearts 
 being melted, their hands were tied, that they could not take this 
 advantage against them as Simeon and Levi did against the Shechemites, 
 to come upon them <I>when they were sore.</I> Joshua could not be sure 
 of this, and therefore, if he had ordered this general circumcision 
 just at this time of his own head, he might justly have been censured 
 as imprudent; for, how good soever the thing was in itself, in the eye 
 of reason it was not seasonable at this time, and might have been of 
 dangerous consequence; but, when God commanded him to do it, he must 
 not <I>consult with flesh and blood;</I> he that bade them to do it 
 would, no doubt, protect them and bear them out in it. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The occasion there was for this general circumcision. 

 (1.) All that came out of Egypt were circumcised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 while they had peace in Egypt doubtless they circumcised their children
 the eighth day according to the law. But after they began to be 
 oppressed, especially when the edict was made for the destruction of 
 their male infants, the administration of this ordinance was 
 interrupted; many of them were uncircumcised, of whom there was a 
 general circumcision, either during the time of the three days' 
 darkness, as Dr. Lightfoot conjectures, or a year after, just before 
 their eating the second passover at Mount Sinai, and in order to that 
 solemnity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:2">Num. ix. 2</A>)

 as many think. And it is with reference to that general circumcision
 that this is called a <I>second,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 But the learned Masius thinks it refers to the general circumcision of
 Abraham's family when that ordinance was first instituted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:23">Gen. xvii. 23</A>.
 
 That first confirmed the promise of the land of Canaan, this second was
 a thankful celebration of the performance of that promise. But,

 (2.) All that were <I>born in the wilderness,</I> namely, after their
 walking in the wilderness, became by the divine sentence a judgment 
 upon them for their disobedience, as is intimated by that repetition of 
 the sentence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 All that were born since that fatal day on which God swore in his wrath
 that none of that generation should <I>enter into his rest</I> were 
 uncircumcised. But what shall we say to this? Had not God enjoined it 
 to Abraham, under a very severe penalty, that every man-child of his 
 seed should be circumcised on the eighth day?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:9-14">Gen. xvii. 9-14</A>.

 Was it not the seal of the everlasting covenant? Was not so great a
 stress laid upon it when they were coming out of Egypt that when, 
 immediately after the first passover, the law concerning that feast was 
 made perpetual, this was one clause of it, that no uncircumcised person 
 should eat of it, but should be deemed as a stranger? and yet, under 
 the government of Moses himself, to have all their children that were 
 born for thirty-eight years together left uncircumcised is 
 unaccountable. So great an omission could not be general but by divine 
 direction. Now,

 [1.] Some think circumcision was omitted because it was needless: it 
 was appointed to be a mark of distinction between the Israelites and 
 other nations, and therefore in the wilderness, where they were so 
 perfectly separated from all and mingled with none, there was no 
 occasion for it. 

 [2.] Others think that they did not look upon the precept of 
 circumcision as obligatory till they came to settle in Canaan; for in 
 the covenant made with them at Mount Sinai nothing was said about 
 circumcision, neither was it of Moses but <I>of the fathers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:22">John vii. 22</A>),

 and with particular reference to the grant of the land of Canaan, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:8">Gen.  xvii. 8</A>.

 [3.] Others think that God favourably dispensed with the observance of 
 this ordinance in consideration of the unsettledness of their state, 
 and their frequent removals while they were in the wilderness. It was 
 requisite that children after they were circumcised should rest for 
 some time while they were sore, and stirring them might be dangerous to 
 them; God therefore would have mercy and not sacrifice.  This reason is 
 generally acquiesced in, but to me it is not satisfactory, for 
 sometimes they staid a year in a place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+9:22">Num. ix. 22</A>),

 if not much longer, and in their removals the little children, though
 sore, might be wrapped so warm, and carried so easy, as to receive no 
 damage, and might certainly be much better accommodated than the 
 mothers in travail or while lying in. Therefore,

 [4.] To me it seems to have been a continued token of God's displeasure 
 against them for their unbelief and murmuring. Circumcision was 
 originally a seal of the promise of the land of Canaan, as we observed 
 before. It was in the believing hope of that good land that the 
 patriarchs circumcised their children; but when God had <I>sworn in his 
 wrath</I> concerning the men of was who came out of Egypt that they 
 should be consumed in the wilderness, and never enter Canaan, nor come 
 within sight of it (as that sentence is here repeated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>,

 reference being made to it), as a further ratification of that
 sentence, and to be a constant memorandum of it to them, all that fell 
 under that sentence, and were to fall by it, were forbidden to 
 circumcise their children, by which they were plainly told that, 
 whatever others might, they should never have the benefit of that 
 promise of which circumcision was the seal. And this was such a 
 significant indication of God's wrath as the breaking of the tables of 
 the covenant was when Israel had broken the covenant by making the 
 golden calf. It is true that there is no express mention of this 
 judicial prohibition in the account of that sentence; but an intimation 
 of it in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:33">Num.  xiv. 33</A>,

 <I>Your children shall bear your whoredoms.</I> It is probable the
 children of Caleb and Joshua were circumcised, for they were excepted 
 out of that sentence, and of Caleb it is particularly said, <I>To him 
 will I give the land, and to his children</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+1:36">Deut. i. 36</A>),

 which was the very promise that circumcision was the seal of: and
 Joshua is here told to circumcise the people, not his own family. 
 Whatever the reason was, it seems that this great ordinance was omitted 
 in Israel for almost forty years together, which is a plain indication 
 that it was not of absolute necessity, nor was to be of perpetual 
 obligation, but should in the fulness of time be abolished, as now it 
 was for so long a time suspended.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The orders given to Joshua for this general circumcision 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 <I>Circumcise again the children of Israel,</I> not the same person,
 but the body of the people. Why was this ordered to be done now? Answ.

 (1.) Because now the promise of which circumcision was instituted to be
 the seal was performed. The seed of Israel was brought safely into the 
 land of Canaan. "Let them therefore hereby own the truth of that 
 promise which their fathers had disbelieved, and could not find in 
 their hearts to trust to." 

 (2.) Because now the threatening of which the suspending of
 circumcision for thirty-eight years was the ratification was fully 
 executed by the expiring of the forty years.  That <I>warfare is 
 accomplished, that iniquity is pardoned</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:2">Isa. xl. 2</A>),

 and therefore now the seal of the covenant is revived again. But why
 was it not done sooner? why not while they were resting some months in 
 the plains of Moab? why not during the thirty days of their mourning 
 for Moses? Why was it not deferred longer, till they had made some 
 progress in the conquest of Canaan, and had gained a settlement there, 
 at least till they had entrenched themselves, and fortified their camp?  
 why must it be done the very next day after they had come over Jordan?  
 Answ. Because divine Wisdom saw that to be the fittest time, just when 
 the forty years were ended, and they had entered Canaan; and the 
 reasons which human wisdom would have offered against it were easily 
 overruled.

 [1.] God would hereby show that the camp of Israel was not governed by 
 the ordinary rules and measures of war, but by immediate direction from 
 God, who by thus exposing them, in the most dangerous moments, 
 magnified his own power in protecting them even then. And this great 
 instance of security, in disabling themselves for action just when they 
 were entering upon action, proclaimed such confidence in the divine 
 care for their safety as would increase their enemies' fears, much more 
 when their scouts informed them not only of the thing itself that was 
 done, but of the meaning of it, that it was a seal of the grant of this 
 land to Israel. 

 [2.] God would hereby animate his people Israel against the 
 difficulties they were now to encounter, by confirming his covenant 
 with them, which gave them unquestionable assurance of victory and 
 success, and the full possession of the land of promise. 

 [3.] God would hereby teach them, and us with them, in all great 
 undertakings to <I>begin with God,</I> to make sure of his favour, by 
 offering ourselves to him <I>a living sacrifice</I> (for that was 
 signified by the blood of circumcision), and then we may expect to 
 prosper in all we do. 

 [4.] The reviving of circumcision, after it had been so long disused, 
 was designed to revive the observance of other institutions, the 
 omission of which had been connived at in the wilderness. This command 
 to circumcise them was to remind them of that which Moses had told them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:8">Deut. xxi. 8</A>),

 that when they should have come <I>over Jordan</I> they must not do as
 they had done <I>in the wilderness,</I> but must come under a stricter 
 discipline. It was said concerning many of the laws God had given them 
 that they must observe them <I>in the land</I> to which they were 
 going, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:1,12:1">Deut. vi. 1; xii. 1</A>.

 [5.] This <I>second</I> circumcision, as it is here called, was typical
 of the spiritual circumcision with which the Israel of God, when they 
 enter into the gospel rest, are circumcised; it is the learned bishop 
 Pierson's observation that this circumcision being performed under the 
 direction of Joshua, Moses' successor, it points to <I>Jesus as the 
 true circumciser,</I> the author of <I>another circumcision</I> than 
 that <I>of the flesh,</I> commanded by the law, even the 
 <I>circumcision of the heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:29">Rom. ii. 29</A>),

 called the <I>circumcision of Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:11">Col. ii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The people's obedience to these orders. Joshua <I>circumcised the 
 children of Israel</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 not himself with his own hands, but he commanded that it should be
 done, and took care that it was done: it might soon be despatched, for 
 it was not necessary that it should be done by a priest or Levite, but 
 any one might be employed to do it. All those that were under twenty 
 years old when the people were numbered at Mount Sinai, and not being 
 numbered with them fell not by the fatal sentence, were circumcised, 
 and by them all the rest might be circumcised in a little time. The 
 people had promised to hearken to Joshua as they had hearkened to Moses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:17"><I>ch.</I> i. 17</A>),

 and here they gave an instance of their dutifulness by submitting to
 this painful institution, and not calling him for the sake of it a 
 bloody governor, as Zipporah because of the circumcision called Moses a 
 bloody husband.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The names given to the place where this was done, to perpetuate the
 memory of it. 

 (1.) It was called <I>the hill of the foreskins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:3"><I>v.</I>  3</A>.

 Probably the foreskins that were cut off were laid on a heap, and
 covered with earth, so that they made a little hillock.

 (2.) It was called <I>Gilgal,</I> from a word which signifies to take 
 away, from that which God said to Joshua

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt.</I> God is
 jealous for the honour of his people, his own honour being so much 
 interested in it; and, whatever reproach they may lie under for a time, 
 first or last it will certainly be rolled away, and every tongue that 
 riseth up against them he will condemn.

 [1.] Their circumcision rolled away the reproach of Egypt.  They were 
 hereby owned to be the free-born children of God, having the seal of 
 the covenant in their flesh, and so the reproach of their bondage in 
 Egypt was removed. They were tainted with the idolatry of Egypt, and 
 that was their reproach; but now that they were circumcised it was to 
 be hoped they would be so entirely devoted to God that the reproach of 
 their affection to Egypt would be rolled away. 

 [2.] Their coming safely to Canaan rolled away the reproach of Egypt, 
 for it silenced that spiteful suggestion of the Egyptians, that <I>for 
 mischief they were brought out, the wilderness had shut them in,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:3">Exod. xiv. 3</A>.

 Their wandering so long in the wilderness confirmed the reproach, but
 now that they had entered Canaan in triumph that reproach was done 
 away.  When God glorifies himself in perfecting the salvation of his 
 people he not only silences the reproach of their enemies, but rolls it 
 upon themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may well imagine that the people of Canaan were astonished, and that 
 when they observed the motions of the enemy they could not but think 
 them very strange. When soldiers take the field they are apt to think 
 themselves excused from religious exercises (they have not time nor 
 thought to attend to them), yet Joshua opens the campaign with one act 
 of devotion after another. What was afterwards said to another Joshua 
 might truly be said to this, <I>Hear now, O Joshua! thou and thy 
 fellows that sit before thee are men wondered at</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+3:8">Zech. iii. 8</A>),

 and yet indeed he took the right method. That is likely to end well
 which begins with God. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A solemn passover kept, at the time appointed by the law, <I>the 
 fourteenth day of the first month,</I> and in the same place where they 
 were circumcised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 While they were wandering in the wilderness they were denied the
 benefit and comfort of this ordinance, as a further token of God's 
 displeasure; but now, in answer to the prayer of Moses upon the passing 
 of that sentence 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:15">Ps. xc. 15</A>,

 God comforted them again, after the time that he had afflicted them,
 and therefore now that joyful ordinance is revived again. Now that they 
 had entered into Canaan it was very seasonable to remember those 
 wondrous works of divine power and goodness by which they were brought 
 out of Egypt. The finishing of mercies should bring to mind the 
 beginning of them; and when it is perfect day we must not forget how 
 welcome the morning-light was when we had long waited for it. The 
 solemn passover followed immediately after the solemn circumcision; 
 thus, when those that received the word were baptized, immediately we 
 find them <I>breaking bread,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:41,42">Acts ii. 41, 42</A>.

 They kept this passover in the plains of Jericho, as it were in
 defiance of the Canaanites that were round about them and enraged 
 against them, and yet could not give them any disturbance. Thus God 
 gave them an early instance of the performance of that promise that 
 when they went up to keep the feasts their land should be taken under 
 the special protection of the divine Providence.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:24">Exod. xxxiv. 24</A>,

 <I>Neither shall any man desire thy land.</I> He now <I>prepared a
 table before them in the presence of their enemies,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:5">Ps. xxiii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Provision made for their camp of the <I>corn of the land,</I> and
 the <I>ceasing of the manna</I> thereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 Manna was a wonderful mercy to them when they needed it. But it was the
 mark of a wilderness state; it was the food of children; and therefore, 
 though it was angel's food, and not to be complained of a light bread, 
 yet it would be more acceptable to them to eat of the <I>corn of the 
 land,</I> and this they are now furnished with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The country people, having retired for safety into Jericho, had left 
 their barns and fields, and all that was in them, which served for the 
 subsistence of this great army. And the supply came very seasonably, 
 for, 

 (1.) After the passover they were to keep <I>the feast of unleavened 
 bread,</I> which they could not do according to the appointment when 
 they had nothing but manna to live upon; and perhaps this was one 
 reason why it was intermitted in the wilderness. But now they found old 
 corn enough in the barns of the Canaanites to supply them plentifully 
 for that occasion; thus <I>the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the 
 just,</I> and little did those who laid it up think <I>whose all these 
 things should be which they had provided.</I>

 (2.) On the morrow after the passover-sabbath they were to <I>wave the 
 sheaf of first-fruits before the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:10,11">Lev. xxiii. 10, 11</A>.

 And this they were particularly ordered to do when they <I>came into
 the land which God would vice them:</I> and they were furnished for 
 this with the <I>fruit of the land that year</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:12">(<I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 which was then growing and beginning to be ripe. Thus they were well
 provided for, both with <I>old and new corn, as good householders.</I> 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:52">Matt. xiii. 52</A>.

 And as soon as ever the fruits of this good land came to their hands
 they had an opportunity of honouring God with them, and employing them 
 in his service according to his appointment. And thus, <I>behold, all 
 things were clean</I> and comfortable <I>to them.</I> Calvin is of 
 opinion that they had kept the passover every year in its season during 
 their wandering in the wilderness, though it is not mentioned, and that 
 God dispensed with their being uncircumcised, as he did, 
 notwithstanding that, admit them to offer other sacrifices. But some
 gather from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:25">Amos v. 25</A>

 that after the sentence passed upon them there were no sacrifices
 offered till they came to Canaan, and consequently no passover was 
 kept. And it is observable that after that sentence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:1-45">Num. 14</A>)

 the law which follows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+15:1-41">Num. xv.</A>)

 concerning sacrifices begins thus: "<I>When you shall have come into
 the land of your habitations</I>" you shall do so and so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Notice is taken of the ceasing of the manna as soon as ever they had 
 eaten the <I>old corn of the land,</I> 

 (1.) To show that it did not come by chance or common providence, as
 snow or hail does, but by the special designation of divine wisdom and 
 goodness; for, as it came just when they needed it, so it continued as 
 long as they had occasion for it and no longer.

 (2.) To teach us not to expect extraordinary supplies when supplies may
 be had in an ordinary way. If God had dealt with Israel according to 
 their deserts, the manna would have ceased when they called it light 
 bread; but as long as they needed it God continued it, though they 
 despised it; and now that they needed it not God withdrew it, though 
 perhaps some of them desired it. He is a wise Father, who knows the 
 necessities of his children, and accommodates his gifts to <I>them,</I> 
 not to their humours. The word and ordinances of God are spiritual 
 manna, with which God nourishes his people in this wilderness, and, 
 though often forfeited, yet they are continued while we are here; but 
 when we come to the heavenly Canaan this manna will cease, for we shall 
 no longer have need of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he
 lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man
 over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua
 went unto him, and said unto him, <I>Art</I> thou for us, or for our
 adversaries?
 &nbsp; 14 And he said, Nay; but <I>as</I> captain of the host of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did
 worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?
 &nbsp; 15 And the captain of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s host said unto Joshua, Loose
 thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest
 <I>is</I> holy. And Joshua did so.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have hitherto found God often speaking to Joshua, but we read not 
 till now of any appearance of God's glory to him; now that his 
 difficulties increased his encouragements were increased in proportion.  
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The time when he was favoured with this vision. It was immediately 
 after he had performed the great solemnities of circumcision and the 
 passover; then God made himself known to him. Note, We may then expect 
 the discoveries of the divine grace when we are found in the way of our 
 duty and are diligent and sincere in our attendance on holy 
 ordinances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The place where he had this vision. It was <I>by Jericho; in 
 Jericho,</I> so the word is; in it by faith and hope, though as yet he 
 had not begun to lay siege to it; in it in thought and expectation; or 
 in the fields of Jericho, hard by the city.  There, it should seem, he 
 was all alone, fearless of danger, because sure of the divine 
 protection. There he was (some think) meditating and praying; and to 
 those who are so employed God often graciously manifests himself. Or 
 perhaps there he was to take a view of the city, to observe its 
 fortifications, and contrive how to attack it; and perhaps he was at a 
 loss within himself how to make his approaches, when God came and 
 directed him. Note, God will <I>help those that help themselves. 
 Vigilantibus non dormientibus succurrit lex--The law succours those who
 watch, not those who sleep.</I> Joshua was in his post as a general, 
 when God came and made himself known as Generalissimo.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The appearance itself. Joshua, as is usual with those that are 
 full of thought and care, was looking downwards, his eyes fixed on the 
 ground, when of a sudden he was surprised with the appearance of a man 
 who stood before him at some little distance, which obliged him to lift 
 up his eyes, and gave a diversion to his musings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He appeared to him as a man, but a considerable man, and one fit to be
 taken notice of. Now,

 1. We have reason to think that this man was the Son of God, the
 eternal Word, who, before he assumed the human nature for a perpetuity, 
 frequently appeared in a human shape. So bishop Patrick thinks, 
 consonant to the judgment of the fathers. Joshua gave him divine 
 honours, and he received them, which a created angel would not have 
 done, and he is called <I>Jehovah,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+6:2"><I>ch.</I> vi. 2</A>.

 2. He here appeared as a soldier, with <I>his sword drawn in his
 hand.</I> To Abraham in his tent he appeared as a traveller; to Joshua 
 in the field as a man of war. Christ will be to his people what their 
 faith expects and desires. Christ had his sword drawn, which served, 
 
 (1.) To justify the war Joshua was engaging in, and to show him that it
 was of God, who gave him commission to kill and slay. If the sovereign 
 draw the sword, this proclaims war, and authorizes the subject to do so 
 too. The sword is then well drawn when Christ <I>draws it, and gives 
 the banner to those that fear him, to be displayed because of the 
 truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:4">Ps.  lx. 4</A>.

 (2.) To encourage him to carry it on with vigour; for Christ's sword
 drawn in his hand denotes how ready he is for the defence and salvation 
 of his people, who through him shall do valiantly. His sword turns 
 every way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The bold question with which Joshua accosted him; he did not send a 
 servant, but stepped up to him himself, and asked, <I>Art thou for us 
 or for our adversaries?</I> which intimates his readiness to entertain 
 him if he were for them, and to fight him if he were against them. This 
 shows, 

 1. His great courage and resolution. He was not ruffled by the
 suddenness of the appearance, nor daunted with the majesty and bravery 
 which no doubt appeared in the countenance of the person he saw; but, 
 with a presence of mind that became so great a general, put this fair 
 question to him. God had bidden Joshua be courageous, and by this it 
 appears that he was so; for what God by his word requires of his people 
 he does by his grace work in them. 

 2. His great concern for the people and their cause; so heartily has he
 embarked in the interests of Israel that none shall stand by him with 
 the face of a man but he will know whether he be a friend or a foe. It 
 should seem, he suspected him for an enemy, a Goliath that had come to 
 <I>defy the armies of the living God,</I> and to give him a challenge. 
 Thus apt are we to look upon that as against us which is most for us. 
 The question plainly implies that the cause between the Israelites and 
 the Canaanites, between Christ and Beelzebub, will not admit of a 
 neutrality. <I>He that is not with us is against us.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The account he gave of himself,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 "Nay, not for your adversaries, you may be sure, but <I>as captain of
 the host of the Lord have I now come,</I> not only for you as a friend, 
 but over you as commander in chief." Here were now, as of old

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:2">Gen.  xxxii. 2</A>),
 
 <I>Mahanaim, two hosts,</I> a host of Israelites ready to engage the
 Canaanites and a host of angels to protect them therein, and he, as 
 captain of both, conducts the host of Israel and commands the host of 
 angels to their assistance. Perhaps in allusion to this Christ is 
 called the <I>captain of our salvation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:10">Heb. ii. 10</A>),

 <I>and a leader and commander to the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:4">Isa. lv. 4</A>.

 Those cannot but be victorious that have such a captain. He now came as
 captain to review the troops, to animate them, and to give the 
 necessary orders for the besieging of Jericho.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The great respect Joshua paid him when he understood who he was; it 
 is probable that he perceived, not only by what he said but by some 
 other sensible indications, that he was a divine person, and not a man. 
 
 
 1. Joshua paid homage to him: He <I>fell on his face to the earth and
 did worship.</I> Joshua was himself general of the forces of Israel, 
 and yet he was far from looking with jealousy upon this stranger, who 
 produced a commission as captain of the Lord's host above him; he did 
 not offer to dispute his claims, but cheerfully submitted to him as his 
 commander. It will become the greatest of men to be humble and reverent 
 in their addresses to God. 

 2. He begged to receive commands and directions from him: <I>What saith
 my Lord unto his servant?</I> His former question was not more bold and 
 soldier-like than this was pious and saint-like; nor was it any 
 disparagement to the greatness of Joshua's spirit thus to humble 
 himself when he had to do with God: even crowned heads cannot bow to 
 low before the throne of the Lord Jesus, who is <I>King of kings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:10,11,72:10,11,Re+19:16">Ps. ii. 10, 11; lxxii. 10, 11; 
 Rev. xix. 16</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) The relation he owns between himself and Christ, that Christ was
 his Lord and himself his servant and under his command, Christ his 
 Captain and himself a soldier under him, to do as he is bidden,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:9">Matt. viii. 9</A>.

 Note, The foundation of all acceptable obedience is laid in a sincere 
 dedication of ourselves, as servants to Jesus Christ as <I>our 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:2">Ps. xvi. 2</A>.

 (2.) The enquiry he makes pursuant to this relation: <I>What saith my
 Lord?</I> which implies an earnest desire to know the will of Christ, 
 and a cheerful readiness and resolution to do it. Joshua owns himself 
 an inferior officer, and stands to receive orders. This temper of mind 
 shows him fit for the post he was in; for those know best how to 
 command that know how to obey.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The further expressions of reverence which this divine captain 
 required from Joshua 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Loose thy shoe from off thy foot,</I> in token of reverence and
 respect (which with us are signified by uncovering the head), and as an
 acknowledgment of a divine presence, which, while it continued there,
 did in a manner sanctify the place and dignify it. We are accustomed to
 say of a person for whom we have a great affection that we love the
 very ground he treads upon; thus Joshua must show his reverence for
 this divine person, he must not tread the ground he stood on with his
 dirty shoes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:1">Eccl. v. 1</A>.

 Outward expressions of inward reverence, and a religious awe of God,
 well become us, and are required of us, whenever we approach to him in
 solemn ordinances. Bishop Patrick well observes here that the very same
 orders that God gave to Moses at the bush, when he was sending him to
 bring Israel out of Egypt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:5">Exod. iii. 5</A>),

 he here gives to Joshua, for the confirming of his faith in the promise 
 he had lately given him, that as he had been with Moses so he would be 
 with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 5</A>.

 Had Moses such a presence of God with him as, when it became sensible,
 sanctified the ground? So had Joshua.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 And (<I>lastly</I>) Hereby he prepares him to receive the instructions 
 he was about to give him concerning the siege of Jericho, which this
 captain of the Lord's host had now come to give Israel possession 
 of.</P>
