 This chapter gives us the history of the reign of Joash, which does not 
 answer to that glorious beginning of it which we had an account of in 
 the foregoing chapter; he was not so illustrious at forty years old as 
 he was at seven, yet his reign is to be reckoned one of the better 
 sort, and appears much worse in Chronicles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:1-27">2 Chron. xxiv.</A>)

 than it does here, for there we find the blood of one of God's prophets
 laid at his door; here we are only told, 

 I. That he did well while Jehoiada lived,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II.  That he was careful and active to repair the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:4-16">ver. 4-16</A>.
 
 III. That after a mean compact with Hazael 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:17,18">ver. 17, 18</A>)

 he died ingloriously,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty
 years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name <I>was</I> Zibiah
 of Beer-sheba.
 &nbsp; 2 And Jehoash did <I>that which was</I> right in the sight of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
 &nbsp; 3 But the high places were not taken away: the people still
 sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The general account here given of Joash is, 

 1. That he reigned forty years. As he began his reign when he was very
 young, he might, in the course of nature, have continued much longer, 
 for he was cut off when he was but forty-seven years old,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 2. That he did that which was right as long as Jehoiada lived to 
 instruct him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Many young men have come too soon to an estate--have had wealth, and 
 power, and liberty, before they knew how to use them--and it has been 
 of bad consequence to them; but against this danger Joash was well 
 guarded by having such a good director as Jehoiada was, so wise, and 
 experienced, and faithful to him, and by having so much wisdom as to 
 hearken to him and be directed by him, even when he was grown up. Note, 
 It is a great mercy to young people, and especially to young princes, 
 and all young men of consequence, to be under good direction, and to 
 have those about them that will instruct them to do <I>that which is 
 right in the sight of the Lord;</I> and they then do wisely and well 
 for themselves when they are willing to be counselled and ruled by 
 such. <I>A child left to himself brings his mother to shame,</I> but a 
 child left to such a tuition may bring himself to honour and comfort. 

 3. That the <I>high places were not taken away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Up and down the country they had altars both for sacrifice and incense,
 to the honour of the God of Israel only, but in competition with, and 
 at least in tacit contempt of, his altar at Jerusalem. These private 
 altars, perhaps, had been more used in the late bad reigns than 
 formerly, because it was not safe to go up to Jerusalem, nor was the 
 temple-service performed as it should have been; and, it may be, 
 Jehoiada connived at them, because some well-meaning people were glad 
 of them when they could not have better, and he hoped that the 
 reforming of the temple, and putting things into a good posture there, 
 would by degrees draw people from their high places and they would 
 dwindle of themselves; or perhaps neither the king nor the priest had 
 zeal enough to carry on their reformation so far, nor courage and 
 strength enough to encounter such an inveterate usage.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4 And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the
 dedicated things that is brought into the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 <I>even</I> the money of every one that passeth <I>the account,</I> the
 money that every man is set at, <I>and</I> all the money that cometh
 into any man's heart to bring into the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 &nbsp; 5 Let the priests take <I>it</I> to them, every man of his
 acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house,
 wheresoever any breach shall be found.
 &nbsp; 6 But it was <I>so, that</I> in the three and twentieth year of king
 Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
 &nbsp; 7 Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the
 <I>other</I> priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the
 breaches of the house? now therefore receive no <I>more</I> money of
 your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.
 &nbsp; 8 And the priests consented to receive no <I>more</I> money of the
 people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.
 &nbsp; 9 But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the
 lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one
 cometh into the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and the priests that kept the
 door put therein all the money <I>that was</I> brought into the house
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 10 And it was <I>so,</I> when they saw that <I>there was</I> much money
 in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up,
 and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the
 house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 11 And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them
 that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that
 wrought upon the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 &nbsp; 12 And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and
 hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 for all that was laid out for the house to repair <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 13 Howbeit there were not made for the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> bowls
 of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or
 vessels of silver, of the money <I>that was</I> brought into the house
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 14 But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith
 the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 15 Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand
 they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they
 dealt faithfully.
 &nbsp; 16 The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the
 house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: it was the priests'.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the repairing of the temple in the reign of 
 Joash.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It seems, the temple had gone out of repair. Though Solomon built it 
 very strong, of the best materials and in the best manner, yet in time 
 it went to decay, and there were <I>breaches found in it</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 in the roofs, or walls, or floors, the ceiling, or wainscoting, or 
 windows, or the partitions of the courts. Even temples themselves are 
 the worse for the wearing; but the heavenly temple will never wax old.  
 Yet it was not only the teeth of time that made these breaches, the 
 sons of Athaliah had <I>broken up the house of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:7">2 Chron. xxiv. 7</A>),
 
 and, out of enmity to the service of the temple, had damaged the
 buildings of it, and the priests had not taken care to repair the 
 breaches in time, so that they went worse and worse. Unworthy were 
 those husbandmen to have this valuable vineyard let out to them upon 
 such easy terms who could not afford to keep the winepress in due and 
 tenantable repair, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:33">Matt. xxi. 33</A>.

 Justly did their great Lord sue them for this permissive waste, and by
 his judgments recover <I>locum vastatum--for dilapidations</I> (as the 
 law speaks), when this neglected temple was laid even with the 
 ground.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The king himself was (as it should seem) the first and forwardest 
 man that took care for the repair of it. We do not find that the 
 priests complained of it or that Jehoiada himself was active in it, but 
 the king was zealous in the matter, 

 1.  Because he was king, and God expects and requires from those who
 have power that they use it for the maintenance and support of 
 religion, the redress of grievances, and reparation of decays, for the 
 exciting and engaging of ministers to do their part and people theirs. 

 2. Because the temple had been both his nursery and his sanctuary when 
 he was a child, in a grateful remembrance of which he now appeared 
 zealous for the honour of it.  Those who have experienced the comfort 
 and benefit of religious assemblies will make the reproach of them 
 their burden

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:18">Zeph. iii. 18</A>),

 the support of them their care, and the prosperity of them their chief
 joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The priests were ordered to collect money for these repairs, and 
 to take care that the work was done. The king had the affairs of his 
 kingdom to mind, and could not himself inspect this affair, but he 
 employed the priests to manage it, the fittest persons, and most 
 likely, one would think, to be hearty in it. 

 1. He gave them orders for the levying of the money of the dedicated
 things. They must not stay till it was paid in, but they must call for 
 it where they knew it was due, in their respective districts, as 
 redemption-money (by virtue of the law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+27:2,3">Lev. xxvii. 2, 3</A>),

 or as a free-will offering,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 This they were to gather every man of his acquaintance, and it was 
 supposed that there was no man but had acquaintance with some or other 
 of the priests. Note, We should take the opportunity that God gives us 
 of exciting those we have a particular acquaintance with to that which 
 is good.

 2. He gave them orders for laying out the money they had levied in 
 <I>repairing the breaches of the house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:5"><I>v.</I>  5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. This method did not answer the intention,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Little money was raised. Either the priests were careless, and did not
 call on the people to pay in their dues, or the people had so little 
 confidence in the priests' management that they were backward to pay 
 money into their hands; if they were distrusted without cause, it was 
 the people's shame; if with, it was more theirs. But what money was 
 raised was not applied to the proper use: <I>The breaches of the house 
 were not repaired;</I> the priests thought it might serve as well as it 
 had done, and therefore put off repairing from time to time. Church 
 work is usually slow work, but it is a pity that churchmen, of all men, 
 should be slow at it. Perhaps what little money they raised they 
 thought it necessary to use for the maintenance of the priests, which 
 must needs fall much short when ten tribes had wholly revolted and the 
 other two were wretchedly corrupted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Another method was therefore taken. The king had his heart much set 
 upon having <I>the breaches of the house repaired,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 His apostasy, at last, gives us cause to question whether he had as
 good an affection for the service of the temple as he had for the 
 structure.  Many have been zealous for building and beautifying 
 churches, and for other forms of godliness, who yet have been strangers 
 to the power of it. However, we commend his zeal, and blame him not for 
 reproving even his tutor Jehoiada himself when he saw him remiss; and 
 so convincing was his reproof that the priests owned themselves 
 unworthy to be any longer employed, and consented to the taking of some 
 other measures, and the giving up of the money they had received into 
 other hands, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It was honestly done, when they found they had not spirit to do it
 themselves, not to hinder other people from doing it.  Another course 
 was taken,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. For raising money, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 The money was not paid into private hands, but put into a public chest,
 and then people brought it in readily and in great abundance, not only 
 their dues, but their free-will offerings for so good a work. The high 
 priest and the secretary of state counted the money out of the chest, 
 and laid it by <I>in specie</I> for the use to which it was 
 appropriated. When public distributions are made faithfully public 
 contributions will be made cheerfully. The money that was given,

 (1.) Was dropped into the chest through a hole in the lid, past recall, 
 to intimate that what has been once resigned to God must never be 
 resumed. <I>Every man, as he purposeth in his heart, so let him 
 give.</I> 

 (2.) The chest was put on the right hand as they went in, which, some 
 think, is alluded to in that rule of charity which our Saviour gives, 
 <I>Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.</I> But, while 
 they were getting all they could for the repair of the temple, they did 
 not break in upon that which was the stated maintenance of the priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 The trespass-money and the sin-money (which were given to them by that
 law,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+5:15,16">Lev. v. 15, 16</A>)

 were reserved to them. Let not the servants of the temple be starved
 under colour of repairing the breaches of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. For laying out the money that was raised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They did not put it into the hands of the priests, who were not 
 versed in affairs of this nature, having other work to mind, but 
 <I>into the hands of those that did the work,</I> or at least <I>had 
 the oversight of it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Those were fittest to be entrusted with this business whose employment
 lay that way. <I>Tractant fabrilia fabri</I>--<I>Every artist has his 
 trade assigned;</I> but let not those who are called to war the holy 
 warfare entangle themselves in the affairs of this life. Those that 
 were thus entrusted did the business,

 [1.] Carefully, purchasing materials and paying workmen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 Business is done with expedition when those are employed in it that
 understand it and know which way to go about it. 

 [2.] Faithfully; such a reputation they got for honesty that there was 
 no occasion to examine their bills or audit their accounts. Let all 
 that are entrusted with public money, or public work, learn hence to 
 deal faithfully, as those that know God will reckon with them, whether 
 men do or no. Those that think it is no sin to cheat the government, 
 cheat the country, or cheat the church, will be of another mind when 
 God shall set their sins in order before them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They did not lay it out in ornaments for the temple, in vessels of
 gold or silver, but in necessary repairs first 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 whence we may learn, in all our expenses to give that the preference 
 which is most needful, and, in dealing for the public, to deal as we 
 would for ourselves. After the repairs were finished we find the 
 overplus turned into plate for the service of the temple,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath,
 and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 18 And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that
 Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of
 Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the
 gold <I>that was</I> found in the treasures of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 and in the king's house, and sent <I>it</I> to Hazael king of Syria:
 and he went away from Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 19 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did,
 <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
 of Judah?
 &nbsp; 20 And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew
 Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.
 &nbsp; 21 For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of
 Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him
 with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son
 reigned in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When Joash had revolted from God and become both an idolater and a 
 persecutor the hand of the Lord went out against him, and his <I>last 
 state was worse than his first.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His wealth and honour became an easy prey to his neighbours. Hazael, 
 when he had chastised Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:32"><I>ch.</I> x. 32</A>),

 threatened Judah and Jerusalem likewise, took Gath, a strong city 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 and thence intended to march with his forces against Jerusalem, the 
 royal city, the holy city, but whose defence, on account of its 
 sinfulness, had departed. Joash had neither spirit nor strength to make 
 head against him, but gave him all the hallowed things, and all the 
 gold that was found both in his exchequer and in the treasures of the 
 temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 to bribe him to march another way. If it were lawful to do this for the 
 public safety, better part with the gold of the temple than expose the 
 temple itself; yet, 

 1. If he had not forsaken God, and forfeited his protection, his
 affairs would not have been brought to this extremity, but he might 
 have forced Hazael to retire. 

 2. He diminished himself, and made himself very mean, lost the honour 
 of a prince and a soldier, and of an Israelite too, in alienating the 
 dedicated things. 

 3. He impoverished himself and his kingdom. And, 

 4. He tempted Hazael to come again, when he could carry home so rich a 
 booty without striking a stroke. And it had this effect, for the next 
 year the host of Syria came up against Jerusalem, destroyed the prince, 
 and plundered the city,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+24:23,24">2 Chron. xxiv. 23, 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His life became an easy prey to his own servants. They conspired 
 against him and slew him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+12:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>),

 not aiming at his kingdom, for they opposed not his son's succeeding 
 him, but to be avenged on him for some crime he had committed; and we 
 are told in Chronicles that his murdering the prophet, Jehoiada's son, 
 was the provocation. In this, how unrighteous soever they were 
 (vengeance was not theirs, nor did it belong to them to repay), God was 
 righteous; and this was not the only time that he let even kings know 
 that it was at their peril if they touched his anointed and did his 
 prophets any harm, and that, when he comes to make inquisition for 
 blood, the blood of prophets will run the account very high. Thus fell 
 Joash, who began in the spirit and ended in the flesh. God usually sets 
 marks of his displeasure upon apostates, even in this life; for they, 
 of all sinners, do most <I>reproach the Lord.</I></P>
