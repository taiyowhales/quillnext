 The last news we had of Haman left him in his cups, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:15"><I>ch.</I> iii. 15</A>.

 Our last news of queen Esther left her in tears, fasting and praying.
 Now this chapter brings in,

 I. Esther in her joys, smiled upon by the king and honoured with his
 company at her banquet of wine,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. Haman upon the fret, because he had not Mordecai's cap and knee,
 and with great indignation setting up a gallows for him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:9-14">ver. 9-14</A>.

 Thus those that sow in tears shall reap in joy, but the triumphing of
 the wicked is short.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on
 <I>her</I> royal <I>apparel,</I> and stood in the inner court of the king's
 house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his
 royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the
 house.
 &nbsp; 2  And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in
 the court, <I>that</I> she obtained favour in his sight: and the king
 held out to Esther the golden sceptre that <I>was</I> in his hand. So
 Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.
 &nbsp; 3  Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther?
 and what <I>is</I> thy request? it shall be even given thee to the
 half of the kingdom.
 &nbsp; 4  And Esther answered, If <I>it seem</I> good unto the king, let the
 king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have
 prepared for him.
 &nbsp; 5  Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do
 as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet
 that Esther had prepared.
 &nbsp; 6  And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What
 <I>is</I> thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what <I>is</I>
 thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be
 performed.
 &nbsp; 7  Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request
 <I>is;</I>
 &nbsp; 8  If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it
 please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request,
 let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare
 for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Esther's bold approach to the king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 When the time appointed for their fast was finished she lost no time,
 but on the third day, when the impression of her devotions were fresh 
 upon her spirit, she addressed the king. When the heart is enlarged in 
 communion with God it will be emboldened in doing and suffering for 
 him. Some think that the three days' fast was only one whole day and 
 two whole nights, in all which time they did not take any food at all, 
 and that this is called <I>three days,</I> as Christ's lying in the 
 grave so long is. This exposition is favoured by the consideration that 
 on the third day the queen made her appearance at court. Resolutions 
 which have difficulties and dangers to break though should be pursued 
 without delay, lest they cool and slacken. <I>What thou doest,</I> 
 which must be done boldly, <I>do it quickly.</I> Now she <I>put on her 
 royal apparel,</I> that she might the better recommend herself to the 
 king, and laid aside her fast-day clothes. She put on her fine clothes, 
 not to please herself, but her husband; in her prayer, as we find in 
 the Apocrypha

 (<U>Esther xiv. 16</U>), 

 she thus appeals to God: <I>Thou knowest, Lord, I abhor the sign of my
 high estate which is upon my head, in the days wherein I show myself, 
 &c.</I> Let hose whose rank obliges them to wear rich clothes learn 
 hence to be dead to them, and not make them their adorning. She stood 
 <I>in the inner court over against the king,</I> expecting her doom, 
 between hope and fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The favourable reception which the king gave her. When he <I>saw 
 her</I> she <I>obtained favour in his sight.</I> The apocryphal author 
 and Josephus say that she took two maids with her, on one of whom she 
 leaned, while the other bore up her train,--that her countenance was
 cheerful and very amiable, but her heart was in anguish,--that the king,
 lifting up his countenance that shone with majesty, at first looked 
 very fiercely upon here, whereupon she grew pale, and fainted, and 
 bowed herself on the head of the maid that went by her; but then God 
 changed the spirit of the king, and, in a fear, he leaped from his 
 throne, took her in his arms till she came to herself, and comforted 
 her with loving words. Here we are only told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he protected her from the law, and assured her of safety, by 
 <I>holding out to her the golden sceptre</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 which she thankfully <I>touched the top of,</I> thereby presenting
 herself to him as a humble petitioner. Thus having had power with God 
 and prevailed, like Jacob, she had power with men too. <I>He that will 
 lose his life</I> for God shall <I>save it,</I> or find it in a better 
 life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he encouraged her address 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>What wilt thou, queen Esther, and what is thy request?</I> So far
 was he from counting her an offender that he seemed glad to see her, 
 and desirous to oblige her. He that had divorced one wife for not 
 coming when she was sent for would not be severe to another for coming 
 when she was not sent for. God can turn the hearts of men, of great 
 men, of those that act most arbitrarily, which way he pleases towards 
 us. Esther feared that she should perish, but was promised that she 
 should have what she might ask for, though it were <I>the half of the 
 kingdom.</I> Note, God in his providence often prevents the fears, and 
 outdoes the hopes, of his people, especially when they venture in his 
 cause. Let us from this story infer, as our Saviour does from the 
 parable of the unjust judge, an encouragement to <I>pray always</I> to 
 our God, <I>and not faint,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:6-8">Luke xviii. 6-8</A>.

 Hear what this haughty king says (<I>What is thy petition, and what is
 thy request? It shall be granted thee</I>), and say <I>shall not 
 God</I> hear and answer the prayers of <I>his own elect, that cry day 
 and night to him?</I> Esther came to a proud imperious man; we come to 
 the God of love and grace. She was not called; we are: the Spirit says, 
 <I>Come,</I> and the bride says, <I>Come.</I> She had a law against 
 her; we have a promise, many a promise, in favour of us: <I>Ask, and it 
 shall be given you.</I> She had no friend to introduce her, or 
 intercede for her, while on the contrary he that was then the king's 
 favourite was her enemy; but we have an advocate with the Father, in 
 whom he is well pleased. <I>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne 
 of grace.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That all the request she had to make to him, at this time, was that 
 he would please to come to a banquet which she had prepared for him, 
 and bring Haman along with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.
 
 Hereby,

 (1.) She would intimate to him how much she valued his favour and
 company. Whatever she had to ask, she desired his favour above any 
 thing, and would purchase it at any rate.

 (2.) She would try how he stood affected to her; for, if he should
 refuse this, it would be to no purpose as yet to present her other 
 request.

 (3.) She would endeavour to bring him into a pleasant humour, and
 soften his spirit, that he might with the more tenderness receive the 
 impressions of the complaint she had to make to him.

 (4.) She would please him, by making court to Haman his favourite, and
 inviting him to come whose company she knew he loved and whom she 
 desired to have present when she made her complaint; for she would say 
 nothing of him but what she durst say to his face.

 (5.) She hoped at the banquet of wine to have a fairer and more
 favourable opportunity of presenting her petition. Wisdom is profitable 
 to direct how to manage some men that are hard to deal with, and to 
 take them by the right handle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That he readily came, and ordered Haman to come along with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 which was an indication of the kindness he still retained for her; if
 he really designed the destruction of her and her people, he would not 
 have accepted her banquet. There he renewed his kind enquiry (<I>What 
 is thy petition?</I>) and his generous promise, that it should be 
 granted, <I>even to the half of the kingdom</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 a proverbial expression, by which he assured her that he would deny her
 nothing in reason. Herod used it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+6:23">Mark vi. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That then Esther thought fit to ask no more than a promise that he 
 would please to accept of another treat, the next day, in her 
 apartment, and Haman with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>),

 intimating to him that then she would let him know what her business
 was. This adjourning of the main petition may be attributed,

 (1.) To Esther's prudence; thus she hoped yet further to win upon him
 and ingratiate herself with him.  Perhaps her heart failed her now when 
 she was going to make her request, and she desired to take some further 
 time for prayer, that God would give her <I>a mouth and wisdom.</I> The 
 putting of it off thus, it is likely, she knew would be well taken as 
 an expression of the great reverence she had for the king, and her 
 unwillingness to be too pressing upon him. What is hastily asked is 
 often as hastily denied; but what is asked with a pause deserves to be 
 considered.

 (2.) To God's providence putting it into Esther's heart to delay her
 petition a day longer, she knew not why, but God did, that what was to 
 happen in the night intervening between this and to-morrow might 
 further her design and make way for her success, that Haman might 
 arrive at the highest pitch of malice against Mordecai and might begin 
 to <I>fall before him.</I> The Jews perhaps blamed Ester as dilatory, 
 and some of them began to suspect her sincerity, or at least her zeal; 
 but the event disproved their jealousy, and all was for the best.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart:
 but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not
 up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against
 Mordecai.
 &nbsp; 10  Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home,
 he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.
 &nbsp; 11  And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the
 multitude of his children, and all <I>the things</I> wherein the king
 had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes
 and servants of the king.
 &nbsp; 12  Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man
 come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but
 myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.
 &nbsp; 13  Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai
 the Jew sitting at the king's gate.
 &nbsp; 14  Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let
 a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou
 unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou
 in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased
 Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This account here given of Haman is a comment upon that of Solomon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:24">Prov. xxi. 24</A>.

 <I>Proud and haughty scorner is his name that deals in proud wrath.</I>
 Never did any man more answer that name than Haman, in whom pride and 
 wrath had so much the ascendant. See him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Puffed up with the honour of being invited to Esther's feast. He was 
 <I>joyful and glad of heart</I> at it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Observe with what a high gust he speaks of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 how he values himself upon it, and how near he thinks it brings him to
 the perfection of felicity, that Esther the queen did let no man come 
 with the king to the banquet but his mighty self, and he thought it was 
 because she was exceedingly charmed with his conversation that the next 
 day she had invited him also to come with the king; none so fit as he 
 to bear the king company. Note, Self-admirers and self-flatterers are 
 really self-deceivers. Haman pleased himself with the fancy that the 
 queen, by this repeated invitation, designed to honour him, whereas 
 really she designed to accuse him, and, in calling him to the banquet, 
 did but call him to the bar. What magnifying glasses do proud men look 
 at their faces in! And how does the <I>pride of their heart deceive 
 them!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:3">Obad. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Vexing and fretting at the slight that Mordecai put upon him, and 
 thereby made uneasy to himself and to all about him. 

 1. Mordecai was as determined as ever: <I>He stood not up, nor moved
 for him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 What he did was from a principle of conscience, and therefore he
 persevered in it, and would not cringe to Haman, no, not when he had 
 reason to fear him and Esther herself complimented him. He knew God 
 could and would deliver him and his people from the rage of Haman, 
 without any such mean and sneaking expedients to mollify him.  Those 
 that walk in holy sincerity may walk in holy security, and go on in 
 their work, not fearing what man can do unto them. <I>He that walks 
 uprightly walks surely.</I>

 2. Haman can as ill bear it as ever; nay, the higher he is lifted up,
 the more impatient is her of contempt and the more enraged at it.

 (1.) It made his own spirit restless, and put him into a grievous
 agitation. He was <I>full of indignation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)
 
 and yet <I>refrained himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Gladly would he have drawn his sword and run Mordecai through for
 affronting him thus; but he hoped shortly to see him fall with all the 
 Jews, and therefore with much ado prevailed with himself to forbear 
 stabbing him. What a struggle had he in his own bosom between his 
 anger, which required Mordecai's death immediately (<I>O that I had of 
 his flesh! I cannot be satisfied!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:31">Job xxxi. 31</A>),

 and his malice, which had determined to wait for the general massacre!
 Thus <I>thorns and snares are in the way of the froward.</I>

 (2.) It made all his enjoyments sapless. This little affront which he
 received from Mordecai was the dead fly which spoiled all his pot of 
 precious ointment; he himself owned in the presence of his wife and 
 friends, to the everlasting reproach of a proud and discontented mind, 
 that he had no comfort in his estate, preferment, and family, as long 
 as Mordecai lived and had a place <I>in the king's gate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:10-13"><I>v.</I> 10-13</A>.
 
 He took notice of his own riches and honours, the numerousness of his
 family, and the high posts to which he was advanced, that he was the 
 darling of the prince and the idol of the court; and <I>yet all this 
 avails him nothing</I> as long as Mordecai is unhanged. Those that are 
 disposed to be uneasy will never want something or other to be uneasy 
 at; and proud men, though they have <I>much</I> to their mind, yet, if 
 they have not <I>all</I> to their mind, it is as nothing to them. The 
 thousandth part of what Haman had would serve to make a humble modest 
 man as much of a happiness as he expects from this world; and yet Haman 
 complained as passionately as if he had been sunk into the lowest 
 degree of poverty and disgrace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Meditating revenge, and assisted therein by his wife and his 
 friends, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 They saw how gladly he would dispense with his own resolution of
 deferring the slaughter till the time determined by the lot, and 
 therefore advised him to take an earnest and foretaste of the 
 satisfaction he then expected in the speedy execution of Mordecai; let 
 him have that to please him at the moment; and having, as he thought, 
 made sure the destruction of all the Jews, at the time appointed, he 
 will not think scorn, for the present, to lay hands on Mordecai alone.

 1. For the pleasing of his fancy they advise him to get <I>a gallows
 ready,</I> and have it set up before his own door, that, as soon as
 ever he could get the warrant signed, there might be no delay of the 
 execution; he would not need so much as to stay the making of the 
 gallows. This is very agreeable to Haman, who has the gallows made and 
 fixed immediately; it must be fifty cubits high, or as near that as 
 might be, for the greater disgrace of Mordecai and to make him a 
 spectacle to every one that passed by; and it must be before Haman's 
 door, that all men might take notice it was to the idol of his revenge 
 that Mordecai was sacrificed and that he might feed his eyes with the 
 sight. 

 2. For the gaining of his point they advise him to go early in the
 morning to the king, and get an order from him for the hanging of 
 Mordecai, which, they doubted not, would be readily granted to one who 
 was so much the king's favourite and who had so easily obtained an 
 edict for the destruction of the whole nation of the Jews. There needed 
 no feigned suggestion; it was enough if he let the king know that 
 Mordecai, in contempt of the king's command, refused to reverence him.  
 And now we leave Haman to go to bed, pleased with the thoughts of 
 seeing Mordecai hanged the next day, and then going merrily to the 
 banquet, and not dreaming of handselling his own gallows.</P>
