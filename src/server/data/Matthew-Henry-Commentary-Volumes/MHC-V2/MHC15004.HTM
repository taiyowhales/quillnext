 The good work of rebuilding the temple was no sooner begun than it met 
 with opposition from those that bore ill will to it; the Samaritans 
 were enemies to the Jews and their religion, and they set themselves to 
 obstruct it. 

 I. They offered to be partners in the building of it, that they might
 have it in their power to retard it; but they were refused, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.
 
 II. They discouraged them in it, and dissuaded them from it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.
 
 III. They basely misrepresented the undertaking, and the undertakers,
 to the king of Persia, by a memorial they sent him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:6-16">ver. 6-16</A>.

 IV. They obtained from him an order to stop the building
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:17-22">ver. 17-22</A>),

 which they immediately put in execution,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
 children of the captivity builded the temple unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of
 Israel;
 &nbsp; 2  Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the
 fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek
 your God, as ye <I>do;</I> and we do sacrifice unto him since the days
 of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.
 &nbsp; 3  But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the
 fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us
 to build a house unto our God; but we ourselves together will
 build unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of
 Persia hath commanded us.
 &nbsp; 4  Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people
 of Judah, and troubled them in building,
 &nbsp; 5  And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their
 purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the
 reign of Darius king of Persia.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an instance of the old enmity that was put between the 
 seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent. God's temple cannot be 
 built, but Satan will rage, and the <I>gates of hell</I> will <I>fight 
 against it.</I> The gospel kingdom was, in like manner, to be set up 
 with much struggling and contention. In this respect the glory of the 
 latter house was greater than the glory of the former, and it was more 
 a figure of the temple of Christ's church, in that Solomon built his 
 temple when there was <I>no adversary nor evil occurrent,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+5:4">1 Kings v. 4</A>);

 but this second temple was built notwithstanding great opposition, in
 the removing and conquering of which, and the bringing of the work to 
 perfection at last in spite of it, the wisdom, power, and goodness of 
 God were much glorified, and the church was encouraged to trust in 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The undertakers are here called the <I>children of the captivity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 which makes them look very little. They had newly come out of
 captivity, were born in captivity, had still the marks of their 
 captivity upon them; though they were not now captives, they were under 
 the control of those whose captives they had lately been. Israel was 
 God's son, his first-born; but by their iniquity the people sold and 
 enslaved themselves, and so became children of the captivity. But, it 
 should seem, the thought of their being so quickened them to this work, 
 for it was by their neglect of the temple that they lost their 
 freedom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The opposers of the undertaking are here said to be <I>the 
 adversaries of Judah and Benjamin,</I> not the Chaldeans or Persians 
 (they gave them no disturbance--"let them build and welcome"), but the
 relics of the ten tribes, and the foreigners that had joined themselves 
 to them, and patched up that mongrel religion we had an account of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+17:33">2 Kings xvii. 33</A>.

 <I>They feared the Lord, and served their own gods too.</I> They are
 called <I>the people of the land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The worst enemies Judah and Benjamin had were those that <I>said they
 were Jews and were not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9">Rev. iii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The opposition they gave had in it much of the subtlety of the old 
 serpent. When they heard that the temple was in building they were 
 immediately aware that it would be a fatal blow to their superstition, 
 and set themselves to oppose it. They had not power to do it forcibly, 
 but they tried all the ways they could to do it effectually.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They offered their service to build with the Israelites only that 
 thereby they might get an opportunity to retard the work, while they 
 pretended to further it. Now, 

 (1.) Their offer was plausible enough, and looked kind: "<I>We will 
 build with you,</I> will help you to contrive, and will contribute 
 towards the expense; <I>for we seek your God as you do,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 This was false, for, though they sought the same God, they did not seek
 him only, nor seek him in the way he appointed, and therefore did not 
 seek him as they did. Herein they designed, if it were possible, to 
 hinder the building of it, at least to hinder their comfortable 
 enjoyment of it; as good almost not have it as not have it to 
 themselves, for the pure worship of the true God and him only. Thus are 
 the <I>kisses of an enemy deceitful;</I> his words are smoother than 
 butter when war is in his heart. But,

 (2.) The refusal of their proffered service was very just, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 <I>The chief of the fathers of Israel</I> were soon aware that they
 meant them no kindness, whatever they pretended, but really designed to 
 do them a mischief, and therefore (though they had need enough of help 
 if it had been such as they could confide in) told them plainly, 
 "<I>You have nothing to do with us,</I> have no part nor lot in this 
 matter, are not true-born Israelites nor faithful worshippers of God; 
 <I>you worship you know not what,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:22">John iv. 22</A>.

 You are none of those with whom we dare hold communion, and therefore
 we ourselves will build it." They plead not to them the law of their 
 God, which forbade them to mingle with strangers (though that 
 especially they had an eye to), but that which they would take more 
 notice of, the king's commission, which was directed to them only: "The 
 king of Persia has commanded us to build this house, and we shall 
 distrust and affront him if we call in foreign aid." Note, In doing 
 good there is need of the <I>wisdom of the serpent,</I> as well as the 
 <I>innocency of the dove,</I> and we have need, as it follows there, to 
 <I>beware of men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:16,17">Matt. x. 16, 17</A>.

 We should carefully consider with whom we are associated and on whose
 hand we lean. While we trust God with a pious confidence we must trust 
 men with a prudent jealousy and caution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When this plot failed they did what they could to divert them from 
 the work and discourage them in it. They weakened their hands by 
 telling them it was in vain to attempt it, calling them <I>foolish 
 builders,</I> who began what they were not able to finish, and by their 
 insinuations troubled them, and made them drive heavily in the work. 
 All were not alike zealous in it. Those that were cool and indifferent 
 were by these artifices drawn off from the work, which wanted their 
 help, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 And because what they themselves said the Jews would suspect to be ill
 meant, and not be influenced by, they, underhand, <I>hired counsellors 
 against them,</I> who, pretending to advise them for the best, should 
 dissuade them from proceeding, and so <I>frustrate their purpose</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 or dissuade the men of Tyre and Sidon from furnishing them with the
 timber they had bargained for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+3:7"><I>ch.</I> iii. 7</A>);

 or whatever business they had at the Persian court, to solicit for any
 particular grants or favours, pursuant to the general edict for their 
 liberty, there were those that were hired and lay ready to appear of 
 counsel against them. Wonder not at the restlessness of the church's 
 enemies in their attempts against the building of God's temple. He whom 
 they serve, and whose work they are doing, is <I>unwearied</I> in 
 <I>walking to and fro through the earth</I> to do mischief. And let 
 those who discourage a good work, and weaken the hands of those that 
 are employed in it, see whose pattern they follow.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign,
 wrote they <I>unto him</I> an accusation against the inhabitants of
 Judah and Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 7  And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath,
 Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of
 Persia; and the writing of the letter <I>was</I> written in the Syrian
 tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.
 &nbsp; 8  Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter
 against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:
 &nbsp; 9  Then <I>wrote</I> Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe,
 and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the
 Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites,
 the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, <I>and</I> the
 Elamites,
 &nbsp; 10  And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble
 Asnappar brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the
 rest <I>that are</I> on this side the river, and at such a time.
 &nbsp; 11  This <I>is</I> the copy of the letter that they sent unto him,
 <I>even</I> unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this
 side the river, and at such a time.
 &nbsp; 12  Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from
 thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and
 the bad city, and have set up the walls <I>thereof,</I> and joined the
 foundations.
 &nbsp; 13  Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be
 builded, and the walls set up <I>again, then</I> will they not pay
 toll, tribute, and custom, and <I>so</I> thou shalt endamage the
 revenue of the kings.
 &nbsp; 14  Now because we have maintenance from <I>the king's</I> palace,
 and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore
 have we sent and certified the king;
 &nbsp; 15  That search may be made in the book of the records of thy
 fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know
 that this city <I>is</I> a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and
 provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of
 old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.
 &nbsp; 16  We certify the king that, if this city be builded <I>again,</I>
 and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no
 portion on this side the river.

 Cyrus stedfastly adhered to the Jews' interest, and supported his own 
 grant. It was to no purpose to offer any thing to him in prejudice of 
 it. What he did was from a good principle, and in the fear of God, and 
 therefore he adhered to it. But, though his reign in all was thirty 
 years, yet after the conquest of Babylon, and his decree for the 
 release of the Jews, some think that he reigned but three years, others 
 seven, and then either died or gave up that part of his government, in 
 which his successor was Ahasuerus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 called also <I>Artaxerxes</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 supposed to be the same that in heathen authors is called
 <I>Cambyses,</I> who had never taken such cognizance of the despised 
 Jews as to concern himself for them, nor had he that knowledge of the 
 God of Israel which his predecessor had. To him these Samaritans 
 applied by letter for an order to stop the building of the temple; and 
 they did it in the beginning of his reign, being resolved to lose no 
 time when they thought they had a king for their purpose. See how 
 watchful the church's enemies are to take the first opportunity of 
 doing it a mischief; let not its friends be less careful to do it a 
 kindness. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The general purport of the letter which they sent to the king, to 
 inform him of this matter. It is called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 <I>an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</I>
 The devil is the <I>accuser of the brethren</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:10">Rev. xii. 10</A>),

 and he carries on his malicious designs against them, not only by
 accusing them himself before God, as he did Job, but by acting as a 
 lying spirit in the mouths of his instruments, whom he employs to 
 accuse them before magistrates and kings and to make them odious to the 
 many and obnoxious to the mighty.  Marvel not if the same arts be still 
 used to depreciate serious godliness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The persons concerned in writing this letter. The contrivers are 
 named 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)
 
 that plotted the thing, the writers
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 that put it into form, and the subscribers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 that concurred in it and joined with them in this representation, this
 misrepresentation I should call it. Now see here, 

 1. How the <I>rulers take counsel together against the Lord</I> and his
 temple, with their companions. The building of the temple would do them 
 no harm, yet they appear against it with the utmost concern and 
 virulence, perhaps because the prophets of the God of Israel had 
 foretold the <I>famishing</I> and <I>perishing</I> of all the <I>gods 
 of the heathen,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+2:11,Jer+10:11">Zeph. ii. 11; Jer. x. 11</A>.

 2. How the people concurred with them in imagining this vain thing.
 They followed the cry, though ignorant of the merits of the cause. All 
 the several colonies of that plantation (nine are here mentioned), who 
 had their denomination from the cities or countries of Assyria, 
 Chaldea, Persia, &c., whence they came, set their hands, by their 
 representatives, to this letter. Perhaps they were incensed against 
 these returned Jews because many of the ten tribes were among them, 
 whose estates they had got into their possession, and of whom they were 
 therefore jealous, lest they should attempt the recovery of them 
 hereafter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A copy of the letter itself, which Ezra inserts here out of the 
 records of the kingdom of Persia, into which it had been entered; and 
 it is well we have it, that we may see whence the like methods, still 
 taken to expose good people and baffle good designs, are copied.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They represent themselves as very loyal to the government, and 
 greatly concerned for the honour and interest of it, and would have it 
 thought that the king had no such loving faithful subjects in all his 
 dominions as they were, none so sensible of their obligations to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 <I>Because we are salted with the salt of the palace</I> (so it is in
 the <I>margin</I>), "we have our salary from the court, and could no
 more live without it than flesh could be preserved without salt;" or, 
 as some think, their pay or pension was sent them in salt; or "Because 
 we had our education in the palace, and were brought up at the king's 
 table," as we find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+1:5">Dan. i. 5</A>.

 These were those whom he intended to prefer; they did <I>eat their
 portion of the king's meat.</I> "Now, in consideration of this, <I>it 
 is not meet for us to see the king's dishonour;</I>" and therefore they 
 urge him to stop the building of the temple, which would certainly be 
 the king's dishonour more than any thing else. Note, A secret enmity to 
 Christ and his gospel is often gilded over with a pretended affection 
 to Caesar and his power. The Jews hated the Roman government, and yet, 
 to serve a turn, could cry, <I>We have no king but Caesar.</I> But (to 
 allude to this), if those that lived upon the crown thought themselves 
 bound in gratitude thus to support the interest of it, much more reason 
 have we thus to argue ourselves into a pious concern for God's honour; 
 <I>we have our maintenance from the God of heaven</I> and are <I>salted 
 with his salt,</I> live upon his bounty and are the care of his 
 providence; and therefore it is not <I>meet for us to see his 
 dishonour</I> without resenting it and doing what we can to prevent 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They represent the Jews as disloyal, and dangerous to the 
 government, that Jerusalem was <I>the rebellious and bad city</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <I>hurtful to kings and provinces,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 See how Jerusalem, <I>the joy of the whole earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:2">Ps. xlviii. 2</A>),

 is here reproached as the scandal of the whole earth. The enemies of
 the church could not do the bad things they design against it if they 
 did not first give it a bad name. Jerusalem had been a loyal city to 
 its rightful princes, and its present inhabitants were as well affected 
 to the king and his government as any of his provinces whatsoever. 
 Daniel, who was a Jew, had lately approved himself so faithful to his 
 prince that his worst enemies could find no fault in his management, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:4">Dan. vi. 4</A>.

 But thus was Elijah most unjustly charged with troubling Israel, the
 apostles with <I>turning the world upside down,</I> and Christ himself 
 with <I>perverting the nation</I> and <I>forbidding to give tribute to 
 Caesar;</I> and we must not think it strange if the same game be still 
 played. Now here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Their history of what was past was invidious, that <I>within this 
 city sedition had been moved of old time,</I> and, for <I>that cause, 
 it was destroyed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It cannot be denied but that there was some colour given for this
 suggestion by the attempts of Jehoiakim and Zedekiah to shake off the 
 yoke of the king of Babylon, which, if they had kept close to their 
 religion and the temple they were now rebuilding, they would never have 
 come under. But it must be considered,

 [1.] That they were themselves, and their ancestors, sovereign princes, 
 and their efforts to recover their rights, if there had not been in 
 them the violation of an oath, for aught I know, would have been 
 justifiable, and successful too, had they taken the right method and 
 made their peace with God first.

 [2.] Though these Jews, and their princes, had been guilty of 
 rebellion, yet it was unjust therefore to fasten this as an indelible 
 brand upon this city, as if that must for ever after go under the name 
 of <I>the rebellious and bad city.</I> The Jews, in their captivity, 
 had given such specimens of good behaviour as were sufficient, with any 
 reasonable men, to roll away that one reproach; for they were 
 instructed (and we have reason to hope that they observed their 
 instructions) to <I>seek the peace of the city where</I> they were 
 <I>captives</I> and <I>pray to the Lord for it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:7">Jer. xxix. 7</A>.

 It was therefore very unfair, though not uncommon, thus to impute the
 iniquity of the fathers to the children.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their information concerning what was now doing was grossly false 
 in matter of fact. Very careful they were to inform the king that the 
 Jews had <I>set up the walls of this city,</I> nay, had <I>finished</I> 
 them (so it is in the <I>margin</I>) and <I>joined the foundations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 when this was far from being the case. They had only begun to build the
 temple, which Cyrus commanded them to do, but, as for the walls, there 
 was nothing done nor designed towards the repair of them, as appears by 
 the condition they were in many years after

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+1:3">Neh. i. 3</A>),

 all in ruins. <I>What shall be given,</I> and what <I>done, to these
 false tongues,</I> nay, which is worse, these false pens? <I>sharp 
 arrows,</I> doubtless, <I>of the mighty,</I> and <I>coals of 
 juniper,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:3,4">Ps. cxx. 3, 4</A>.

 If they had not been perfectly lost to all virtue and honour they would
 not, and if they had not been very secure of the king's countenance 
 they durst not, have written that to the king which all their 
 neighbours knew to be a notorious lie. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:12">Prov. xxix. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Their prognostics of the consequences were altogether groundless 
 and absurd. They were very confident, and would have the king believe 
 it upon their word, that if this city should be built, not only the 
 Jews would <I>pay no toll, tribute, or custom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 but (since a great lie is as soon spoken as a little one) that the king
 would have no portion at all on this side the river

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 that all the countries on this side Euphrates would instantly revolt,
 drawn in to do so by their example; and, if the prince in possession 
 should connive at this, he would wrong, not only himself, but his 
 successors: <I>Thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.</I> See 
 how every line in this letter breathes both the subtlety and malice of 
 the old serpent.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  <I>Then</I> sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor,
 and <I>to</I> Shimshai the scribe, and <I>to</I> the rest of their
 companions that dwell in Samaria, and <I>unto</I> the rest beyond the
 river, Peace, and at such a time.
 &nbsp; 18  The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read
 before me.
 &nbsp; 19  And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found
 that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings,
 and <I>that</I> rebellion and sedition have been made therein.
 &nbsp; 20  There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have
 ruled over all <I>countries</I> beyond the river; and toll, tribute,
 and custom, was paid unto them.
 &nbsp; 21  Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and
 that this city be not builded, until <I>another</I> commandment shall
 be given from me.
 &nbsp; 22  Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage
 grow to the hurt of the kings?
 &nbsp; 23  Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter <I>was</I> read
 before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they
 went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to
 cease by force and power.
 &nbsp; 24  Then ceased the work of the house of God which <I>is</I> at
 Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of
 Darius king of Persia.

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The orders which the king of Persia gave, in answer to the 
 information sent him by the Samaritans against the Jews. He suffered 
 himself to be imposed upon by their fraud and falsehood, took no care 
 to examine the allegations of their petition concerning that which the 
 Jews were now doing, but took it for granted that the charge was true, 
 and was very willing to gratify them with an order of council to stay 
 proceedings. 

 1. He consulted the records concerning Jerusalem, and found that it had 
 indeed rebelled against the king of Babylon, and therefore that it was, 
 as they called it, a <I>bad city</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),
 
 and withal that in times past kings had reigned there, to whom all the
 countries on that side the river had been tributaries 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 and that therefore there was danger that if ever they were able (which
 they were never likely to be) they would claim them again. Thus he says 
 as they said, and pretends to give a reason for so doing. See the hard 
 fate of princes, who must see and hear with other men's eyes and ears, 
 and give judgment upon things as they are represented to them, though 
 often represented falsely. God's judgment is always just because he 
 sees things as they are, and it is according to truth. 

 2. He appointed these Samaritans to stop the building of the city
 immediately, till further orders should be given about it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.
 
 Neither they, in their letter, nor he, in his order, make any mention
 of the temple, and the building of that, because both they and he knew 
 that they had not only a permission, but a command, from Cyrus to 
 rebuild that, which even these Samaritans had not the confidence to 
 move for the repeal of.  They spoke only of the <I>city:</I> "Let not 
 <I>that</I> be built," that is, as a city with walls and gates; 
 "whatever you do, prevent <I>that, lest damage grow to the hurt of the 
 kings:</I>" he would not that the crown should lose by his wearing 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The use which the enemies of the Jews made of these orders, so 
 fraudulently obtained; upon the receipt of them they went up <I>in 
 haste to Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 <I>Their feet ran to evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:16">Prov. i. 16</A>.

 They were impatient till the builders were served with this
 prohibition, which they produced as their warrant to <I>make them cease 
 by force and power.</I> As they abused the king in obtaining this order 
 by their mis-informations, so they abused him in the execution of it; 
 for the order was only to prevent the walling of the <I>city,</I> but, 
 having force and power on their side, they construed it as relating to 
 the <I>temple,</I> for it was that to which they had an ill will, and 
 which they only wanted some colour to hinder the building of. There was 
 indeed a general clause in the order, to <I>cause these men to 
 cease,</I> which had reference to their complaint about building the 
 walls; but they applied it to the building of the temple. See what need 
 we have to pray, not only for kings, but for all in authority under 
 them, and <I>the governors sent by them,</I> because the 
 <I>quietness</I> and <I>peaceableness</I> of our lives, <I>in all 
 godliness and honesty,</I> depend very much upon the integrity and 
 wisdom of inferior magistrates, as well as the supreme. The consequence 
 was that <I>the work of the house of God ceased</I> for a time, through 
 the power and insolence of its enemies; and so, through the coldness 
 and indifference of its friends, it stood still till the second year of 
 Darius Hystaspes, for to me it seems clear by the thread of this sacred 
 history that it was that Darius,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+4:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Though now a stop was put to it by the violence of the Samaritans, yet
 that they might soon after have gone on by connivance, if they had had 
 a due affection to the work, appears by this, that before they had that 
 express warrant from the king for doing it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:1-12"><I>ch.</I> vi.</A>)

 they were reproved by the prophets for not doing it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:1,Hag+1:1"><I>ch.</I> v. 1</A>,
 
 compared with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+5:1,Hag+1:1">Hag. i. 1</A>,

 &c. If they had taken due care to inform Cambyses of the truth of this 
 case, perhaps he would have recalled his order; but, for aught I know, 
 some of the builders were almost as willing it should cease as the 
 adversaries themselves were. At some periods the church has suffered 
 more by the coldness of its friends than by the heat of its enemies; 
 but both together commonly make church-work slow work.</P>
