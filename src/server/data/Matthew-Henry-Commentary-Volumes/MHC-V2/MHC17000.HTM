 How the providence of God watched over the Jews that had returned out
 of captivity to their own land, and what great and kind things were 
 done for them, we read in the two foregoing books; but there were many 
 who staid behind, having not zeal enough for God's house, and the holy 
 land and city, to carry them through the difficulties of a removal 
 thither. These, one would think, should have been excluded the special 
 protection of Providence, as unworthy the name of Israelites; but our 
 God deals not with us according to our folly and weakness. We find in 
 this book that even those Jews who were scattered in the provinces of 
 the heathen were taken care of, as well as those who were gathered in 
 the land of Judea, and were wonderfully preserved, when doomed to 
 destruction and appointed as sheep for the slaughter. Who drew up this 
 story is uncertain. Mordecai was as able as any man to relate, on his 
 own knowledge, the several passages of it; <I>quorum pars magna 
 fuit--for he bore a conspicuous part in it;</I> and that he wrote such
 an account of them as was necessary to inform his people of the grounds 
 of their observing the feast of Purim we are told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:20"><I>ch.</I> ix. 20</A>,

 <I>Mordecai wrote these things,</I> and sent them enclosed in letters
 to all the Jews), and therefore we have reason to think he was the 
 penman of the whole book. It is the narrative of a plot laid against 
 the Jews to cut them all off, and which was wonderfully disappointed by 
 a concurrence of providences. The most compendious exposition of it 
 will be to read it deliberately all together at one time, for the 
 latter events expound the former and show what providence intended in 
 them. The name of God is not found in this book; but the apocryphal 
 addition to it (which is not in the Hebrew, nor was ever received by 
 the Jews into the can on), containing six chapters, begins thus, 
 <I>Then Mordecai said, God has done these things.</I> But, though the 
 name of God be not in it, the finger of God is, directing many minute 
 events for the bringing about of his people's deliverance. The 
 particulars are not only surprising and very entertaining, but edifying 
 and very encouraging to the faith and hope of God's people in the most 
 difficult and dangerous times. We cannot now expect such miracles to be 
 wrought for us as were for Israel when they were brought out of Egypt, 
 but we may expect that in such ways as God here took to defeat Haman's 
 plot he will still protect his people. We are told, 

 I. How Esther came to be queen and Mordecai to be great at court, who
 were to be the instruments of the intended deliverance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:1-2:23"><I>ch.</I> i., ii.</A>

 II. Upon what provocation, and by what arts, Haman the Amalekite
 obtained an order for the destruction of all the Jews,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:1-15"><I>ch.</I> iii.</A>

 III. The great distress the Jews, and their patriots especially, were
 in thereupon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+4:1-17"><I>ch.</I> iv.</A>

 IV. The defeating of Haman's particular plot against Mordecai's life,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:1-7:10"><I>ch.</I> v.-vii.</A>
 
 V. The defeating of his general plot against the Jews,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+8:1-17"><I>ch.</I> viii.</A>

 VI. The care that was taken to perpetuate the remembrance of this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:1-10:3"><I>ch.</I> ix., x.</A>

 The whole story confirms the Psalmist's observation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:12,13">Ps. xxxvii. 12, 13</A>),
 
 <I>The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his
 teeth. The Lord shall laugh at him; he sees that his day is 
 coming.</I></P>
