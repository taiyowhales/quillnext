 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter gives us a particular account what sort of progress the 
 several tribes of Israel made in the reducing of Canaan after the death 
 of Joshua. He did (as we say) break the neck of that great work, and 
 put it into such a posture that they might easily have perfected it in 
 due time, if they had not been wanting to themselves; what they did in 
 order hereunto, and wherein they came short, we are told. 

 I. The united tribes o Judah and Simeon did bravely. 

 1. God appointed Judah to begin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 2. Judah took Simeon to act in conjunction with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:3">ver. 3</A>.

 3. They succeeded in their enterprises against Bezek

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>),

 Jerusalem,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:8">ver. 8</A>.

 Hebron and Debir

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:9-15">ver. 9-15</A>),

 Hormah, Gaza, and other places, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:17-19">ver. 17-19</A>.

 4. Yet where there were chariots of iron their hearts failed them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:19">ver. 19</A>.

 Mention is made of the Kenites settling among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:16">ver. 16</A>.

 II. The other tribes, in comparison with these, acted a cowardly part.
 
 1. Benjamin failed,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:21">ver. 21</A>.

 2. The house of Joseph did well against Beth-el 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:22-26">ver. 22-26</A>),

 but in other places did not improve their advantages, nor Manasseh

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:27,28">ver. 27, 28</A>),
 
 nor Ephraim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:29">ver. 29</A>.

 3. Zebulun spared the Canaanites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:30">ver. 30</A>.

 4. Asher truckled worse than any of them to the Canaanites,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:31,32">ver. 31, 32</A>.

 5. Naphtali was kept out of the full possession of several of his
 cities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:33">ver. 33</A>.

 6. Dan was straitened by the Amorites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:34">ver. 34</A>.

 No account is given of Issachar, nor of the two tribes and a half on
 the other side Jordan.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the
 children of Israel asked the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, Who shall go up for us
 against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
 &nbsp; 2 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have
 delivered the land into his hand.
 &nbsp; 3 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into
 my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise
 will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
 &nbsp; 4 And Judah went up; and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> delivered the Canaanites and
 the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek
 ten thousand men.
 &nbsp; 5 And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against
 him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.
 &nbsp; 6 But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught
 him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
 &nbsp; 7 And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their
 thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered <I>their meat</I> under
 my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they
 brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.
 &nbsp; 8 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and
 had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set
 the city on fire.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The children of Israel consult the oracle of God for direction which
 of all the tribes should first attempt to clear their country of the 
 Canaanites, and to animate and encourage the rest. It was <I>after the 
 death of Joshua.</I> While he lived he directed them, and all the 
 tribes were obedient to him, but when he died he left no successor in 
 the same authority that he had; but the people must consult the 
 breast-plate of judgment, and thence receive the word of command; for 
 God himself, as he was their King, so he was the Lord of their hosts.
 The question they ask is, <I>Who shall go up first?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 By this time, we may suppose, they were so multiplied that the places
 they were in possession of began to be too strait for them, and they 
 must thrust out the enemy to make room; now they enquire who should 
 first take up arms. Whether each tribe was ambitious of being first, 
 and so strove for the honour of it, or whether each was afraid of being 
 first, and so strove to decline it, does not appear; but by common 
 consent the matter was referred to God himself, who is the fittest both 
 to dispose of honours and to cut out work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God appointed that Judah should go up first, and promised him 
 success 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>I have delivered the land into his hand,</I> to be possessed, and
 therefore will deliver the enemy into his hand, that keeps him out of 
 possession, to be destroyed." And why must Judah be first in this 
 undertaking? 

 1. Judah was the most numerous and powerful tribe, and therefore let
 Judah venture first. Note, God appoints service according to the 
 strength he has given. Those that are most able, from them most work is 
 expected. 

 2. Judah was first in dignity, and therefore must be first in duty. He
 it is whom <I>his brethren must praise,</I> and therefore he it is who 
 must lead in perilous services. Let the burden of honour and the
 burden of work go together. 

 3. Judah was first served; the lot came up for Judah first, and
 therefore Judah must first fight. 

 4. Judah was the tribe out of which our Lord was to spring: so that in 
 Judah, Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, went before them. Christ 
 engaged the powers of darkness first, and foiled them, which animates 
 us for our conflicts; and it is in him that we are <I>more than 
 conquerors.</I> Observe, The service and the success are put together: 
 "Judah shall go up; let him do his part, and then he shall find that 
 <I>I have delivered the land into his hand.</I>" His service will not 
 avail unless God give the success; but God will not give the success 
 unless he vigorously apply himself to the service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Judah hereupon prepares to go up, but courts his brother and 
 neighbour the tribe of Simeon (the lot of which tribe fell within that 
 of Judah and was assigned out of it) to join forces with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Observe here,

 1. That the strongest should not despise but desire the assistance even
 of those that are weaker. Judah was the most considerable of all the 
 tribes, and Simeon the least considerable, and yet Judah begs Simeon's 
 friendship, and prays an aid from him; the head cannot say to the foot, 
 <I>I have no need of thee,</I> for we are <I>members one of 
 another.</I> 

 2. Those that crave assistance must be ready to give assistance:
 <I>Come with me into my lot,</I> and then <I>I will go with thee into 
 thine.</I> It becomes Israelites to help one another against 
 Canaanites; and all Christians, even those of different tribes, should 
 strengthen one another's hands against the common interests of Satan's 
 kingdom. Those who thus help one another in love have reason to hope 
 that God will graciously help them both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The confederate forces of Judah and Simeon take the field: <I>Judah 
 went up</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and Simeon with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Caleb, it is probable, was commander-in-chief of this expedition; for
 who so fit as he who had both an old man's head and a young man's hand, 
 the experience of age and the vigour of youth?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+14:10,11">Josh. xiv. 10, 11</A>.

 It should seem too, by what follows

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>),

 that he was not yet in possession of his own allotment. It was happy
 for them that they had such a general as, according to his name, was 
 all heart. Some think that the Canaanites had got together into a body, 
 a formidable body, when Israel consulted who should go and <I>fight 
 against them,</I> and that they then began to stir when they heard of 
 the death of Joshua, whose name had been so dreadful to them; but, if 
 so, it proved they did but meddle to their own hurt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. God gave them great success. Whether they invaded the enemy, or the 
 enemy first gave them the alarm, <I>the Lord delivered them into their 
 hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Though the army of Judah was strong and bold, yet the victory is
 attributed to God: he <I>delivered the Canaanites into their hand;</I> 
 having given them authority, he here gives them ability to destroy 
 them--put it in their power, and so tried their obedience to his 
 command, which was <I>utterly to cut them off.</I> Bishop Patrick 
 observes upon this that we meet not with such religious expressions in 
 the heathen writers, concerning the success of their arms, as we have 
 here and elsewhere in this sacred history. I wish such pious 
 acknowledgments of the divine providence had not grown into disuse at 
 this time with many that are called Christians. Now,

 1. We are told how the army of the Canaanites was routed in the field,
 in or near Bezek, the place where they drew up, which afterwards Saul 
 made the place of a general rendezvous

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+11:8">1 Sam. xi. 8</A>);

 they slew 10,000 men, which blow, if followed, could not but be a very
 great weakening to those that were already brought so very low. 

 2. How their king was taken and mortified. His name was Adoni-bezek,
 which signifies, <I>lord of Bezek.</I> There have been those that 
 called their lands by <I>their own names</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:11">Ps. xlix. 11</A>),

 but here was one (and there has been many another) that called himself
 by his land's name. He was taken prisoner after the battle, and we are 
 here told how they used him; they cut off his thumbs, to disfit him for 
 fighting, and his great toes, that he might not be able to run away, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It had been barbarous thus to triumph over a man in misery, and that
 lay at their mercy, but that he was a devoted Canaanite, and one that 
 had in like manner abused others, which probably they had heard of.
 Josephus says, "They cut off his hands and his feet," probably 
 supposing those more likely to be mortal wounds than only the cutting 
 off of his thumbs and his great toes. But this indignity which they did 
 him extorted from him an acknowledgment of the righteousness of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Here observe,

 (1.) What a great man this Adoni-bezek had been, how great in the
 field, where armies fled before him, how great at home, where kings 
 were <I>set with the dogs of his flock;</I> and yet now himself a 
 prisoner, and reduced to the extremity of meanness and disgrace. See 
 how changeable this world is, and how slippery its high places are. Let 
 not the highest be proud, nor the strongest secure, for they know not 
 how low they may be brought before they die.

 (2.) What desolations he had made among his neighbours: he had wholly
 subdued seventy kings, to such a degree as to have them his prisoners; 
 he that was the chief person in a city was then called a <I>king,</I> 
 and the greatness of their title did but aggravate their disgrace, and 
 fired the pride of him that insulted over them. We cannot suppose that 
 Adoni-bezek had seventy of these petty princes at once his slaves; but 
 first and last, in the course of his reign, he had thus deposed and 
 abused so many, who perhaps were many of them kings of the same cities 
 that successively opposed him, and whom he thus treated to please his 
 own imperious barbarous fancy, and for a terror to others. It seems the 
 Canaanites had been wasted by civil wars, and those bloody ones, among 
 themselves, which would very much facilitate the conquest of them by 
 Israel. "Judah," says Dr. Lightfoot, "in conquering Adoni-bezek, did, 
 in effect, conquer seventy kings." 

 (3.) How justly he was treated as he had treated others. Thus the 
 righteous God sometimes, in his providence, makes the punishment to 
 answer the sin, and observes an equality in his judgments; the spoiler 
 shall be spoiled, and the <I>treacherous dealer dealt treacherously</I> 
 with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:1">Isa. xxxiii. 1</A>.

 And those that <I>showed no mercy</I> shall have <I>no mercy shown</I>
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:13">Jam. ii. 13</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:10,18:6">Rev. xiii. 10; xviii. 6</A>.

 (4.) How honestly he owned the righteousness of God herein: <I>As I
 have done, so God has requited me.</I> See the power of conscience, 
 when God by his judgments awakens it, how it brings sin to remembrance, 
 and subscribes to the justice of God. He that in his pride had set God 
 at defiance now yields to him, and reflects with as much regret upon 
 the kings under his table as ever he had looked upon them with pleasure 
 when he had them there. He seems to own that he was better dealt with 
 than he had dealt with his prisoners; for though the Israelites maimed 
 him (according to the law of retaliation, an <I>eye for an eye,</I> so 
 a thumb for a thumb), yet they did not put him <I>under the table</I> 
 to be fed with the crumbs there, because, though the other might well 
 be looked upon as an act of justice, this would have savoured more of 
 pride and haughtiness than did become an Israelite.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Particular notice is taken of the conquest of Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Our translators judge it spoken of here as done formerly in Joshua's
 time, and only repeated on occasion of Adoni-bezek's dying there, and 
 therefore read it, "they had fought against Jerusalem," and put this 
 verse in a parenthesis; but the original speaks of it as a thing now 
 done, and this seems most probable because it is said to be done by the 
 children of Judah in particular, not by all Israel in general, whom 
 Joshua commanded. Joshua indeed conquered and slew Adoni-zedek, king
 of Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:1-43">Josh. x.</A>),

 but we read not there of his taking the city; probably, while he was
 pursing his conquests elsewhere, this Adoni-bezek, a neighbouring 
 prince, got possession of it, whom Israel having conquered in the 
 field, the city fell into their hands, and they slew the inhabitants, 
 except those who retreated into the castle and held out there till 
 David's time, and they <I>set the city on fire,</I> in token of their 
 detestation of the idolatry wherewith it had been deeply infected, yet 
 probably not so utterly as to consume it, but to leave convenient 
 habitations for as many as they had to put into the possession of 
 it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight
 against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the
 south, and in the valley.
 &nbsp; 10 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron:
 (now the name of Hebron before <I>was</I> Kirjath-arba:) and they slew
 Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.
 &nbsp; 11 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir:
 and the name of Debir before <I>was</I> Kirjath-sepher:
 &nbsp; 12 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh
 it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
 &nbsp; 13 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took
 it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
 &nbsp; 14 And it came to pass, when she came <I>to him,</I> that she moved
 him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off <I>her</I>
 ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?
 &nbsp; 15 And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast
 given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb
 gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
 &nbsp; 16 And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went
 up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into
 the wilderness of Judah, which <I>lieth</I> in the south of Arad; and
 they went and dwelt among the people.
 &nbsp; 17 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the
 Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And
 the name of the city was called Hormah.
 &nbsp; 18 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon
 with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.
 &nbsp; 19 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was with Judah; and he drave out <I>the
 inhabitants of</I> the mountain; but could not drive out the
 inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
 &nbsp; 20 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he
 expelled thence the three sons of Anak.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further account of that glorious and successful campaign 
 which Judah and Simeon made. 

 1. The lot of Judah was pretty well cleared of the Canaanites, yet not
 thoroughly. Those that <I>dwelt in the mountain</I> (the mountains that 
 were round about Jerusalem) were driven out

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:9,19"><I>v.</I> 9, 19</A>),

 but those in the valley kept their ground against them, having
 <I>chariots of iron,</I> such as we read of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+17:16">Josh. xvii. 16</A>.

 Here the men of Judah failed, and thereby spoiled the influence which
 otherwise their example hitherto might have had on the rest of the 
 tribes, who followed them in this instance of their cowardice, rather 
 than in all the other instances of their courage. They had iron 
 chariots, and therefore it was thought not safe to attack them: but had 
 not Israel God on their side, <I>whose chariots are thousands of 
 angels</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:17">Ps. lxviii. 17</A>),

 before whom these iron chariots would be but as stubble to the fire?
 Had not God expressly promised by the oracle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 to give them success against the Canaanites in this very expedition,
 without excepting those that had iron chariots? Yet they suffered their 
 fears to prevail against their faith, they could not trust God under 
 any disadvantages, and therefore durst not face the iron chariots, but 
 meanly withdrew their forces, when with one bold stroke they might have 
 completed their victories; and it proved of pernicious consequence.
 They did run well, what hindered them? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:7">Gal. v. 7</A>.

 2. Caleb was put in possession of Hebron, which, though given him by
 Joshua ten or twelve years before (as Dr. Lightfoot computes), yet 
 being employed in public service, for the settling of the tribes, which 
 he preferred before his own private interests, it seems he did not till 
 now make himself master of; so well content was that good man to serve 
 others, while he left himself to be served last; few are like-minded, 
 for <I>all seek their own,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:20,21">Phil. ii. 20, 21</A>.

 Yet now the men of Judah all came in to his assistance for the reducing
 of Hebron

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 slew the sons of Anak, and put him in possession of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 They gave Hebron unto Caleb. And now Caleb, that he might return the
 kindness of his countrymen, is impatient to see Debir reduced and put 
 into the hands of the men of Judah, to expedite which he proffers his 
 daughter to the person that will undertake to command in the siege of 
 that important place,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 Othniel bravely undertakes it, and wins the town and the lady

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and by his wife's interest and management with her father gains a very
 good inheritance for himself and his family, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 We had this passage before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:16-19">Josh. xv. 16-19</A>,

 where it was largely explained and improved. 

 3. Simeon got ground of the Canaanites in his border, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 In the eastern part of Simeon's lot, they destroyed the Canaanites in
 Zephath, and called it <I>Hormah--destruction,</I> adding this to some 
 other devoted cities not far off, which they had some time ago, with 
 good reason, called by that name,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:2,3">Num. xxi. 2, 3</A>.

 And this perhaps was the complete performance of the vow they them made
 that they would utterly destroy these cities of the Canaanites in the 
 south. In the western part they took Gaza, Askelon, and Ekron, cities 
 of the Philistines; they gained present possession of the cities, but, 
 not destroying the inhabitants, the Philistines in process of time 
 recovered the cities, and proved inveterate enemies to the Israel of 
 God, and no better could come of doing their work by the halves. 

 4. The Kenites gained a settlement in the tribe of Judah, choosing it
 there rather than in any other tribe, because it was the strongest, and 
 there they hoped to be safe and quiet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 These were the posterity of Jethro, who either went with Israel when
 Moses invited them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:29">Num. x. 29</A>)

 or met them about the same place when they came up from their
 wanderings in the wilderness thirty-eight years after, and went with 
 them then to Canaan, Moses having promised them that they should fare 
 as Israel fared, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:32">Num. x. 32</A>.

 They had at first seated themselves in the <I>city of palm-trees,</I>
 that is, Jericho, a city which never was to be rebuilt, and therefore 
 the fitter for those who <I>dwelt in tents,</I> and did not mind 
 building. But afterwards they removed into the wilderness of Judah, 
 either out of their affection to that place, because solitary and 
 retired, or out of their affection to that tribe, which perhaps had 
 been in a particular manner kind to them. Yet we find the tent of Jael, 
 who was of that family, far north, in the lot of Naphtali, when Sisera 
 took shelter there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:17"><I>ch.</I> iv. 17</A>.

 This respect Israel showed them, to let them fix where they pleased,
 being a quiet people, who, wherever they were, were content with a 
 little. Those that molested none were molested by none. <I>Blessed are 
 the meek, for</I> thus <I>they shall inherit the earth.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites
 that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the
 children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.
 &nbsp; 22 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel:
 and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>was</I> with them.
 &nbsp; 23 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name
 of the city before <I>was</I> Luz.)
 &nbsp; 24 And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they
 said unto him, show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city,
 and we will show thee mercy.
 &nbsp; 25 And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they
 smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the
 man and all his family.
 &nbsp; 26 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a
 city, and called the name thereof Luz: which <I>is</I> the name
 thereof unto this day.
 &nbsp; 27 Neither did Manasseh drive out <I>the inhabitants of</I>
 Beth-shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the
 inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam
 and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but
 the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
 &nbsp; 28 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put
 the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.
 &nbsp; 29 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in
 Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
 &nbsp; 30 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor
 the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them,
 and became tributaries.
 &nbsp; 31 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor
 the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of
 Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:
 &nbsp; 32 But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the
 inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.
 &nbsp; 33 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of
 Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among
 the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the
 inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries
 unto them.
 &nbsp; 34 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the
 mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the
 valley:
 &nbsp; 35 But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and
 in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so
 that they became tributaries.
 &nbsp; 36 And the coast of the Amorites <I>was</I> from the going up to
 Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told upon what terms the rest of the tribes stood with the 
 Canaanites that remained.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Benjamin neglected to drive the Jebusites out of that part of the 
 city of Jerusalem which fell to their lot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Judah had set them a good example, and gained them great advantages by
 what they did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 but they did not follow the blow for want of resolution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The house of Joseph,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Bestirred themselves a little to get possession of Beth-el, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 That city is mentioned in the tribe of Benjamin,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:22">Josh. xviii. 22</A>.

 Yet it is spoken of there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 as a city in the borders of that tribe, and, it should seem, the line
 went through it, so that one half of it only belonged to Benjamin, the 
 other half to Ephraim; and perhaps the activity of the Ephraimites at 
 this time, to recover it from the Canaanites, secured it entirely to 
 them henceforward, or at least the greatest part of it, for afterwards 
 we find it so much under the power of the ten tribes (and Benjamin was 
 none of them) that Jeroboam set up one of his calves in it. In this 
 account of the expedition of the Ephraimites against Beth-el 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Their interest in the divine favour: <I>The Lord was with 
 them,</I> and would have been with the other tribes if they would have 
 exerted their strength. The Chaldee reads it here, as in many other 
 places, <I>The Word of the Lord was their helper,</I> namely, Christ 
 himself, the captain of the Lord's host, now that they acted 
 separately, as well as when they were all in one body.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The prudent measures they took to gain the city. They sent spies 
 to observe what part of the city was weakest, or which way they might 
 make their attack with most advantage, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 These spies got very good information from a man they providentially
 met with, who showed them a private way into the town, which was left 
 unguarded because, being not generally known, no danger was suspected 
 on that side. And here,

 [1.] He is not to be blamed for giving them this intelligence if he did
 it from a conviction that <I>the Lord was with them,</I> and that by 
 his donation the land was theirs of right, any more than Rahab was for 
 entertaining those whom she knew to be enemies of her country, but 
 friends of God. Nor, 

 [2.] Are those to be blamed who <I>showed him mercy,</I> gave him and
 his family not only their lives, but liberty to go wherever they 
 pleased: for one good turn requires another. But, it seems, he would 
 not join himself to the people of Israel, he feared them rather than 
 loved them, and therefore he removed after a colony of the Hittites, 
 which, it should seem, had gone into Arabia and settled there upon 
 Joshua's invasion of the country; with them this man chose to dwell, 
 and among them he built a city, a small one, we may suppose, such as 
 planters commonly build, and in the name of it preserved the ancient 
 name of his native city, <I>Luz, an almond-tree,</I> preferring this 
 before its new name, which carried religion in it, 
 <I>Bethel</I>--<I>the house of God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Their success. The spies brought or sent notice of the 
 intelligence they had gained to the army, which improved their 
 advantages, surprised the city, and put them all to the sword, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Besides this achievement, it seems, the children of Joseph did 
 nothing remarkable 

 (1.) Manasseh failed to drive out the Canaanites from several very
 considerable cities in their lot, and did not make any attempt upon 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 But the Canaanites, being in possession, were resolved not to quit it;
 they would dwell in that land, and Manasseh had not resolution enough 
 to offer to dispossess them; as if there was no meddling with them 
 unless they were willing to resign, which it was not to be expected 
 they ever would be. Only as Israel got strength they got ground, and 
 served themselves, both by their contributions and by their personal 
 services,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:28,35"><I>v.</I> 28, 35</A>.

 (2.) Ephraim likewise, though a powerful tribe, neglected Gezer a
 considerable city, and suffered the Canaanites to <I>dwell among 
 them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 which, some think, intimates their allowing them a quiet settlement,
 and indulging them with the privileges of an unconquered people, not so 
 much as making them tributaries.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Zebulun, perhaps inclining to the sea-trade, for it was foretold 
 that it should be a haven for ships, neglected to reduce Kitron and 
 Nahalol 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 and only made the inhabitants of those places tributaries to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Asher quitted itself worse than any of the tribes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>),

 not only in leaving more towns than any of them in the hands of the
 Canaanites, but in submitting to the Canaanites instead of making them 
 tributaries; for so the manner of expression intimates, that the 
 Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, as if the Canaanites were the 
 more numerous and the more powerful, would still be lords of the 
 country, and the Israelites must be only upon sufferance among 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Naphtali also permitted the Canaanites to live among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),
 
 only by degrees they got them so far under as to exact contributions
 from them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Dan was so far from extending his conquests where his lot lay that, 
 wanting spirit to make head against the Amorites, he was forced by them 
 to retire into the mountains and inhabit the cities there, but durst 
 not venture into the valley, where, it is probable, the chariots of 
 iron were, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Nay, and some of the cities in the mountains were kept against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 Thus were they straitened in their possessions, and forced to seek for
 more room at Laish, a great way off,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+18:1-31"><I>ch.</I> xviii. 1</A>,

 &c. In Jacob's blessing Judah is compared to a lion, Dan to a serpent;
 now observe how Judah with his lion-like courage prospered and 
 prevailed, but Dan with all his serpenting subtlety could get no 
 ground; craft and artful management do not always effect the wonders 
 they pretend to. What Dan came short of doing, it seems, his neighbours 
 the Ephraimites in part did for him; they put the Amorites under 
 tribute, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Upon the whole matter it appears that the people of Israel were 
 generally very careless both of their duty and interest in this thing; 
 they did not what they might have done to expel the Canaanites and make 
 room for themselves. And, 

 1. It was owing to their slothfulness and cowardice. They would not be
 at the pains to complete their conquests; like the sluggard, that 
 dreamed of a lion in the way, a lion in the streets, they fancied 
 insuperable difficulties, and frightened themselves with winds and 
 clouds from sowing and reaping. 

 2. It was owing to their covetousness; the Canaanites' labour and money 
 would do them more good (they thought) than their blood, and therefore 
 they were willing to let them live among them, that they might make a 
 hand of them.

 3. They had not that dread and detestation of idolatry which they ought
 to have had; they thought it a pity to put these Canaanites to the 
 sword, though the measure of their iniquity was full, thought it would 
 be no harm to let them live among them, and that they should be in no 
 danger from them.

 4. The same thing that kept their fathers forty years out of Canaan
 kept them now out of the full possession of it, and that was unbelief.
 Distrust of the power and promise of God lost them their advantages, 
 and ran them into a thousand mischiefs.</P>
