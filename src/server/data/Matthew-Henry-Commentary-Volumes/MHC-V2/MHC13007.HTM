 In this chapter we have some account of the genealogies, 
 
 I. Of Issachar,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. Of Benjamin,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:6-12">ver. 6-12</A>.

 III. Of Naphtali, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:13">ver. 13</A>.

 IV. Of Manasseh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:14-19">ver. 14-19</A>.

 V. Of Ephraim,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:20-29">ver. 20-29</A>.

 VI. Of Asher, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:30-40">ver. 30-40</A>.

 Here is no account either of Zebulun or Dan.  Why they only should be
 omitted we can assign no reason; only it is the disgrace of the tribe
 of Dan that idolatry began in that colony of the Danites which fixed in
 Laish, and called Dan, and there one of the golden calves was set up by
 Jeroboam.  Dan is omitted,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now the sons of Issachar <I>were,</I> Tola, and Puah, Jashub, and
 Shimron, four.
 &nbsp; 2  And the sons of Tola; Uzzi, and Rephaiah, and Jeriel, and
 Jahmai, and Jibsam, and Shemuel, heads of their father's house,
 <I>to wit,</I> of Tola: <I>they were</I> valiant men of might in their
 generations; whose number <I>was</I> in the days of David two and
 twenty thousand and six hundred.
 &nbsp; 3  And the sons of Uzzi; Izrahiah: and the sons of Izrahiah;
 Michael, and Obadiah, and Joel, Ishiah, five: all of them chief
 men.
 &nbsp; 4  And with them, by their generations, after the house of their
 fathers, <I>were</I> bands of soldiers for war, six and thirty
 thousand <I>men:</I> for they had many wives and sons.
 &nbsp; 5  And their brethren among all the families of Issachar <I>were</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a short view given us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the tribe of Issachar, whom Jacob had compared to a <I>strong 
 ass, couching between two burdens</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:14">Gen. xlix. 14</A>),

 an industrious tribe, that minded their country business very closely
 and <I>rejoiced in their tents,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:18">Deut. xxxiii. 18</A>.

 And here it appears, 

 1. That they were a numerous tribe; for they had many wives. So
 fruitful their country was that they saw no danger of over-stocking the 
 pasture, and so ingenious the people were that they could find work for 
 all hands. Let no people complain of their numbers, provided they 
 suffer none to be idle. 

 2. That they were a valiant tribe, <I>men of might</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:2,5"><I>v.</I> 2, 5</A>),

 <I>chief men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Those that were inured to labour and business were of all men the
 fittest to serve their country when there was occasion, The number of 
 the respective families, as taken in the days of David, is here set 
 down, amounting in the whole to above 145,000 men fit for war. The 
 account, some think, was taken when Joab numbered the people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:1-25">2 Sam. xxiv.</A>

 But I rather think it refers to some other computation that was made,
 perhaps among themselves, because it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:24">1 Chron. xxvii. 24</A>)

 that that account was not inserted in the chronicles of king David, it
 having offended God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the tribe of Benjamin. Some account is here given of this tribe, 
 but much larger in the next chapter. The militia of this tribe scarcely 
 reached to 60,000; but they are said to be <I>mighty men of valour,</I> 
 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:7,9,11"><I>v.</I> 7, 9, 11</A>.

 <I>Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:27">Gen. xlix. 27</A>.

 It was the honour of this tribe that it produced Saul the first king,
 and more its honour that it adhered to the rightful kings of the house 
 of David when the other tribes revolted. Here is mention

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 of Hushim the sons of Aher. The sons of Dan are said to be
 <I>Hushim</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:23">Gen. xlvi. 23</A>),

 and therefore some read Aher appellatively, <I>Hushim</I>--the <I>sons
 of another</I> (that is, another of Jacob's sons) or the sons of a 
 stranger, which Israelites should not be, but such the Danites were 
 when they set up Micah's graven and molten image among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Of the tribe of Naphtali, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The first fathers only of that tribe are named, the very same that we
 shall find, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+46:24">Gen. xlvi. 24</A>,

 only that <I>Shillem</I> there is <I>Shallum</I> here. None of their
 descendents are named, perhaps because their genealogies were lost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Of the tribe of Manasseh, that part of it which was seated within 
 Jordan; for of the other part we had some account before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+5:23-26"><I>ch.</I> v. 23</A>,

 &c.  Of this tribe observe, 

 1. That one of them married an Aramitess, that is, a Syrian, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 This was during their bondage in Egypt, so early did they begin to
 mingle with the nations. 

 2. That, though the father married a Syrian, Machir, the son of that
 marriage, perhaps seeing the inconvenience of it in his father's house, 
 took to wife a daughter of Benjamin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It is good for the children to take warning by their father's mistakes
 and not stumble at the same stone.

 3. Here is mention of Bedan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 who perhaps is the same with that Bedan who is mentioned as one of
 Israel's deliverers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+12:11">1 Sam. xii. 11</A>.

 Jair perhaps, who was of Manasseh 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:3">Judg. x. 3</A>),
 
 was the man.</P>

 &nbsp; 38  And the sons of Jether; Jephunneh, and Pispah, and Ara.
 &nbsp; 39  And the sons of Ulla; Arah, and Haniel, and Rezia.
 &nbsp; 40  All these <I>were</I> the children of Asher, heads of <I>their</I>
 father's house, choice <I>and</I> mighty men of valour, chief of the
 princes. And the number throughout the genealogy of them that
 were apt to the war <I>and</I> to battle <I>was</I> twenty and six thousand
 men.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the tribe of Ephraim. Great things we read of that tribe when it 
 came to maturity. Here we have an account of the disasters of its 
 infancy, while it was in Egypt as it should seem; for Ephraim himself 
 was alive when those things were done, which yet is hard to imagine if 
 it were, as is here computed, seven generations off. Therefore I am apt 
 to think that either it was another Ephraim or that those who were 
 slain were the immediate sons of that Ephraim that was the son of 
 Joseph. In this passage, which is related here only, we have, 

 1. The great breach that was made upon the family of Ephraim. The men
 of Gath, Philistines, giants, slew many of the sons of that family, 
 <I>because they came down to take away their cattle,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 It is uncertain who were the aggressors here. Some make the men of Gath
 the aggressors, men <I>born in the land of Egypt,</I> but now resident 
 in Gath, supposing that they came down into the land of Goshen, to 
 drive away the Ephraimites' cattle, and slew the owners, because they 
 stood up in the defence of them. Many a man's life has been exposed and 
 betrayed by his wealth; so far is it from being a strong city. Others 
 think that the Ephraimites made a descent upon the men of Gath to 
 plunder them, presuming that the time had come when they should be put 
 in possession of Canaan; but they paid dearly for their rashness and 
 precipitation.  Those that will not wait God's time cannot expect God's 
 blessing. I rather think that the men of Gath came down upon the 
 Ephraimites, because the Israelites in Egypt were shepherds, not 
 soldiers, abounded in cattle of their own, and therefore were not 
 likely to venture their lives for their neighbours' cattle: and the 
 words may be read, <I>The men of Gath slew them, for they came down to 
 take away their cattle.</I> Zabad the son of Ephraim, and Shuthelah, 
 and Ezer, and Elead (his grandchildren), were, as Dr. Lightfoot thinks, 
 the men that were slain. Jacob had foretold that the seed of Ephraim 
 should become a <I>multitude of nations</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:19">Gen. xlviii. 19</A>),

 and yet that plant is thus nipped in the bud. God's providences often
 seem to contradict his promises; but, when they do so, they really 
 magnify the promise, and make the performance of it, notwithstanding, 
 so much more illustrious.  The Ephraimites were the posterity of 
 Joseph, and yet his power could not protect them, though some think he 
 was yet living. The sword devours one as well as another. 

 2. The great grief which oppressed the father of the family hereupon:
 <I>Ephraim mourned many days.</I> Nothing brings the aged to the grave 
 with more sorrow than their following the young that descend from them 
 to the grave first, especially if in blood. It is often the burden of 
 those that live to be old that they see those go before them of whom 
 they said, <I>These same shall comfort us.</I> It was a brotherly 
 friendly office which his brethren did, when <I>they came to comfort 
 him</I> under this great affliction, to express their sympathy with him 
 and concern for him, and to suggest that to him which would support and 
 quiet him under this sad providence. Probably they reminded him of the 
 promise of increase which Jacob had blessed him when he laid his right 
 hand upon his head.  Although his house was not so with God as he 
 hoped, but a house of mourning, a shattered family, yet that promise 
 was sure,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:5">2 Sam. xxiii. 5</A>.

 3.  The repair of this breach, in some measure, by addition of another
 son to his family in his old age 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 like Seth, <I>another seed instead of that of Abel whom Cain slew,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:25">Gen. iv. 25</A>.

 When God thus restores comfort to his mourners, <I>makes glad according
 to the days wherein he afflicted,</I> setting the mercies over against 
 the crosses, we ought therein to take notice of the kindness and 
 tenderness of divine Providence; it is as if <I>it repented God 
 concerning his servants,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:13,15">Ps. xc. 13, 15</A>.

 Yet joy that a man was born into his family could not make him forget
 his grief; for he gives a melancholy name to his son, <I>Beriah--in 
 trouble,</I> for he was born when the family was in mourning, when 
 <I>it went evil with his house.</I> It is good to have in remembrance 
 the affliction and the misery, the wormwood and the gall, that our 
 souls may be <I>humbled within us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:19,20">Lam. iii. 19, 20</A>.

 What name more proper for <I>man that is born of a woman</I> than
 <I>Beriah,</I> because born into a troublesome world? It is added, as a 
 further honour to the house of Ephraim,

 (1.) That a daughter of that tribe, <I>Sherah</I> by name, at the time
 of Israel's setting in Canaan, built some cities, either at her own 
 charge or by her own care; one of them bore her name, 
 <I>Uzzen-sherah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 A virtuous woman may be as great an honour and blessing to a family as
 a mighty man.

 (2.) That a son of that tribe was employed in the conquest of Canaan,
 <I>Joshua the son of Nun,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 In this also the breach made on Ephraim's family was further repaired;
 and perhaps the resentment of this injury formerly done by the 
 Canaanites to the Ephraimites might make him more vigorous in the 
 war.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the tribe of Asher. Some men of note of that tribe are here 
 named. Their militia was not numerous in comparison with some other 
 tribes, only 26,000 men in all; but their princes were <I>choice and
 mighty men of valour, chief of the princes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+7:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>),

 and perhaps it was their wisdom that they coveted not to make their
 trained bands numerous, but rather to have a few, and those apt to the 
 war and serviceable men.</P>
