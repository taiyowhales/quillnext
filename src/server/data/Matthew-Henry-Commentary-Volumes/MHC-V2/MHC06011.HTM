 This chapter continues and concludes the history of the conquest of
 Canaan; of the reduction of the southern parts we had an account in the
 foregoing chapter, after which we may suppose Joshua allowed his forces
 some breathing-time; now here we have the story of the war in the
 north, and the happy success of that war.

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard
 <I>those things,</I> that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the
 king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,
 &nbsp; 2 And to the kings that <I>were</I> on the north of the mountains,
 and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in
 the borders of Dor on the west,
 &nbsp; 3 <I>And to</I> the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and <I>to</I>
 the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite
 in the mountains, and <I>to</I> the Hivite under Hermon in the land of
 Mizpeh.
 &nbsp; 4 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much
 people, even as the sand that <I>is</I> upon the sea shore in
 multitude, with horses and chariots very many.
 &nbsp; 5 And when all these kings were met together, they came and
 pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
 &nbsp; 6 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them:
 for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain
 before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their
 chariots with fire.
 &nbsp; 7 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against
 them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.
 &nbsp; 8 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> delivered them into the hand of Israel, who
 smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto
 Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they
 smote them, until they left them none remaining.
 &nbsp; 9 And Joshua did unto them as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> bade him: he houghed
 their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here entering upon the story of another campaign that Joshua 
 made, and it was a glorious one, no less illustrious than the former in 
 the success of it, though in respect of miracles it was inferior to it 
 in glory. The wonders God then wrought for them were to animate and 
 encourage them to act vigorously themselves. Thus the war carried on by 
 the preaching of the gospel against Satan's kingdom was at first 
 forwarded by miracles; but, the war being by them sufficiently proved 
 to be of God, the managers of it are now left to the ordinary 
 assistance of divine grace in the use of the sword of the Spirit, and 
 must not expect hail-stones nor the standing still of the sun. In this 
 story we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The Canaanites taking the field against Israel. They were the 
 aggressors, God hardening their hearts to begin the war, that Israel 
 might be justified beyond exception in destroying them. Joshua and all 
 Israel had returned to the camp at Gilgal, and perhaps these kings knew 
 no other than that they intended to sit down content with the conquest 
 they had already made, and yet they prepare war against them. Note, 
 Sinners bring ruin upon their own heads, so that <I>God will be 
 justified when he speaks,</I> and they alone shall bear the blame for 
 ever. Judah had now <I>couched as a lion gone up from the prey;</I> if 
 the northern kings rouse him up, it is at their peril, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:9">Gen. xlix. 9</A>.
 
 Now,
 
 1. Several nations joined in this confederacy, some <I>in the
 mountains</I> and some <I>in the plains,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Canaanites from east and west, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 of different constitutions and divided interests among themselves, and 
 yet they here unite against Israel as against a common enemy.  Thus are 
 <I>the children of this world</I> more unanimous, and therein <I>wiser, 
 than the children of light.</I> The oneness of the church's enemies 
 should shame the church's friends out of their discords and divisions, 
 and engage them to be one. 

 2. The head of this confederacy was <I>Jabin king of Hazor</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 as Adoni-zedec was of the former; it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 Hazor had been the <I>head of all those kingdoms,</I> which could not
 have revolted without occasioning ill-will; but this was forgotten and 
 laid aside upon this occasion, by consent of parties,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:12">Luke xxiii. 12</A>.

 When they had all drawn up their forces together, every kingdom
 bringing in its quota, they were a very great army, much greater than 
 the former, <I>as the sand on the sea shore in multitude,</I> and upon 
 this account much stronger and more formidable, that they had horses 
 and chariots very many, which we do not find the southern kings had; 
 hereby they had a great advantage against Israel, for their army 
 consisted only of foot, and they never brought horses nor chariots into 
 the field. Josephus tells us that the army of the Canaanites consisted 
 of 300,000 foot, 10,000 horses, and 20,000 chariots. <I>Many there be 
 that rise up</I> against God's Israel; doubtless their numbers made 
 them very confident of success, but it proved that so much the greater 
 slaughter was made of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The encouragement God gave to Joshua to give them the meeting, even 
 upon the ground of their own choosing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Be not afraid because of them.</I> Joshua was remarkable for his
 courage--it was his master grace, and yet it seems he had need to be 
 again and again cautioned not to be afraid. Fresh dangers and 
 difficulties make it necessary to fetch in fresh supports and comforts 
 from the word of God, which we have always nigh unto us, to be made use 
 of in every time of need. Those that have God on their side need not be 
 disturbed at the number and power of their enemies; <I>more are those 
 that are with us than those that are against us;</I> those have the 
 hosts of the Lord that have the Lord of hosts engaged for them. For his 
 encouragement, 

 1.  God assures him of success, and fixes the hour: <I>To-morrow about
 this time,</I> when an engagement (it is probable) was expected and 
 designed on both sides, <I>I will deliver them up slain.</I> Though 
 they were to be slain by the sword of Israel, yet it is spoken of as 
 God's work, that he would deliver them up. 

 2. He appoints him to <I>hough their horses, hamstring</I> them,
 <I>lame</I> them, and <I>burn their chariots,</I> not only that Israel 
 might not use them hereafter, but that they might not fear them now, 
 their God designing this contempt to be put upon them. Let Israel look 
 upon their chariots but as rotten wood designed for the fire, and their 
 horses of war as disabled things, scarcely good enough for the cart. 
 This encouragement which God here gave to Joshua no doubt he 
 communicated to the people, who perhaps were under some apprehensions 
 of danger from this vast army, notwithstanding the experience they had 
 had of God's power engaged for them. And the wisdom and goodness of God 
 are to be observed,

 (1.) In infatuating the counsels of the enemy, that all the kings of
 Canaan, who were not dispersed at such a distance from each other but 
 that they might have got all together in a body, did not at first 
 confederate against Israel, but were divided in to the southern and 
 northern combination, and so became the less formidable. And,

 (2.) In preparing his people to encounter the greater force, by 
 breaking the less. They first engage with five kings together, and now 
 with many more. God proportions our trials to our strength and our 
 strength to our trials.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Joshua's march against these confederate forces, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He <I>came upon them suddenly,</I> and surprised them in their
 quarters. He made this haste,

 1. That he might put them into the greater confusion, by giving them an
 alarm, when they little thought he was near them. 

 2.  That he might be sure not to come short of the honour God had
 fixed, to give him the meeting at the enemies' camp, <I>to-morrow about 
 this time.</I> It is fit we should keep time with God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His success, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He obtained the honour and advantage of a complete victory; he smote
 them and chased them, in the several ways they took in their flight; 
 some fled towards Zidon, which lay to the northwest, others towards 
 Mizpeh, eastward, but the parties Joshua sent out pursued them each 
 way. So <I>the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel;</I> they 
 would not deliver themselves into the hands of Israel to be made 
 proselytes and tributaries, and so offered up to God's grace

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:16">Rom. xv. 16</A>),

 and therefore God delivered them into their hands to be made sacrifices
 to his justice; for God will be honoured by us or upon us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. His obedience to the orders given him, in destroying the horses and 
 chariots 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 which was an instance, 

 1. Of his subjection to the divine will, as one under authority, that
 must do as he is bidden. 

 2.  Of his self-denial, and crossing his own genius and inclination in
 compliance with God's command. 

 3. Of his confidence in the power of God engaged for Israel, which
 enabled them to despise the chariots and horses which others trusted 
 in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:7,33:17">Ps. xx. 7; xxxiii. 17</A>.

 4. Of his care to keep up in the people the like confidence in God, by
 taking that from them which they would be tempted to trust too much to. 
 This was <I>cutting of a right hand.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and
 smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was
 the head of all those kingdoms.
 &nbsp; 11 And they smote all the souls that <I>were</I> therein with the
 edge of the sword, utterly destroying <I>them:</I> there was not any
 left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.
 &nbsp; 12 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of
 them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword,
 <I>and</I> he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 commanded.
 &nbsp; 13 But <I>as for</I> the cities that stood still in their strength,
 Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; <I>that</I> did Joshua
 burn.
 &nbsp; 14 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the
 children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man
 they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed
 them, neither left they any to breathe.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the same improvement made of this victory as was made of 
 that in the foregoing chapter. 

 1. The destruction of Hazor is particularly recorded, because in it,
 and by the king thereof, this daring design against Israel was laid,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 The king of Hazor, it seems, escaped with his life out of the battle,
 and thought himself safe when he had got back into his own city, and 
 Joshua had gone in pursuit of the scattered troops another way. But it 
 proved that that which he thought would be for his welfare was his 
 trap; in it <I>he was taken as in an evil net;</I> there he was slain, 
 and his city, for his sake, burned. Yet we find that the remains of it 
 being not well looked after by Israel the Canaanites rebuilt it, and 
 settled there under another king of the same name,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:2">Judg. iv. 2</A>.

 2. The rest of the cities of that part of the country are spoken of
 only in general, that Joshua got them all into his hands, but did not 
 burn them as he did Hazor, for Israel was to dwell in <I>great and 
 goodly cities which they builded not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:10">Deut. vi. 10</A>)

 and in these among the rest. And here we find Israel rolling in blood
 and treasure. 

 (1.) In the blood of their enemies; <I>they smote all the souls</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 <I>neither left they any to breathe</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 that there might be none to infect them with the abominations of
 Canaan, and none to disturb them in the possession of it. The children 
 were cut off, lest they should afterwards lay claim to any part of this 
 land in the right of their parents.

 (2.) In the wealth of their enemies. The spoil, and the cattle, they
 <I>took for a prey to themselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:14"><I>v.</I>  14</A>.

 As they were enriched with the spoil of their oppressors when they came
 out of Egypt, wherewith to defray the charges of their apprenticeship 
 in the wilderness, so they were now enriched with the spoil of their 
 enemies for a stock wherewith to set up in the land of Canaan. Thus is 
 the wealth of the sinner laid up for the just.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15 As the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses
 command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all
 that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 16 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south
 country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the
 plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;
 &nbsp; 17 <I>Even</I> from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even
 unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all
 their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.
 &nbsp; 18 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
 &nbsp; 19 There was not a city that made peace with the children of
 Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all <I>other</I>
 they took in battle.
 &nbsp; 20 For it was of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to harden their hearts, that they
 should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them
 utterly, <I>and</I> that they might have no favour, but that he might
 destroy them, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 21 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from
 the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all
 the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel:
 Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.
 &nbsp; 22 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the
 children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there
 remained.
 &nbsp; 23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto
 Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land
 rested from war.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the conclusion of this whole matter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A short account is here given of what was done in four things:--

 1.  The obstinacy of the Canaanites in their opposition to the 
 Israelites.  It was strange that though it appeared so manifestly that 
 God fought for Israel, and in every engagement the Canaanites had the 
 worst of it, yet they stood it out to the last; not one city made peace 
 with Israel, but the Gibeonites only, who understood the things that 
 belonged to their peace better than their neighbours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 It is intimated that other cities might have made as good terms for
 themselves, without ragged clothes and clouted shoes, if they would 
 have humbled themselves, but they never so much as <I>desired 
 conditions of peace.</I> We here are told whence this unaccountable 
 infatuation came: <I>It was of the Lord to harden their hearts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 As Pharaoh's heart was hardened by his own pride and wilfulness first,
 and afterwards by the righteous judgment of God, to his destruction, so 
 were the hearts of these Canaanites. To punish them for all their other 
 follies, God left them to this, to make those their enemies whom they 
 might have made their friends. This was it that ruined them: they 
 <I>came against Israel in battle,</I> and gave the first blow, and 
 therefore <I>might have no favour</I> shown them. Those know not what 
 they do who give the provocation to divine justice, or the authorized 
 instruments of it. <I>Are we stronger than God?</I> Observe here, That 
 hardness of heart is the ruin of sinners. Those that are stupid and 
 secure, and heedless of divine warnings, are already marked for 
 destruction. What hope is there of those concerning whom God has said, 
 <I>Go, make their hearts fat?</I>

 2. The constancy of the Israelites in prosecuting this war

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Joshua made war a long time;</I> some reckon it five years, others
 seven, that were spent in subduing this land: so long God would train 
 up Israel to war, and give them repeated instances of his power and 
 goodness in every new victory that he gave them. 

 3. The conquest of the Anakim at last,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 Either this was done as they met with them where they were dispersed,
 as some think, or rather it should seem the Anakim had retired to their 
 fastnesses, and so were hunted out and cut off at last, after all the 
 rest of Israel's enemies.  The mountains of Judah and Israel were the 
 habitations of those mountains of men; but not their height, nor the 
 strength of their caves, nor the difficulty of the passes to them, 
 could secure, no, not these mighty men, from the sword of Joshua. The 
 cutting off of the sons of Anak is particularly mentioned because these 
 had been such a terror to the spies forty years before, and their bulk 
 and strength had been thought an insuperable difficulty in the way of 
 the reducing of Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:28,33">Num. xiii. 28, 33</A>.

 Even that opposition which seemed invincible was got over. Never let
 the sons of Anak be a terror to the Israel of God, for even their day 
 will come to fall. Giants are dwarfs to Omnipotence; yet this struggle 
 with the Anakim was reserved for the latter end of the war, when the 
 Israelites had become more expert in the arts of war, and had had more 
 experience of the power and goodness of God. Note, God sometimes 
 reserves the sharpest trials of his people by affliction and temptation 
 for the latter end of their days.  Therefore <I>let not him that girds 
 on the harness boast as he that puts it off.</I> Death, that tremendous 
 son of Anak, is the last enemy that is to be encountered; but it is 
 <I>to be destroyed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:26">1 Cor. xv. 26</A>.

 Thanks be to God, who will give us the victory. 

 4. The end and issue of this long war. The Canaanites were rooted out,
 not perfectly (as we shall find after in the book of Judges), but in a 
 good measure; they were not able to make any head either,

 (1.) So as to keep the Israelites out of possession of the land:
 <I>Joshua took all that land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 And we may suppose the people dispersed themselves and their families
 into the countries they had conquered, at least those that lay nearest 
 to the head-quarters at Gilgal, until an orderly distribution should be 
 made by lot, that every man might know his own.  Or,

 (2.) So as to keep them in action, or give them any molestation
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>The land rested from war.</I> It ended not in a peace with the
 Canaanites (that was forbidden), but in a peace from them. There is a 
 rest, a rest from war, remaining for the people of God, into which they 
 shall enter when their warfare is accomplished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That which was now done is here compared with that which had been 
 said to Moses. God's word and his works, if viewed and considered 
 together, will mutually illustrate each other. It is here observed in 
 the close, 

 1. That all the precepts God had given to Moses relating to the 
 conquest of Canaan were obeyed on the people's part, at least while 
 Joshua lived. See how solemnly this is remarked

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>As the Lord commanded Moses his servant,</I> by whose hand the law
 was given, <I>so did Moses command Joshua,</I> for Moses was faithful, 
 as a law-giver, to him that appointed him; he did his part, and then he 
 died: but were the commands of Moses observed when he was in his grave? 
 Yes, they were: <I>So did Joshua,</I> who was, in his place, as 
 faithful as Moses in his. <I>He left nothing undone</I> (Heb. he 
 <I>removed nothing) of all that the Lord commanded Moses.</I> Those 
 that leave their duty undone do what they can to remove or make void 
 the command of God, by which they are bound to do it; but Joshua, by 
 performing the precept, <I>confirmed</I> it, as the expression is,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:26">Deut. xxvii. 26</A>.

 Joshua was himself a great commander, and yet nothing was more his
 praise than his obedience. Those that rule others at their will must 
 themselves be ruled by the divine will; then their power is indeed 
 their honour, and not otherwise. The pious obedience for which Joshua 
 is here commended respects especially the command to destroy the 
 Canaanites, and to <I>break down their altars and burn their 
 images,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:2-5,Ex+23"24,34:13">Deut. vii. 2-5; 
 Exod. xxiii. 24; xxxiv. 13</A>.

 Joshua, in his zeal for the Lord of hosts, spared neither the idols nor
 the idolaters. Saul's disobedience, or rather his partial obedience, to 
 the command of God, for the utter destruction of the Amalekites, cost 
 him his kingdom. It should seem Joshua himself gives this account of 
 his most careful and punctual observance of his orders in the execution 
 of his commission, that in all respects he had done as Moses commanded 
 him; and then it intimates that he had more pleasure and satisfaction 
 in reflecting upon his obedience to the commands of God in all this 
 war, and valued himself more upon that, than upon all the gains and 
 triumphs with which he was enriched and advanced. 

 2. That all the promises God had given to Moses relating to this
 conquest were accomplished <I>on his part,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Joshua <I>took the whole land,</I> conquered it, and took possession of
 it, <I>according to all that the Lord said unto Moses.</I> God had 
 promised to drive out the nations before them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:2,34:11">Exod. xxxiii. 2; xxxiv. 11</A>),
 
 and to <I>bring them down,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:3">Deut. ix. 3</A>.

 And now it was done. There failed not one word of the promise. Our
 successes and enjoyments are then doubly sweet and comfortable to us 
 when we see them flowing to us from the promise (this is <I>according 
 to what the Lord said</I>), as our obedience is then acceptable to God
 when it has an eye to the precept. And, if we make conscience of our 
 duty, we need not question the performance of the promise.</P>
