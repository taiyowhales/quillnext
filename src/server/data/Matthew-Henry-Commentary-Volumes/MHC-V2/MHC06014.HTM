 Here is, 

 I. The general method that was taken in dividing the land,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+14:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.
 
 II. The demand Caleb made of Hebron, as his by promise, and
 therefore not to be put into the lot with the rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+14:6-12">ver. 6-12</A>.

 And Joshua's grant of that demand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+14:13-15">ver. 13-15</A>.

 This was done at Gilgal, which was as yet their head-quarters.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And these <I>are the countries</I> which the children of Israel
 inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and
 Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes
 of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.
 &nbsp; 2 By lot <I>was</I> their inheritance, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded by the
 hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and <I>for</I> the half tribe.
 &nbsp; 3 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and a half
 tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none
 inheritance among them.
 &nbsp; 4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and
 Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the
 land, save cities to dwell <I>in,</I> with their suburbs for their
 cattle and for their substance.
 &nbsp; 5 As the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did,
 and they divided the land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The historian, having in the foregoing chapter given an account of the 
 disposal of the countries on the other side Jordan, now comes to tell 
 us what they did with the countries in the land of Canaan. They were 
 not conquered to be left desert, <I>a habitation for dragons, and a 
 court for owls,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:13">Isa. xxxiv. 13</A>.

 No, the Israelites that had hitherto been closely encamped in a body,
 and the greatest part of them such as never knew any other way of 
 living, must now disperse themselves to replenish these new conquests. 
 It is said of the earth, <I>God created it not in vain; he formed it to 
 be inhabited,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:18">Isa. xlv. 18</A>.

 Canaan would have been subdued in vain if it had not been inhabited.
 Yet every man might not go and settle where he pleased, but as there 
 seems to have been in the days of Peleg an orderly and regular division 
 of the habitable earth among the sons of Noah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:25,32">Gen. x. 25, 32</A>),

 so there was now such a division of the land of Canaan among the sons
 of Jacob. God had given Moses directions how this distribution should 
 be made, and those directions are here punctually observed. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:53-56">Num. xxvi. 53</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The managers of this great affair were Joshua the chief magistrate, 
 Eleazar the chief priest, and ten princes, one of each of the tribes 
 that were now to have their inheritance, whom God himself had nominated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+34:17-29">Num. xxxiv. 17</A>,

 &c.) some years before; and, it should seem, they were all
 now in being, and attended this service, that every tribe, having a 
 representative of its own, might be satisfied that there was fair 
 dealing, and might the more contentedly sit down by its lot.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The tribes among whom this dividend was to be made were nine and a 
 half. 
 
 1. Not the two and a half that were already seated
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 though perhaps now that they saw what a good land Canaan was, and how
 effectually it was subdued, they might some of them repent their 
 choice, and wish they had now been to have their lot with their 
 brethren, upon which condition they would gladly have given up what 
 they had on the other side Jordan; but it could not be admitted: they 
 had made their election without power of revocation, and so must their 
 doom be; they themselves have decided it, and they must adhere to their 
 choice. 

 2. Not the tribe of Levi; this was to be otherwise provided for. God 
 had distinguished them from, and dignified them above, the other 
 tribes, and they must not now mingle themselves with them, nor cast in 
 their lot among them, for this would entangle them in the affairs of 
 this life, which would not consist with a due attendance on their 
 sacred function. But, 

 3. Joseph made two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, pursuant to Jacob's
 adoption of Joseph's two sons, and so the number of the tribes was kept 
 up to twelve, though Levi was taken out, which is intimated here

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The children of Joseph were two tribes, therefore they gave no part
 to Levi,</I> they being twelve without them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The rule by which they went was the lot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 <I>The disposal</I> of that is <I>of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:33">Prov. xvi. 33</A>.

 It was here used in an affair of weight, and which could not otherwise
 be accommodated to universal satisfaction, and it was used in a solemn 
 religious manner as an appeal to God, by consent of parties. In 
 dividing by lot,

 1. They referred themselves to God, and to his wisdom and sovereignty,
 believing him fitter to determine for them than they for themselves.  
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:4">Ps. xlvii. 4</A>,

 <I>He shall choose our inheritance for us.</I> 

 2. They professed a willingness to abide by the determination of it;
 for every man must take what is his lot, and make the best of it. In 
 allusion to this we are said to <I>obtain an inheritance in Christ</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:11">Eph. i. 11</A>),

 <B><I>eklerothemen</I></B>--<I>we have obtained it by lot,</I> so the
 word signified; for it is obtained by a divine designation. Christ, our 
 Joshua, gives eternal life to <I>as many as were given him,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and
 Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou
 knowest the thing that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Moses the man of God
 concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.
 &nbsp; 7 Forty years old <I>was</I> I when Moses the servant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him
 word again as <I>it was</I> in mine heart.
 &nbsp; 8 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart
 of the people melt: but I wholly followed the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God.
 &nbsp; 9 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon
 thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy
 children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 my God.
 &nbsp; 10 And now, behold, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath kept me alive, as he said,
 these forty and five years, even since the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake this word
 unto Moses, while <I>the children of</I> Israel wandered in the
 wilderness: and now, lo, I <I>am</I> this day fourscore and five years
 old.
 &nbsp; 11 As yet I <I>am as</I> strong this day as <I>I was</I> in the day that
 Moses sent me: as my strength <I>was</I> then, even so <I>is</I> my
 strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.
 &nbsp; 12 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> spake
 in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims <I>were</I>
 there, and <I>that</I> the cities <I>were</I> great <I>and</I> fenced: if so be
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>will be</I> with me, then I shall be able to drive them
 out, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said.
 &nbsp; 13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of
 Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.
 &nbsp; 14 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
 Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly
 followed the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel.
 &nbsp; 15 And the name of Hebron before <I>was</I> Kirjatharba; <I>which Arba
 was</I> a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from
 war.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Before the lot was cast into the lap for the determining of the 
 portions of the respective tribes, the particular portion of Caleb was 
 assigned to him. He was now, except Joshua, not only the oldest man in 
 all Israel, but was twenty years older than any of them, for all that 
 were above twenty years old when he was forty were dead in the 
 wilderness; it was fit therefore that this phoenix of his age should 
 have some particular marks of honour put upon him in the dividing of 
 the land.  Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Caleb here presents his petition, or rather makes his demand, to 
 have Hebron given him for a possession (<I>this mountain</I> he calls 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and not to have that put into the lot with the other parts of the
 country. To justify his demand, he shows that God had long since, by 
 Moses, promised him <I>that very mountain;</I> so that God's mind being 
 already made known in this matter it would be a vain and needless thing 
 to consult it any further by casting lots, by which we are to appeal to 
 God in those cases only which cannot otherwise be decided, not in those 
 which, like this, are already determined. Caleb is here called the 
 <I>Kenezite,</I> some think from some remarkable victory obtained by 
 him over the Kenezites, as the Romans gave their great generals titles 
 from the countries they conquered, as Africanus, Germanicus, &c.  
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To enforce his petition, 

 (1.) He brings the children of Judah, that is, the heads and great men
 of that tribe, along with him, to present it, who were willing thus to 
 pay their respects to that ornament of their tribe, and to testify 
 their consent that he should be provided for by himself, and that they 
 would not take it as any reflection upon the rest of this tribe. Caleb 
 was the person whom God had chosen out of that tribe to be employed in 
 dividing the land

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+34:19">Num. xxxiv. 19</A>),

 and therefore, lest he should seem to improve his authority as a
 commissioner for his own private advantage and satisfaction, he brings 
 his brethren along with him, and waiving his own power, seems rather to 
 rely upon their interest.

 (2.) He appeals to Joshua himself concerning the truth of the
 allegations upon which he grounded his petition: <I>Thou knowest the 
 thing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 (3.) He makes a very honourable mention of Moses, which he knew would
 not be at all unpleasing to Joshua: Moses the <I>man of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and the <I>servant of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 What Moses said he took as from God himself, because Moses was his
 mouth and his agent, and therefore he had reason both to desire and 
 expect that it should be made good. What can be more earnestly desired 
 than the tokens of God's favour? And what more confidently expected 
 than the grants of his promise?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In his petition he sets forth,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The testimony of his conscience concerning his integrity in the 
 management of that great affair on which it proved the fare of Israel 
 turned, the spying out of the land. Caleb was one of the twelve that 
 were sent out on that errand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 and he now reflected upon it with comfort, and mentioned it, not in
 pride, but as that which, being the consideration of the grant, was 
 necessary to be inserted in the plea, 

 [1.] That he made his report as it was in his heart, that is, he spoke
 as he thought when he spoke so honourably of the land of Canaan, so 
 confidently of the power of God to put them in possession of it, and so 
 contemptibly of the opposition that the Canaanites, even the Anakim 
 themselves, could make against them, as we find he did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:30,14:7-9">Num. xiii. 30; xiv. 7-9</A>.

 He did not do it merely to please Moses, or to keep the people quiet,
 much less from a spirit of contradiction to his fellows, but from a 
 full conviction of the truth of what he said and a firm belief of the 
 divine promise.

 [2.] That herein he <I>wholly followed the Lord his God,</I> that is,
 he kept close to his duty, and sincerely aimed at the glory of God in 
 it.  He conformed himself to the divine will with an eye to the divine 
 favour. He had obtained this testimony from God himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:24">Num. xiv. 24</A>),

 and therefore it was not vain-glory in him to speak of it, any more
 than it is for those who have <I>God's Spirit witnessing with their 
 spirits</I> that they are the children of God humbly and thankfully to 
 tell others for their encouragement what God has done for their souls. 
 Note, Those that follow God fully when they are young shall have both 
 the credit and comfort of it when they are old, and the reward of it 
 for ever in the heavenly Canaan. 

 [3.] That he did this when all his brethren and companions in that
 service, except Joshua, did otherwise.  They <I>made the heart of the 
 people melt</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and how pernicious the consequences of it were was very well known. It
 adds much to the praise of following God if we adhere to him when 
 others desert and decline from him. Caleb needed not to mention 
 particularly Joshua's conduct in this matter; it was sufficiently 
 known, and he would not seem to flatter him; it was enough to say

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 <I>Thou knowest what the Lord spoke concerning me and thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The experience he had had of God's goodness to him ever since to 
 this day. Though he had wandered with the rest in the wilderness, and 
 had been kept thirty-eight years out of Canaan as they were, for that 
 sin which he was so far from having a hand in that he had done his 
 utmost to prevent it, yet, instead of complaining of this, he 
 mentioned, to the glory of God, his mercy to him in two things:--

 [1.] That he was kept alive in the wilderness, not only notwithstanding
 the common perils and fatigues of that tedious march, but though all 
 that generation of Israelites, except himself and Joshua, were one way 
 or other cut off by death. With what a grateful sense of God's goodness 
 to him does he speak it!

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>).

 <I>Now behold</I> (behold and wonder) <I>the Lord hath kept me alive
 these forty and five years,</I> thirty-eight years in the wilderness, 
 through the plagues of the desert, and seven years in Canaan through 
 the perils of war! Note, <I>First,</I> While we live, it is God that 
 keeps us alive; by his power he protects us from death, and by his 
 bounty supplies us continually with the supports and comforts of life. 
 He <I>holdeth our soul in life. Secondly,</I> The longer we live the 
 more sensible we should be of God's goodness to us in keeping us alive, 
 his care in prolonging our frail lives, his patience in prolonging our 
 forfeited lives. Has he kept me alive these forty-five years? Is it 
 about that time of life with us? Or is it more? Or is it less? We have 
 reason to say, <I>It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not 
 consumed.</I> How much are we indebted to the favour of God, and what 
 shall we render?  Let the life thus kept by the providence of God be 
 devoted to his praise. <I>Thirdly,</I> The death of many others round 
 about us should make us the more thankful to God for sparing us and 
 keeping us alive.  Thousands falling on our right hand and our left and 
 yet ourselves spared. These distinguishing favours impose on us strong 
 obligations to singular obedience. 

 [2.] That he was fit for business, now that he was in Canaan. Though
 eighty-five years old, yet as hearty and lively as when he was forty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>As my strength was then, so is it now.</I> This was the fruit of the
 promise, and out-did what was said; for God not only gives what he 
 promises, but he gives more: life by promise shall be life, and health, 
 and strength, and all that which will make the promised life a blessing 
 and comfort. Moses had said in his prayer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:10">Ps. xc. 10</A>)

 that at <I>eighty years old</I> even their <I>strength is labour and
 sorrow,</I> and so it is most commonly. But Caleb was an exception to 
 the rule; his strength at eighty-five was ease and joy: this he got by 
 <I>following the Lord fully.</I> Caleb here takes notice of this to the 
 glory of God, and as an excuse for his asking a portion which he must 
 fetch out of the giants' hands. Let not Joshua tell him he <I>knew not 
 what he asked;</I> could he get the possession of that which he begged 
 for a title to? "Yes," says he, "why not? I am as fit for war now as 
 ever I was."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The promise Moses had made him in God's name that he should have 
 <I>this mountain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 This promise is his chief plea, and that on which he relies. As we find
 it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:24">Num. xiv. 24</A>)

 it is general, <I>him will I bring into the land whereunto he went, and
 his seed shall possess it;</I> but it seems it was more particular, and 
 Joshua knew it; both sides understood this mountain for which Caleb was 
 now a suitor to be intended. This was the place from which, more than 
 any other, the spies took their report, for here they met with the sons 
 of Anak

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+13:22">Num. xiii. 22</A>),

 the sight of whom made such an impression upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 We may suppose that Caleb, observing what stress they laid upon the
 difficulty of conquering Hebron, a city garrisoned by the giants, and 
 how thence they inferred that the conquest of the whole land was 
 utterly impracticable, in opposition to their suggestions, and to 
 convince the people that he spoke as he thought, bravely desired to 
 have that city which they called <I>invincible</I> assigned to himself 
 for his own portion: "I will undertake to deal with that, and, if I 
 cannot get it for my inheritance, I will be without." "Well," said 
 Moses, "it shall be thy own then, win it and wear it." Such a noble 
 heroic spirit Caleb had, and so desirous was he to inspire his brethren 
 with it, that he chose this place only because it was the most 
 difficult to be conquered. And, to show that his soul did not decay any 
 more than his body, now forty-five years after he adheres to his choice 
 and is still of the same mind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The hopes he had of being master of it, though the sons of Anak 
 were in possession of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>If the Lord will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them
 out.</I> The city of Hebron Joshua had already reduced

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:37"><I>ch.</I> x. 37</A>),

 but the mountain which belonged to it, and which was inhabited by the
 sons of Anak, was yet unconquered; for though the cutting off of the 
 Anakim from Hebron was mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+11:21"><I>ch.</I> xi. 21</A>,

 because the historian would relate all the military actions together,
 yet it seems it was not conquered till after they had begun to divide 
 the land. Observe, He builds his hopes of driving out the sons of Anak 
 upon the presence of God with him. He does not say, "Because I am now 
 as strong for war as I was at forty, therefore I shall drive them out," 
 depending upon his personal valour; nor does he depend upon his 
 interest in the warlike tribe of Judah, who attended him now in making 
 this address, and no doubt would assist him; nor does he court Joshua's 
 aid, or put it upon that, "If thou wilt be with me I shall gain my 
 point." But, <I>If the Lord will be with me.</I> Here, 

 [1.] He seems to speak doubtfully of God's being with him, not from any
 distrust of his goodness or faithfulness. He had spoken without the 
 least hesitation of God's presence with Israel in general

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:9">Num. xiv. 9</A>);

 <I>the Lord is with us.</I> But for himself, from a humble sense of his
 own unworthiness of such a favour, he chooses to express himself thus, 
 <I>If the Lord will be with me.</I> The Chaldee paraphrase reads it, 
 <I>If the Word of the Lord be my helper,</I> that Word which is God, 
 and in the fulness of time was made flesh, and is the captain of our 
 salvation. 

 [2.] But he expresses without the least doubt his assurance that if God
 were with him he should be able to dispossess the sons of Anak. "If God 
 be with us, <I>If God be for us, who can be against us,</I> so as to 
 prevail?" It is also intimated that if God were not with him, though 
 all the forces of Israel should come in to his assistance, he should 
 not be able to gain his point. Whatever we undertake, God's favourable 
 presence with us is all in all to our success; this therefore we must 
 earnestly pray for, and carefully make sure of, by keeping ourselves in 
 the love of God; and on this we must depend, and from this take our 
 encouragement against the greatest difficulties.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Upon the whole matter, Caleb's request is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <I>Give me this mountain,</I>

 (1.) Because it was formerly in God's promise, and he would let Israel
 know how much he valued the promise, insisting upon <I>this mountain, 
 whereof the Lord spake in that day,</I> as most desirable, though 
 perhaps as good a portion might have fallen to him by lot in common 
 with the rest. Those that live by faith value that which is given by 
 promise far above that which is given by providence only.

 (2.) Because it was now in the Anakim's possession, and he would let
 Israel know how little he feared the enemy, and would by his example 
 animate them to push on their conquests. Herein Caleb answered his 
 name, which signifies <I>all heart.</I></P>

 II. Joshua grants his petition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Joshua blessed him,</I> commended his bravery, applauded his
 request, and gave him what he asked. He also prayed for him, and for 
 his good success in his intended undertaking against the sons of Anak. 
 Joshua was both a prince and a prophet, and upon both accounts it was 
 proper for him to give Caleb his blessing, for <I>the less is blessed 
 of the better.</I> Hebron was settled on Caleb and his heirs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>because he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel.</I> And happy are
 we if we follow him. Note, Singular piety shall be crowned with 
 singular favours. Now, 

 1. We are here told what Hebron had been, the city of Arba, a great man
 among the Anakim

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);
 
 we find it called <I>Kirjath-arba</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:2">Gen. xxiii. 2</A>),

 as the place where Sarah died. Hereabouts Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
 lived most of their time in Canaan, and near to it was the cave of 
 Machpelah, where they were buried, which perhaps had led Caleb hither 
 when he went to spy out the land, and had made him covet this rather 
 than any other part for his inheritance. 

 2. We are afterwards told what Hebron was.

 (1.) It was one of the cities belonging to priests
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+21:13">Josh. xxi. 13</A>),
 
 and a <I>city of refuge,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+20:7">Josh. xx. 7</A>.

 When Caleb had it, he contented himself with the country about it, and
 cheerfully gave the city to the priests, the Lord's ministers, thinking 
 it could not be better bestowed, no, not upon his own children, nor 
 that it was the less his own for being thus devoted to God. 

 (2.) It was a royal city, and, in the beginning of David's reign, the
 metropolis of the kingdom of Judah; thither the people resorted to him, 
 and there he reigned seven years.  Thus highly was Caleb's city 
 honoured; it is a pity there should have been such a blemish upon his 
 family long after as Nabal was, who was <I>of the house of Caleb,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:3">1 Sam. xxv. 3</A>.

 But the best men cannot entail their virtues.</P>
