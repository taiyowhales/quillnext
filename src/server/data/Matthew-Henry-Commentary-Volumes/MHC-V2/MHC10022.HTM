 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter is a psalm, a psalm of praise; we find it afterwards
 inserted among David's psalms 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:1-50">Ps. xviii.</A>)

 with some little variation. We have it here as it was first composed
 for his own closed and his own harp; but there we have it as it was 
 afterwards delivered to the chief musician for the service of the 
 church, a second edition with some amendments; for, though it was 
 calculated primarily for David's case, yet it might indifferently serve 
 the devotion of others, in giving thanks for their deliverances; or it 
 was intended that his people should thus join with him in his 
 thanksgivings, because, being a public person, his deliverances were to 
 be accounted public blessings and called for public acknowledgments. 
 The inspired historian, having largely related David's deliverances in 
 this and the foregoing book, and one particularly in the close of the 
 foregoing chapter, thought fit to record this sacred poem as a memorial 
 of all that had been before related. Some think that David penned this 
 psalm when he was old, upon a general review of the mercies of his life 
 and the many wonderful preservations God had blessed him with, from 
 first to last. We should in our praises, look as far back as we can, 
 and not suffer time to wear out the sense of God's favours. Others 
 think that he penned it when he was young, upon occasion of some of his 
 first deliverances, and kept it by him for his use afterwards, and 
 that, upon every new deliverance, his practice was to sing this song. 
 But the book of Psalms shows that he varied as there was occasion, and 
 confined not himself to one form. Here is,

 I. The title of the psalm, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. The psalm itself, in which, with a very warm devotion and very
 great fluency and copiousness of expression,

 1. He gives glory to God. 

 2. He takes comfort in him; and he finds matter for both,

 (1.) In the experiences he had of God's former favours. 

 (2.) In the expectations he had of his further favours. These are
 intermixed throughout the whole psalm.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And David spake unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> the words of this song in the
 day <I>that</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had delivered him out of the hand of all his
 enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 

 I. That it has often been the lot of God's people to have many enemies, 
 and to be in imminent danger of falling into their hands. David was a
 man after God's heart, but not after men's heart: many were those that 
 hated him, and sought his ruin; Saul is particularly named, either,

 1. As distinguished from his enemies of the heathen nations. Saul
 hated David, but David did not hate Saul, and therefore would not 
 reckon him among his enemies; or, rather, 

 2. As the chief of his enemies, who was more malicious and powerful
 than any of them. Let not those whom God loves marvel if the world hate 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Those that trust God in the way of duty shall find him a present 
 help to them in their greatest dangers. David did so. God delivered him 
 out of the hand of Saul. He takes special notice of this. Remarkable 
 preservations should be mentioned in our praises with a particular 
 emphasis. He delivered him also <I>out of the hand of all his 
 enemies,</I> one after another, sometimes in one way, sometimes in 
 another; and David, from his own experience, has assured us <I>that, 
 though many are the troubles of the righteous, yet the Lord delivers 
 them out of them all,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:19">Ps. xxxiv. 19</A>.

 We shall never be delivered from all our enemies till we get to heaven;
 and to that heavenly kingdom God will preserve all that are his,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:18">2 Tim. iv. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Those that have received many signal mercies from God ought to 
 give him the glory of them. Every new mercy in our hand should put a 
 new song into our mouth, even praises to our God. Where there is a 
 grateful heart, out of the abundance of that the mouth will speak. 
 David spoke, not only to himself, for his own pleasure, not merely to 
 those about him, for their instruction, but <I>to the Lord,</I> for his 
 honour, <I>the words of this song.</I> Then we sing with grace when we 
 sing to the Lord. In distress he <I>cried with his voice</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+142:1">Ps. cxlii. 1</A>),

 therefore with his voice he gave thanks. Thanksgiving to God is the
 sweetest vocal music.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We ought to be speedy in our thankful returns to God: <I>In the day 
 that God delivered him he sang this song.</I> While the mercy is fresh, 
 and our devout affections are most excited by it, let the 
 thank-offering be brought, that it may be kindled with the fire of 
 those affections.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  And he said, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> my rock, and my fortress, and my
 deliverer;
 &nbsp; 3 The God of my rock; in him will I trust: <I>he is</I> my shield,
 and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my
 saviour; thou savest me from violence.
 &nbsp; 4 I will call on the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>who is</I> worthy to be praised: so
 shall I be saved from mine enemies.
 &nbsp; 5 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly
 men made me afraid;
 &nbsp; 6 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death
 prevented me;
 &nbsp; 7 In my distress I called upon the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and cried to my God:
 and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry <I>did
 enter</I> into his ears.
 &nbsp; 8 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven
 moved and shook, because he was wroth.
 &nbsp; 9 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of
 his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
 &nbsp; 10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness <I>was</I>
 under his feet.
 &nbsp; 11 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon
 the wings of the wind.
 &nbsp; 12 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters,
 <I>and</I> thick clouds of the skies.
 &nbsp; 13 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire
 kindled.
 &nbsp; 14 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered
 his voice.
 &nbsp; 15 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and
 discomfited them.
 &nbsp; 16 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the
 world were discovered, at the rebuking of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, at the blast
 of the breath of his nostrils.
 &nbsp; 17 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many
 waters;
 &nbsp; 18 He delivered me from my strong enemy, <I>and</I> from them that
 hated me: for they were too strong for me.
 &nbsp; 19 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 was my stay.
 &nbsp; 20 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered
 me, because he delighted in me.
 &nbsp; 21 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> rewarded me according to my righteousness:
 according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
 &nbsp; 22 For I have kept the ways of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and have not wickedly
 departed from my God.
 &nbsp; 23 For all his judgments <I>were</I> before me: and <I>as for</I> his
 statutes, I did not depart from them.
 &nbsp; 24 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from
 mine iniquity.
 &nbsp; 25 Therefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath recompensed me according to my
 righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.
 &nbsp; 26 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, <I>and</I>
 with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.
 &nbsp; 27 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the
 froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.
 &nbsp; 28 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes
 <I>are</I> upon the haughty, <I>that</I> thou mayest bring <I>them</I> down.
 &nbsp; 29 For thou <I>art</I> my lamp, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will lighten my
 darkness.
 &nbsp; 30 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I
 leaped over a wall.
 &nbsp; 31 <I>As for</I> God, his way <I>is</I> perfect; the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 <I>is</I> tried: he <I>is</I> a buckler to all them that trust in him.
 &nbsp; 32 For who <I>is</I> God, save the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>? and who <I>is</I> a rock, save
 our God?
 &nbsp; 33 God <I>is</I> my strength <I>and</I> power: and he maketh my way
 perfect.
 &nbsp; 34 He maketh my feet like hinds' <I>feet:</I> and setteth me upon my
 high places.
 &nbsp; 35 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is
 broken by mine arms.
 &nbsp; 36 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
 gentleness hath made me great.
 &nbsp; 37 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did
 not slip.
 &nbsp; 38 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned
 not again until I had consumed them.
 &nbsp; 39 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could
 not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.
 &nbsp; 40 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that
 rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.
 &nbsp; 41 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I
 might destroy them that hate me.
 &nbsp; 42 They looked, but <I>there was</I> none to save; <I>even</I> unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, but he answered them not.
 &nbsp; 43 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I
 did stamp them as the mire of the street, <I>and</I> did spread them
 abroad.
 &nbsp; 44 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
 thou hast kept me <I>to be</I> head of the heathen: a people <I>which</I> I
 knew not shall serve me.
 &nbsp; 45 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they
 hear, they shall be obedient unto me.
 &nbsp; 46 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of
 their close places.
 &nbsp; 47 The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth; and blessed <I>be</I> my rock; and exalted be
 the God of the rock of my salvation.
 &nbsp; 48 It <I>is</I> God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the
 people under me,
 &nbsp; 49 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast
 lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou
 hast delivered me from the violent man.
 &nbsp; 50 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, among the
 heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.
 &nbsp; 51 <I>He is</I> the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth
 mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.
 </FONT></P>
 

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us observe, in this song of praise,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How David adores God, and gives him the glory of his infinite 
 perfections. There is none like him, nor any to be compared with him 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>Who is God, save the Lord?</I> All others that are adored as deities
 are counterfeits and pretenders. None is to be relied on but he. <I>Who 
 is a rock, save our God?</I> They are dead, but <I>the Lord liveth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 They disappoint their worshippers when they most need them. But <I>as
 for God his way is perfect,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Men begin in kindness, but end not-promise, but perform not; but God
 will finish his work, and his word is tried, and what we may trust.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he triumphs in the interest he has in this God, and his 
 relation to him, which he lays down as the foundation of all the 
 benefits he has received from him: <I>He is my God;</I> as such he 
 cries to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 and cleaves to him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>);

 "and, if <I>my God,</I> then <I>my rock</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that is, "my strength and my power

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 the rock under which I take shelter (he who is to me as the shadow of a
 great rock in a weary land), the rock on which I build my hope,"
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Whatever is my strength and support, it is <I>the God of my rock that
 makes it so;</I> nay, he is <I>the God of the rock of my salvation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>):

 my saving strength is in him and from him. David often hid himself in
 a rock

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:2">1 Sam. xxiv. 2</A>),

 but God was his chief hiding-place. "He is my fortress, in which I am
 safe and think myself so--<I>my high tower,</I> or stronghold, in which 
 I am out of the reach of real evils--the <I>tower of salvation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),

 which can never be sealed nor battered, nor undermined. Salvation
 itself saves me. Am I in distress? he is my deliverer--struck at, shot 
 at? he is my shield--pursued? he is my refuge--oppressed? he is my 
 saviour, that rescues me out of the hand of those that seek my ruin.
 Nay, he is the <I>horn of my salvation,</I> by which I am strongly 
 protected, and my enemies are strongly pushed." Christ is spoken of as 
 the <I>horn of salvation</I> in the house of David,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:69">Luke i. 69</A>.

 "Am I burdened, and ready to sink? <I>The Lord is my stay</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),
 
 by whom I am supported. Am I in the dark, benighted, at a loss? <I>Thou
 art my lamp, O Lord!</I> to show me my way, and thou wilt dispel <I>my 
 darkness,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 If we sincerely take the Lord for our God, all this, and much more, he
 will be to us, all we need and can desire.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What improvement he makes of his interest in God. If he be mine, 
 
 1. <I>In him will I trust</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 that is, "I will resign myself to his direction, and then depend upon
 his power, and wisdom, and goodness, to conduct me well."

 2. <I>On him I will call</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>for he is worthy to be praised.</I> What we have found in God that
 is worthy to be praised should engage us to pray to him and give glory 
 to him.

 3. <I>To him will I give thanks</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:50"><I>v.</I> 50</A>),

 and that publicly. When he was among the heathen he would neither be
 afraid nor ashamed to own his obligations to the God of Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The full and large account he keeps for himself, and gives to 
 others, of the great and kind things God had done for him. This takes 
 up most of the song. He gives God the glory both of his deliverances 
 and of his successes, showing both the perils he was delivered from and 
 the power he was advanced to.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He magnifies the great salvations God had wrought for him. God 
 sometimes brings his people into very great difficulties and dangers, 
 that he may have the honour of saving them and they the comfort of 
 being saved by him. He owns, <I>Thou hast saved me from violence</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),
 
 <I>from my enemies</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>from my strong enemy,</I> meaning Saul, who, if God had not
 succoured him, would have been too hard for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Thou hast given me <I>the shield of thy salvation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 To magnify the salvation, he observes,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That the danger was very great and threatening out of which he was 
 delivered. Men <I>rose up against him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:40,49"><I>v.</I> 40, 49</A>)

 that <I>hated him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),
 
 <I>a violent man</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>)

 namely, Saul, who was malicious in his designs against him and vigorous
 in his pursuit. This is expressed figuratively, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 He was surrounded with death on every side, threatened to be
 overwhelmed, and saw no way of escape. So violently did the waves of 
 death beat upon him, so strongly did the cords and snares of death hold 
 him, that he could not help himself, any more than a man in the grave 
 can. The floods of Belial, the wicked one, and his wicked instruments, 
 made him afraid; he trembled to see not only earth, but death and hell, 
 in arms against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That his deliverance was an answer to prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He has here left us a good example, when we are in distress, to cry
 unto God with importunity, as children in a fright cry to their 
 parents; and great encouragement to do so, in that he found God ready 
 to answer prayer out of his temple in heaven, where he is continually 
 served and adored.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That God appeared in a singular and extraordinary manner for him
 and against his enemies. The expressions are borrowed from the descent
 of the divine Majesty upon Mount Sinai,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>,

 &c. We do not find that in any of David's battles God fought for him
 with thunder (as in Samuel's time), or with hail (as in Joshua's time),
 or with the stars in their courses (as in Deborah's time); but these 
 lofty metaphors are used, 

 [1.] To set forth the glory of God, which was manifested in his 
 deliverance. God's wisdom and power, his goodness and faithfulness,
 his justice and holiness, and his sovereign dominion over all the 
 creatures and all the counsels of men, which appeared in favour of 
 David, were as clear and bright a discovery of God's glory to an eye of 
 faith as such miraculous interpositions would have been to an eye of 
 sense.

 [2.] To set forth God's displeasure against his enemies, God so 
 espoused his cause that he showed himself an enemy to all his enemies; 
 his anger is set forth by a <I>smoke out of his nostrils,</I> and 
 <I>fire out of his mouth</I>

 Who knows the power and terror of his wrath?

 [3.] To set forth the extraordinary confusion which his enemies were 
 put into, and the consternation that seized them; as if the earth had 
 trembled and the <I>foundations of the world</I> had been discovered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:8,16"><I>v.</I> 8, 16</A>.
 
 Who can stand before God when he is angry?

 [4.] To show how ready God was to help him: <I>He rode upon a cherub 
 and did fly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 God hastened to his succour, and came to him with seasonable relief,
 though he had seemed at a distance; yet he was <I>a God hiding 
 himself</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:15">Isa. xiv. 15</A>),

 for he made <I>darkness his pavilion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 for the amazement of his enemies and the protection of his own
 people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) That God manifested his particular favour and kindness to him in 
 these deliverances 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</I> The deliverance
 came not from common providence, but covenant-love; he was herein 
 treated as a favourite: so he perceived by the communications of divine 
 grace and comfort to his soul with these deliverances, and the 
 communion he had with God in them. Herein he was a type of Christ, whom 
 God upheld because he <I>delighted in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1,2">Isa. xlii. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He magnifies the great successes God had crowned him with. He had 
 not only preserved but prospered him. He was blessed, 

 (1.) With liberty and enlargement. He was <I>brought into a large 
 place</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 where he had room to thrive, and his <I>steps were enlarged under
 him,</I> so that he had room to stir

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 being no longer straitened and confined.

 (2.) With military skill, and strength, and swiftness. Though he was 
 bred up to the crook, he was well instructed in the arts of war and 
 qualified for the toils and perils of it. God, having called him to 
 fight his battles, qualified him for the service. He made him very
 ingenious (<I>He teacheth my hands to war,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 And this ingenuity was as good as strength, for it follows, "so <I>that
 a bow of steel is broken by my arms,</I>" not so much by main force as 
 by dexterity), and very vigorous and valiant. (<I>Thou hast girded me
 with strength to battle,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 He gives God the glory of all his courage and ability for service), and
 very expeditious: <I>He maketh my feet swift like hinds feet</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 which is of great advantage both in charging and retreating.

 (3.) With victory over his enemies, not only Saul and Absalom, but the 
 Philistines, Moabites, Ammonites, Syrians, and other neighbouring 
 nations, whom he subdued and made tributaries to Israel. His wonderful 
 victories are here described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:38-43"><I>v.</I> 38-43</A>.

 They were <I>speedy</I> victories (<I>I turned not again till I had
 consumed them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>)
 
 and <I>complete</I> victories. The enemies of Israel were <I>wounded,
 destroyed, consumed,</I> fell <I>under his feet,</I> trampled upon, and 
 disabled to rise, and their necks lay at his mercy. They cried both to 
 earth and heaven for help, but in vain. <I>There was none to save,</I> 
 none that durst appear for them. God <I>answered them, not</I> for they 
 were not on his side, nor did they cry unto him till they were brought 
 to the last extremity. Being thus abandoned, they became an easy prey
 to David's righteous and victorious sword, so that he <I>beat them as 
 small as the dust of the earth,</I> which is scattered by the wind and 
 trodden on by every foot.

 (4.) With advancement to honour and power. To this he was anointed
 before his troubles began, and at length, <I>post tot discrimina 
 rerum--after all his dangers and disasters,</I> he gained his point.
 God <I>made his way perfect</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 gave him success in all his undertakings, <I>set him upon his high
 places</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 denoting both safety and dignity. God's gentleness, his grace and
 tender mercy, <I>made him great</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 gave him great wealth, and great authority, and a name like that of the
 great men of the earth. He was <I>kept to be the head of the 
 heathen</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>);

 his signal preservations evinced that he was designed and reserved for
 something great--to rule over all Israel, notwithstanding the 
 <I>strivings of the people,</I> and so that those whom <I>he had not 
 known should serve him,</I> many of the nations that lay remote. Thus 
 he was <I>lifted up on high,</I> as high as the throne, above those
 that <I>rose up against him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The comfortable reflections he makes upon his own integrity, which 
 God, by those wonderful deliverances, had graciously owned and 
 witnessed to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:21-25"><I>v.</I> 21-25</A>.

 He means especially his integrity with reference to Saul and
 Ishbosheth, Absalom and Sheba, and those who either opposed his coming 
 to the crown or endeavoured to dethrone him. They falsely accused him
 and misrepresented him, but he had the testimony of this conscience for 
 him that he was not an ambitious aspiring man, a false and bloody man, 
 as they called him,--that he had never taken any indirect unlawful 
 courses to secure or raise himself, but in his whole conduct had kept 
 in the way of his duty,--and that in the whole course of his 
 conversation he had, for the main, made religion his business, so that 
 he could take God's favours to him as the rewards of his righteousness, 
 not of debt, but of grace. God had recompensed him, though not for his 
 righteousness, as if that had merited any thing at the hand of God, yet 
 according to his righteousness, which he was well pleased with, and had 
 an eye to. His conscience witnessed for him,

 1. That he had made the word of God his rule, and had kept to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Wherever he was, God's judgments were before him as his guide;
 whithersoever he went, he took his religion along with him, and though 
 he was forced to depart from his country, and sent, as it were, to 
 serve other gods, yet as for God's statutes, he did not depart from 
 them, but kept the way of the Lord and walked in it.

 2. That he had carefully avoided the bye-paths of sin. He had not
 wickedly departed from his God. He could not say but that he had taken 
 some false steps, but he had not deserted God, nor forsaken his way.
 Sins of infirmity he could not acquit himself from, but the grace of 
 God had kept him from presumptuous sins. Though he had sometimes 
 <I>weakly</I> departed from his God. By this it appeared that he was 
 <I>upright before God,</I> or <I>to God</I> (in his sight, and with an 
 eye to him), that he <I>kept himself from his own iniquity,</I> not 
 only from that particular sin of killing Saul when it was in the power 
 of his hand to do it, but, in general, he was afraid of sin and 
 watchful against it, and made conscience of what he said and did. The 
 matter of Uriah is an exception

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:5">1 Kings xv. 5</A>),

 like that in Hezekiah's character,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:31">2 Chron. xxxii. 31</A>.

 Note, A careful abstaining from our own iniquity is one of the best
 evidences of our own integrity; and the testimony of our conscience for 
 us that we have done so will be such a rejoicing as will not only 
 lessen the griefs of an afflicted state, but increase the comforts of a 
 prosperous state. David reflected with more comfort upon his victories 
 over his own iniquity than upon his conquest of Goliath and all the 
 hosts of the uncircumcised Philistines; and the witness of his own 
 heart to his uprightness was sweeter though more silent music than 
 theirs that sang, <I>David has slain his ten thousands.</I> If a great 
 man be a good man, his goodness will be much more his satisfaction than 
 his greatness. Let favour be shown to the upright and his uprightness 
 will sweeten it, will double it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The comfortable prospects he has of God's further favour. As he 
 looks back, so he looks forward, with pleasure, and assures himself of 
 the kindness God has in store for all the saints, for himself, and also 
 for his seed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. For all good people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:26-28"><I>v.</I> 26-28</A>.

 As God had dealt with him according to his uprightness, so he will with
 all others. He takes occasion here to lay down the established rules of 
 God's procedure with the children of men:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That he will do good to those that are upright in their hearts. As 
 we are found towards God, he will be found towards us. 

 [1.] God's mercy and grace will be the joy of those that are merciful 
 and gracious. Even the merciful need mercy; and they shall obtain it.

 [2.] God's uprightness, his justice and faithfulness, will be the joy 
 of those that are upright, just, and faithful, both towards God and 
 man.

 [3.] God's purity and holiness will be the joy of those that are pure 
 and holy, who therefore give thanks at the remembrance thereof. And, if 
 any of these good people be <I>afflicted people, he will save</I> them, 
 either out of their afflictions or by and after them. On the other 
 hand,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That those who turn aside to crooked ways he will <I>lead forth 
 with the workers of iniquity,</I> as he says in another psalm. <I>With 
 the froward he will wrestle;</I> and those with whom God wrestles are 
 sure to be foiled. <I>Woe unto him that strives with his Maker!</I> God 
 will walk contrary to those that walk contrary to him and be displeased 
 with those that are displeased with him. As for the haughty, his eyes 
 are upon them, marking them out, as it were, to be brought down; for 
 <I>he resists the proud.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. For himself. He foresaw that his conquests and kingdom would be yet
 further enlarged,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:45,46"><I>v.</I> 45, 46</A>.

 Even the <I>sons of the stranger,</I> that would hear the report of his
 victories and the tokens of God's presence with him, would be possessed 
 with a fear of him, would be forced to submit to him, though feignedly, 
 and would be obedient to him. The successes which he had had he looked 
 upon as earnests of more and means of more. Who durst oppose him by 
 whom so many had been overcome? Thus the Son of David <I>goes on 
 conquering and to conquer,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:2">Rev. vi. 2</A>.
 
 His gospel, which has been victorious, shall be so more and more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. For his seed: He <I>showeth mercy to his Messiah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+22:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),

 not only to David himself, but to that seed of his for evermore. David
 was himself anointed of God, not a usurper, but duly called to the 
 government and qualified for it; therefore he doubted not but God would 
 show mercy to him, that mercy which he had promised not to take from 
 him nor from his posterity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:15,16"><I>ch.</I> vii. 15, 16</A>);

 on that promise he depends, with an eye to Christ, who alone is his
 <I>seed for evermore,</I> whose throne and kingdom still continue, and 
 will to the end, whereas the seed and lineage of David are long since 
 extinct. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:28,29">Ps. lxxxix. 28, 29</A>.

 Thus all his joys and all his hopes terminate, as ours should, in the
 great Redeemer.</P>
