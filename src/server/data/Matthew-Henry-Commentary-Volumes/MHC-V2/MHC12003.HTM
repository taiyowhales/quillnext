 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are now called to attend the public affairs of Israel, in which we 
 shall find Elisha concerned. Here is, 

 I. The general character of Jehoram, king of Israel,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. A war with Moab, in which Jehoram and his allies were engaged,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:4-8">ver. 4-8</A>.

 III. The straits which the confederate army were reduced to in their
 expedition against Moab, and their consulting Elisha in that distress, 
 with the answer of peace he gave them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:9-19">ver. 9-19</A>.

 IV. The glorious issue of this campaign 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:20-25">ver. 20-25</A>)

 and the barbarous method the king of Moab took to oblige the
 confederate army to retire,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:26,27">ver. 26, 27</A>.

 The house of Ahab is doomed to destruction; and, though in this chapter
 we have both its character and its condition better than before, yet 
 the threatened ruin is not far off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in
 Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and
 reigned twelve years.
 &nbsp; 2 And he wrought evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; but not like
 his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of
 Baal that his father had made.
 &nbsp; 3 Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of
 Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.
 &nbsp; 4 And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto
 the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred
 thousand rams, with the wool.
 &nbsp; 5 But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of
 Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jehoram, the son of Ahab, and brother of Ahaziah, is here upon the 
 throne of Israel; and, though he was but a bad man, yet two commendable 
 things are here recorded of him:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That he removed his father's idols. He did evil in many things, but 
 not like his father Ahab or his mother Jezebel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Bad he was, but not so bad, so <I>overmuch wicked,</I> as Solomon 
 speaks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:17">Eccl. vii. 17</A>.

 Perhaps Jehoshaphat, though by his alliance with the house of Ahab he
 made his own family worse, did something towards making Ahab's better.  
 Jehoram saw his father and brother cut off for worshipping Baal, and 
 wisely took warning by God's judgments on them, and <I>put away the 
 image of Baal,</I> resolving to worship the God of Israel only, and 
 consult none but his prophets. So far was well, yet it did not prevent 
 the destruction of Ahab's family, nay, that destruction came <I>in his 
 days,</I> and fell immediately <I>upon him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:24"><I>ch.</I> ix. 24</A>),

 though he was one of the best of the family, for then the measure of 
 its iniquity was full. Jehoram's reformation was next to none; for, 

 1. He only put away the image of Baal <I>which his father had made,</I>
 and this probably in compliment to Jehoshaphat, who otherwise would not 
 have come into confederacy with him, any more than with his brother,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:49">1 Kings xxii. 49</A>.

 But he did not destroy the worship of Baal among the people, for Jehu
 found it prevalent,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+10:19"><I>ch.</I> x. 19</A>.

 It was well to reform his family, but it was not enough; he ought to
 have used his power for the reforming of his kingdom. 

 2. When he put away the image of Baal, he adhered to the worship of the 
 calves, that politic sin of Jeroboam, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:3"><I>v.</I>  3</A>.

 <I>He departed not therefrom,</I> because that was the state engine by
 which the division between the two tribes was supported. Those do not 
 truly, nor acceptably, repent or reform, who only part with the sins 
 that they lose by, but continue their affection to the sins that they 
 get by.

 3.  He only <I>put away</I> the image of Baal, he did not break it in
 pieces, as he ought to have done. He laid it aside for the present, yet 
 not knowing but he might have occasion for it another time; and 
 Jezebel, for reasons of state, was content to worship her Baal in 
 private.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That he did what he could to recover his brother's losses. As he 
 had something more of the religion of an Israelite than his father, so 
 he had something more of the spirit of a king than his brother. Moab 
 rebelled against Israel, immediately upon the death of Ahab, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:1"><I>ch.</I> i. 1</A>.
 
 And we do not find that Ahaziah made any attempt to chastise or reduce
 them, but tamely let go his interest in them, rather than entertain the 
 cares, undergo the fatigues, and run the hazards, of a war with them. 
 His folly and pusillanimity herein, and his indifference to the public 
 good, were the more aggravated because the tribute which the king of 
 Moab paid was a very considerable branch of the revenue of the crown of 
 Israel: 100,000 <I>lambs, and</I> 100,000 <I>wethers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The riches of kings then lay more in cattle than coin, and they thought 
 it not below them to <I>know the state of their flocks and herds</I> 
 themselves, because, as Solomon observes, <I>the crown doth not endure 
 to every generation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:23,24">Prov. xxvii. 23, 24</A>.

 Taxes were then paid not so much in money as in the commodities of the
 country, which was an ease to the subject, whether it was an advantage 
 to the prince or no. The revolt of Moab was a great loss to Israel, yet 
 Ahaziah sat still in sloth and ease.  But an upper chamber in his house 
 proved as fatal to him as the high places of the field could have been

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:2"><I>ch.</I> i. 2</A>),

 and the breaking of his lattice let into his throne a man of the more
 active genius, that would not lose the dominion of Moab without making 
 at least one push for its preservation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and
 numbered all Israel.
 &nbsp; 7 And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah,
 saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go
 with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I <I>am</I>
 as thou <I>art,</I> my people as thy people, <I>and</I> my horses as thy
 horses.
 &nbsp; 8 And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The
 way through the wilderness of Edom.
 &nbsp; 9 So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the
 king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey:
 and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that
 followed them.
 &nbsp; 10 And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath called
 these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of
 Moab!
 &nbsp; 11 But Jehoshaphat said, <I>Is there</I> not here a prophet of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that we may enquire of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by him? And one of the king
 of Israel's servants answered and said, Here <I>is</I> Elisha the son
 of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.
 &nbsp; 12 And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> is with him. So
 the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down
 to him.
 &nbsp; 13 And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do
 with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the
 prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him,
 Nay: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath called these three kings together, to
 deliver them into the hand of Moab.
 &nbsp; 14 And Elisha said, <I>As</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts liveth, before whom
 I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of
 Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor
 see thee.
 &nbsp; 15 But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the
 minstrel played, that the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> came upon him.
 &nbsp; 16 And he said, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Make this valley full of
 ditches.
 &nbsp; 17 For thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Ye shall not see wind, neither
 shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water,
 that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.
 &nbsp; 18 And this is <I>but</I> a light thing in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: he
 will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.
 &nbsp; 19 And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city,
 and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and
 mar every good piece of land with stones.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Jehoram has no sooner got the sceptre into his hand than he takes the 
 sword into his hand, to reduce Moab. Crowns bring great cares and 
 perils to the heads that wear them; no sooner in honour than in war. 
 Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The concerting of this expedition between Jehoram king of Israel and 
 Jehoshaphat king of Judah. Jehoram levied an army 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and such an opinion he had of the godly king of Judah that,

 1. He courted him to be his confederate: <I>Wilt thou go with me
 against Moab?</I> And he gained him. Jehoshaphat said, <I>I will go up. 
 I am as thou art,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Judah and Israel, though unhappily divided from each other, yet can
 unite against Moab a common enemy. Jehoshaphat upbraids them not with 
 their revolt from the house of David, nor makes it an article of their 
 alliance that they shall return to their allegiance, though he had good 
 reason to insist upon it, but treats with Israel as a sister-kingdom.  
 Those are no friends to their own peace and strength who can never find 
 in their hearts to forgive and forget an old injury, and unite with 
 those that have formerly broken in upon their rights. <I>Quod initio 
 non vulvit, tractu temporis invalescit--That which was originally 
 destitute of authority in the progress of time acquires it.</I>

 2. He consulted him as his confidant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He took advice of Jehoshaphat, who had more wisdom and experience than
 himself, which way they should make their descent upon the country of 
 Moab; and he advised that they should not march against them the 
 nearest way, over Jordan, but go round <I>through the wilderness of 
 Edom,</I> that they might take the king of Edom (who was tributary to 
 him) and his forces along with them If two be better than one, much 
 more will not a <I>three-fold cord be easily broken.</I> Jehoshaphat 
 had like to have paid dearly for joining with Ahab, yet he joined with 
 his son, and this expedition also had like to have been fatal to him.  
 There is nothing got by being yoked with unbelievers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great straits that the army of the confederates was reduced to 
 in this expedition. Before they saw the face of an enemy they were all 
 in danger of perishing for want of water, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 This ought to have been considered before they ventured a march through
 the wilderness, the same wilderness (or very near it) where their 
 ancestors wanted water,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:2">Num. xx. 2</A>.

 God suffers his people, by their own improvidence, to bring themselves
 into distress, that the wisdom, power, and goodness of his providence 
 may be glorified in their relief. What is more cheap and common than 
 water? It is <I>drink to every beast of the field,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:11">Ps. civ. 11</A>.

 Yet the want of it will soon humble and ruin kings and armies.  The
 king of Israel sadly lamented the present distress, and the imminent 
 danger it put them in of falling into the hands of their enemies the 
 Moabites, to whom, when weakened by thirst, they would be an easy prey, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 it was he that had <I>called these kings together;</I> yet he charges
 it upon Providence, and reflects upon that as unkind: The Lord has 
 <I>called them together.</I> Thus <I>the foolishness of man perverteth 
 his way,</I> and then <I>his heart fretteth against the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:3">Prov. xix. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Jehoshaphat's good motion to ask counsel of God in this exigency, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The place they were now in could not but remind them of the <I>wonders
 of which their fathers told them,</I> the waters fetched out of the 
 rock for Israel's seasonable supply. The thought of this, we may 
 suppose, encouraged Jehoshaphat to ask, <I>Is there not here a prophet 
 of the Lord,</I> like unto Moses? He was the more concerned because it 
 was by his advice that they fetched this compass through the 
 wilderness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It was well that Jehoshaphat enquired of the Lord now, but it would
 have been much better if he had done it sooner, before he engaged in 
 this war, or steered this course; so the distress might have been 
 prevented. Good men are sometimes remiss and forgetful, and neglect 
 their duty till necessity and affliction drive them to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Elisha recommended as a proper person for them to consult with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 And here we may wonder,

 1. That Elisha should follow the camp, especially in such a tedious
 march as this, as a volunteer, unasked, unobserved, and in no post of 
 honour at all; not in the office of <I>priest of the war</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:2">Deut. xx. 2</A>)

 or president of the council of war, but in such obscurity that none of
 the kings knew they had such a jewel in the treasures of their camp, 
 nor so good a friend in their retinue. We may suppose it was by special 
 direction from heaven that Elisha attended the war, as <I>the chariot 
 of Israel and the horsemen thereof.</I> Thus does God anticipate his 
 people with the blessings of his goodness and provide his oracles for 
 those that provide them not for themselves. It would often be bad with 
 us if God did not take more care of us, both for soul and body, than we 
 take for ourselves. 

 2. That a servant of the king of Israel knew of his being there when 
 the king himself did not. Probably it was such a servant as Obadiah was 
 to his father Ahab, one that <I>feared the Lord;</I> to such a one 
 Elisha made himself known, not to the kings.  The account he gives of 
 him is that it was he that <I>poured water on the hands of Elijah,</I> 
 that is, he was his servant, and particularly attended him when he 
 washed his hands. He that will be great, let him learn to minister: he 
 that will rise high, let him begin low.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The application which the kings made to Elisha. They went down to 
 him to his quarters, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Jehoshaphat had such an esteem for a prophet with whom the word of the
 Lord was that he would condescend to visit him in his own person and 
 not send for him up to him. The other two were moved by the straits 
 they were in to make their court to the prophet. He that humbled 
 himself was thus exalted, and looked great, when three kings came to 
 knock at his door, and beg his assistance; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9">Rev. iii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The entertainment which Elisha gave them. 

 1. He was very plain with the wicked king of Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>What have I to do with thee?</I> How canst thou expect an answer of
 peace from me? <I>Get thee to the prophets of thy father and 
 mother,</I> whom thou hast countenanced and maintained in thy 
 prosperity, and let them help thee now in thy distress." Elisha was not 
 imposed upon, as Jehoshaphat was, by his partial and hypocritical 
 reformation; he knew that, though he had put away the image of Baal, 
 Baal's prophets were still dear to him, and perhaps some of the were 
 now in his camp. "Go," said he, "<I>go to them. Get you to the gods 
 whom you have served,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:14">Judg. x. 14</A>.

 The world and the flesh have ruled you, let them help you; why should
 God be <I>enquired of by</I> you?"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:3">Ezek. xiv. 3</A>.

 Elisha tells him to his face, in a holy indignation at his wickedness,
 that he can scarcely find in his heart to <I>look towards him</I> or to 
 <I>see him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Jehoram is to be respected as a prince, but as a wicked man he is a
 vile person, and is to be condemned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+15:4">Ps. xv. 4</A>.

 Elisha, as a subject, will honour him, but as a prophet he will cause
 him to know his iniquity. For those that had such an extraordinary 
 commission it was fit (though not for a common person) to say to a 
 king, <I>Thou art wicked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:18">Job xxxiv. 18</A>.

 Jehoram has so much self-command as to take this plain dealing
 patiently; he cares not now for hearing of the prophets of Baal, but is 
 a humble suitor to the God of Israel and his prophet, representing the 
 present case as very deplorable and humbly recommending it to the 
 prophet's compassionate consideration. In effect, he owns himself 
 unworthy, but let not the other kings be ruined for his sake.

 2. Elisha showed a great respect to the godly king of Judah, 
 <I>regarded his presence,</I> and, for his sake, would <I>enquire of 
 the Lord</I> for them all. It is good being with those that have God's 
 favour and his prophet's love. Wicked people often fare the better for 
 the friendship and society of those that are godly. 

 3.  He composed himself to receive instructions from God. His mind was
 somewhat ruffled and disturbed at the sight of Jehoram; though he was 
 not put into a sinful heat or passion, nor had spoken unadvisedly, yet 
 his zeal for the present indisposed him for prayer and the operations 
 of the Spirit, which required a mind very calm and sedate. He therefore 
 called for a musician 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 a devout musician, one accustomed to play upon his harp and sign psalms
 to it. To hear God's praises sweetly sung, as David had appointed, 
 would cheer his spirits, and settle his mind, and help to put him into 
 a right frame both to speak to him and to hear from him. We find a 
 company of prophets prophesying with <I>a psaltery and a tabret before 
 them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:5">1 Sam. x. 5</A>.

 Those that desire communion with God must keep their spirits quiet and
 serene. Elisha being refreshed, and having the tumult of his spirits 
 laid by this divine music, <I>the hand of the Lord came upon him,</I> 
 and his visit did him more honour than that of three kings. 

 4.  God, by him, gave them assurance that the issue of the present 
 distress would be comfortable and glorious.

 (1.) They should speedily be supplied with water, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 To try their faith and obedience, he bids them <I>make the valley full
 of ditches</I> to receive the water.  Those that expect God's blessings 
 must prepare room for them, <I>dig the pools</I> for the rain to fill, 
 as they did in the valley of Baca, and so made even that a well,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:6">Ps. lxxxiv. 6</A>.

 To raise the wonder, he tells them they shall have water enough, and
 yet there shall be <I>neither wind nor rain.</I> Elijah, by prayer, 
 obtained water out of the clouds, but Elisha fetches it nobody knows 
 whence. The spring of these waters shall be as secret as the head of 
 the Nile.  God is not tied to second causes. Ordinarily it is by a 
 plentiful rain that God <I>confirms his inheritance</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:9">Ps. lxviii. 9</A>),
 
 but here it is done without rain, at least without rain in that place.
 Some of the <I>fountains of the great deep,</I> it is likely, <I>were 
 broken up</I> on this occasion; and, to increase the miracle, <I>that 
 valley</I> only (as it should seem) <I>was filled with water,</I> and 
 no other place had any share of it.  

 (2.) That supply should be an earnest of victory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>This is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord;</I> you shall
 not only be saved from perishing, but shall return in triumph." As God

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20 And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering
 was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom,
 and the country was filled with water.
 &nbsp; 21 And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up
 to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on
 armour, and upward, and stood in the border.
 &nbsp; 22 And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone
 upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side
 <I>as</I> red as blood:
 &nbsp; 23 And they said, This <I>is</I> blood: the kings are surely slain,
 and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the
 spoil.
 &nbsp; 24 And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites
 rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them:
 but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in <I>their</I>
 country.
 &nbsp; 25 And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of
 land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped
 all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in
 Kir-haraseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers
 went about <I>it,</I> and smote it.
 &nbsp; 26 And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore
 for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to
 break through <I>even</I> unto the king of Edom: but they could not.
 &nbsp; 27 Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his
 stead, and offered him <I>for</I> a burnt offering upon the wall. And
 there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed
 from him, and returned to <I>their own</I> land.

 I. We have here the divine gift of both those things which God had 
 promised by Elisha--water and victory, and the former not only a pledge
 of the latter, but a means of it. God, who created, and commands, all 
 the waters, both above and beneath the firmament, sent them an 
 abundance of water on a sudden, which did them double service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It relieved their armies, which were ready to perish, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 And, which was very observable, this relief came just at the time of
 the <I>offering of the morning sacrifice</I> upon the altar at 
 Jerusalem, a certain time, and universally known. That time Elisha 
 chose for his <I>hour of prayer</I> (it is likely <I>looking towards 
 the temple,</I> for so there were to do in their prayers when they were 
 <I>going out to battle</I> and encamped at a distance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:44">1 Kings viii. 44</A>),

 in token of his communion with the temple-service, and his expectation
 of success by virtue of the great sacrifice. We now cannot pitch upon 
 any hour more acceptable than another, because our high priest is 
 always appearing for us, to present and plead his sacrifice. That time 
 God chose for the hour of mercy to put an honour upon the daily 
 sacrifice, which had been despised. God answered Daniel's prayer just 
 at the <I>time of the evening sacrifice</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:21">Dan. ix. 21</A>);

 for he will acknowledge his own institutions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It deceived their enemies, who were ready to triumph, into the 
 destruction. Notice was given to the Moabites of the advances of the 
 confederate army, to oppose which <I>all that were able to put on 
 armour</I> were posted upon the frontiers, where they were ready to 
 give the Israelites a warm reception 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 promising themselves that it would be easy dealing with an army
 fatigued by so long a march through the wilderness of Edom. But see 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How easily they were drawn into their own delusions. Observe the 
 steps of their self-deceit. 

 [1.] They saw the water in the valley where the army of Israel 
 encamped, and conceited it was blood 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 because they knew the valley to be dry, and (there having been no rain)
 could not imagine it should be water. The sun shone upon it, and 
 probably <I>the sky was red and lowering,</I> a presage of <I>foul 
 weather that day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:3">Matt. xvi. 3</A>),

 and so it proved to them. But, this making the water look red, their
 own fancies, which made them willing to believe what made for them, 
 suggested, <I>This is blood,</I> God permitting them thus to impose 
 upon themselves. 

 [2.] If their camp was thus full of blood, they conclude, "Certainly 
 the kings have fallen out (as confederates of different interests are 
 apt to do) and they have <I>slain one another</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 for who else should slay them?" And,

 [3.] "If the armies have slain one another, we have nothing to do but 
 to divide the prey. <I>Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</I>" These 
 were the gradual suggestions of some sanguine spirits among them, that 
 thought themselves wiser and happier in their conjectures than their 
 neighbours; and the rest, being desirous it should be so, were forward 
 to believe it was so. <I>Quod volumus facile credimus--What we wish we 
 readily believe.</I> Thus those that are to be destroyed are first 
 deceived 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:8">Rev. xx. 8</A>),

 and none are so effectually deceived as those that deceive
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How fatally they thereby ran upon their own destruction. They 
 rushed carelessly into the camp of Israel, to plunder it, but were 
 undeceived when it was too late. The Israelites, animated by the 
 assurances Elisha had given them of victory, fell upon them with the 
 utmost fury, routed them, and pursued them into their own country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),
 
 which they laid waste
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 destroyed the cities, marred the ground, stopped up the wells, felled 
 the timber, and left only the royal city standing, in the walls of 
 which they made great breaches with their battering engines. This they 
 got by rebelling against Israel. Who ever <I>hardened his heart against 
 God and prospered?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In the close of the chapter we are told what the king of Moab did 
 when he found himself reduced to the last extremity by the besiegers, 
 and that his capital city was likely to fall into their hands. 

 1. He attempted that which was bold and brave.  he got together 700
 choice men, and with them sallied out upon the intrenchments of the 
 king of Edom, who, being but a mercenary in this expedition, would not, 
 he hoped, make any great resistance if vigorously attacked, and so he 
 might make his escape that way. But it would not do; even the king of 
 Edom proved too hard for him, and obliged him to retire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 2. This failing, he did that which was brutish and barbarous; he took 
 his own son, his eldest son, that was to succeed him, than whom nothing 
 could be more dear to himself and his people, and <I>offered him for a 
 burnt-offering upon the wall,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.
 
 He designed by this,

 (1.) To obtain the favour of Chemosh his god, which, being a devil, 
 delighted in blood and murder, and the destruction of mankind. The 
 dearer any thing was to them the more acceptable those idolaters 
 thought it must needs be if offered in sacrifice to their gods, and 
 therefore burnt their children in the fire to their honour. 

 (2.) To terrify the besiegers, and oblige them to retire. Therefore he 
 did it <I>upon the wall,</I> in their sight, that they might see what 
 desperate courses he resolved to take rather than surrender, and how 
 dearly he would sell his city and life. He intended hereby to render 
 them odious, and to exasperate and enrage his own subjects against 
 them. This effect it had: <I>There was great indignation against 
 Israel</I> for driving him to this extremity, whereupon they raised the 
 siege and returned. Tender and generous spirits will not do that, 
 though just, which will drive any man distracted, or make him 
 desperate.</P>
