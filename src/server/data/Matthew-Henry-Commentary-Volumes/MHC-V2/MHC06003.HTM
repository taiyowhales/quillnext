 This chapter, and that which follows it, give us the history of
 Israel's passing through Jordan into Canaan, and a very memorable
 history it is. Long afterwards, they are told to remember what God did
 for them between Shittim (whence they decamped,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:1">ver. 1</A>)

 and Gilgal, where they next pitched,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+4:19,Mic+6:5"><I>ch.</I> iv. 19, Mic. vi. 5</A>,

 that they might know the righteousness of the Lord. By Joshua's order
 they marched up to the river's side,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:1">ver. 1</A>),

 and then almighty power led them through it. They passed through the
 Red Sea unexpectedly, and in their flight by night, but they have 
 notice some time before of their passing through Jordan, and their 
 expectations raised. 
 
 I. The people are directed to follow the ark, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>.

 II. They are commanded to sanctify themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:5">ver.  5</A>.

 III. The priests with the ark are ordered to lead the van, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:6">ver. 6</A>.

 IV.  Joshua is magnified and made commander in chief, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.

 V.  Public notice is given of what God is about to do for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>.

 IV. The thing is done, Jordan is divided, and Israel brought safely
 through it, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:14-17">ver.  14-17</A>.

 This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from
 Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel,
 and lodged there before they passed over.
 &nbsp; 2 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went
 through the host;
 &nbsp; 3 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of
 the covenant of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God, and the priests the Levites
 bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after
 it.
 &nbsp; 4 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two
 thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may
 know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed <I>this</I>
 way heretofore.
 &nbsp; 5 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to
 morrow the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will do wonders among you.
 &nbsp; 6 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of
 the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up
 the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Rahab, in mentioning to the spies the <I>drying up of the Red Sea</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:10"><I>ch.</I> ii. 10</A>),

 the report of which terrified the Canaanites more than anything else,
 intimates that those on that side the water expected that Jordan, that 
 great defence of their country, would in like manner give way to them. 
 Whether the Israelites had any expectation of it does not appear. God 
 often <I>did things for them which they looked not for,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:3">Isa. lxiv. 3</A>.
 
 Now here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That they <I>came to Jordan and lodged there,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Though they were not yet told how they should pass the river, and were
 unprovided for the passing of it in any ordinary way, yet they went 
 forward in faith, having been told

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:11"><I>ch.</I> i. 11</A>)

 that they should pass it. We must go on in the way of our duty though
 we foresee difficulties, trusting God to help us through them when we 
 come to them. Let us proceed as far as we can, and depend on divine 
 sufficiency for that which we find ourselves not sufficient for. In 
 this march Joshua led them, and particular notice is taken of his early 
 rising as there is afterwards upon other occasions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+6:12,7:16,8:10"><I>ch.</I> vi. 12; 
 vii. 16; viii. 10</A>),

 which intimates how little he loved his ease, how much he loved his
 business, and what care and pains he was willing to take in it. Those 
 that would bring great things to pass must rise early. <I>Love not 
 sleep, lest thou come to poverty.</I> Joshua herein set a good example 
 to the officers under him, and taught them to rise early, and to all 
 that are in public stations especially to attend continually to the 
 duty of their place.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the people were directed to follow the ark. Officers were 
 appointed to go through the host to give these directions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that every Israelite might know both what to do and what to depend
 upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They might depend upon the ark to lead them; that is, upon God 
 himself, of whose presence the ark was an instituted sign and token. It 
 seems, the pillar of cloud and fire was removed, else that would have 
 led them, unless we suppose that it now hovered over the ark and so 
 they had a double guide: honour was put upon the ark, and a defence 
 upon that glory. It is called here the <I>ark of the covenant of the 
 Lord their God.</I> What greater encouragement could they have than 
 this, that the Lord was their God, a God in covenant with them? Here 
 was the <I>ark of the covenant;</I> if God be ours, we need not fear 
 any evil. He was nigh to them, present with them, went before them: 
 what could come amiss to those that were thus guided, thus guarded?  
 Formerly the ark was carried in the midst of the camp, but now it went 
 before them to <I>search out a resting-place</I> for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:33">Num. x. 33</A>),
 
 and, as it were, to give them livery and seisin of the promised land,
 and put them in possession of it In the ark the tables of the law were, 
 and over it the mercy-seat; for the divine law and grace reigning in 
 the heart are the surest pledges of God's presence and favour, and 
 those that would be led to the heavenly Canaan must take the law of God 
 for their guide (<I>if thou wilt enter into life keep the 
 commandments</I>) and have the great propitiation in their eye, 
 <I>looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal 
 life.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They might depend upon the priests and Levites, who were appointed 
 for that purpose to carry the ark before them. The work of ministers is 
 to hold forth the word of life, and to take care of the administration 
 of those ordinances which are the tokens of God's presence and the 
 instruments of his power and grace; and herein they must go before the 
 people of God in their way to heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The people must follow the ark: <I>Remove from your place and go 
 after it,</I> 

 (1.) As those that are resolved never to forsake it.  Wherever God's
 ordinances are, there we must be; if they flit, we must remove and go 
 after them.

 (2.) As those that are entirely satisfied in its guidance, that it will
 lead in the best way to the best end; and therefore, <I>Lord, I will 
 follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</I> This must be all their car, 
 to attend the motions of the ark, and follow it with an implicit faith. 
 Thus must we walk after the rule of the word and the direction of the 
 Spirit in every thing, so shall <I>peace be upon us,</I> as it now was 
 upon the Israel of God. They must follow the priests as far as they 
 carried the ark, but no further; so we must follow our ministers only 
 as they follow Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. In following the ark, they must <I>keep their distance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 They must none of them come within a thousand yards of the ark.

 (1.) They must thus express their awful and reverent regard to that
 token of God's presence, lest its familiarity with them should breed 
 contempt.  This charge to them not to come near was agreeable to that 
 dispensation of darkness, bondage, and terror: but we now through 
 Christ have access with boldness.

 (2.) Thus it was made to appear that the ark was able to protect
 itself, and needed not to be guarded by the men of war, but was itself 
 a guard to them. With what a noble defiance of the enemy did it leave 
 all it its friends half a mile behind except the unarmed priests that 
 carried it as perfectly sufficient for its own safety and theirs that 
 followed it!

 (3.) Thus it was the better seen by those that were to be led by it:
 <I>That you may know the way by which you must go,</I> seeing it, as it 
 were, chalked out or tracked by the ark. Had they been allowed to come 
 near it, they would have surrounded it, and none would have had the 
 sight of it but those that were close to it; but, as it was put at such 
 a distance before them, they would all have the satisfaction of seeing 
 it, and would be animated by the sight. And it was with good reason 
 that this provision was made for their encouragement: <I>For you have 
 not passed this way heretofore.</I> This had been the character of all 
 their way through the wilderness, it was an untrodden path, but this 
 especially through Jordan.  While we are here we must expect and 
 prepare for unusual events, to pass ways that we have not passed 
 before, and much more when we go hence; our way through the <I>valley 
 of the shadow of death</I> is a way we have not gone before, which 
 makes it the more formidable. But, if we have the assurance of God's 
 presence, we need not fear; that will furnish us with such strength as 
 we never had when we come to do a work we never did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They were commanded to sanctify themselves, that they might be 
 prepared to attend the ark; and with good reason: For <I>to-morrow the 
 Lord will do wonders among you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 See how magnificently he speaks of God's works: he <I>doeth
 wonders,</I> and is therefore to be adored, admired, and trusted in. 
 See how intimately acquainted Joshua was with the divine counsels: he 
 could tell before-hand what god would do, and when. See what 
 preparation we must make to receive the discoveries of God's glory and 
 the communications of his grace: we must sanctify ourselves. This we 
 must do when we are to attend the ark, and God by it is about to do 
 wonders among us; we must separate ourselves from all other cares, 
 devote ourselves to God's honour, and <I>cleanse ourselves from all 
 filthiness of flesh and spirit.</I> The people of Israel were now 
 entering into the holy land, and therefore must sanctify themselves. 
 God was about to give them uncommon instances of his favour, which by 
 meditation and prayer they must compose their minds to a very careful 
 observation of, that they might give God the glory, and take to 
 themselves the comfort, of these appearances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The priests were ordered to take up the ark and carry it <I>before 
 the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It was the Levites' work ordinarily to carry the ark,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:15">Num. iv. 15</A>.

 But on this great occasion the priests were ordered to do it. And they
 did as they were commanded, <I>took up the ark,</I> and did not think 
 themselves disparaged, <I>went before the people,</I> and did not thing 
 themselves exposed; the ark they carried was both their honour and 
 their defence. And now we may suppose that prayer of Moses used, when 
 the ark set forward

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+10:35">Num. x. 35</A>),

 <I>Rise up, Lord and let they enemies be scattered.</I> Magistrates are
 here instructed to stir up ministers to their work, and to make use of 
 their authority for the furtherance of religion. Ministers must 
 likewise learn to go before in the way of God, and not to shrink nor 
 draw back when dangers are before them. They must expect to be most 
 struck at, but they <I>know whom they have trusted.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to
 magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that,
 as I was with Moses, <I>so</I> I will be with thee.
 &nbsp; 8 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the
 covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of
 Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.
 &nbsp; 9 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and
 hear the words of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God.
 &nbsp; 10 And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God
 <I>is</I> among you, and <I>that</I> he will without fail drive out from
 before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and
 the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the
 Jebusites.
 &nbsp; 11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth
 passeth over before you into Jordan.
 &nbsp; 12 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of
 Israel, out of every tribe a man.
 &nbsp; 13 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet
 of the priests that bear the ark of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the Lord of all the
 earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, <I>that</I> the waters of
 Jordan shall be cut off <I>from</I> the waters that come down from
 above; and they shall stand upon a heap.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe here how God honours Joshua, and by this wondrous work 
 he is about to do designs to make Israel know that he is their 
 governor, and then how Joshua honours God and endeavours by it to make 
 Israel know that he is their God. Thus those that honour God he will 
 honour, and those whom he has advanced should do what they can in their 
 places to exalt him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God speaks to Joshua to put honour upon him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 1. It was a great honour God id him that he spoke to him as he had done
 to Moses from off the mercy-seat, before the priests removed it with 
 the ark.  This would make Joshua easy in himself and great among the 
 people, that God was pleased to speak so familiarly to him. 

 2. That he designed to <I>magnify him in the sight of all Israel.</I>
 He had told him before that he would be with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 5</A>),

 and that comforted him, but now all Israel shall see it, and this would
 magnify him. Those are truly great with whom God is and whom he employs 
 and owns in his service. God magnified him because he would have the 
 people magnify him. Pious magistrates are to be highly honoured and 
 esteemed as public blessings, and the more we see of God with them the 
 more we should honour them. By the dividing of the red Sea Israel was
 convinced that God was with Moses in bringing them out of Egypt; 
 therefore they are said to be <I>baptized unto Moses in the sea,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:2">1 Cor. x. 2</A>.

 And upon that occasion they <I>believed him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:31">Exod. xiv. 31</A>.

 And now, by the dividing of Jordan, they shall be convinced that God is
 in like manner with Joshua in bringing them into Canaan.  God had 
 magnified Joshua before on several occasions, but now he began to 
 magnify him as the successor of Moses in the government. Some have 
 observed that it was at the banks of Jordan that God began to magnify 
 Joshua, and at the same place he began to magnify our Lord Jesus as 
 Mediator; for John was baptizing at Bethabara, <I>the house of 
 passage,</I> and there it was that when our Saviour was baptized it was 
 proclaimed concerning him, <I>This is my beloved Son.</I> 

 3. That by him he gave orders to the priests themselves, though they
 were his immediate attendants

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt command the priests,</I> that is, "Thou shalt make known
 to them the divine command in this matter, and take care that they 
 observe it, to stand still at the brink of Jordan while the waters 
 part, that it may appear to be <I>at the presence of the Lord,</I> of 
 the mighty God of Jacob, that Jordan is <I>driven back,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:5,7">Ps. cxiv. 5, 7</A>.

 God could have divided the river without the priests, but they could
 not without him. The priests must herein set a good example to the 
 people, and teach them to do their utmost in the service of God, and 
 trust him for help in time of need.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Joshua speaks to the people, and therein honours God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He demands attention 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Come hither</I> to me, as many as can come within hearing, and,
 before you see the works, <I>hear the words of the Lord your God,</I> 
 that you may compare them together and they may illustrate each other." 
 He had commanded them to sanctify themselves, and therefore calls them 
 to <I>hear the word of God,</I> for that is the ordinary means of 
 sanctification,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:17">John  xvii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He now tells them, at length, by what way they should pass over 
 Jordan, by the stopping of its streams 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>The waters of Jordan shall be cut off.</I> God could by a sudden and
 miraculous frost have congealed the surface, so that they might all 
 have gone over upon the ice; but that being a thing sometimes done even 
 in that country by the ordinary power of nature

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:30">Job xxxviii. 30</A>),

 it would not have been such an honour to Israel's God, nor such a
 terror to Israel's enemies; it must therefore be done in such a way as 
 had no precedent but the dividing of the Red Sea: and that miracle is 
 here repeated, to show that God has the same power to finish the 
 salvation of his people that he had to begin it, for he is the 
 <I>Alpha</I> and the <I>Omega;</I> and that <I>the word of the Lord</I> 
 (as the Chaldee reads it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 the essential, eternal Word, was as truly with Joshua as he was with
 Moses.  And by the dividing of the waters from the waters, and the 
 making of the dry land to appear which had been covered, God would 
 remind them of that in which Moses by revelation had instructed them 
 concerning the work of creation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:6,9">Gen. i. 6, 9</A>),

 that by what they now saw their belief of that which they there read
 might be assisted, and they might know that the God whom they 
 worshipped was the same God that made the world and that it was the 
 same power that was engaged and employed for them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The people having been directed before to follow the ark are here 
 told that it should <I>pass before them into Jordan,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) The ark of the covenant must be their guide. During the reign of
 Moses, the cloud was their guide, but now, in Joshua's reign, the ark; 
 both were visible signs of God's presence and presidency, but divine 
 grace under the Mosaic dispensation was wrapt up as in a cloud and 
 covered with a veil, while by Christ, our Joshua, it is revealed in the 
 ark of the covenant unveiled.

 (2.) It is called <I>the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the
 earth.</I> "He that is your God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 in covenant with you, is the <I>Lord of all the earth,</I> has both
 right and power to command, control, use, and dispose of all nations 
 and of all creatures. He is the <I>Lord of all the earth,</I> therefore 
 he needs not you, nor can he be benefited by you; therefore it is your 
 honour and happiness to have him in covenant with you: if he be yours, 
 all the creatures are at your service, and when he pleases shall be 
 employed for you." When we are praising and worshipping God as Israel's 
 God, and ours through Christ, we must remember that he is the <I>Lord 
 of the whole earth,</I> and reverence him and trust in him accordingly. 
 Some observe an accent in the original, which they think directs us to 
 translate it somewhat more emphatically, <I>Behold the ark of the 
 covenant, even the ark of the Lord, or even of the covenant of the Lord 
 of all the earth.</I> 

 (3.) They are told that the ark should <I>pass before them into
 Jordan.</I> God would not appoint them to go any where but where he 
 himself would go before them and go with them; and they might safely 
 venture, even into Jordan itself, if the ark of the covenant led them. 
 While we make God's precepts our rule, his promises our stay, and his 
 providence our guide, we need not dread the greatest difficulties we 
 may meet with in the way of duty. That promise is sure to all the seed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:2">Isa. xliii. 2</A>),

 <I>When thou passes through the waters I will be with thee, and through
 the rivers they shall not overflow thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. From what God was now about to do for them he infers an assurance of 
 what he would yet further do. This he mentions first, so much was his 
 heart upon it, and so great a satisfaction did it give him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 "<I>Hereby you shall know that the living God</I> (the true God, and
 God of power, not one of the dead gods of the heathen) <I>is among 
 you,</I> though you see him not, nor are to have any image of him, is 
 among you to give you law, secure your welfare, and receive your 
 homage,--is among you in this great undertaking now before you; and
 therefore you shall, nay, he himself <I>will, without fail, drive out 
 from before you the Canaanites.</I>" So that the dividing of Jordan was 
 intended to be to them, 

 (1.) A sure token of God's presence with them.  By this they could not
 but <I>know that God was among them,</I> unless their unbelief was as 
 obstinate against the most convincing evidence as that of their fathers 
 was, who presently after God had divided the Red Sea before them, 
 impudently asked, <I>Is the Lord among us, or is he not?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:7">Exod. xvii. 7</A>.

 (2.) A sure pledge of the conquest of Canaan. "If the living God is
 among you, <I>expelling he will expel</I> (so the Hebrew phrase is) 
 <I>from before you the Canaanites.</I>" He will do it certainly, and do 
 it effectually. What should hinder him? What can stand in his way 
 before whom rivers are divided and dried up? The forcing of the lines 
 was certain presage of the ruin of all their hosts: how could they 
 stand their ground when Jordan itself was driven back? When they had 
 not courage to dispute this pass, but trembled at the approach of the 
 <I>mighty God of Jacob</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:7">Ps. cxiv. 7</A>),

 what opposition could they ever make after this? This assurance which
 Joshua here gives them was so well grounded that it would enable one 
 Israelite to chase a thousand Canaanites, and two to put then thousand 
 to flight; and it would be abundantly strengthened by remembering the 
 song of Moses, dictated forty years before, which plainly foretold the 
 dividing of Jordan and the influence it would have upon the driving out 
 of the Canaanites.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:15-17">Exod. xv. 15-17</A>,

 "<I>The inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away,</I> and so be
 effectually driven out; they shall be as still as a stone till thy 
 people pass over, and then thou shalt bring them in and plant them." 
 Note, God's glorious appearances for his church and people ought to be 
 improved by us for the encouragement of our faith and hope for the 
 future. <I>As for God, his work is perfect.</I> If Jordan's flood 
 cannot keep them our, Canaan's force cannot turn them out again.</P>

 5. He directs them to get twelve men ready, one of each tribe, who must 
 be within call to receive such orders as Joshua should afterwards give 
 them,

 It does not appear that they were to attend the priests, and walk with
 them when they carried the ark, that they might more immediately be 
 witnesses of the wonders done by it, as some think; but they were to be 
 at hand for the service they were called to,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their
 tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of
 the covenant before the people;
 &nbsp; 15 And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the
 feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of
 the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of
 harvest,)
 &nbsp; 16 That the waters which came down from above stood <I>and</I> rose
 up upon a heap very far from the city Adam, that <I>is</I> beside

 passed over right against Jericho.

 Here we have a short and plain account of the dividing of the river 
 Jordan, and the passage of the children of Israel through it. The story 
 is not garnished with the flowers of rhetoric (gold needs not to be 
 painted), but it tell us, in short, matter of fact.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That this river was now broader and deeper than usually it was at 
 other times of the year, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The melting of the snow on the mountains of Lebanon, near which this
 river had its rise, was the occasion that at the time of harvest, 
 barley-harvest, which was the spring of the year, Jordan overflowed all 
 his banks. This great flood, just at that time (which Providence might 
 have restrained for once, of which he might have ordered them to cross 
 at another time of the year) very much magnified the power of God and 
 his kindness to Israel. Note, Though the opposition given to the 
 salvation of God's people have all imaginable advantages, yet god can 
 and will conquer it. Let the banks of Jordan be filled to the brink, 
 filled till they run over, it is as easy to Omnipotence to divide them, 
 and dry them up, as if they were ever so narrow, ever so shallow; it is 
 all one with the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That as soon as ever the feet of the priests dipped in the brim of 
 the water the stream stopped immediately, as if a sluice had been led 
 down to dam it up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 So that the waters above swelled, stood on a heap, and ran back, and
 yet, as it should seem did not spread, but congealed, which 
 unaccountable rising of the river was observed with amazement by those 
 that live upward upon it many miles off, and the remembrance of it 
 remained among them long after: the waters on the other side this 
 invisible dam ran down of course, and left the bottom of the river dry 
 as far downward, it is likely, as they swelled upward.  When they 
 passed through the red Sea, the waters were a wall on either hand, here 
 only on the right-hand. Note, The God of nature can, when he pleases, 
 change the course of nature, and alter its properties, can turn fluids 
 into solids, <I>waters into standing rocks,</I> as, on the contrary, 
 <I>rocks into standing waters,</I> to serve his own purposes.  See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:5,8">Ps. cxiv. 5, 8</A>.

 What cannot God do? What will he not do for the perfecting of his
 peoples, salvation? Sometimes he <I>cleaves the earth with rivers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:9">Hab. iii. 9</A>),

 and sometimes, as here, cleaves the rivers without earth. It is easy to
 imagine how, when the course of this strong rapid stream was arrested 
 on a sudden, <I>the waters roared and were troubled,</I> so that the 
 mountains seemed to <I>shake with the swelling thereof</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:3">Ps. xlvi. 3</A>),

 how <I>the floods lifted up their voice, the floods lifted up their
 waves,</I> while the Lord on high showed himself <I>mightier than the 
 noise of</I> these <I>many waters,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:3,4">Ps. xciii. 3, 4</A>.

 With reference to this the prophet asks, <I>Was the Lord displeased
 against the rivers?  was thine anger against the rivers?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:8">Hab. iii. 8</A>.
 
 No, <I>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 In allusion to this, it is foretold, among the great things God will do
 for the gospel church in the latter days, that the great river 
 Euphrates shall be dried up, that <I>the way of the kings of the east 
 may be prepared,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+16:12">Rev. xvi. 12</A>.

 When the time has come for Israel's entrance into the land of promise
 all difficulties shall be conquered, <I>mountains shall become 
 plains</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:7">Zech. iv. 7</A>)

 and rivers become dry, for the <I>ransomed of the Lord to pass
 over.</I> When we have finished our pilgrimage through this wilderness, 
 death will be like this Jordan between us and the heavenly Canaan, but 
 the ark of the covenant has prepare us a way through it; it is the last 
 enemy that shall be destroyed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That <I>the people passed over right against Jericho,</I> which 
 was, 

 1. An instance of their boldness, and a noble defiance of their 
 enemies. Jericho was one of the strongest cities, and yet they dared to 
 face it at their first entrance. 

 2. It was an encouragement to them to venture through Jordan, for
 Jericho was a goodly city and the country about it extremely pleasant; 
 and, having that in view as their own, what difficulties could 
 discourage them from taking possession? 

 3. It would increase the confusion and terror of their enemies, who no 
 doubt strictly observed their motions, and were the amazed spectators 
 of this work of wonders.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That the priests <I>stood still in the midst of Jordan while all 
 the people passed over,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 There the ark was appointed to be, to show that the same power that
 parted the waters kept them parted as long as there was occasion; and 
 had not the divine presence, of which the ark was a token, been their 
 security, the waters would have returned upon them and buried them. 
 there the priests were appointed to stand still,

 1. To try their faith, whether they could venture to take their post, 
 when god assigned it to them, with mountains of water over their heads. 
 As they made a bold step when they set the first foot into Jordan, so 
 now they made a bold stand when they tarried longest in Jordan; but 
 they knew they carried their own protection with them.  Note, Ministers 
 in times of peril should be examples of courage and confidence in the 
 divine goodness. 

 2. It was to encourage the faith of the people, that they might go 
 triumphantly into Canaan, and <I>fear no evil,</I> no, not in this 
 <I>valley of the shadow of death</I> (for so the divided river was), 
 being assured of God's presence, which interposed between them and the 
 greatest danger, between them and the proud waters, which otherwise had 
 gone over their souls. Thus in the greatest dangers the saints are 
 <I>comforted</I> with <I>his rod and his staff,</I>
