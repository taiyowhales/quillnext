 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now king David was old <I>and</I> stricken in years; and they
 covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.
 &nbsp; 2 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for
 my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the
 king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that
 my lord the king may get heat.
 &nbsp; 3 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of
 Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the
 king.
 &nbsp; 4 And the damsel <I>was</I> very fair, and cherished the king, and
 ministered to him: but the king knew her not.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, as recorded in the foregoing chapter, had, by the great mercy of 
 God, escaped the sword of the destroying angel. But our deliverances 
 from or through diseases and dangers are but reprieves; if the candle 
 be not blown out, it will burn out of itself. We have David here 
 sinking under the infirmities of old age, and brought by them to the 
 gates of the grave. He that <I>cometh up out of the pit shall fall into 
 the snare;</I> and, one way or other, <I>we must needs die.</I> 

 1. It would have troubled one to see David so infirm. He as old, and 
 his natural heat so wasted that no clothes could keep him warm, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 David had been a valiant active man and a man of business, and very
 vehement had the flame always been in his breast; and yet now his blood 
 is chilled and stagnated, he is confined to his bed, and there can get 
 no heat. He was now seventy years old. Many, at that age, are as lively 
 and fit for business as ever; but David was now chastised for his 
 former sins, especially that in the matter of Uriah, and felt from his 
 former toils and the hardships he had gone through in his youth, which 
 then he made nothing of, but was now the worse for. <I>Let not the 
 strong man glory in his strength,</I> which may soon be weakened by 
 sickness, or at last will be weakened by old age. Let young people 
 <I>remember their Creator in the days of their youth,</I> before these 
 evil days come. What our hand finds to do for God, and our souls, and 
 our generation, let us do with all our might, because the night comes, 
 the night of old age, in which no man can work; and, when our strength 
 has gone, it will be a comfort to remember that we used it well. 

 2. It would have troubled one to see his physicians so weak and
 unskilful that they knew no other way of relieving him than by outward 
 applications. No cordials, no spirits, but,

 (1.) <I>They covered him with clothes,</I> which, where there is any 
 inward heat, will keep it in, and so increase it; but, where it is not, 
 they have none to communicate, no, not royal clothing. Elihu makes it a 
 difficulty to understand <I>how our garments are warm upon us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:17">Job xxxvii. 17</A>);

 but, if God deny his blessing, men <I>clothe themselves, and there is
 none warm</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:6">Hag. i. 6</A>),
 
 David here was not.

 (2.) They foolishly prescribed nuptials to one that should rather have 
 been preparing for his funeral 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>);

 but they knew what would gratify their own corruptions, and perhaps
 were too willing to gratify his, under colour of consulting his health. 
 His prophets should have been consulted as well as his physicians in an 
 affair of this nature. However, this might be excused then, when even
 good men ignorantly allowed themselves to have many wives. We now have 
 not so learned of Christ, but are taught that one man must have but one 
 wife

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:5">Matt. xix. 5</A>),

 and further that <I>it is good for a man not to touch a woman,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:1">1 Cor. vii. 1</A>.

 That Abishag was married to David before she lay with him, and was his
 secondary wife, appears from its being imputed as a great crime to 
 Adonijah that he desired to marry her

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I
 will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and
 fifty men to run before him.
 &nbsp; 6 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying,
 Why hast thou done so? and he also <I>was a</I> very goodly <I>man;</I> and
 <I>his mother</I> bare him after Absalom.
 &nbsp; 7 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with
 Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 8 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and
 Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which
 <I>belonged</I> to David, were not with Adonijah.
 &nbsp; 9 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone
 of Zoheleth, which <I>is</I> by En-rogel, and called all his brethren
 the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:
 &nbsp; 10 But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and
 Solomon his brother, he called not.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David had much affliction in his children. Amnon and Absalom had both 
 been his grief; the one his first-born, the other his third, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:2,3">2 Sam. iii. 2, 3</A>.

 His second, whom he had by Abigail, we will suppose he had comfort in;
 his fourth was Adonijah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:4">2 Sam. iii. 4</A>);

 he was one of those that were born in Hebron; we have heard nothing of
 him till now, and here we are told that he was a comely person, and 
 that he was next in age, and (as it proved) next in temper to Absalom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 And, further, that in his father's eyes he had been a jewel, but was
 now a thorn.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His father had made a fondling of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He had not displeased him at any time. It is not said that he never
 displeased his father; it is probably that he had done so frequently, 
 and his father was secretly troubled at his misconduct and lamented it 
 before God. But his father had not displeased him, by crossing him in 
 his humours, denying him any thing he had a mind to, or by calling him 
 to an account as to what he had done and where he had been, or by 
 keeping him to his book or his business, or reproving him for what he 
 saw or heard of that he did amiss; he never said to him, <I>Why hast 
 thou done so?</I> because he saw it was uneasy to him, and he could not 
 bear it without fretting. It was the son's fault that he was displeased 
 at reproof and took it for affront, whereby he lost the benefit of it; 
 and it was the father's fault that, because he saw it displeased him, 
 he did not reprove him; and now he justly smarted for indulging him. 
 Those who honour their sons more than God, as those do who keep them 
 not under good discipline, thereby forfeit the honour they might expect 
 from their sons.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He, in return, made a fool of his father. Because he was old, and 
 confined to his bed, he thought no notice was to be taken of him, and 
 therefore <I>exalted himself,</I> and said, <I>I will be king,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Children that are indulged learn to be proud and ambitious, which is
 the ruin of a great many young people. The way to keep them humble is 
 to keep them under. Observe Adonijah's insolence.

 1. He looked upon the days of mourning for his father to be at hand, 
 and therefore he prepared to succeed him, though he knew that by the 
 designation both of God and David Solomon was to be the man; for public 
 notice had been given of it by David himself, and the succession 
 settled, as it were by act of parliament, in pursuance of God's 
 appointment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:9,23:1">1 Chron. xxii. 9; xxiii. 1</A>.

 This entail Adonijah attempted by force to cut off, in contempt both of
 God and his father. Thus is the kingdom of Christ opposed, and there 
 are those that say, "We will not have him to reign over us." 

 2. He looked upon his father as superannuated and good for nothing, and
 therefore he entered immediately upon the possession of the throne. He 
 cannot wait till his father's head be laid low, but it must now be 
 said, <I>Adonijah reigns</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 and, <I>God save king Adonijah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 His father is not fit to govern, for he is old and past ruling, nor
 Solomon, for he is young, and not yet able to rule; and therefore 
 Adonijah will take the government upon him. It argues a very base and 
 wicked mind for children to insult over their parents because of the 
 infirmities of their age.

 3. In pursuance of this ambitious project,

 (1.) He got a great retinue 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>chariots and horsemen,</I> both for state and strength, to wait on
 him, and to fight for him.

 (2.) He made great interest with no less than Joab, the general of the 
 army, and Abiathar the high priest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 That he should make his court to those who by their influence in church
 and camp were capable of doing him great service is not strange; but we 
 may well wonder by what arts they could be drawn to follow him and help 
 him. They were old men, who had been faithful to David in the most
 difficult and troublesome of his times, men of sense and experience, 
 who, one would think, would not easily be wheedled. They could not 
 propose any advantage to themselves by supporting Adonijah, for they 
 were both at the top of their preferment and stood fast in it. They 
 could not be ignorant of the entail of the crown upon Solomon, which it 
 was not in their power to cut off, and therefore it was their interest 
 to oblige him. But God, in this matter, left them to themselves, 
 perhaps to correct them for some former misconduct with a scourge of 
 their own making. We are told

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 who those were that were of such approved fidelity to David that
 Adonijah had not the confidence so much as to propose his project to 
 them--Zadok, Benaiah, and Nathan. A man that has given proofs of his 
 resolute adherence to that which is good shall not be asked to do a bad 
 thing.

 (3.) He prepared a great entertainment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 at En-rogel, not far from Jerusalem; his guests were the king's sons,
 and the king's servants, whom he feasted and caressed to bring them 
 over to his party; but Solomon was not invited, either because he 
 despised him or because he despaired of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Such as serve their own belly, and will be in the interest of those
 that will feast them what side soever they are of, are an easy prey to 
 seducers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:18">Rom. xvi. 18</A>.

 Some think that Adonijah slew these sheep and oxen, even fat ones, for
 sacrifice, and that it was a religious feast he made, beginning his 
 usurpation with a show of devotion, as Absalom under the colour of a 
 vow

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:7">2 Sam. xv. 7</A>),

 which he might do the more plausibly when he had the high priest
 himself on his side. It is a pity that any occasion should ever be 
 given to say, <I>In nomine Domini incipit omne malam--In the name of 
 the Lord begins all evil,</I> and that all religious exercises should 
 be made to patronise all religious practices.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,
 saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth
 reign, and David our lord knoweth <I>it</I> not?
 &nbsp; 12 Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel,
 that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son
 Solomon.
 &nbsp; 13 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst
 not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying,
 Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit
 upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?
 &nbsp; 14 Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also
 will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.
 &nbsp; 15 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and
 the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto
 the king.
 &nbsp; 16 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And
 the king said, What wouldest thou?
 &nbsp; 17 And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy
 God unto thine handmaid, <I>saying,</I> Assuredly Solomon thy son
 shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.
 &nbsp; 18 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the
 king, thou knowest <I>it</I> not:
 &nbsp; 19 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in
 abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar
 the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy
 servant hath he not called.
 &nbsp; 20 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel <I>are</I> upon
 thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne
 of my lord the king after him.
 &nbsp; 21 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall
 sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be
 counted offenders.
 &nbsp; 22 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the
 prophet also came in.
 &nbsp; 23 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet.
 And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before
 the king with his face to the ground.
 &nbsp; 24 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah
 shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
 &nbsp; 25 For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat
 cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's
 sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and,
 behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king
 Adonijah.
 &nbsp; 26 But me, <I>even</I> me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and
 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not
 called.
 &nbsp; 27 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not
 showed <I>it</I> unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my
 lord the king after him?
 &nbsp; 28 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And
 she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
 &nbsp; 29 And the king sware, and said, <I>As</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth, that
 hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,
 &nbsp; 30 Even as I sware unto thee by the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel, saying,
 Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit
 upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.
 &nbsp; 31 Then Bathsheba bowed with <I>her</I> face to the earth, and did
 reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for
 ever.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the effectual endeavours that were used by Nathan and 
 Bathsheba to obtain from David a ratification of Solomon's succession, 
 for the crushing of Adonijah's usurpation. 

 1. David himself knew not what was doing. Disobedient children think
 that they are well enough off if they can but keep their good old 
 parents ignorant of their bad courses; but a <I>bird of the air will 
 carry the voice.</I> 

 2. Bathsheba lived retired, and knew nothing of it either, till Nathan
 informed her. Many get very comfortably through this world that know 
 little how the world goes. 

 3. Solomon, it is likely, knew of it, but was as a deaf man that heard
 not. Though he had years, and wisdom above his years, yet we do not 
 find that he stirred to oppose Adonijah, but quietly composed himself 
 and left it to God and his friends to order the matter. Hence David, in 
 his Psalm for Solomon, observes that while men, in pursuit of the 
 world, in vain <I>rise early and sit up late, God giveth his 
 beloved</I> (his <I>Jedidiahs</I>) <I>sleep,</I> in giving them to be 
 easy, and to gain their point without agitation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:1,2">Ps. cxxvii. 1, 2</A>.

 How then is the design brought about?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Nathan the prophet alarms Bathsheba by acquainting her with the 
 case, and puts her in a way to get an order from the king for the 
 confirming of Solomon's title. He was concerned, because he knew God's 
 mind, and David's and Israel's interest; it was by him that God had 
 named Solomon <I>Jedidiah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:25">2 Sam. xii. 25</A>),

 and therefore he could not sit still and see the throne usurped, which
 he knew was Solomon's right by the will of him from whom promotion 
 cometh. When crowns were disposed of by immediate direction from 
 heaven, no marvel that prophets were so much interested and employed in 
 that matter; but now that common providence rules the affairs of the 
 kingdom of men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:32">Dan. iv. 32</A>)

 the subordinate agency must be left to common persons, and let not
 prophets intermeddle in them, but keep to the affairs of the kingdom of 
 God among men. Nathan applied to Bathsheba, as one that had the 
 greatest concern for Solomon, and could have the freest access to 
 David. He informed her of Adonijah's attempt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and that it was not with David's consent or knowledge. He suggested to
 her that not only Solomon was in danger of losing the crown, but that 
 he and she too were in danger of losing their lives if Adonijah 
 prevailed. A humble spirit may be indifferent to a crown, and may be 
 content, notwithstanding the prospect of it, to sit down short of the 
 possession of it. But the law of self-preservation, and the sixth 
 commandment, obliges us to use all possible endeavours to secure our 
 own life and the life of others. Now, says Nathan, let me <I>give thee 
 counsel how to save thy own life and the life of thy son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 Such as this is the counsel that Christ's ministers give us in his
 name, to give all diligence, not only <I>that no man take our crown</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:11">Rev. iii. 11</A>),

 but that we <I>save our lives,</I> even the lives of our souls. He
 directs her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>)

 to go to the king, to remind him of his word and oath, that Solomon
 should be his successor; and to ask him in the most humble manner, 
 <I>Why doth Adonijah reign?</I> He thought David was not so cold but 
 this would warm him. Conscience, as well as a sense of honour, would 
 put life into him upon such an occasion as this; and he promised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)

 that, while she was reasoning with the king in this matter, he would
 come in and second her, as if he came accidentally, which perhaps the 
 king might look upon as a special providence (and he was one that took 
 notice of such evidences,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:32,33">1 Sam. xxv. 32, 33</A>),

 or, at least, it would help to awaken him so much the more.</P>

 II. Bathsheba, according to Nathan's advice and direction, loses no 
 time, but immediately makes her application to the king, on the same 
 errand on which Esther came to king Ahasuerus, to intercede for her 
 life. She needed not wait for a call as Esther did, she knew she should 
 be welcome at any time; but it is remarked that when she visited the 
 king Abishag was ministering to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 and Bathsheba took no displeasure either at him or her for it, also
 that she <I>bowed and did obeisance to the king</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 in token of her respect to him both as her prince and as her husband;
 such a genuine daughter was she of Sarah, who obeyed Abraham, calling 
 him <I>lord.</I> Those that would find favour with superiors mush show 
 them reverence, and be dutiful to those whom they expect to be kind to 
 them. Her address to the king, on this occasion, is very discreet. 

 1. She reminded him of his promise made to her and confirmed with a
 solemn oath, that Solomon should succeed him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 She knew how fast this would hold such a conscientious man as David
 was.

 2. She informed him of Adonijah's attempt, which he was ignorant of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "Adonijah reigns, in competition with thee for the present and in
 contradiction to thy promise for the future. The fault is not thine, 
 for thou knewest it not; but now that thou knowest it thou wilt, in 
 pursuance of thy promise, take care to suppress this usurpation." She 
 told him who were Adonijah's guests, and who were in his interest, and 
 added, but "<I>Solomon thy servant has he not called,</I> which plainly 
 shows he looks upon him as his rival, and aims to undermine him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.
 
 It is not an oversight, but a contempt of the act of settlement, that
 Solomon is neglected." 

 3. She pleads that it is very much in his power to obviate this
 mischief

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>The eyes of all Israel are upon thee,</I> not only as a <I>king,</I>
 for we cannot suppose it the prerogative of any prince to bequeath his 
 subjects by will (as if they were his goods and chattels) to whom he 
 pleases, but as a <I>prophet.</I> All Israel knew that David was not 
 only himself <I>the anointed of the God of Jacob,</I> but that the 
 <I>Spirit of the Lord spoke by him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:1,2">2 Sam. xxiii. 1, 2</A>),

 and therefore waiting for and depending upon a divine designation, in a
 matter of such importance, David's word would be an oracle and a law to 
 them; this therefore (says Bathsheba) they expect, and it will end the 
 controversy and effectually quash all Adonijah's pretensions. <I>A 
 divine sentence is in the lips of the king.</I> Note, Whatever power, 
 interest or influence, men have, they ought to improve it to the utmost 
 for the preserving and advancing of the kingdom of the Messiah, of 
 which Solomon's kingdom was a type. 

 4. She suggested the imminent peril which she and her son would be in
 if this matter was not settled in David's life-time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 "If Adonijah prevail, as he is likely to do (having Joab the general
 and Abiathar the priest on his side) unless speedily suppressed, 
 Solomon and all his friends will be looked upon as traitors and dealt 
 with accordingly." Usurpers are most cruel. If Adonijah had got into 
 the throne, he would not have dealt so fairly with Solomon as Solomon 
 did with him. Those hazard everything who stand in the way of such as 
 against right force their entrance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Nathan the prophet, according to his promise, seasonably stepped 
 in, and seconded her, while she was speaking, before the king had given 
 his answer, lest, if he had heard Bathsheba's representation only, his
 answer should be dilatory and only that he would consider of it: but 
 out of the mouth of two witnesses, two such witnesses, the word would 
 be established, and he would immediately give positive orders. The king 
 is told that Nathan the prophet has come, and he is sure to be always 
 welcome to the king, especially when either he is not well or has any 
 great affair upon his thoughts; for, in either case, a prophet will be, 
 in a particular manner, serviceable to him. Nathan knows he must render 
 honour to whom honour is due, and therefore pays the king the same 
 respect now that he finds him sick in bed as he would have done if he 
 had found him in his throne: He <I>bowed himself with his face to the 
 ground,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 He deals a little more plainly with the king than Bathsheba had done.
 In this his character would support him, and the present languor of the 
 king's spirits made it necessary that they should be roused.

 1. He makes the same representation of Adonijah's attempt as Bathsheba
 had made

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>),

 adding that his party had already got to such a height of assurance as
 to shout, <I>God save king Adonijah,</I> as if king David were already 
 dead, taking notice also that they had not invited him to their feast 
 (<I>Me thy servant has he not called</I>), thereby intimating that they
 resolved not to consult either God or David in the matter, for Nathan 
 was <I>secretioribus consiliis--intimately acquainted with the mind of 
 both.</I> 

 2. He makes David sensible how much he was concerned to clear himself
 from having a hand in it: <I>Hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after 
 me?</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),
 
 and again
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 "<I>Is this thing done by my lord the king?</I> If it be, he is not so
 faithful either to God's word or to his own as we all took him to be; 
 if it be not, it is high time that we witness against the usurpation, 
 and declare Solomon his successor. If it be, why is not Nathan made 
 acquainted with it, who is not only in general, the king's confidant, 
 but is particularly concerned in this matter, having been employed to 
 notify to David the mind of God concerning the succession; but, if my 
 lord the king knows nothing of the matter (as certainly he does not), 
 what daring insolence are Adonijah and his party guilty of!" Thus he 
 endeavoured to incense David against them, that he might act the more 
 vigorously for the support of Solomon's interest. Note, Good men would 
 do their duty if they were reminded of it, and put upon it, and told 
 what occasion there is for them to appear; and those who thus are their 
 remembrancers do them a real kindness, as Nathan here did to David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. David, hereupon, made a solemn declaration of his firm adherence to
 his former resolution, that Solomon should be his successor. Bathsheba 
 is called in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 and to her, as acting for and on behalf of her son, the king gives
 these fresh assurances. 

 1. He repeats his former promise and oath, owns that he had <I>sworn
 unto her by the Lord God of Israel that Solomon would reign after 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 Though he is old, and his memory begins to fail him, yet he remembers
 this. Note, An oath is so sacred a thing that the obligations of it 
 cannot be broken, and so solemn a thing that the impressions of it, one 
 would think, cannot be forgotten.

 2. He ratifies it with another, because the occasion called for it:
 <I>As the Lord liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress, 
 even so will I certainly do this day,</I> without dispute, without 
 delay. His form of swearing seems to be what he commonly used on solemn 
 occasions, for we find it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+4:9">2 Sam. iv. 9</A>.

 And it carries in it a grateful acknowledgment of the goodness of God
 to him, in bringing him safely through the many difficulties and 
 hardships which had lain in his way, and which he now makes mention of 
 to the glory of God (as Jacob, when he lay a dying, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:16">Gen. xlviii. 16</A>),

 thus setting to his seal, from his own experience, that that was true
 which the Spirit of the Lord spoke by him. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:22">Ps. xxxiv. 22</A>,

 <I>The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants.</I> Dying saints ought
 to be witnesses for God, and speak of him as they have found. Perhaps 
 he speaks thus, on this occasion, for the encouragement of his son and 
 successor to trust in God in the distresses he also might meet 
 with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Bathsheba receives these assurances

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 1. With great complaisance to the king's person; she did reverence to
 him; while Adonijah and his party affronted him. 

 2. With hearty good wishes for the king's health; <I>Let him live.</I>
 So far was she from thinking that he lived too long that she prayed he 
 might live for ever, if it were possible, to adorn the crown he wore 
 and to be a blessing to his people. We should earnestly desire the 
 prolonging of useful lives, however it may be the postponing of any 
 advantages of our own.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>32 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan
 the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came
 before the king.
 &nbsp; 33 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of
 your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule,
 and bring him down to Gihon:
 &nbsp; 34 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him
 there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say,
 God save king Solomon.
 &nbsp; 35 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit
 upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have
 appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
 &nbsp; 36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,
 Amen: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of my lord the king say so <I>too.</I>
 &nbsp; 37 As the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath been with my lord the king, even so be he
 with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my

 &nbsp; 38 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the
 son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went
 down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and
 brought him to Gihon.
 &nbsp; 39 And Zadok the priest took a horn of oil out of the
 tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and
 all the people said, God save king Solomon.
 &nbsp; 40 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped
 with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent
 with the sound of them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the effectual care David took both to secure Solomon's 
 right and to preserve the public peace, by crushing Adonijah's project 
 in the bud. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The express orders he gave for the proclaiming of Solomon. The 
 persons he entrusted with this great affair were Zadok, Nathan, and 
 Benaiah, men of power and interest whom David had always reposed a 
 confidence in and found faithful to him, and whom Adonijah had passed 
 by in his invitation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 David orders them forthwith, with all possible solemnity, to proclaim
 Solomon. They must take with them <I>the servants of their lord,</I> 
 the lifeguards, and all the servants of the household. They must set 
 Solomon on the mule the king used to ride, for he kept not such stables 
 of horses as his son afterwards did. He appoints them whither to go

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:33-35"><I>v.</I> 33 and <I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>),

 and what to do.

 1. Zadok and Nathan, the two ecclesiastical persons, must, in God's
 name, anoint him king; for though he was not the first of his family, 
 as Saul and David were, yet he was a younger son, was made king by 
 divine appointment, and his title was contested, which made it 
 necessary that hereby it should be settled. This unction was typical of 
 the designation and qualification of the Messiah, or Christ, the 
 anointed one, on whom the Spirit, that oil of gladness, was poured 
 without measure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:9,Ps+89:20">Heb. i. 9; Ps. lxxxix. 20</A>.

 And all Christians, being <I>heirs of the kingdom</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:5">Jam. ii. 5</A>),

 do from him <I>receive the anointing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:27">1 John ii. 27</A>.

 2. The great officers, civil and military, are ordered to give public
 notice of this, and to express the public joy upon this occasion by 
 sound of trumpet, by which the law of Moses directed the gracing of 
 great solemnities; to this must be added the acclamations of the 
 people: "<I>Let king Solomon live,</I> let him prosper, let his kingdom 
 be established and perpetuated, and let him long continue in the 
 enjoyment of it;" so it had been promised concerning him. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:15">Ps. lxxii. 15</A>,

 <I>He shall live.</I> 

 3. They must then bring him in state to the city of David, and he must
 sit upon the throne of his father, as his substitute now, or viceroy, 
 to despatch public business during his weakness and be his successor 
 after his death: <I>He shall be king in my stead.</I> It would be a 
 great satisfaction to David himself, and to all parties concerned, to 
 have this done immediately, that upon the demise of the king there 
 might be no dispute, or agitation, in the public affairs. David was far 
 from grudging his successor the honour of appearing such in his 
 life-time, and yet perhaps was so taken up with his devotions on his 
 sick-bed that, if he had not been put in mind of it by others, this 
 great good work, which was so necessary to the public repose, would 
 have been left undone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The great satisfaction which Benaiah, in the name of the rest,
 professed in these orders. The king said, "Solomon shall reign for me, 
 and reign after me." "Amen" (says Benaiah heartily); "as the king says,
 so say we; we are entirely satisfied in the nomination, and concur in 
 the choice, we give our vote for Solomon, <I>nemine 
 contradicente--unanimously,</I> and since we can bring nothing to pass, 
 much less establish it, without the concurrence of a propitious 
 providence, <I>The Lord God of my lord the king say so too!</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.
 
 This is the language of his faith in that promise of God on which
 Solomon's government was founded. If we say as God says in his word, we 
 may hope that he will say as we say by his providence. To this he adds 
 a prayer for Solomon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 that God would be with him as he had been with David, and make his
 throne greater. He knew David was not one of those that envy their 
 children's greatness, and that therefore he would not be disquieted at 
 this prayer, nor take it as an affront, but would heartily say 
 <I>Amen</I> to it. The wisest and best man in the world desires his 
 children may be wiser and better than he, for he himself desires to be 
 wiser and better than he is; and wisdom and goodness are true 
 greatness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The immediate execution of these orders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:38-40"><I>v.</I> 38-40</A>.

 No time was lost, but Solomon was brought in state to the place
 appointed, and there Zadok (who, though he was not as yet high priest, 
 was, we may suppose, the suffragan, the Jews called him the 
 <I>sagan,</I> or second priest) anointed him by the direction of Nathan 
 the prophet and David the king,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 In the tabernacle, where the ark was now lodged, was kept among other
 sacred things, the holy oil for many religious services thence Zadok 
 took a <I>horn of oil,</I> which denotes both power and plenty, and 
 therewith anointed Solomon. We do not find that Abiathar pretended to 
 anoint Adonijah: he was made king by a feast, not by an unction. Whom 
 God calls, he will qualify, which was signified by the anointing; 
 usurpers had it not. <I>Christ</I> signifies <I>anointed,</I> and he is 
 the king whom God hath <I>set upon his holy hill of Sion,</I> according 
 to decree,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6,7">Ps. ii. 6, 7</A>.

 Christians also are <I>made to our God</I> (and <I>by</I> him)
 <I>kings,</I> and they have an <I>unction from the Holy One,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:20">1 John ii. 20</A>.

 The people, hereupon, express their great joy and satisfaction in the
 elevation of Solomon, surround him with their Hosannas--<I>God save 
 king Solomon,</I> and attend him with their music and shouts of joy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 Hereby they declared their concurrence in the choice, and that he was
 not forced upon them, but cheerfully accepted by them. The power of a 
 prince can be little satisfaction to himself, unless he knows it to be 
 a satisfaction to his people. Every Israelite indeed rejoices in the 
 exaltation of the Son of David.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>41 And Adonijah and all the guests that <I>were</I> with him heard
 <I>it</I> as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the
 sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore <I>is this</I> noise of the
 city being in an uproar?
 &nbsp; 42 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
 the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou
 <I>art</I> a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.
 &nbsp; 43 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord
 king David hath made Solomon king.
 &nbsp; 44 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan
 the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the
 Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride
 upon the king's mule:
 &nbsp; 45 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed
 him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so
 that the city rang again. This <I>is</I> the noise that ye have heard.
 &nbsp; 46 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
 &nbsp; 47 And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king
 David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name,
 and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed
 himself upon the bed.
 &nbsp; 48 And also thus said the king, Blessed <I>be</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of
 Israel, which hath given <I>one</I> to sit on my throne this day, mine
 eyes even seeing <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 49 And all the guests that <I>were</I> with Adonijah were afraid,
 and rose up, and went every man his way.
 &nbsp; 50 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went,
 and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
 &nbsp; 51 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth
 king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the
 altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will
 not slay his servant with the sword.
 &nbsp; 52 And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man,
 there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth: but if
 wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
 &nbsp; 53 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the
 altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon
 said unto him, Go to thine house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The tidings of Solomon's inauguration brought to Adonijah and his 
 party, in the midst of their jollity: <I>They had made an end of 
 eating,</I> and, it should seem, it was a great while before they made 
 an end, for all the affair of Solomon's anointing was ordered and 
 finished while they were at dinner, glutting themselves. Thus those who 
 <I>serve not our Lord Christ,</I> but oppose him, are commonly such as 
 <I>serve their own belly</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:18">Rom. xvi. 18</A>)

 and made <I>a god of it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:19">Phil. iii. 19</A>.

 Their long feast intimates likewise that they were very secure and
 confident of their interest, else they would not have lost so much 
 time. The old world and Sodom were <I>eating and drinking,</I> secure 
 and sensual, when their destruction came,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:26-29">Luke xvii. 26</A>,

 &c. When <I>they made an end of eating,</I> and were preparing
 themselves to proclaim their king, and bring him in triumph into the 
 city, they <I>heard the sound of the trumpet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 and a <I>dreadful sound it was in their ears,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:21">Job xv. 21</A>.

 Joab was an old man, and was alarmed at it, apprehending the city to be
 in an uproar; but Adonijah was very confident that the messenger, being 
 a <I>worthy man, brought good tidings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 Usurpers flatter themselves with the hopes of success, and those are
 commonly least timorous whose condition is most dangerous. But how can 
 those who do evil deeds expect to have good tidings? No, the worthiest 
 man will bring them the worst news, as the priest's son did here to 
 Adonijah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 "<I>Verily,</I> the best tidings I have to bring you is that <I>Solomon
 is made king,</I> so that your pretensions are all quashed." He relates 
 to them very particularly,

 1. With what great solemnity <I>Solomon was made king</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:44,45"><I>v.</I> 44, 45</A>),

 and that he was now <I>sitting on the throne of the kingdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.
 
 Adonijah thought to have stepped into the throne before him, but
 Solomon was too quick for him. 

 2. With what general satisfaction Solomon was made king, so that that
 which was done was not likely to be undone again.

 (1.) The people were pleased, witness their joyful acclamations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.
 
 (2.) The courtiers were pleased: <I>The kings servants</I> attended him
 with an address of congratulation upon this occasion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>.

 We have here the heads of their address: They <I>blessed king
 David,</I> applauded his prudent care for the public welfare, 
 acknowledged their happiness under his government, and prayed heartily 
 for his recovery. They also prayed for Solomon, that God would make
 his name better than his father's, which it might well be when he had 
 his father's foundation to build upon. A child, on a giant's shoulders, 
 is higher than the giant himself.

 (3.) The king himself was pleased: He <I>bowed himself upon the 
 bed,</I> not only to signify his acceptance of his servants' address, 
 but to offer up his own address to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>):

 "<I>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,</I> who, as Israel's God, for
 Israel's good, has brought this matter to such a happy issue, <I>my 
 eyes even seeing it.</I>" Note, It is a great satisfaction to good men, 
 when they are going out of the world, to see the affairs of their 
 families in a good posture, their children rising up in their stead to 
 serve God and their generation, and especially to see peace upon Israel 
 and the establishment of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The effectual crush which this gave to Adonijah's attempt. It 
 spoiled the sport of his party, dispersed the company, and obliged 
 every man to shift for his own safety. <I>The triumphing of the wicked 
 is short.</I> They were building a castle in the air, which, having no 
 foundation, would soon fall and crush them. They were afraid of being 
 taken in the fact, while they were together hatching their treason, and 
 therefore each one made the best of his way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The terror Adonijah himself was in, and the course he took to
 secure himself. He was now as much depressed as he had been elevated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:42,50"><I>v.</I> 42, 50</A>.

 He had despised Solomon as not worthy to be his guest

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 but now he dreads him as his judge: He <I>feared because of
 Solomon.</I> Thus those who oppose Christ and his kingdom will shortly 
 be made to tremble before him, and call in vain to rocks and mountains 
 to shelter them from his wrath. He <I>took hold on the horns of the 
 altar,</I> which was always looked upon as a sanctuary, or place of 
 refuge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:14">Exod. xxi. 14</A>),

 intimating hereby that he durst not stand a trial, but threw himself
 upon the mercy of his prince, in suing for which he relied upon no 
 other plea than the mercy of God, which was manifested in the 
 institution and acceptance of the sacrifices that were offered on that 
 altar and the remission of sin thereupon. Perhaps Adonijah had formerly 
 slighted the service of the altar, yet now he courts the protection of 
 it. Many who in the day of their security neglect the great salvation, 
 under the arrests of the terrors of the Lord would gladly be beholden 
 to Christ and his merit, and, when it is too late, will <I>catch hold 
 of the horns of the altar.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His humble address to Solomon for mercy. By those who brought
 Solomon tidings where he was, he sent a request for his life 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>):
 
 <I>Let king Solomon swear to me that he will not slay his servant.</I>
 He owns Solomon for his prince, and himself his servant, dares not
 justify himself, but <I>makes supplication to his judge.</I> It was a 
 great change with him. He that in the morning was grasping at a crown 
 is before night begging for his life. Then Adonijah reigned, now 
 Adonijah trembles, and cannot think himself safe unless Solomon 
 promise, with an oath, not to put him to death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The orders Solomon gave concerning him. He discharges him upon his
 good behaviour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:52,53"><I>v.</I> 52, 53</A>.

 He considered that Adonijah was his brother, and that it was the first
 offence. Perhaps, being so soon made sensible of his error and then not 
 persisting in his rebellion, he might prove not only a peaceable, but a 
 serviceable subject, and therefore, if he will conduct himself well for 
 the future, what is past shall be pardoned: but if he be fond 
 disaffected, turbulent, and aspiring, this offence shall be remembered 
 against him, he shall be called up upon his former conviction (as our 
 law speaks), and execution shall be awarded against him. Thus the Son 
 of David receives those to mercy that have been rebellious: if they 
 will return to their allegiance, and be faithful to their Sovereign, 
 their former crimes shall not be mentioned against them; but, if still 
 they continue in the interests of the world and the flesh, this will be 
 their ruin. Adonijah is sent for, and told upon what terms he stands, 
 which he signifies his grateful submission to, and then is told to go 
 to his house and live retired there. Solomon not only gave him his 
 life, but his estate, thus <I>establishing his throne by mercy.</I></P>
