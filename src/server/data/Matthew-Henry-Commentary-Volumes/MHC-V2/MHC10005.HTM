 How far Abner's deserting the house of Saul, his murder, and the murder 
 of Ish-bosheth, might contribute to the perfecting of the revolution, 
 and the establishing of David as king over all Israel, does not appear; 
 but, it should seem, that happy change followed presently thereupon, 
 which in this chapter we have an account of. Here is, 

 I. David anointed king by all the tribes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. Making himself master of the strong-hold of Zion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:6-10">ver. 6-10</A>.

 III.  Building himself a house and strengthening himself in his kingdom, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 IV. His children that were born after this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>.

 V.  His victories over the Philistines,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and
 spake, saying, Behold, we <I>are</I> thy bone and thy flesh.
 &nbsp; 2 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he
 that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said to
 thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a
 captain over Israel.
 &nbsp; 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and
 king David made a league with them in Hebron before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: and
 they anointed David king over Israel.
 &nbsp; 4 David <I>was</I> thirty years old when he began to reign, <I>and</I> he
 reigned forty years.
 &nbsp; 5 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months:
 and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all
 Israel and Judah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The humble address of all the tribes to David, beseeching him to
 take upon him the government (for they were now as sheep having no 
 shepherd), and owning him for their king. Though David might by no 
 means approve the murder of Ish-bosheth, yet he might improve the 
 advantages he gained thereby, and accept the applications made to him 
 thereupon. Judah had submitted to David as their king above seven years 
 ago, and their ease and happiness, under his administration, encouraged 
 the rest of the tribes to make their court to him. What numbers came 
 from each tribe, with what zeal and sincerity they came, and how they 
 were entertained for three days at Hebron, when they were all of one 
 heart to make David king, we have a full account,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:23-40">1 Chron. xii. 23-40</A>.
 
 Here we have only the heads of their address, containing the grounds
 they went upon in making David king. 

 1. Their relation to him was some inducement: "<I>We are thy bone and
 thy flesh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 not only thou art our bone and our flesh, not a stranger, unqualified
 by the law to be king

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+17:15">Deut. xvii. 15</A>),

 but we are thine," that is, "we know that thou considerest us as thy
 bone and thy flesh, and hast as tender a concern for us as a man has 
 for his own body, which Saul and his house had not.  <I>We are thy bone 
 and thy flesh,</I> and therefore thou wilt be as glad as we shall be to 
 put an end to this long civil war; and thou wilt take pity on us, 
 protect us, and do thy utmost for our welfare." Those who take Christ 
 for their king may thus plead with him: "<I>We are thy bone and thy 
 flesh,</I> thou hast made thyself in all things <I>like unto thy 
 brethren</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:17">Heb. ii. 17</A>);

 therefore be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:6">Isa. iii. 6</A>.

 2. His former good services to the public were a further inducement

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>When Saul was king</I> he was but the cypher, thou wast the figure,
 <I>thou wast he that leddest out</I> Israel to battle, and broughtest 
 them in in triumph; and therefore who so fit now to fill the vacant 
 throne?" He that is faithful in a little deserves to be entrusted with 
 more. Former good offices done for us should be gratefully remembered 
 by us when there is occasion. 

 3. The divine appointment was the greatest inducement of all: <I>The
 Lord said, Thou shalt feed my people Israel,</I> that is, thou shalt 
 rule them; for princes are to feed their people as shepherds, in every 
 thing consulting the subjects' benefit, feeding them and not fleecing 
 them. "And thou shalt be not only a king to govern in peace, but a 
 captain to preside in war, and be exposed to all the toils and perils 
 of the camp." Since God has said so, now at length, when need drives 
 them to it, they are persuaded to say so too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The public and solemn inauguration of David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 A convention of the states was called; all the elders of Israel came to
 him; the contract was settled, the <I>pacta conventa--covenants,</I> 
 sworn to, and subscribed on both sides. He obliged himself to protect 
 them as their judge in peace and captain in war; and they obliged 
 themselves to obey him. He <I>made a league</I> with them to which God 
 was a witness: it was <I>before the Lord.</I> Hereupon he was, for the 
 third time, anointed king. His advances were gradual, that his faith 
 might be tried and that he might gain experience. And thus his kingdom 
 typified that of the Messiah, which was to come to its height by 
 degrees; for <I>we see not yet all things put under him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:8">Heb. ii. 8</A>),

 but we shall see it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:25">1 Cor. xv. 25</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A general account of his reign and age. He was thirty years old 
 when he began to reign, upon the death of Saul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 At that age the Levites were at first appointed to begin their
 administration,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+4:3">Num. iv. 3</A>.
 
 About that age the Son of David entered upon his public ministry,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+3:23">Luke iii. 23</A>.

 Then men come to their full maturity of strength and judgment. He
 reigned, in all, forty years and six months, of which seven years and a 
 half in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Hebron had been famous,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+14:15">Josh. xiv. 15</A>.

 It was a priest's city. But Jerusalem was to be more so, and to be the
 holy city. Great kings affected to raise cities of their own, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:11,36,Ge+10:32-35">Gen. x. 11, 36, 32-35</A>.

 David did so, and Jerusalem was the city of David. It is a name famous
 to the end of the Bible

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:1-27">Rev. xxi.</A>),

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the
 Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David,
 saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt
 not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.
 &nbsp; 7 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same
 <I>is</I> the city of David.
 &nbsp; 8 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the
 gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind,
 <I>that are</I> hated of David's soul, <I>he shall be chief and
 captain.</I> Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not
 come into the house.
 &nbsp; 9 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David.
 And David built round about from Millo and inward.
 &nbsp; 10 And David went on, and grew great, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of hosts
 <I>was</I> with him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 If Salem, the place of which Melchizedec was king, was Jerusalem (as 
 seems probable from 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:2">Ps. lxxvi. 2</A>),

 it was famous in Abraham's time. Joshua, in his time, found it the
 chief city of the south part of Canaan,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:1-3">Josh. x. 1-3</A>.
 
 It fell to Benjamin's lot
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+18:28">Josh. xviii. 28</A>),

 but joined close to Judah's,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+15:8">Josh. xv. 8</A>.
 
 The children of Judah had taken it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:8">Judg. i. 8</A>),

 but the children of Benjamin suffered the Jebusites to dwell among them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+1:21">Judg. i. 21</A>),

 and they grew so upon them that it became a <I>city of Jebusites,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+19:11">Judg. xix. 11</A>.

 Now the very first exploit David did, after he was anointed king over
 all Israel, was to gain Jerusalem out of the hand of the Jebusites, 
 which, because it belonged to Benjamin, he could not well attempt till 
 that tribe, which long adhered to Saul's house

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+12:29">1 Chron. xii. 29</A>),
 
 submitted to him. Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The Jebusites' defiance of David and his forces. They said, 
 <I>Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in 
 hither,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 They sent David this provoking message, because, as it is said
 afterwards, on another occasion, they could not believe that <I>ever an 
 enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:12">Lam. iv. 12</A>.
 
 They confided either,

 1. In the protection of their gods, which David, in contempt, had
 called <I>the blind and the lame,</I> for <I>they have eyes and see 
 not, feet and walk not.</I> "But," say they, "these are the guardians 
 of our city, and except thou take these away (which thou canst never 
 do) thou canst not come in hither." Some think they were constellated 
 images of brass set up in the recess of the fort, and entrusted with 
 the custody of the place. They called their idols their <I>Mauzzim,</I> 
 or <I>strong-holds</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:38">Dan. xi. 38</A>)

 and as such relied on them. <I>The name of the Lord is our strong
 tower,</I> and his arm is strong, his eyes are piercing. Or, 

 2. In the strength of their fortifications, which they thought were
 made so impregnable by nature or art, or both, that the blind and the 
 lame were sufficient to defend them against the most powerful 
 assailant. The strong-hold of Zion they especially depended on, as that 
 which could not be forced.  Probably they set blind and lame people, 
 invalids or maimed soldiers, to make their appearance upon the walls, 
 in scorn of David and his men, judging them an equal match for him. 
 Though there remain but wounded men among them, yet they should serve 
 to beat back the besiegers.  Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+37:10">Jer. xxxvii. 10</A>.

 Note, The enemies of God's people are often very confident of their own
 strength and most secure when their day to fall draws nigh.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David's success against the Jebusites. Their pride and insolence, 
 instead of daunting him, animated him, and when he made a general 
 assault he gave this order to his men: "<I>He that smiteth the 
 Jebusites, let him also throw down into the ditch,</I> or gutter, 
 <I>the lame and the blind,</I> which are set upon the wall to affront 
 us and our God." It is probable they had themselves spoken blasphemous 
 things, and were therefore hated of David's soul. Thus 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>

 may be read; we fetch our reading of it from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+11:6">1 Chron. xi. 6</A>,

 which speaks only of smiting the Jebusites, but nothing of the blind
 and the lame. The Jebusites had said that if these images of theirs did 
 not protect them <I>the blind and the lame should not come into the 
 house,</I> that is, they would never again trust their palladium (so 
 Mr. Gregory understands it) nor pay the respect they had paid to their 
 images; and David, having gained the fort, said so too, that these 
 images, which could not protect their worshippers, should never have 
 any place there more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His fixing his royal seat in Sion. He himself dwelt in the fort 
 (the strength whereof, which had given him opposition, and was a terror 
 to him, now contributed to his safety), and he built houses round about 
 for his attendants and guards 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 from Millo (the town-hall, or state-house) and inward. He proceeded and
 prospered in all he set his hand to, grew great in honour, strength, 
 and wealth, more and more honourable in the eyes of his subjects and 
 formidable in the eyes of his enemies; for <I>the Lord God of hosts was 
 with him.</I> God has all creatures at his command, makes what use he 
 pleases of them, and serves his own purposes by them; and he was with 
 him, to direct, preserve, and prosper him, Those that have the Lord of 
 hosts for them need not fear what hosts of men or devils can do against 
 them. Those who grow great must ascribe their advancement to the 
 presence of God with them, and give him the glory of it. The church is 
 called <I>Sion,</I> and the <I>city of the living God.</I> The 
 Jebusites, Christ's enemies, must first be conquered and dispossessed, 
 the blind and the lame taken away, and then Christ divides the spoil, 
 sets up his throne there, and makes it his residence by the Spirit.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar

 &nbsp; 12 And David perceived that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had established him king
 over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people
 Israel's sake.
 &nbsp; 13 And David took <I>him</I> more concubines and wives out of
 Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons
 and daughters born to David.
 &nbsp; 14 And these <I>be</I> the names of those that were born unto him in

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. David's house built, a royal palace, fit for the reception of the
 court he kept and the homage that was paid to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The Jews were husbandmen and shepherds, and did not much addict
 themselves either to merchandise or manufactures; and therefore Hiram, 
 king of Tyre, a wealthy prince, when he sent to congratulate David on 
 his accession to the throne, offered him workmen to build him a house.  
 David thankfully accepted the offer, and Hiram's workmen built David a 
 house to his mind. Many have excelled in arts and sciences who were 
 strangers to the covenants of promise. Yet David's house was never the 
 worse, nor the less fit to be dedicated to God, for being built by the 
 sons of the stranger. It is prophesied of the gospel church, <I>The 
 sons of the strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall 
 minister unto thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:10">Isa. lx. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David's government settled and built up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 1. His kingdom was established, there was nothing to shake it, none to
 disturb his possession or question his title. He that made him king 
 established him, because he was to be a type of Christ, with whom God's 
 hand should be established, and his <I>covenant stand fast,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:21-28">Ps. lxxxix. 21-28</A>.

 Saul was made king, but not established; so Adam in innocency. David
 was established king, so is the Son of David, with all who through him 
 are made to our God <I>kings and priests.</I>

 2. It was exalted in the eyes both of its friends and enemies. Never
 had the nation of Israel looked so great or made such a figure as it 
 began now to do. Thus it is promised of Christ that he shall be 
 <I>higher than the kings of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:27">Ps. lxxxix. 27</A>.

 God has <I>highly exalted him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:9">Phil. ii. 9</A>.

 3.  David perceived, by the wonderful concurrence of providences to his
 establishment and advancement, that God was with him. <I>By this I know 
 that thou favourest me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:11">Ps. xli. 11</A>.

 Many have the favour of God and do not perceive it, and so want the
 comfort of it: but to be exalted to that and established in it, and to 
 perceive it, is happiness enough. 

 4.  He owned that it was for his people Israel's sake that God had done
 great things for him, that he might be a blessing to them and they 
 might be happy under his administration. God did not make Israel his 
 subjects for his sake, that he might be great, and rich, and absolute: 
 but he made him their king for their sake, that he might lead, and 
 guide, and protect them. Kings are <I>ministers of God to their people 
 for good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:4">Rom. xiii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. David's family multiplied and increased. All the sons that were 
 born to him after he came to Jerusalem are here mentioned together, 
 eleven in all, besides the six that were born to him before in Hebron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:2,5"><I>ch.</I> iii. 2, 5</A>.

 <I>There</I> the mothers are mentioned, not <I>here;</I> only, in
 general, it is said that he <I>took more concubines and wives,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Shall we praise him for this? We praise him not; we justify him not;
 nor can we scarcely excuse him. The bad example of the patriarchs might 
 make him think there was no harm in it, and he might hope it would 
 strengthen his interest, by multiplying his alliances, and increasing 
 the royal family. <I>Happy is the man that has his quiver full of these 
 arrows.</I> But one vine by the side of the house, with the blessing of 
 God, may send boughs to the sea and branches to the rivers. Adam, by 
 one wife, peopled the world, and Noah re-peopled it.  David had many 
 wives, and yet that did not keep him from coveting his neighbour's wife 
 and defiling her; for men that have once broken the fence will wander 
 endlessly. Of David's concubines, see

 and said, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me,
 as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that
 place Baal-perazim.
 &nbsp; 21 And there they left their images, and David and his men
 burned them.
 &nbsp; 22 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves
 in the valley of Rephaim.
 &nbsp; 23 And when David enquired of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, he said, Thou shalt not
 go up; <I>but</I> fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over
 against the mulberry trees.
 &nbsp; 24 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the
 tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself:
 for then shall the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> go out before thee, to smite the host of
 the Philistines.
 &nbsp; 25 And David did so, as the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had commanded him; and smote
 the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The particular service for which David was raised up was to <I>save 
 Israel out of the hand of the Philistines,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:18"><I>ch.</I> iii. 18</A>.

 This therefore divine Providence, in the first place, gives him an
 opportunity of accomplishing. Two great victories obtained over the 
 Philistines we have here an account of, by which David not only 
 balanced the disgrace and retrieved the loss Israel had sustained in 
 the battle wherein Saul was slain, but went far towards the total 
 subduing of those vexatious neighbours, the last remains of the devoted 
 nations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In both these actions the Philistines were the aggressors, stirred 
 first towards their own destruction, and pulled it on their own heads. 
 
 1. In the former they <I>came up to seek David</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 because they <I>heard that he was anointed king over Israel.</I> He
 that under Saul had slain his ten thousands, what would he do when he 
 himself came to be king! They therefore thought it was time to look 
 about them, and try to crush his government in its infancy, before it 
 was well settled.  Their success against Saul, some years ago, perhaps 
 encouraged them to make this attack upon David; but they considered not 
 that David had that presence of God with him which Saul had forfeited 
 and lost. The kingdom of the Messiah, as soon as ever it was set up in 
 the world, was thus vigorously attacked by the powers of darkness, who, 
 with the combined force both of Jews and Gentiles, made head against 
 it. The heathen raged, and the kings of the earth set themselves to 
 oppose it; but all in vain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1-12">Ps. ii. 1</A>,

 &c. The destruction will turn, as this did,
 upon Satan's own kingdom. They took counsel together, but were 
 <I>broken in pieces,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:9,10">Isa. viii. 9, 10</A>.

 2. In the latter they <I>came up yet again,</I> hoping to recover what 
 they had lost in the former engagement, and their hearts being hardened 
 to their destruction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 3. In both they <I>spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim,</I>
 which lay very near Jerusalem. That city they hoped to make themselves 
 masters of before David had completed the fortifications of it.  
 Jerusalem, from its infancy, has been aimed at, and struck at, with a 
 particular enmity. Their spreading themselves intimates that they were 
 very numerous and that they made a very formidable appearance. We read 
 of the church's enemies <I>going up on the breadth of the earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:9">Rev. xx. 9</A>),

 but the further they spread themselves the fairer mark they are to
 God's arrows.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In both, David, though forward enough to go forth against them (for 
 as soon as he heard it he <I>went down to the hold,</I> to secure some 
 important and advantageous post, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 yet entered not upon action till he had <I>enquired of the Lord</I> by
 the breast-plate of judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>,
 
 and again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 His enquiry was twofold:--

 1.  Concerning his duty: "<I>Shall I go up?</I> Shall I have a
 commission from heaven to engage them?" One would think he needed not 
 doubt this; what was he made king for, but to fight the battles of the 
 Lord and Israel? But a good man loves to see God going before him in 
 every step he takes. "Shall I go up <I>now?</I>" It is to be done, but 
 is it to be done at this time? <I>In all thy ways acknowledge him.</I> 
 And besides, though the Philistines were public enemies, yet some of 
 them had been his particular friends. Achish had been kind to him in 
 his distress, and had protected him. "Now," says David, "ought not I, 
 in remembrance of that, rather to make peace with them than to make war 
 with them?" "No," says God, "they are Israel's enemies, and are doomed 
 to destruction, and therefore scruple not, but <I>go up.</I>" 

 2.  Concerning his success. His conscience asked the former question,
 <I>Shall I go up?</I> His prudence asked this, <I>Wilt thou deliver 
 them into my hand?</I> Hereby he owns his dependence on God for 
 victory, that he could not conquer them unless God delivered them into 
 his hand, and refers his cause to the good pleasure of God: <I>Wilt 
 thou do it?</I> Yea, says God, <I>I will doubtless do it.</I> If God 
 send us, he will bear us out and stand by us. The assurance God has 
 given us of victory over our spiritual enemies, that he will tread 
 Satan under our feet shortly, should animate us in our spiritual 
 conflicts. We do not fight at uncertainty. David had now a great army 
 at command and in good heart, yet he relied more on God's promise than 
 his own force.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In the former of these engagements David routed the army of the 
 Philistines by dint of sword 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 He <I>smote them;</I> and when he had done, 

 1. He gave his God the glory; he said, "<I>The Lord has broken forth
 upon my enemies before me.</I> I could not have done it if he had not 
 done it before me; he opened the breach like the breach of waters in a 
 dam, which when once opened grows wider and wider." The principal part 
 of the work was God's doing; nay, he did all; what David did was not 
 worth speaking of; and therefore, <I>Not unto us, but unto the Lord, 
 give glory.</I> He hoped likewise that this breach, like that of 
 waters, was as the opening of the sluice, to let in a final desolation 
 upon them; and, to perpetuate the remembrance of it, he called the 
 place <I>Baal-perazim, the master of the breaches,</I> because, God 
 having broken in upon their forces, he soon had the mastery of them. 
 Let posterity take notice of it to God's honour. 

 2. He put their gods to shame. They brought the images of their gods
 into the field as their protectors, in imitation of the Israelites 
 bringing the ark into their camp; but, being put to flight, they could 
 not stay to carry off their images, for they were a <I>burden to the 
 weary beasts</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:1">Isa. xlvi. 1</A>),

 and therefore they left them to fall with the rest of their baggage
 into the hands of the conqueror. Their images failed them, and gave 
 them no assistance, and therefore they left their images to shift for 
 themselves. God can make men weary of those things that they have been 
 most fond of, and compel them to desert what they dote upon, and cast 
 even <I>the idols of silver and gold to the moles and the bats,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:20,21">Isa. ii. 20, 21</A>.

 David and his men converted to their own use the rest of the plunder,
 but the images they burnt, as God had appointed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:5">Deut. vii. 5</A>):

 "<I>You shall burn their graven images with fire,</I> in token of your
 detestation of idolatry, and lest they should be a snare." Bishop 
 Patrick well observes here that when the ark fell into the Philistines' 
 hands it consumed them, but, when these images fell into the hands of 
 Israel, they could not save themselves from being consumed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. In the latter of these engagements God gave David some sensible 
 tokens of his presence with him, bade him not fall upon them directly, 
 as he had done before, but <I>fetch a compass behind them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 1. God appoints him to draw back, as <I>Israel stood still to see the
 salvation of the Lord.</I> 

 2. He promised him to charge the enemy himself, by an invisible host of
 angels, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 "Thou shalt hear the <I>sound of a going,</I> like the march of an army
 in the air, <I>upon the tops of the mulberry trees.</I>" Angels tread 
 light, and he that can walk upon the clouds can, when he pleases, walk 
 on the tops of trees, or (as bishop Patrick understands it) at the head 
 of the mulberry-trees, that is, of the wood, or hedge-row of those 
 trees.  "And, by that sign, thou shalt know that <I>the Lord goes out 
 before thee;</I> though thou see him not, yet thou shalt hear him, and 
 faith shall come and be confirmed by hearing.  He goes forth <I>to 
 smite the host of the Philistines.</I>" When David had himself smitten 
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 he ascribed it to God: <I>The Lord has broken forth upon my
 enemies,</I> to reward him for which thankful acknowledgment the next 
 time God did it himself alone, without putting him to any toil or 
 peril. Those that own God in what he has done for them will find him
 doing more. But observe, Though God promised to <I>go before him and 
 smite the Philistines,</I> yet David, when he heard the sound of the 
 going must bestir himself and be ready to pursue the victory. Note, 
 God's grace must quicken our endeavours. If God work in us both to will 
 and to do, it does not follow that we must sit still, as those that 
 have nothing to do, but we must therefore, <I>work out our own 
 salvation</I> with all possible care and diligence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:12,13">Phil. ii. 12, 13</A>.
 
 The sound of the going was,

 (1.) A signal to David when to move; it is comfortable going out when 
 God goes before us. And, 

 (2.) Perhaps it was an alarm to the enemy, and put them into confusion. 
 Hearing the march of an army against their front, they retreated with 
 precipitation, and fell into David's army which lay behind them in 
 their rear. Of those whom God fights against it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:36">Lev. xxvi. 36</A>),
 
 <I>The sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them.</I>

 (3.) The success of this is briefly set down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 David observed his orders, waited till God moved, and stirred them, but
 not till then.  Thus he was trained up in a dependence on God and his 
 providence. God performed his promise, went before him, and routed all 
 the enemies' force, and David failed not to improve his advantages; he 
 smote the Philistines, even to the borders of their own country. When 
 the kingdom of the Messiah was to be set up, the apostles that were to 
 beat down the devil's kingdom must not attempt any thing till they 
 received the promise of the Spirit, who <I>came with a sound from 
 heaven as of a rushing mighty wind</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:2">Acts ii. 2</A>),

 which was typified by this sound of the going on the tops of the
 mulberry trees; and, when they heard that, they must bestir themselves, 
 and did so; they went forth conquering and to conquer.</P>
