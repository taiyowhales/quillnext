 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When the prophet had condemned Ephraim for lies and deceit he comforted 
 himself with this, that Judah yet "ruled with God, and was faithful 
 with the Most Holy," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:12">Hos. xi. 12</A>.

 It was a very melancholy view which the last chapter gave us of the
 desolations of Israel; but this chapter shows us the affairs of Judah 
 in a good posture at the same time, that it may appear God has not 
 quite cast off the seed of Abraham,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1">Rom. xi. 1</A>.

 Hezekiah is here upon the throne, 

 I. Reforming his kingdom,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II.  Prospering in all his undertakings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>),

 and this at the same time when the ten tribes were led captive, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.

 III. Yet invaded by Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:13">ver. 13</A>.

 1. His country put under contribution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:14-16">ver. 14-16</A>.

 2. Jerusalem besieged, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:17">ver. 17</A>.

 3. God blasphemed, himself reviled, and his people solicited to revolt,
 in a virulent speech made by Rabshakeh,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:18-37">ver. 18-37</A>.

 But how well it ended, and how much to the honour and comfort of our
 great reformer, we shall find in the next chapter.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah
 king of Israel, <I>that</I> Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah
 began to reign.
 &nbsp; 2 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and
 he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name
 also <I>was</I> Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
 &nbsp; 3 And he did <I>that which was</I> right in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 according to all that David his father did.
 &nbsp; 4 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut
 down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that
 Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did
 burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.
 &nbsp; 5 He trusted in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel; so that after him was
 none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor <I>any</I> that were
 before him.
 &nbsp; 6 For he clave to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>and</I> departed not from following
 him, but kept his commandments, which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded Moses.
 &nbsp; 7 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was with him; <I>and</I> he prospered whithersoever
 he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and
 served him not.
 &nbsp; 8 He smote the Philistines, <I>even</I> unto Gaza, and the borders
 thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a general account of the reign of Hezekiah. It appears, by 
 comparing his age with his father's, that he was born when his father 
 was about eleven or twelve years old, divine Providence so ordering 
 that he might be of full age, and fit for business, when the measure of 
 his father's iniquity should be full. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His great piety, which was the more wonderful because his father was 
 very wicked and vile, one of the worst of the kings, yet he was one of 
 the best, which may intimate to us that what good there is in any is 
 not of nature, but of grace, free grace, sovereign grace, which, 
 contrary to nature, grafts into the good olive that which was wild by 
 nature 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:24">Rom. xi. 24</A>),

 and also that grace gets over the greatest difficulties and
 disadvantages: Ahaz, it is likely, gave his son a bad education as well 
 as a bad example; Urijah his priest perhaps had the tuition of him; his 
 attendants and companions, we may suppose, were such as were addicted 
 to idolatry; and yet Hezekiah became eminently good. When God's grace 
 will work what can hinder it?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was a genuine son of David, who had a great many degenerate ones 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>He did that which was right, according to all that David his father
 did,</I> with whom the covenant was made, and therefore he was entitled 
 to the benefit of it. We have read of some of them who did that which 
 was right, <I>but not like David,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+14:3"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 3</A>.

 They did not love God's ordinances, nor cleave to them, as he did; but
 Hezekiah was a second David, had such a love for God's word, and God's 
 house, as he had. Let us not be frightened with an apprehension of the 
 continual decay of virtue, as if, when times and men are bad, they must 
 needs, of course, grow worse and worse; that does not follow, for, 
 after many bad kings, God raised up one that was like David 
 himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was a zealous reformer of his kingdom, and as we find 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:3">2 Chron. xxix. 3</A>)

 he began betimes to be so, fell to work as soon as ever he came to the
 crown, and lost no time. He found his kingdom very corrupt, the people 
 in all things too superstitious.  They had always been so, but in the 
 last reign worse than ever. By the influence of his wicked father, a 
 deluge of idolatry had overspread the land; his spirit was stirred 
 against this idolatry, we may suppose (as Paul's at Athens), while his 
 father lived, and therefore, as soon as ever he had power in his hands, 
 he set himself to abolish it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 though, considering how the people were wedded to it, he might think it
 could not be done without opposition.

 (1.) The images and the groves were downright idolatrous and of
 heathenish original. These he broke and destroyed.  Though his own 
 father had set them up, and shown an affection for them, yet he would 
 not protect them. We must never dishonour God in honour to our earthly 
 parents.

 (2.) The high places, though they had sometimes been used by the
 prophets upon special occasions and had been hitherto connived at by 
 the good kings, were nevertheless an affront to the temple and a breach 
 of the law which required them to worship there only, and, being from 
 under the inspection of the priests, gave opportunity for the 
 introducing of idolatrous usages. Hezekiah therefore, who made God's 
 word his rule, not the example of his predecessors, removed them, made 
 a law for the removal of them, the demolishing of the chapels, 
 tabernacles, and altars there erected, and the suppressing of the use 
 of them, which law was put in execution with vigour; and, it is 
 probable, the terrible judgments which the kingdom of Israel was now 
 under for their idolatry made Hezekiah the more zealous and the people 
 the more willing to comply with him. It is well when our neighbours' 
 harms are our warnings.

 (3.) The brazen serpent was originally of divine institution, and yet,
 because it had been abused to idolatry, he broke it to pieces. The 
 children of Israel had brought that with them to Canaan; where they set 
 it up we are not told, but, it seems, it had been carefully preserved, 
 as a memorial of God's goodness to their fathers in the wilderness and 
 a traditional evidence of the truth of that story, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:9">Num. xxi. 9</A>,

 for the encouragement of the sick to apply to God for a cure and of
 penitent sinners to apply to him for mercy. But in process of time, 
 when they began to worship the creature more than the Creator, those 
 that would not worship images borrowed from the heathen, as some of 
 their neighbours did, were drawn in by the tempter to burn incense to 
 the brazen serpent, because that was made by order from God himself and 
 had been an instrument of good to them. But Hezekiah, in his pious zeal 
 for God's honour, not only forbade the people to worship it, but, that 
 it might never be so abused any more, he showed the people that it was 
 <I>Nehushtan,</I> nothing else but <I>a piece of brass,</I> and that 
 therefore it was an idle wicked thing to burn incense to it; he then 
 broke it to pieces, that is, as bishop Patrick expounds it, ground it 
 to powder, which he scattered in the air, that no fragment of it might 
 remain. If any think that the just honour of the brazen serpent was 
 hereby diminished they will find it abundantly made up again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:14">John iii. 14</A>,

 where our Saviour makes it a type of himself. Good things, when
 idolized, are better parted with than kept.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Herein he was a nonesuch, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 None of all the kings of Judah were like him, <I>either before or after
 him.</I> Two things he was eminent for in his reformation:--

 (1.) Courage and confidence in God. In abolishing idolatry, there was
 danger of disobliging his subjects, and provoking them to rebel; but 
 <I>he trusted in the Lord God of Israel</I> to bear him out in what he 
 did and save him from harm. A firm belief of God's all-sufficiency to 
 protect and reward us will conduce much to make us sincere, bold, and 
 vigorous, in the way of our duty, like Hezekiah. When he came to the 
 crown he found his kingdom compassed with enemies, but he did not seek 
 for succour to foreign aids, as his father did, but trusted in the God 
 of Israel to be the keeper of Israel.

 (2.) Constancy and perseverance in his duty. For this there was none
 like him, that he clave to the Lord with a fixed resolution and never 
 <I>departed from following him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Some of his predecessors that began well fell off: but he, like Caleb,
 followed the Lord <I>fully.</I> He not only abolished all idolatrous 
 usages, but kept God's commandments, and in every thing made conscience 
 of his duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His great prosperity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 He was with God, and then God was with him, and, having the special
 presence of God with him, <I>he prospered whithersoever he went,</I> 
 had wonderful success in all his enterprises, in his wars, his 
 buildings, and especially his reformation, for that good work was 
 carried on with less difficulty than he could have expected. Those that 
 do God's work with an eye to his glory, and with confidence in his 
 strength, may expect to prosper in it. Great is the truth and will 
 prevail. Finding himself successful,

 1. He threw off the yoke of the king of Assyria, which his father had
 basely submitted to. This is called <I>rebelling against him,</I> 
 because so the king of Assyria called it; but it was really an 
 asserting of the just rights of his crown, which it was not in the 
 power of Ahaz to alienate. If it was imprudent to make this bold 
 struggle so soon, yet I see not that it was, as some think, unjust; 
 when he had thrown out the idolatry of the nations he might well throw 
 off the yoke of their oppression. The surest way to liberty is to serve 
 God. 

 2. He made a vigorous attack upon the Philistines, and smote them even
 unto Gaza, both the country villages and the fortified town, <I>the 
 tower of the watchmen and the fenced cities,</I> reducing those places 
 which they had made themselves masters of in his father's time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:18">2 Chron. xxviii. 18</A>.

 When he had purged out the corruptions his father had brought in he
 might expect to recover the possessions his father had lost. Of his 
 victories over the Philistines Isaiah prophesied,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:28-32">Isa. xiv. 28</A>,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah,
 which <I>was</I> the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of
 Israel, <I>that</I> Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against
 Samaria, and besieged it.
 &nbsp; 10 And at the end of three years they took it: <I>even</I> in the
 sixth year of Hezekiah, that <I>is</I> the ninth year of Hoshea king
 of Israel, Samaria was taken.
 &nbsp; 11 And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria,
 and put them in Halah and in Habor <I>by</I> the river of Gozan, and
 in the cities of the Medes:
 &nbsp; 12 Because they obeyed not the voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> their God, but
 transgressed his covenant, <I>and</I> all that Moses the servant of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> commanded, and would not hear <I>them,</I> nor do <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 13 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib
 king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah,
 and took them.
 &nbsp; 14 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to
 Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou
 puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto
 Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty
 talents of gold.
 &nbsp; 15 And Hezekiah gave <I>him</I> all the silver that was found in the
 house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and in the treasures of the king's house.
 &nbsp; 16 At that time did Hezekiah cut off <I>the gold from</I> the doors
 of the temple of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and <I>from</I> the pillars which Hezekiah
 king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The kingdom of Assyria had now grown considerable, though we never read 
 of it till the last reign. Such changes there are in the affairs of 
 nations and families: those that have been despicable become 
 formidable, and those, on the contrary, are brought low that have made 
 a great noise and figure. We have here an account,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of the success of Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, against Israel, his 
 besieging Samaria 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 taking it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and carrying the people into captivity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 with the reason why God brought this judgment upon them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord their God.</I> This
 was related more largely in the foregoing chapter, but it is here 
 repeated, 

 1. As that which stirred up Hezekiah and his people to purge out
 idolatry with so much zeal, because they saw the ruin which it brought 
 upon Israel. When their neighbour's house was on fire, and their own in 
 danger, it was time to cast away the accursed thing. 

 2. As that which Hezekiah much lamented, but had not strength to
 prevent.  Though the ten tribes had revolted from, and often been 
 vexatious to, the house of David, no longer ago than in his father's 
 reign, yet being of the seed of Israel he could not be glad at their 
 calamities. 

 3. As that which laid Hezekiah and his kingdom open to the king of
 Assyria, and made it much more easy for him to invade the land.  It is 
 said of the ten tribes here that they would neither <I>hear</I> God's 
 commandments nor <I>do</I> them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Many will be content to give God the hearing that will give him no more

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:31">Ezek. xxxiii. 31</A>),

 but these, being resolved not to do their duty, did not care to hear of
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of the attempt of Sennacherib, the succeeding king of Assyria, 
 against Judah, in which he was encouraged by his predecessor's success 
 against Israel, whose honours he would vie with and whose victories he 
 would push forward. The descent he made upon Judah was a great calamity 
 to that kingdom, by which God would try the faith of Hezekiah and 
 chastise the people, who are called <I>a hypocritical nation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:6">Isa. x. 6</A>),

 because they did not comply with Hezekiah's reformation, nor willingly
 part with their idols, but kept them up in their hearts, and perhaps in 
 their houses, though their high places were removed. Even times of 
 reformation may prove troublesome times, made so by those that oppose 
 it, and then the blame is laid upon the reformers. This calamity will 
 appear great upon Hezekiah if we consider, 

 1. How much he lost of his country, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The king of Assyria took all or most of the fenced cities of Judah, the
 frontier-towns and the garrisons, and then all the rest fell into his 
 hands of course. The confusion which the country was put into by this 
 invasion is described by the prophet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:28-31">Isa. x. 28-31</A>.
 
 2. How dearly he paid for his peace. He saw Jerusalem itself in danger
 of falling into the enemies' hand, as Samaria had done, and was willing 
 to purchase its safety at the expense,

 (1.) Of a mean submission: "<I>I have offended</I> in denying the usual
 tribute, and am ready to make satisfaction as shall be demanded," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Where was Hezekiah's courage? Where his confidence in God? Why did he
 not advise with Isaiah before he sent this crouching message?

 (2.) Of a vast sum of money-300 talents of silver and thirty of gold
 (above 200,000<I>l.</I>), not to be paid annually, but as a present 
 ransom. To raise this sum, he was forced not only to empty the public 
 treasures

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 but to take the golden plates off from the doors of the temple, and
 from the pillars, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Though <I>the temple sanctified the gold</I> which he had dedicated,
 yet, the necessity being urgent, he thought he might make as bold with 
 that as his father David (whom he took for his pattern) did with the 
 show-bread, and that it was neither impious nor imprudent to give a 
 part for the preservation of the whole. His father Ahaz had plundered 
 the temple in contempt of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:24">2 Chron. xxviii. 24</A>.

 He had repaid with interest what his father took; and now, with all due
 reverence, he only begged leave to borrow it again in an exigency and 
 for a greater good, with a resolution to restore it in full as soon as 
 he should be in a capacity to do so.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and
 Rab-shakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against
 Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they
 were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper
 pool, which <I>is</I> in the highway of the fuller's field.
 &nbsp; 18 And when they had called to the king, there came out to them
 Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which <I>was</I> over the household, and
 Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
 &nbsp; 19 And Rab-shakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
 saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence <I>is</I>
 this wherein thou trustest?
 &nbsp; 20 Thou sayest, (but <I>they are but</I> vain words,) <I>I have</I>
 counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust,
 that thou rebellest against me?
 &nbsp; 21 Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised
 reed, <I>even</I> upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into
 his hand, and pierce it: so <I>is</I> Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all
 that trust on him.
 &nbsp; 22 But if ye say unto me, We trust in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God: <I>is</I>
 not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath
 taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall
 worship before this altar in Jerusalem?
 &nbsp; 23 Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king
 of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou
 be able on thy part to set riders upon them.
 &nbsp; 24 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
 least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for
 chariots and for horsemen?
 &nbsp; 25 Am I now come up without the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> against this place to
 destroy it? The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said to me, Go up against this land, and
 destroy it.
 &nbsp; 26 Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah,
 unto Rab-shakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian
 language; for we understand <I>it:</I> and talk not with us in the
 Jews' language in the ears of the people that <I>are</I> on the wall.
 &nbsp; 27 But Rab-shakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy
 master, and to thee, to speak these words? <I>hath he</I> not <I>sent
 me</I> to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own
 dung, and drink their own piss with you?
 &nbsp; 28 Then Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the
 Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great
 king, the king of Assyria:
 &nbsp; 29 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he
 shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:
 &nbsp; 30 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, The
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered
 into the hand of the king of Assyria.
 &nbsp; 31 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
 Make <I>an agreement</I> with me by a present, and come out to me, and
 <I>then</I> eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig
 tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern:
 &nbsp; 32 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land,
 a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of
 oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and
 hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will deliver us.
 &nbsp; 33 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his
 land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
 &nbsp; 34 Where <I>are</I> the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where <I>are</I>
 the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered
 Samaria out of mine hand?
 &nbsp; 35 Who <I>are</I> they among all the gods of the countries, that
 have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?
 &nbsp; 36 But the people held their peace, and answered him not a
 word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
 &nbsp; 37 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which <I>was</I> over the
 household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the
 recorder, to Hezekiah with <I>their</I> clothes rent, and told him the
 words of Rab-shakeh.

 Here is, 

 I. Jerusalem besieged by Sennacherib's army, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He sent three of his great generals with a great host against
 Jerusalem. Is this the great king, the king of Assyria? No, never call 
 him so; he is a base, false, perfidious man, and worthy to be made 
 infamous to all ages; let him never be named with honour that could do 
 such a dishonourable thing as this, to take Hezekiah's money, which he 
 gave him upon condition he should withdraw his army, and then, instead 
 of quitting his country according to the agreement, to advance against 
 his capital city, and not send him his money again either. Those are 
 wicked men indeed, and, let them be ever so great, we will call them 
 so, whose principle it is not to make their promises binding any 
 further than is for their interest. Now Hezekiah had too much reason to 
 repent his treaty with Sennacherib, which made him much the poorer and 
 never the safer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Hezekiah, and his princes and people, railed upon by Rabshakeh, the
 chief speaker of the three generals, and one that had the most 
 satirical genius. He was no doubt instructed what to say by 
 Sennacherib, who intended hereby to pick a new quarrel with Hezekiah. 
 He had promised, upon the receipt of Hezekiah's money, to withdraw his 
 army, and therefore could not for shame make a forcible attack upon 
 Jerusalem immediately; but he sent Rabshakeh to persuade Hezekiah to
 surrender it, and, if he should refuse, the refusal would serve him for 
 a pretence (and a very poor one) to besiege it, and, if it hold out, to 
 take it by storm. Rabshakeh had the impudence to desire audience of the
 king himself at the conduit of the upper pool, without the walls; but 
 Hezekiah had the prudence to decline a personal treaty, and sent three 
 commissioners (the prime ministers of state) to hear what he had to 
 say, but with a charge to them not to answer that fool <I>according to 
 his folly</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>),

 for they could not convince him, but would certainly provoke him, and
 Hezekiah had learned of his father David to believe that God would hear 
 when he, <I>as a deaf man, heard not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:13-15">Ps. xxxviii. 13-15</A>.

 One interruption they gave him in his discourse, which was only to
 desire that he would speak to them now in the Syrian language, and they 
 would consider what he said and report it to the king, and, if they did 
 not give him a satisfactory answer, then he might appeal to the people, 
 by speaking <I>in the Jews' language,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 This was a reasonable request, and agreeable to the custom of treaties,
 which is that the plenipotentiaries should settle matters between 
 themselves before any thing be made public; but Hilkiah did not 
 consider what an unreasonable man he had to deal with, else he would 
 not have made this request, for it did but exasperate Rabshakeh, and
 make him the more rude and boisterous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Against all the rules of decency and honour, instead of treating with
 the commissioners, he menaces the soldiery, persuades them to desert or 
 mutiny, threatens if they hold out to reduce the to the last 
 extremities of famine, and then goes on with his discourse, the scope 
 of which is to persuade Hezekiah, and his princes and people, to 
 surrender the city. Observe how, in order to do this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He magnifies his master the king of Assyria. Once and again he calls 
 him <I>That great king, the king of Assyria,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:19,28"><I>v.</I> 19, 28</A>.

 What an idol did he make of that prince whose creature he was! God is
 the great King, but Sennacherib was in his eye a little god, and he 
 would possess them with the same veneration for him that he had, and 
 thereby frighten them into a submission to him. But to those who by 
 faith see the King of kings in his power and glory even the king of 
 Assyria looks mean and little.  What are the greatest of men when 
 either they come to compare with God or God comes to contend with them?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:6,7">Ps. lxxxii. 6, 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He endeavours to make them believe that it will be much for their 
 advantage to surrender. If they held out, they must expect no other 
 than to eat their own dung, by reason of the want of provisions, which 
 would be entirely cut off from them by the besiegers; but if they would 
 capitulate, seek his favour with a present and cast themselves upon his 
 mercy, he would give them very good treatment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 I wonder with what face Rabshakeh could speak of making an agreement
 with a present when his master had so lately broken the agreement 
 Hezekiah made with him with that great present, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Can those expect to be trusted that have been so grossly perfidious?
 But, <I>Ad populum phaleras</I>--<I>Gild the chain and the vulgar will 
 let you bind them.</I> He thought to soothe up all with a promise that 
 if they would surrender upon discretion, though they must expect to be 
 prisoners and captives, yet it would really be happy for them to be so. 
 One would wonder he should ever think to prevail by such gross 
 suggestions as these, but that the devil does thus impose upon sinners 
 every day by his temptations. He will needs persuade them,

 (1.) That their imprisonment would be to their advantage, for they
 should <I>eat every man of his own vine</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>);

 though the property of their estates would be vested in the conquerors,
 yet they should have the free use of them. But he does not explain it 
 now to them as he would afterwards, that it must be understood just as 
 much, and just as long, as the conqueror pleases.

 (2.) That their captivity would be much more to their advantage: <I>I
 will take you away to a land like your own land;</I> and what the 
 better would they be for that, when they must have nothing in it to 
 call their own?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That which he aims at especially is to convince them that it is to 
 no purpose for them to stand it out: <I>What confidence is this wherein 
 thou trustest?</I> So he insults over Hezekiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 To the people he says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 "<I>Let not Hezekiah deceive you</I> into your own ruin, for <I>he
 shall not be able to deliver you;</I> you must either bend or break." 
 It were well if sinners would submit to the force of this argument, in 
 making their peace with God--That it is <I>therefore</I> our wisdom to 
 yield to him, because it is in vain to contend with him: what 
 confidence is that which those trust in who stand it out against him? 
 <I>Are we stronger than he?</I> Or what shall we get by setting briars 
 and thorns before a consuming fire? But Hezekiah was not so helpless 
 and defenceless as Rabshakeh would here represent him. Three things he 
 supposes Hezekiah might trust to, and he endeavours to make out the 
 insufficiency of these:--

 (1.) His own military preparations: <I>Thou sayest, I have counsel and
 strength for the war;</I> and we find that so he had,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+32:3">2 Chron. xxxii. 3</A>.

 But this Rabshakeh turns off with a slight: "<I>They are but vain
 words;</I> thou art an unequal match for us," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 With the greatest haughtiness and disdain imaginable, he challenges him
 to produce 2000 men of all his people that know how to manage a horse, 
 and will venture to give him 2000 horses if he can. He falsely 
 insinuates that Hezekiah has no men, or none fit to be soldiers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Thus he thinks to run him down with confidence and banter, and will lay
 him any wager that one captain of the least of his master's servants is 
 able to baffle him and all his forces.

 (2.) His alliance with Egypt. He supposes that Hezekiah trusts to Egypt
 for chariots and horsemen

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 because the king of Israel had done so, and of this confidence he truly
 says, It is <I>a broken reed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 it will not only fail a man when he leans on it and expects it to bear
 his weight, but <I>it will run into his hand and pierce it,</I> and 
 rend his shoulder, as the prophet further illustrates this similitude, 
 with application to Egypt,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+29:6,7">Ezek. xxix. 6, 7</A>.

 So is the king of Egypt, says he; and truly so had the king of Assyria
 been to Ahaz, who trusted in him, but he <I>distressed him, and 
 strengthened him not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:20">2 Chron. xxviii. 20</A>.

 Those that trust to any arm of flesh will find it no better than a
 broken reed; but God is the rock of ages. 

 (3.) His interest in God and relation to him. This was indeed the 
 confidence in which Hezekiah trusts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 He supported himself by depending on the power and promise of God; with
 this he encouraged himself and his people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):
 
 <I>The Lord will surely deliver us,</I> and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 This Rabshakeh was sensible was their great stay, and therefore he was
 most large in his endeavours to shake this, as David's enemies, who 
 used all the arts they had to drive him from his confidence in God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:2,11:1">Ps. iii. 2; xi. 1</A>),
 
 and thus did Christ's enemies,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:43">Matt. xxvii. 43</A>.

 Three things Rabshakeh suggested to discourage their confidence in God,
 and they were all false:--

 [1.] That Hezekiah had forfeited God's protection, and thrown himself
 out of it, by <I>destroying the high places and the altars,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 Here he measures the God of Israel by the gods of the heathen, who
 delighted in the multitude of altars and temples, and concludes that 
 Hezekiah has given a great offence to the God of Israel, in confining 
 his people to one altar: thus is one of the best deeds he ever did in 
 his life misconstrued as impious and profane, by one that did not, or 
 would not, know the law of the God of Israel.  If that be represented 
 by ignorant and malicious men as evil and a provocation to God which is 
 really good and pleasing to him, we must not think it strange. If this 
 was to be sacrilegious, Hezekiah would ever be so.  

 [2.] That God had given orders for the destruction of Jerusalem at this
 time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>Have I now come up without the Lord?</I> This is all banter and
 rhodomontade. He did not himself think he had any commission from God 
 to do what he did (by whom should he have it?) but he made this 
 pretence to amuse and terrify the <I>people that were on the wall.</I> 
 If he had any colour at all for what he said, it might be taken from 
 the notice which perhaps he had had, by the writings of the prophets, 
 of the hand of God in the destruction of the ten tribes, and he thought 
 he had as good a warrant for the seizing of Jerusalem as of Samaria. 
 Many that have fought against God have pretended commissions from him. 
 
 [3.] That if Jehovah, the God of Israel, should undertake to protect
 them from the king of Assyria, yet he was notable to do it.  With this 
 blasphemy he concluded his speech

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+18:33-35"><I>v.</I> 33-35</A>),

 comparing the God of Israel with the gods of the nations whom he had
 conquered and putting him upon the level with them, and concluding that 
 because they could not defend and deliver their worshippers the God of 
 Israel could not defend and deliver his. See here, <I>First,</I> His 
 pride. When he conquered a city he reckoned himself to have conquered 
 its gods, and valued himself mightily upon it. His high opinion of the 
 idols made him have a high opinion of himself as too hard for them. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> His profaneness. The God of Israel was not a local 
 deity, but the God of the whole earth, the only living and true God, 
 the ancient of days, and had often proved himself to be above all gods; 
 yet he makes no more of him than of the upstart fictitious gods of 
 Hamath and Arpad, unfairly arguing that the gods (as some now say the 
 priests) of all religions are the same, and himself above them all. The 
 tradition of the Jews is that Rabshakeh was an apostate Jew, which made 
 him so ready in the Jews' language; if so, his ignorance of the God of 
 Israel was the less excusable and his enmity the less strange, for 
 apostates are commonly the most bitter and spiteful enemies, witness 
 Julian. A great deal of art and management, it must be owned, there 
 were in this speech of Rabshakeh, but, withal, a great deal of pride, 
 malice, falsehood, and blasphemy. One grain of sincerity would have 
 been worth all this wit and rhetoric.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> We are told what the commissioners on Hezekiah's part 
 did. 

 1. They held their peace, not for want of something to say both on
 God's behalf and Hezekiah's: they might easily and justly have 
 upbraided him with his master's treachery and breach of faith, and have 
 asked him, What religion encourages you to hope that such conduct will 
 prosper? At least they might have given that grave hint which Ahab gave 
 to Benhadad's like insolent demands--<I>Let not him that girdeth on the 
 harness boast as though he had put it off.</I> But the king had 
 commanded them not to answer him, and they observed their instructions.  
 There is a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak, and there 
 are those to whom to offer any thing religious or rational is to cast 
 pearls before swine. What can be said to a madman? It is probable that 
 their silence made Rabshakeh yet more proud and secure, and so his 
 heart was lifted up and hardened to his destruction. 

 2. They rent their clothes in detestation of his blasphemy and in grief
 for the despised afflicted condition of Jerusalem, the reproach of 
 which was a burden to them. 

 3. They faithfully reported the matter to the king, their master, and 
 <I>told him the words of Rabshakeh,</I> that he might consider what was 
 to be done, what course they should take and what answer they should 
 return to Rabshakeh's summons.</P>
