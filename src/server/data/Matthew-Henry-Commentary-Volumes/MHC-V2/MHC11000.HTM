 Many histories are books of kings and their reigns, to which the
 affairs of their kingdoms are reduced; this is a piece of honour that
 has commonly been paid to crowned heads. The holy Scripture is the
 history of the kingdom of God among men, under the several
 administrations of it; but there the King is one and his name one. The
 particular history now before us accounts for the affairs of the
 kingdoms of Judah and Israel, yet with special regard to the kingdom of
 God among them; for still it is a sacred history, much more instructive
 and not less entertaining than any of the histories of the kings of the
 earth, to which (those of them that are of any certainty) it is prior
 in time; for though there were kings in Edom before there was any king
 in Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:31">Gen. xxxvi. 31</A>

 (foreigners, in that point of state, got the precedency), yet the
 history of the kings of Israel lives, and will live, in holy Writ, to 
 the end of the world, whereas that of the kings of Edom is long since 
 buried in oblivion; for the honour that comes from God is durable, 
 while the honour of the world is like a mushroom, which comes up in a 
 night and perishes in a night.--The Bible began with the story of 
 patriarchs, and prophets, and judges, men whose converse with heaven 
 was more immediate, the record of which strengthens our faith, but is 
 not so easily accommodated to our case, now that we expect not visions, 
 as the subsequent history of affairs like ours under the direction of 
 common providence; and here also we find, though not many types and 
 figures of the Messiah, yet great expectations of him; for not only 
 prophets, but kings, desired to see the great mysteries of the gospel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:24">Luke x. 24</A>--The

 two books of Samuel are introductions to the books of the Kings, as
 they relate the origin of the royal government in Saul and of the royal 
 family in David. These two books give us an account of David's 
 successor, Solomon, the division of his kingdom, and the succession of 
 the several kings both of Judah and Israel, with an abstract of their 
 history down to the captivity. And as from the book of Genesis we may 
 collect excellent rules of economics, for the good governing of 
 families, so from these books we may collect rules of politics, for the 
 directing of public affairs. There is in these books special regard had 
 to the house and lineage of David, from which Christ came. Some of his 
 sons trod in his steps, and others did not. The characters of the kings 
 of Judah may be thus briefly given:--David the devout, Solomon the 
 wise, Rehoboam the simple, Abijah the valiant, Asa the upright, 
 Jehoshaphat the religious, Jehoram the wicked, Ahaziah the profane, 
 Joash the backslider, Amaziah the rash, Uzziah the mighty, Jotham the 
 peaceable, Ahaz the idolater, Hezekiah the reformer, Manasseh the 
 penitent, Amon the obscure, Josiah the tender-hearted, Jehoahaz, 
 Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah, all wicked, and such as brought 
 ruin quickly on themselves and their kingdom. The number of the good 
 and bad is nearly equal, but the reigns of the good were generally long 
 and those of the bad short, the consideration of which will make the 
 state of Israel not altogether so bad in this period as at first it 
 seems. In this first book we have, 
 
 I. The death of David,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:1-2:46"><I>ch.</I> i. and ii.</A>

 II. The glorious reign of Solomon, and his building the temple

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:1-10:29"><I>ch.</I> iii.-x.</A>),

 but the cloud his sun set under,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:1-43"><I>ch.</I> xi.</A>

 III. The division of the kingdoms in Rehoboam, and his reign and
 Jeroboam's,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+12:1-14:31"><I>ch.</I> xii.-xi<I>v.</I></A>

 IV. The reigns of Abijah and Asa over Judah, Baasha and Omri over
 Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:1-16:34"><I>ch.</I> xv. and xvi.</A>

 V. Elijah's miracles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:1-19:21"><I>ch.</I> xvii.-xix.</A>

 VI. Ahab's success against Benhadad, his wickedness and fall,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:1-22:53"><I>ch.</I> xx.-xxii.</A>

 And in all this history it appears that kings, though gods to us, are
 men to God, mortal and accountable.</P>
