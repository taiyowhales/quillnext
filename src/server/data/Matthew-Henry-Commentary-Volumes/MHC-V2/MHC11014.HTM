 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The kingdom being divided into that of Judah and that of Israel, we 
 must henceforward, in these books of Kings, expect and attend their 
 separate history, the succession of their kings, and the affairs of 
 their kingdoms, accounted for distinctly. In this chapter we have, 
 
 I. The prophecy of the destruction of Jeroboam's house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:7-16">ver. 7-16</A>.

 The sickness of his child was the occasion of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>),

 and the death of his child the earnest of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:17,18">ver. 17, 18</A>),

 together with the conclusion of his reign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:19,20">ver. 19, 20</A>.

 II. The history of the declension and diminution of Rehoboam's house
 and kingdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:21-28">ver. 21-28</A>)

 and the conclusion of his reign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:29-31">ver. 29-31</A>.

 In both we may read the mischievous consequences of sin and the
 calamities it brings on kingdoms and families.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
 &nbsp; 2 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and
 disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of
 Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there <I>is</I> Ahijah the
 prophet, which told me that <I>I should be</I> king over this people.
 &nbsp; 3 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of
 honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the
 child.
 &nbsp; 4 And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh,
 and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for
 his eyes were set by reason of his age.
 &nbsp; 5 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam
 cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he <I>is</I> sick: thus
 and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she
 cometh in, that she shall feign herself <I>to be</I> another <I>woman.</I>
 &nbsp; 6 And it was <I>so,</I> when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as
 she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of
 Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself <I>to be</I> another? for I <I>am</I>
 sent to thee <I>with</I> heavy <I>tidings.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 How Jeroboam persisted in his contempt of God and religion we read in 
 the close of the foregoing chapter. Here we are told how God proceeded 
 in his controversy with him; for when God judges he will overcome, and 
 sinners shall either bend or break before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His child fell sick, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 It is probable that he was his eldest son, and heir-apparent to the
 crown; for at his death all the kingdom went into mourning for him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:1-34"><I>ch.</I> xiii.</A>

 His dignity as a prince, his age as a young prince, and his interest in
 heaven as a pious prince, could not exempt him from sickness, dangerous 
 sickness. Let none be secure of the continuance of their health, but 
 improve it, while it continues, for the best purposes. Lord, <I>behold, 
 he whom thou lovest,</I> thy favourite, he whom Israel loves, their 
 darling, <I>is sick. At that time,</I> when Jeroboam prostituted the 
 profaned the priesthood

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+13:33"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 33</A>),

 his child sickened. When sickness comes into our families we should
 enquire whether there be not some particular sin harboured in our 
 houses, which the affliction is sent to convince us of and reclaim us 
 from.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He sent his wife in disguise to enquire of Ahijah the prophet 
 <I>what should become of the child,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 The sickness of his child touched him in a tender part. The withering
 of this branch of the family would, perhaps, be as sore an affliction 
 to him as the withering of that branch of his body,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+13:4"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 4</A>.

 Such is the force of natural affection; our children are ourselves but
 once removed.  Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Jeroboam's great desire, under this affliction, is to know <I>what 
 shall become of the child,</I> whether he will live or die. 

 (1.) It would have been more prudent if he had desired to know what 
 means they should use for the recovery of the child, what they should 
 give him, and what they should do to him; but by this instance, and 
 those of Ahaziah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:2">2 Kings i. 2</A>)
 
 and Benhadad
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:8">2 Kings viii. 8</A>),

 it should seem they had then such a foolish notion of fatality as took
 them off from all use of means; for, if they were sure the patient 
 would live, they thought means needless; if he would die, they thought 
 them useless; not considering that duty is ours, events are God's, and 
 that he that ordained the end ordained the means. Why should a prophet 
 be desired to show that which a little time will show? 

 (2.) It would have been more pious if he had desired to know wherefore 
 God contended with him, had begged the prophet's prayers, and cast away 
 his idols from him; then the child might have been restored to him, as 
 his hand was. But most people would rather be told their fortune than 
 their faults or their duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he might know the child's doom, he sent to Ahijah the prophet, 
 who lived obscurely and neglected in Shiloh, blind through age, yet 
 still blest with the visions of the Almighty, which need not bodily 
 eyes, but are rather favoured by the want of them, the eyes of the mind 
 being then most intent and least diverted. Jeroboam sent not to him for 
 advice about the setting up of his calves, or the consecrating of his 
 priests, but had recourse to him in his distress, when the gods he 
 served could give him no relief. <I>Lord, in trouble have those visited 
 thee</I> who before slighted thee. Some have by sickness been reminded 
 of their forgotten ministers and praying friends. He sent to Ahijah, 
 because he had <I>told him he should be king,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 "He was once the messenger of good tidings, surely he will be so
 again." Those that by sin disqualify themselves for comfort, and yet 
 expect their ministers, because they are good men, should speak peace 
 and comfort to them, greatly wrong both themselves and their 
 ministers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He sent his wife to enquire of the prophet, because she could best 
 put the question without naming names, or making any other description 
 than this, "Sir, I have a son ill; will he recover or not?" The heart 
 of her husband safely trusted in her that she would be faithful both in 
 delivering the message and bringing him the answer; and it seems there 
 were none of all his counsellors in whom he could repose such a 
 confidence; otherwise the sick child could very ill spare her, for 
 mothers are the best nurses, and it would have been much fitter for her 
 to have staid at home to tend him than go to Shiloh to enquire what 
 would become of him. If she go, she must be <I>incognito--in
 disguise,</I> must change her dress, cover her face, and go by another 
 name,not only to conceal herself from her own court and the country 
 through which she passed (as if it were below her quality to go upon 
 such an errand, and what she had reason to be ashamed of, as Nicodemus 
 that came to Jesus by night, whereas it is no disparagement to the 
 greatest to attend God's prophets), but also to conceal herself from 
 the prophet himself, that he might only answer her question concerning 
 her son, and not enter upon the unpleasing subject of her husband's 
 defection. Thus some people love to prescribe to their ministers, limit 
 them to smooth things, and care not for having the <I>whole counsel of 
 God declared</I> to them, lest it prove to prophesy <I>no good 
 concerning them, but evil.</I> But what a strange notion had Jeroboam 
 of God's prophet when he believed that he could and would certainly 
 tell what would <I>become of the child,</I> and yet either could not or 
 would not discover who was the mother! Could he see into the thick 
 darkness of futurity, and yet not see through the thin veil of this 
 disguise? Did Jeroboam think the God of Israel like his calves, just 
 what he pleased? <I>Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. God gave Ahijah notice of the approach of Jeroboam's wife, and 
 that she came in disguise, and full instructions what to say to her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 which enabled him, as she came in at the door, to call her by her name,
 to her great surprise, and so to discover to all about him who she was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam, why feignest thou thyself to be
 another?</I> He had no regard, 

 1. To her rank. She was a queen, but what was that to him, who had a
 message to deliver to her immediately from God, before whom all the 
 children of men stand upon the same level? Nor, 

 2. To her present. It was usual for those who consulted prophets to
 bring them tokens of respect, which they accepted, and yet were no 
 hirelings. She brought him a handsome country present

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 but he did not think himself obliged by that to give her any finer
 language than the nature of her message required. Nor, 

 3.  To her industrious concealment of herself. It is a piece of
 civility not to take notice of those who desire not to be taken notice 
 of; but the prophet was no courtier, nor gave flattering titles; plain 
 dealing is best, and she shall know, at the first word, what she has to 
 trust to: <I>I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.</I> Note, Those who 
 think by their disguises to hide themselves from God will be wretchedly 
 confounded when they find themselves disappointed in the day of 
 discovery. Sinners now appear in the garb of saints, and are taken to 
 be such; but how will they blush and tremble when they find themselves 
 stripped of their false colours, and are called by their own name: "Go 
 out, thou treacherous false-hearted hypocrite. <I>I never knew thee.  
 Why feignest thou thyself to be another?</I>" Tidings of a portion with 
 hypocrites will be heavy tidings. God will judge men according to what 
 they are, not according to what they seem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel,
 Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee
 prince over my people Israel,
 &nbsp; 8 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave
 it thee: and <I>yet</I> thou hast not been as my servant David, who
 kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to
 do <I>that</I> only <I>which was</I> right in mine eyes;
 &nbsp; 9 But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou
 hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke
 me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:
 &nbsp; 10 Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of
 Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against
 the wall, <I>and</I> him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will
 take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh
 away dung, till it be all gone.
 &nbsp; 11 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat;
 and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat:
 for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath spoken <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 12 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: <I>and</I>
 when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
 &nbsp; 13 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he
 only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is
 found <I>some</I> good thing toward the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel in the
 house of Jeroboam.
 &nbsp; 14 Moreover the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall raise him up a king over Israel, who
 shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.
 &nbsp; 15 For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the
 water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which
 he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the
 river, because they have made their groves, provoking the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> to
 anger.
 &nbsp; 16 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam,
 who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.
 &nbsp; 17 And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:
 <I>and</I> when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;
 &nbsp; 18 And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him,
 according to the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which he spake by the hand of
 his servant Ahijah the prophet.
 &nbsp; 19 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how
 he reigned, behold, they <I>are</I> written in the book of the
 chronicles of the kings of Israel.
 &nbsp; 20 And the days which Jeroboam reigned <I>were</I> two and twenty
 years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned
 in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 When those that set up idols, and keep them up, go to enquire of the 
 Lord, he determines to answer them, not according to the pretensions of 
 their enquiry, but <I>according to the multitude of their idols,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:4">Ezek. xiv. 4</A>.
 
 So Jeroboam is answered here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The prophet anticipates the enquiry concerning the child, and 
 foretels the ruin of Jeroboam's house for the wickedness of it. No one 
 else durst have carried such a message: a servant would have smothered 
 it, but his own wife cannot be suspected of ill-will to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God calls himself the <I>Lord God of Israel.</I> Though Israel had 
 forsaken God, God had not cast them off, nor given them a bill of 
 divorce for their whoredoms. He is Israel's God, and therefore will 
 take vengeance on him who did them the greatest mischief he could do 
 them, debauched them and drew them away from God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He upbraids Jeroboam with the great favour he had bestowed upon him, 
 in making him king, exalting him from among the people, the common 
 people, to be prince over God's chosen Israel, and taking the kingdom 
 <I>from the house of David,</I> to bestow it upon him. Whether we keep 
 an account of God's mercies to us or no, he does, and will set even 
 them in order before us, if we be ungrateful, to our greater confusion; 
 otherwise he gives and upbraids not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He charges him with his impiety and apostasy, and his idolatry 
 particularly: <I>Thou hast done evil above all that were before 
 thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Saul, that was rejected, never worshipped idols; Solomon did it but
 occasionally, in his dotage, and never made Israel to sin. Jeroboam's 
 calves, though pretended to be set up in honour of the God of Israel, 
 that brought <I>them up out of Egypt,</I> yet are here called <I>other 
 gods,</I> or <I>strange gods,</I> because in them he worshipped God as 
 the heathen worshipped their strange gods, because by them he 
 <I>changed the truth of God into a lie</I> and represented him as 
 altogether different from what he is, and because many of the ignorant 
 worshippers terminated their devotion in the image, and did not at all 
 regard the God of Israel. Though they were calves of gold, the richness 
 of the metal was so far from making them acceptable to God that they 
 <I>provoked him to anger,</I> designedly affronted him, under colour of 
 pleasing him. In doing this,

 (1.) He had not set David before him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Thou hast not been as my servant David,</I> who, though he had his
 faults and some bad ones, yet never forsook the worship of God nor grew 
 loose nor cold to that; his faithful adherence to that gained him this 
 honourable character, that he <I>followed God with all his heart,</I> 
 and herein he was proposed for an example to all his successors. Those 
 did not do well that did not do like David.

 (2.) He had not <I>set God before him,</I> but
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 "<I>Thou hast cast me behind thy back,</I> my law, my fear; thou hast
 neglected me, forgotten me, and preferred thy policies before my 
 precepts."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He foretels the utter ruin of Jeroboam's house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 He thought, by his idolatry, to establish his government, and by that
 he not only lost it, but brought destruction upon his family, the 
 universal destruction of all the males, whether shut up or left, 
 married or unmarried.

 (1.) Shameful destruction. They shall be taken away as dung, which is
 loathsome and which men are glad to be rid of.  He worshipped 
 dunghill-deities, and God removed his family as a great dunghill. Noble 
 and royal families, if wicked, are no better in God's account. 

 (2.) Unusual destruction. Their very dead bodies should be meat for the
 dogs in the street, or the birds of prey in the field, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Thus evil pursues sinners. See this fulfilled,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+15:29"><I>ch.</I>  xv. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He foretels the immediate death of the sick child, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In mercy to him, lest, if he live, he be infected with the sin, 
 and so involved in the ruin, of his father's house. Observe the 
 character given of him: <I>In him was found some good thing towards the 
 Lord God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.</I> He had an affection 
 for the true worship of God and disliked the worship of the calves. 
 Note, 

 [1.] Those are good <I>in whom are good things towards the Lord God of 
 Israel,</I> good inclinations, good intentions, good desires, towards 
 him. 

 [2.] Where there is but <I>some</I> good thing of that kind it will be 
 found: God, who seeks it, sees it be it ever so little and is pleased 
 with it. 

 [3.] A little grace goes a great way with great people. It is so rare 
 to find princes well affected to religion that, when they are so, they 
 are worthy of double honour. 

 [4.] Pious dispositions are in a peculiar manner amiable and acceptable 
 when they are found in those that are young. The divine image in 
 miniature has a peculiar beauty and lustre in it. 

 [5.] Those that are good in bad times and places shine very brightly in 
 the eyes of God. A good child <I>in the house of Jeroboam</I> is a 
 miracle of divine grace: to be there untainted is like being in the 
 fiery furnace unhurt, unsinged. Observe the care taken of him: he only, 
 of all Jeroboam's family, shall die in honour, shall be buried, and 
 shall be lamented as one that lived desired. Note, Those that are 
 distinguished by divine grace shall be distinguished by divine 
 providence. This hopeful child dies first of all the family, for God 
 often <I>takes those soonest whom he loves best.</I> Heaven is the 
 fittest place for them; this earth is not worthy of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In wrath to the family. 

 [1.] It was a sign the family would be ruined when <I>he</I> was taken 
 by whom it might have been reformed.  The righteous are removed from 
 the evil to come in this world, to the good to come in a better world. 
 It is a bad omen to a family when the best in it are buried out of it; 
 when what was valuable is picked out the rest is for the fire. 

 [2.] It was likewise a present affliction to the family and kingdom, by 
 which both ought to have been bettered; and this aggravated the 
 affliction to the poor mother that she should not reach home time 
 enough to see her son alive: <I>When thy feet enter into the city,</I> 
 just then <I>the child shall die.</I> This was to be a sign to her of 
 the accomplishment of the rest of the threatenings, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:34">1 Sam. ii. 34</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. He foretels the setting up of another family to rule over Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This was fulfilled in Baasha of Issachar, who conspired against Nadab
 the son of Jeroboam, in the second year of his reign, murdered him and 
 all his family. "<I>But what? Even now.</I> Why do I speak of it as a 
 thing at a distance? It is at the door. It shall be done <I>even 
 now.</I>" Sometimes God makes quick work with sinners; he did so with 
 the house of Jeroboam. It was not twenty-four years from his first 
 elevation to the final extirpation of his family.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. He foretels the judgments which should come upon the people of 
 Israel for conforming to the worship which Jeroboam had established. 
 <I>If the blind lead the blind,</I> both the blind leaders and the 
 blind followers shall <I>fall into the ditch.</I> It is here foretold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>,

 (1.) That they should never be easy, nor rightly settled in their land, 
 but continually <I>shaken like a reed in the water.</I> After they left 
 the house of David, the government never continued long in one family, 
 but one undermined and destroyed another, which must needs occasion 
 great disorders and disturbances among the people. 

 (2.) That they should, ere long, be totally expelled out of their land, 
 that good land, and given up to ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This was fulfilled in the captivity of the ten tribes by the king of
 Assyria. Families and kingdoms are ruined by sin, ruined by the 
 wickedness of the heads of them.  <I>Jeroboam did sin, and made Israel 
 to sin.</I> If great men do wickedly, they involve many others both in 
 the guilt and in the snare; multitudes <I>follow their pernicious 
 ways.</I> They go to hell with a long train, and their condemnation 
 will be the more intolerable, for they must answer, not only for their 
 own sins, but for the sins which others have been drawn into and kept 
 in by their influence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jeroboam's wife has nothing to say against the word of the Lord, 
 but she goes home with a heavy heart to their house in <I>Tirzah,</I> a 
 <I>sweet delightful place,</I> so the name signifies, famed for its 
 beauty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:4">Cant. vi. 4</A>.

 But death, which will stain its beauty and embitter all its delights,
 cannot be shut out from it. Hither she came, and here we leave her 
 attending the funeral of her son, and expecting the fate of her family.

 1. <I>The child died</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 and justly did all Israel mourn, not only for the loss of so hopeful a
 prince, whom they were not worthy of, but because his death plucked up 
 the flood-gates, and made a breach, at which an inundation of judgments 
 broke in. 
 
 2.  Jeroboam himself died soon after, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 It is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:20">2 Chron. xiii. 20</A>),

 <I>The Lord struck him</I> with some sore disease, so that he died 
 miserably, when he had reigned twenty-two years, and left his crown to 
 a son who lost it, and his life too, and all the lives of his family, 
 within two years after. For a further account of him the reader is 
 referred to the annals of his reign, drawn up by his own secretaries, 
 or to the public records, like those in the Tower, called here, <I>The 
 Book</I> or register, <I>of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel,</I> 
 to which recourse might then be had; but, not being divinely inspired, 
 these records are long since lost.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam
 <I>was</I> forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he
 reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> did
 choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.
 And his mother's name <I>was</I> Naamah an Ammonitess.
 &nbsp; 22 And Judah did evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and they
 provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had
 committed, above all that their fathers had done.
 &nbsp; 23 For they also built them high places, and images, and
 groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.
 &nbsp; 24 And there were also sodomites in the land: <I>and</I> they did
 according to all the abominations of the nations which the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 cast out before the children of Israel.
 &nbsp; 25 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam,
 <I>that</I> Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:
 &nbsp; 26 And he took away the treasures of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he
 took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
 &nbsp; 27 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and
 committed <I>them</I> unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which
 kept the door of the king's house.
 &nbsp; 28 And it was <I>so,</I> when the king went into the house of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the
 guard chamber.
 &nbsp; 29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did,
 <I>are</I> they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
 of Judah?
 &nbsp; 30 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all <I>their</I>
 days.
 &nbsp; 31 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
 fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name <I>was</I> Naamah
 an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Judah's story and Israel's are intermixed in this book. Jeroboam 
 out-lived Rehoboam, four or five years, yet his history is despatched 
 first, that the account of Rehoboam's reign may be laid together; and a 
 sad account it is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is no good said of the king. All the account we have of him 
 here is, 

 1. That he was forty-one years old when he began to reign, by which
 reckoning he was born in the last year of David, and had his education, 
 and the forming of his mind, in the best days of Solomon; yet he lived 
 not up to these advantages. Solomon's defection at last did more to 
 corrupt him than his wisdom and devotion had done to give him good 
 principles. 

 2. That he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, <I>the city where God
 put his name,</I> where he had opportunity enough to know his duty, if 
 he had but had a heart to do it. 

 3. That his mother was Naamah, an Ammonitess; this is twice mentioned,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:21,31"><I>v.</I> 21, 31</A>.
 
 It was strange that David would marry his son Solomon to an Ammonitess
 (for it was done while he lived), but it is probable that Solomon was 
 in love with her, because she was <I>Naamah,</I> a <I>beauty</I> (so it 
 signifies), and his father was loth to cross him, but it proved to have 
 a very bad influence upon posterity.  Probably she was daughter to 
 Shobi the Ammonite, who was kind to David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+17:27">2 Sam. xvii. 27</A>),

 and David was too willing to requite him by matching his son into his
 family. None can imagine how lasting and how fatal the consequences may 
 be of being unequally yoked with unbelievers. 

 4. That he had continual war with Jeroboam

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 which could not but be a perpetual uneasiness to him.  

 5. That when he had reigned but seventeen years he died, and left his
 throne to his son. His father, and grandfather, and grandson, that 
 reigned well, reigned long, forty years apiece. But sin often shortens 
 men's lives and comforts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is much evil said of the subjects, both as to their character 
 and their condition.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See here how wicked and profane they were. It is a most sad account 
 that is here given of their apostasy from God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:22-24"><I>v.</I> 22-24</A>.

 Judah, the only professing people God had in the world, <I>did evil in
 his sight,</I> in contempt and defiance of him and the tokens of his 
 special presence with them; <I>they provoked him to jealousy,</I> as 
 the adulterous wife provokes her husband by breaking the 
 marriage-covenant. Their fathers had been bad enough, especially in the 
 times of the judges, but they did abominable things, <I>above all that 
 their fathers had done.</I> The magnificence of their temple, the pomp 
 of their priesthood, and all the secular advantages with which their 
 religion was attended, could not prevail to keep them to it. Nothing 
 less than the <I>pouring out of the Spirit from on high</I> will keep 
 God's Israel in their allegiance to him. The account here given of the 
 wickedness of the Jews agrees with that which the apostle gives of the 
 wickedness of the Gentile world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:21,24">Rom. i. 21, 24</A>),

 so that both <I>Jew and Gentile are</I> alike <I>under sin,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:9">Rom. iii. 9</A>.

 (1.) They became <I>vain in their imaginations</I> concerning God, and 
 <I>changed his glory into an image,</I> for they built themselves 
 <I>high places, images, and groves</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 profaning God's name by affixing to it their images, and God's
 ordinances by serving their idols with them.  They foolishly fancies 
 that they exalted God when they worshipped him on high hills and 
 pleased him when they worshipped him under the pleasant shadow of green 
 trees.

 (2.) They were given up to vile affections (as those idolaters 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:26,27">Rom. i. 26, 27</A>),
 
 for there were <I>sodomites in the land</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 <I>men with men working that which is unseemly,</I> and not to be
 thought of, much less mentioned, without abhorrence and indignation. 
 They dishonoured God by one sin and then God left them to dishonour 
 themselves by another. They profaned the privileges of a holy nation, 
 therefore God gave them up to their own hearts' lusts, to imitate the 
 abominations of the accursed Canaanites; and herein the Lord was 
 righteous. And, when they did <I>like those that were cast out,</I> how 
 could they expect any other than to be cast out like them?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See here how weak and poor they were; and this was the consequence 
 of the former. Sin exposes, impoverishes, and weakens any people. 
 Shishak, king of Egypt, came against them, and so far, either by force 
 or surrender, made himself master of Jerusalem itself that he took away 
 the treasures both of the temple and of the exchequer, of the house of 
 the Lord and of the king's house, which David and Solomon had amassed,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 These, it is likely, tempted him to make his descent; and, to save the
 rest, Rehoboam perhaps tamely surrendered them, as Ahab,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+20:4"><I>ch.</I> xx. 4</A>.

 He also took away the golden shields that were made but in his father's
 time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 These the king of Egypt carried off as trophies of his victory; and,
 instead of them, Rehoboam made brazen shields, which the life-guard 
 carried before him when he went to church in state, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.

 This was an emblem of the diminution of his glory.  Sin makes the gold
 become dim, changes the most fine gold, and turns it into brass.  We 
 commend Rehoboam for going to <I>the house of the Lord,</I> perhaps the 
 oftener for the rebuke he had been under, and do not condemn him for 
 going in pomp. Great men should honour God with their honour, and then 
 they are themselves most honoured by it.</P>
