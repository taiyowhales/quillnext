 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here entering upon a pleasant scene, the good and glorious reign 
 of Hezekiah, in which we shall find more of God and religion than 
 perhaps in any of the good reigns we have yet met with; for he was a 
 very zealous, devout, good man, none like him. In this chapter we have 
 an account of the work of reformation which he set about with vigour 
 immediately after his accession to the crown. Here is, 

 I. His exhortation to the priests and Levites, when he put them in
 possession of the house of God again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. The care and pains which the Levites took to cleanse the temple,
 and put things in order there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:12-19">ver. 12-19</A>.

 III. A solemn revival of God's ordinances that had been neglected, in
 which atonement was made for the sins of the last reign, and the wheels 
 were set a-going again, to the great satisfaction of king and people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:20-36">ver. 20-36</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Hezekiah began to reign <I>when he was</I> five and twenty years
 old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his
 mother's name <I>was</I> Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
 &nbsp; 2  And he did <I>that which was</I> right in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 according to all that David his father had done.
 &nbsp; 3  He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened
 the doors of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and repaired them.
 &nbsp; 4  And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered
 them together into the east street,
 &nbsp; 5  And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now
 yourselves, and sanctify the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of your
 fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy <I>place.</I>
 &nbsp; 6  For our fathers have trespassed, and done <I>that which was</I>
 evil in the eyes of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God, and have forsaken him, and
 have turned away their faces from the habitation of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 turned <I>their</I> backs.
 &nbsp; 7  Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out
 the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt
 offerings in the holy <I>place</I> unto the God of Israel.
 &nbsp; 8  Wherefore the wrath of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was upon Judah and Jerusalem,
 and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to
 hissing, as ye see with your eyes.
 &nbsp; 9  For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons
 and our daughters and our wives <I>are</I> in captivity for this.
 &nbsp; 10  Now <I>it is</I> in mine heart to make a covenant with the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.
 &nbsp; 11  My sons, be not now negligent: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath chosen you
 to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister
 unto him, and burn incense.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Hezekiah's age when he came to the crown. He was <I>twenty-five 
 years old.</I> Joash, who came to the crown after two bad reigns, was 
 but seven years old; Josiah, who came after two bad reigns, was but 
 eight, which occasioned the delay of the reformation; but Hezekiah had 
 come to years, and so applied himself immediately to it. We may well 
 think with what a sorrowful heart he beheld his father's idolatry and 
 profaneness, how it troubled him to see the doors of the temple shut, 
 though, while his father lived, he durst not open them. His soul no 
 doubt wept in secret for it, and he vowed that when he should receive 
 the congregation he would redress these grievances, which made him do 
 it with more readiness and resolution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His general character. He <I>did that which was right like 
 David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Of several of his predecessors it had been said that they did that
 which was right, <I>but not like David,</I> not with David's integrity 
 and zeal. But here was one that had as hearty an affection for the ark 
 and law of God as ever David had.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His speedy application to the great work of restoring religion. 
 The first thing he did was to <I>open the doors of the house of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 We are willing to hope his father had not quite suppressed the temple
 service; for then the holy fire on the altar must have gone out, and we 
 do not read of the re-kindling of it; but he had hindered the people 
 from attending it, and the priests, except such of them as were of his 
 own party,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+16:5">2 Kings xvi. 15</A>.

 But Hezekiah immediately threw the church doors open, and <I>brought in
 the priests and Levites.</I> He found Judah low and naked, yet did not 
 make it his first business to revive the civil interests of his 
 kingdom, but to restore religion to its good posture again. Those that 
 begin with God begin at the right end of their work, and it will 
 prosper accordingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His speech to the priests and Levites. It was well known, no doubt, 
 that he had a real kindness for religion and was disaffected to the 
 corruptions of the last reign; yet we do not find the priests and 
 Levites making application to him for the restoration of the temple 
 service but he calls upon them, which, I doubt, bespeaks their coldness 
 as much as his zeal; and perhaps, if they had done their part with 
 vigour, things would not have been brought into so very bad a posture 
 as Hezekiah found them in. Hezekiah's exhortation to the Levites is 
 very pathetic.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He laid before them the desolations of religion and the deplorable 
 state to which it was brought among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>):

 <I>Our fathers have trespassed.</I> He said not "<I>My</I> father,"
 because it became him, as a son, to be as tender as might be of his 
 father's name, and because his father would not have done all this if 
 their fathers had not neglected their duty. Urijah the priest had 
 joined with Ahaz in setting up an idolatrous altar. He complained,

 (1.) That the house of God had been deserted: <I>They have forsaken 
 God, and turned their backs upon his habitation.</I> Note, Those that 
 turn their backs upon God's ordinances may truly be said to forsake God 
 himself. 

 (2.) That the instituted worship of God there had been let fall. The 
 lamps were not lighted, and incense was not burnt. There are still such 
 neglects as these, and they are no less culpable, when the word is not 
 duly read and opened (for that was signified by the <I>lighting of the 
 lamps</I>) and when prayers and praises are not duly offered up, for 
 that was signified by <I>the burning of incense.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He showed the sad consequences of the neglect and decay of religion 
 among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 This was the cause of all the calamities they had lain under. God had
 in anger delivered them to trouble, to the sword, and to captivity.  
 When we are under the rebukes of God's providence it is good for us to 
 enquire whether we have not neglected God's ordinances and whether the 
 controversy he has with us may not be traced to this neglect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He declared his own full purpose and resolution to revive religion 
 and make it his business to promote it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>It is in my heart</I> (that is, I am fully resolved) <I>to make a
 covenant with the Lord God of Israel</I> (that is, to worship him only, 
 and in that way which he has appointed); for I am sure that, otherwise, 
 his fierce anger will not turn away from us." This covenant he would 
 not only make himself, but bring his people into the bond of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He engaged and excited the Levites and priests to do their duty on 
 this occasion. This he begins with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 this he ends with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He called them <I>Levites</I> to remind them of their obligation to
 God, called them his <I>sons</I> to remind them of the relation to 
 himself, that he expected that, <I>as a son with the father, they 
 should serve with him</I> in the reformation of the land.

 (1.) he told them what was their duty, to sanctify <I>themselves</I> 
 first (by repenting of their neglects, reforming their own hearts and 
 lives, and renewing their covenants with God to do their duty better 
 for the time to come), and then to <I>sanctify the house of God,</I> as 
 his servants, to make it clean from every thing that was disagreeable, 
 either through the disuse or the profanation of it, and to set it up 
 for the purposes for which it was made. 

 (2.) He stirred them up to do it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>Be not now negligent,</I> or remiss, in your duty. Let not this
 good work be retarded through your carelessness." <I>Be not 
 deceived,</I> so the <I>margin.</I> Note, Those that by their 
 negligence in the service of God think to mock God, and put a cheat 
 upon him, do but deceive themselves, and put a damning cheat upon their 
 own souls. <I>Be not secure</I> (so some), as if there were no urgent 
 call to do it or no danger in not doing it. Note, Men's negligence in 
 religion is owing to their carnal security. The consideration he 
 quickens them with is derived from their office. God had herein put 
 honour upon them: He has <I>chosen you to stand before him.</I> God 
 therefore expected work from them. They were not chosen to be idle, to 
 enjoy the dignity and leave the duty to be done by others, but to serve 
 him and to minister to him.  They must therefore be ashamed of their 
 late remissness, and, now that the doors of the temple were opened 
 again, must set about their work with double diligence.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel
 the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the
 sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of
 Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and
 Eden the son of Joah:
 &nbsp; 13  And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the
 sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:
 &nbsp; 14  And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the
 sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.
 &nbsp; 15  And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves,
 and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to cleanse the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 16  And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to cleanse <I>it,</I> and brought out all the uncleanness that
 they found in the temple of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> into the court of the house
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. And the Levites took <I>it,</I> to carry <I>it</I> out abroad
 into the brook Kidron.
 &nbsp; 17  Now they began on the first <I>day</I> of the first month to
 sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the
 porch of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: so they sanctified the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in
 eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made
 an end.
 &nbsp; 18  Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have
 cleansed all the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the altar of burnt
 offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the showbread table,
 with all the vessels thereof.
 &nbsp; 19  Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did
 cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified,
 and, behold, they <I>are</I> before the altar of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here busy work, good work, and needful work, the cleansing of 
 the house of the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The persons employed in this work were the priests and Levites, who 
 should have kept the temple clean, but, not having done that, were 
 concerned to make it clean. Several of the Levites are here named, two 
 of each of the three principal houses, Kohath, Gershon, and Merari 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and two of each of the three families of singers, Asaph, Heman, and
 Jeduthun, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 We cannot think these are named merely because they were chief in place
 (for then surely the high priest, or some of the heads of the courses 
 of the priests, would have been mentioned), but because they were more 
 zealous and active than the rest. When God has work to do he will raise 
 up leading men to preside in it. And it is not always that the first in 
 place and rank are most fit for service or most forward to it. These 
 Levites not only bestirred themselves, but <I>gathered their 
 brethren,</I> and quickened them to do <I>according to the commandment 
 of the king by the word of the Lord.</I> Observe, They did according to 
 the king's command, but with an eye to God's word. The king commanded 
 them what was already their duty by the word of God, and, in doing it, 
 they regarded God's word as a rule to them and the king's commandment 
 as a spur to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The work was <I>cleansing the house of God,</I> 

 1. From the common dirt it had contracted while it was shut up-dust,
 and cobwebs, and the rust of the vessels. 

 2. From the idols and idolatrous altars that were set up in it, which,
 though kept ever so neat, were a greater pollution to it than if it had 
 been made the common sewer of the city. The priests were none of them 
 mentioned as leading men in this work, yet none but they durst go 
 <I>into the inner part of the house, no, not to cleanse it,</I> which 
 they did, and perhaps the high priest into the holy of holies, to 
 cleanse that. And, though the Levites had the honour to be the leaders 
 in the work, they did not disdain to be servitors to the priests 
 according to their office; for what filth the priests brought into the 
 court the Levites carried to the brook Kidron. Let not men's 
 usefulness, be it ever so eminent, make them forget their place.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The expedition with which they did this work was very remarkable. 
 They began on the first day of the first month, a happy beginning of 
 the new-year, and one that promised a good year. Thus should every year 
 begin with the reformation of what is amiss, and the purging away, by 
 true repentance, of all the defilements contracted the foregoing year. 
 In eight days they cleared and cleansed the temple, and in eight days 
 more the <I>courts</I> of the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Let those that do good work learn to rid work and get it done. Let what
 is amiss be amended quickly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The report they made of it to Hezekiah was very agreeable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 They gave him an account of what they had done, because it was he that
 set them on work, boasted not of their own care and pains, nor did they 
 come to him to be paid, but to let him know that all things that had 
 been profaned were now sanctified according to law, and were ready to 
 be used again whenever he pleased. They knew the good king had set his 
 heart upon God's altar, and longed to be attending that, and therefore 
 they insisted most upon the readiness they had put that into--that the 
 vessels for the altar were scoured and brightened. Those vessels which 
 Ahaz, in his <I>transgression, had cast away</I> as vessels in which 
 there was no pleasure, they gathered together, sanctified them, and 
 laid them in their place <I>before the altar.</I> Though the vessels of 
 the sanctuary may be profaned for a while, God will find a time and a 
 way to sanctify them. Neither his ordinances nor his people shall be 
 suffered to fail for ever.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers
 of the city, and went up to the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 21  And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven
 lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom,
 and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the
 priests the sons of Aaron to offer <I>them</I> on the altar of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 22  So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the
 blood, and sprinkled <I>it</I> on the altar: likewise, when they had
 killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they
 killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the
 altar.
 &nbsp; 23  And they brought forth the he goats <I>for</I> the sin offering
 before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands
 upon them:
 &nbsp; 24  And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation
 with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all
 Israel: for the king commanded <I>that</I> the burnt offering and the
 sin offering <I>should be made</I> for all Israel.
 &nbsp; 25  And he set the Levites in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with
 cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the
 commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the
 prophet: for <I>so was</I> the commandment of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> by his
 prophets.
 &nbsp; 26  And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the
 priests with the trumpets.
 &nbsp; 27  And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the
 altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 began <I>also</I> with the trumpets, and with the instruments
 <I>ordained</I> by David king of Israel.
 &nbsp; 28  And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang,
 and the trumpeters sounded: <I>and</I> all <I>this continued</I> until the
 burnt offering was finished.
 &nbsp; 29  And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all
 that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.
 &nbsp; 30  Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the
 Levites to sing praise unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with the words of David, and
 of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they
 bowed their heads and worshipped.
 &nbsp; 31  Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated
 yourselves unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, come near and bring sacrifices and
 thank offerings into the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. And the congregation
 brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of
 a free heart burnt offerings.
 &nbsp; 32  And the number of the burnt offerings, which the
 congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred
 rams, <I>and</I> two hundred lambs: all these <I>were</I> for a burnt
 offering to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 33  And the consecrated things <I>were</I> six hundred oxen and three
 thousand sheep.
 &nbsp; 34  But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay
 all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did
 help them, till the work was ended, and until the <I>other</I> priests
 had sanctified themselves: for the Levites <I>were</I> more upright in
 heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
 &nbsp; 35  And also the burnt offerings <I>were</I> in abundance, with the
 fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for <I>every</I>
 burnt offering. So the service of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> was set
 in order.
 &nbsp; 36  And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had
 prepared the people: for the thing was <I>done</I> suddenly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The temple being cleansed, we have here an account of the good use that 
 was immediately made of it. A solemn assembly was called to meet the 
 king at the temple, the very next day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 and very glad, no doubt, all the good people in Jerusalem were, when it
 was said, <I>Let us go up to the house of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:1">Ps. cxxii. 1</A>.

 As soon as Hezekiah heard that the temple was ready for him he lost no
 time, but made it appear that he was ready for it. He rose early to go 
 up to the house of the Lord, earlier on that day than on other days, to 
 show that his heart was upon his work there. Now this day's work was to 
 look two ways:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Atonement must be made for the sins of the last reign. They thought 
 it not enough to lament and forsake those sins, but they brought a 
 sin-offering. Even our repentance and reformation will not obtain 
 pardon but in and through Christ, who was made <I>sin</I> (that is, a 
 sin-offering) for us. No peace but through his blood, no, not for 
 penitents. Observe, 

 1. The sin-offering was <I>for the kingdom, for the sanctuary,</I> and
 <I>for Judah</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 that is, to make atonement for the sins of princes, priests, and
 people, for they had all corrupted their way. The law of Moses 
 appointed sacrifices to make atonement for the sins of the whole 
 congregation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+4:13,14,Nu+15:24,25">Lev. iv. 13, 14; Num. xv. 24, 25</A>),

 that the national judgments which their national sins deserved might be
 turned away. For this purpose we must now have an eye to Christ the 
 great propitiation, as well as for the remission and salvation of 
 particular persons. 

 2. The law appointed only one goat for a sin-offering, as on the day of
 atonement

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+16:15">Lev. xvi. 15</A>)

 and on such extraordinary occasions as this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+15:24">Num. xv. 24</A>.

 But they here offered seven

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 because the sins of the congregation had been very great and long
 continued in. Seven is a number of perfection. Our great sin-offering 
 is but one, yet that one <I>perfects</I> for ever <I>those that are 
 sanctified.</I> 

 3. The king and the <I>congregation</I> (that is, the representatives
 of the congregation) <I>laid their hands on the heads of the goats</I> 
 that were for the <I>sin-offering</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 thereby owning themselves guilty before God and expressing their desire
 that the guilt of the sinner might be transferred to the sacrifice. By 
 faith we lay our hands on the Lord Jesus, and so <I>receive the 
 atonement,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+5:11">Rom. v. 11</A>.

 4. Burnt-offerings were offered with the sin-offerings, <I>seven
 bullocks, seven rams,</I> and <I>seven lambs.</I> The intention of the 
 burnt-offerings was to give glory to the God of Israel, whom they owned 
 as the only true God, which it was proper to do at the same time that 
 they were by the sin-offering making atonement for their offences. The 
 blood of those, as well as of the sin-offering, was <I>sprinkled upon 
 the altar</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 to make reconciliation <I>for all Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 and not for Judah only.  Christ is a propitiation, not for the sins of
 Israel only, but <I>of the whole world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:1,22">1 John ii. 1, 2</A>.

 5. While the offerings were burning upon the altar the <I>Levites</I>
 sang <I>the song of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 the Psalms composed by David and Asaph

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 accompanied by the musical instruments which God by his prophets had
 commanded the use of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 and which had been long neglected. Even sorrow for sin must not put us
 out of tune for praising God. By faith we must rejoice in Christ Jesus 
 as our righteousness; and our prayers and praises must ascend with his 
 offering, to be accepted only in virtue of it. 

 6. The king and all the congregation testified their consent to and
 concurrence in all that was done, by <I>bowing their heads</I> and 
 <I>worshipping,</I> expressing an awful veneration of the divine 
 Majesty, by postures of adoration.  This is taken notice of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:28-30"><I>v.</I> 28-30</A>.
 
 It is not enough for us to be where God is worshipped, if we do not
 ourselves worship him, and that not with bodily exercise only, which 
 profits little, but with the heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The solemnities of this day did likewise look forward. The temple 
 service was to be set up again, that it might be continually kept up; 
 and this Hezekiah calls them to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 "Now that you have <I>consecrated yourselves to the Lord</I>--have both
 made an atonement and made a covenant by sacrifice, are solemnly 
 reconciled and engaged to him--now <I>come near, and bring 
 sacrifices.</I>" Note, Our covenant with God must be pursued and 
 improved in communion with him. Having consecrated ourselves, in the 
 first place, to the Lord, we must bring the sacrifices of prayer, and 
 praise, and alms, to his house. Now, in this work, it was found.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the people were free. Being called to it by the king, they 
 brought in their offerings, though not in such abundance as in the 
 glorious days of Solomon (for Judah was now diminished, impoverished, 
 and brought low), but according to what they had, and as much as one 
 could expect considering their poverty and the great decay of piety 
 among them. 

 (1.) Some were so generous as to bring burnt-offerings, which were 
 wholly consumed to the honour of God, and of which the offerer had no 
 part. Of this sort there were seventy bullocks, 100 rams, and 200 
 lambs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 (2.) Others brought peace-offerings and thank-offerings, the fat of 
 which was burnt upon the altar, and the flesh divided between the 
 priests and the offerers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 Of this sort there were 600 oxen and 3000 sheep,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Perhaps the remembrance of their sin in sacrificing on the high places
 made them more willing to bring their sacrifices now to God's 
 altar.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That <I>the priests were few,</I> too few for the service, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.
 
 Many of them, it is likely, were suspended and laid aside as polluted
 and uncanonical, for having sacrificed to idols in the last reign, and 
 the rest had not the zeal that one might have expected upon such an 
 occasion. They thought that the king needed not to be so forward, that 
 there was no necessity for such haste in opening the doors of the 
 temple, and therefore they took no care to sanctify themselves, and 
 being unsanctified, and so unqualified, they made that their excuse for 
 being absent from the service; as if their offence would be their 
 defence. It is recorded here, to the perpetual shame of the priests, 
 that, though they were so well provided for out of the offerings of the 
 Lord made by fire, yet they did not mind their business. Here was work 
 to do, and there wanted proper hands to do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That the Levites were forward. They had been <I>more upright in 
 heart to sanctify themselves than the priests</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 were better affected to the work and better prepared and qualified for
 it. This was their praise, and, in recompence for it, they had the 
 honour to be employed in that which was the priests' work: they 
 <I>helped them to flay the offerings.</I> This was not according to the 
 law

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+1:5,6">Lev. i. 5, 6</A>),

 but the irregularity was dispensed with in cases of necessity, and thus
 encouragement was given to the faithful zealous Levites and a just 
 disgrace put upon the careless priests. What the Levites wanted in the 
 ceremonial advantages of their birth and consecration was abundantly 
 made up in their eminent qualifications of skill and will to do the 
 work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That all were pleased. The king and all the people rejoiced in this 
 blessed turn of affairs and the new face of religion which the kingdom 
 had put on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.
 
 Two things in this matter pleased them:--

 (1.) That it was soon brought about: <I>The thing was done 
 suddenly,</I> in a little time, with a great deal of ease, and without 
 any opposition. Those that go about the work of God in faith and with 
 resolution will find that there is not that difficulty in it which they 
 sometimes imagine, but it will be a pleasing surprise to them to see 
 how soon it is done. 

 (2.) That the hand of God was plainly in it: <I>God had prepared the 
 people</I> by the secret influences of his grace, so that many of those 
 who had in the last reign doted on the idolatrous altars were now as 
 much in love with God's altar. This change, which God wrought on their 
 minds, did very much expedite and facilitate the work. Let magistrates 
 and ministers do their part towards the reforming of a land, and 
 ascribe to him the glory of what is done, especially when it is done 
 suddenly and is a pleasing surprise. <I>This is the Lord's doing, and 
 it is marvellous.</I></P>
