 We found it very easy, in the former chapter, to applaud the decency of 
 Ruth's behaviour, and to show what good use we may make of the account 
 given us of it; but in this chapter we shall have much ado to vindicate 
 it from the imputation of indecency, and to save it from having an ill 
 use made of it; but the goodness of those times was such as saved what 
 is recorded here from being ill done, and yet the badness of these 
 times is such as that it will not justify any now in doing the like. 
 Here is, 

 I.  The directions Naomi gave to her daughter-in-law how to claim Boaz
 for her husband,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. Ruth's punctual observance of those directions,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 III. The kind and honourable treatment Boaz gave her,

 IV. Her return to her mother-in-law,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter,
 shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?
 &nbsp; 2 And now <I>is</I> not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou
 wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.
 &nbsp; 3 Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment
 upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: <I>but</I> make not thyself
 known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.
 &nbsp; 4 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the
 place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his
 feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt
 do.
 &nbsp; 5 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will
 do.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Naomi's care for her daughter's comfort is without doubt very 
 commendable, and is recorded for imitation. She had no thoughts of 
 marrying herself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:12"><I>ch.</I> i. 12</A>.

 But, though she that was old had resolved upon a perpetual widowhood,
 yet she was far from the thoughts of confining her daughter-in-law to 
 it, that was young. Age must not make itself a standard to youth. On 
 the contrary, she is full of contrivance how to get her well married. 
 Her wisdom projected that for her daughter which her daughter's modesty 
 forbade her to project for herself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 This she did

 1. In justice to the dead, to raise up seed to those that were gone,
 and so to preserve the family from being extinct. 

 2. In kindness and gratitude to her daughter-in-law, who had conducted
 herself very dutifully and respectfully to her. "<I>My daughter</I>" 
 (said she, looking upon her in all respects as her own), "<I>shall I 
 not seek rest for thee,</I>" that is, a settlement in the married 
 state; "shall I not get thee a good husband, <I>that it may be well 
 with thee,</I>" that is, "that thou mayest live plentifully and 
 pleasantly, and not spend all thy days in the mean and melancholy 
 condition we now live in?" Note,

 (1.) A married state is, or should be, a state of rest to young people.
 Wandering affections are then fixed, and the heart must be at rest. It 
 is at rest in the house of a husband, and in his heart,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:9"><I>ch.</I> i. 9</A>.

 Those are giddy indeed that marriage does not compose. 

 (2.) That which should be desired and designed by those that enter into
 the married state is <I>that it may be well with them,</I> in order to 
 which it is necessary that they choose well; otherwise, instead of 
 being a rest to them, it may prove the greatest uneasiness. Parents, in 
 disposing of their children, must have this in their eye, <I>that it 
 may be well with them.</I> And be it always remembered <I>that is best 
 for us which is best for our souls.</I>

 (3.) It is the duty of parents to seek this rest for their children,
 and to do all that is fit for them to do, in due time, in order to it. 
 And the more dutiful and respectful they are to them, though they can 
 the worse spare them, yet they should the rather prefer them, and the 
 better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The course she took in order to her daughter's preferment was very 
 extraordinary and looks suspicious. If there was any thing improper in 
 it, the fault must lie upon Naomi, who put her daughter upon it, and 
 who knew, or should know, the laws and usages of Israel better than 
 Ruth. 

 1. It was true that Boaz, being near of kin to the deceased, and (for
 aught that Naomi knew to the contrary) the nearest of all now alive, 
 was obliged by the divine law to marry the widow of Mahlon, who was the 
 eldest son of Elimelech, and was dead without issue

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 "<I>Is not Boaz of our kindred,</I> and therefore bound in conscience
 to take care of our affairs?" This may encourage us to lay ourselves by 
 faith at the feet of Christ, that he is our near kinsman; having taken 
 our nature upon him, he is <I>bone of our bone and flesh of our 
 flesh.</I> 

 2. It was a convenient time to remind him of it, now that he had got so
 much acquaintance with Ruth by her constant attendance on his reapers 
 during the whole harvest, which was now ended; and he also, by the 
 kindness he had shown to Ruth in smaller matters, had encouraged Naomi 
 to hope that he would not be unkind, much less unjust, in this greater. 
 And she thought it was a good opportunity to apply to him when he made 
 a winnowing-feast at his threshing-floor

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 then and there completing the joy of the harvest, and treating his
 workmen like a kind master: <I>He winnoweth barley to-night,</I> that 
 is, he makes his entertainment to-night. As Nabal and Absalom had 
 feasts at their sheep-shearing, so Boaz at his winnowing. 

 3. Naomi thought Ruth the most proper person to do it herself; and
 perhaps it was the usage in that country that in this case the woman 
 should make the demand; so much is intimated by the law,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:7-9">Deut.  xxv. 7-9</A>.

 Naomi therefore orders her daughter-in-law to make herself clean and
 neat, not to make herself fine 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Wash thyself and anoint thee,</I> not paint thee (as Jezebel), put
 on thy raiment, but not the attire of a harlot, and go down to the 
 floor," whither, it is probable, she was invited to the supper there 
 made; but she must not make herself known, that it, not make her errand 
 known (she herself could not but be very well known among Boaz's 
 reapers) till the company had dispersed and Boaz had retired. And upon 
 this occasion she would have an easier access to him in private than 
 she could have at his own house. And thus far was well enough. But, 

 4.  Her coming to lie down at his feet, when he was asleep in his bed,
 had such an appearance of evil, was such an approach towards it, and 
 might have been such an occasion of it, that we know not well how to 
 justify it. Many expositors think it unjustifiable, particularly the 
 excellent Mr. Poole. We must not to evil that good may come. It is 
 dangerous to bring the spark and the tinder together; for how great a 
 matter may a little fire kindle! All agree that it is not to be drawn 
 into a precedent; neither our laws nor our times are the same that were 
 then; yet I am willing to make the best of it. If Boaz was, as they 
 presumed, the next kinsman, she was his wife before God (as we say), 
 and there needed but little ceremony to complete the nuptials; and 
 Naomi did not intend that Ruth should approach to him any otherwise 
 than as his wife.  She knew Boaz to be not only an old man (she would 
 not have trusted to that alone in venturing her daughter-in-law so near 
 him), but a grave sober man, a virtuous and religious man, and one that 
 feared God. She knew Ruth to be a modest woman, <I>chaste, and a keeper 
 at home,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:5">Tit. ii. 5</A>.

 The Israelites had indeed been once debauched by the daughters of Moab

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:1">Num. xxv. 1</A>),
 
 but this Moabitess was none of those daughters. Naomi herself designed
 nothing but what was honest and honourable, and her charity (which 
 <I>believeth all things</I> and <I>hopeth all things</I>) banished and 
 forbade all suspicion that either Boaz or Ruth would attempt any thing 
 but what was likewise honest and honourable. If what she advised had 
 been then as indecent and immodest (according to the usage of the 
 country) as it seems now to us, we cannot think that if Naomi had had 
 so little virtue (which yet we have no reason to suspect) she would 
 also have had so little wisdom as to put her daughter upon it, since 
 that alone might have marred the match, and have alienated the 
 affections of so grave and good a man as Boaz from her. We must 
 therefore think that the thing did not look so ill then as it does now.  
 Naomi referred her daughter-in-law to Boaz for further directions. When 
 she had thus made her claim, Boaz, who was more learned in the laws, 
 would <I>tell her what she must do.</I> Thus must we lay ourselves at 
 the feet of our Redeemer, to receive from him our doom. <I>Lord, what 
 wilt thou have me to do?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:6">Acts ix. 6</A>.

 We may be sure, if Ruth had apprehended any evil in that which her
 mother advised her to, she was a woman of too much virtue and too much 
 sense to promise as she did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>All that thou sayest unto me I will do.</I> Thus must <I>the younger
 submit to the elder,</I> and to their grave and prudent counsels, when 
 they have nothing worth speaking of to object against it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all
 that her mother in law bade her.
 &nbsp; 7 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry,
 he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came
 softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.
 &nbsp; 8 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and
 turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.
 &nbsp; 9 And he said, Who <I>art</I> thou? And she answered, I <I>am</I> Ruth
 thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid;
 for thou <I>art</I> a near kinsman.
 &nbsp; 10 And he said, Blessed <I>be</I> thou of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, my daughter:
 <I>for</I> thou hast showed more kindness in the latter end than at
 the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether
 poor or rich.
 &nbsp; 11 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that
 thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou
 <I>art</I> a virtuous woman.
 &nbsp; 12 And now it is true that I <I>am thy</I> near kinsman: howbeit
 there is a kinsman nearer than I.
 &nbsp; 13 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, <I>that</I> if
 he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do
 the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman
 to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, <I>as</I> the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth: lie down until the morning.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Boaz's good management of his common affairs. It is probable, 
 according to the common usage, 

 1. When his servants winnowed, he was with them, and had his eye upon
 them, to prevent, not their stealing any of his corn (he had no reason 
 to fear that), but their waste of it through carelessness in the 
 winnowing of it. Masters may sustain great losses by servants that are 
 heedless, though they be honest, which is a reason why men should be 
 diligent to <I>know the state of their own flocks,</I> and look well to 
 them. 

 2. When he had more than ordinary work to be done, he treated his
 servants with extraordinary entertainments, and, for their 
 encouragement, did <I>eat and drink with them.</I> It well becomes 
 those that are rich and great to be generous to, and also to be 
 familiar with, those that are under them, and employed for them. 

 3.  When Boaz had supped with his workmen, and been awhile pleasant
 with them, he <I>went to bed in due time,</I> so early that by midnight 
 he had his first sleep

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:8"><I>v.</I>  8</A>),

 and thus he would be fit for his business betimes next morning. All
 that are good husbands will keep good hours, and not indulge themselves 
 nor their families in unseasonable mirth. The Chaldee paraphrase tell 
 us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>)

 that <I>Boaz ate and drank and his heart was good</I> (and so the
 Hebrew word is), <I>and he blessed the name of the Lord, who had heard 
 his prayers, and taken away the famine from the land of Israel.</I> So 
 that he went sober to bed, his heart was in a good frame, and not 
 overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness. And he did not go to bed 
 without prayer.  Now that he had eaten and was full he blessed the 
 Lord, and now that he was going to rest he committed himself to the 
 divine protection; it was well he did, for he had an unusual temptation 
 before him, though he knew not of it. 

 4. He had his bed or couch laid <I>at the end of the heap of corn;</I>
 not because he had set his heart upon it, nor only that he might watch 
 and keep it safe from thieves, but it was too late to go home to the 
 city, and here he would be near his work, and ready for it next 
 morning, and he would show that he was not nice or curious in his 
 lodging, neither took state nor consulted his ease, but was, like his 
 father Jacob, a plain man, that, when there was occasion, could make 
 his bed in a barn, and, if need were, sleep contentedly in the 
 straw.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Ruth's good assurance in the management of her affair. She observed 
 her mother's orders, went and laid herself down, not by his side, but 
 overcross his bed's feet, in her clothes, and kept awake, waiting for 
 an opportunity to tell her errand.  When he awaked in the night, and 
 perceived there was somebody at his feet, and enquired who it was, she 
 told him her name and then her errand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 that she came to put herself under his protection, as the person
 appointed by the divine law to be her protector: "<I>Thou art he that 
 has a right to redeem</I> a family and an estate from perishing, and 
 therefore <I>let this ruin be under thy hand:</I> and <I>spread thy 
 skirt over me</I>--be pleased to espouse me and my cause." Thus must we 
 by faith apply ourselves to Jesus Christ as our next kinsman, that is 
 able to redeem us, come under his wings, as we are invited

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37">Matt. xxiii. 37</A>),

 and beg of him to <I>spread his skirt over us.</I> "Lord Jesus, take me
 into thy covenant and under thy care. <I>I am oppressed, undertake for 
 me.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The good acceptance Ruth gained with Boaz. What she did had no 
 ill-effect, either one way or other, so that Naomi was not mistaken in 
 her good opinion of her kinsman. He knew her demand was just and 
 honourable, and treated her accordingly, and did not <I>deal with</I> 
 his <I>sister as with a harlot,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:31">Gen. xxxiv. 31</A>.

 For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He did not offer to violate her chastity, though he had all the 
 opportunity that could be. The Chaldee paraphrase thus descants upon 
 it:--He <I>subdued his concupiscence, and did not approach to her, but
 did as Joseph the Just, who would not come near to his Egyptian 
 mistress, and as Phaltiel the Pious, who, when Saul had given him 
 Michal, David's wife</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:44">1 Sam. xxv. 44</A>),

 <I>put a sword between himself and her, that he might not touch
 her.</I> Boaz knew it was not any sinful lust that brought her thither, 
 and therefore bravely maintained both his own honour and hers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He did not put any ill construction upon what she did, did not 
 reproach her as an impudent woman and unfit to make an honest man a 
 wife. She having approved herself well in the fields, and all her 
 conduct having been modest and decent, he would not, from this 
 instance, entertain the least suspicion of her character nor seem to do 
 so, perhaps blaming himself that he had not offered the service of a 
 kinsman to these distressed widows, and saved her this trouble, and 
 ready to say as Judah concerning his daughter-in-law, <I>She is more 
 righteous than I.</I> But on the contrary,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He commended her, spoke kindly to her, called her his 
 <I>daughter,</I> and spoke honourably of her, as a woman of eminent 
 virtue. She had shown in this instance more kindness to her 
 mother-in-law, and to the family into which she had matched, than in 
 any instance yet. It was very kind to leave her own country and come 
 along with her mother to the land of Israel, to dwell with her, and 
 help to maintain her. For this he had blessed her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:12"><I>ch.</I> ii. 12</A>);

 but now he says, Thou hast <I>shown more kindness in the latter end
 than at the beginning</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 in that she consulted not her own fancy, but her husband's family, in
 marrying again. She received not the addresses of <I>young men</I> 
 (much less did she seek them) <I>whether poor or rich,</I> but was 
 willing to marry as the divine law directed, though it was to an old 
 man, because it was for the honour and interest of the family into 
 which she had matched, and for which she had an entire kindness. Young 
 people must aim, in disposing of themselves, not so much to please 
 their own eye as to please God and their parents.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He promised her marriage 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>Fear not</I> that I will slight thee, or expose thee; no, <I>I will
 do all that thou requirest,</I> for it is the same that the law 
 requires, from the next of kin, and I have no reason to decline it, 
 <I>for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous 
 woman,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Note,

 [1.] Exemplary virtue ought to have its due praise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:8">Phil. iv. 8</A>),

 and it will recommend both men and women to the esteem of the wisest
 and best. Ruth was a poor woman, and poverty often obscures the lustre 
 of virtue; yet Ruth's virtues, even in a mean condition, were generally 
 taken notice of and could not be hid; nay, her virtues took away the 
 reproach of her poverty. If poor people be but good people, they shall 
 have honour from God and man. Ruth had been remarkable for her 
 humility, which paved the way to this honour. The less she proclaimed 
 her own goodness the more did her neighbours take notice of it. 

 [2.] In the choice of yoke-fellows, virtue should especially be 
 regarded, known approved virtue. Let religion determine the choice, and 
 it will certainly crown the choice and make it comfortable. <I>Wisdom 
 is better than gold,</I> and, when it is said to be <I>good with an 
 inheritance,</I> the meaning is that an inheritance is worth little 
 without it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He made his promise conditional, and could not do otherwise, for 
 it seems there was a kinsman that was nearer than he, to whom the right 
 of redemption did belong, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This he knew, but we may reasonably suppose Naomi (who had been long
 abroad, and could not be exact in the pedigree of her husband's family) 
 was ignorant of it, otherwise she would never have sent her daughter to 
 make her claim of Boaz. Yet he does not bid her go herself to this 
 other kinsman; this would have been to put too great a hardship upon 
 her: but he promises,

 [1.] That he would himself propose it to the other kinsman, and know 
 his mind. The Hebrew word for a widow signifies <I>one that is 
 dumb.</I> Boaz will therefore <I>open his mouth for the dumb</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:8">Prov. xxxi. 8</A>),

 and will say that for this widow which she knew not how to say for
 herself. 

 [2.] That, if the other kinsman refused to do the kinsman's part, he 
 would do it, would marry the widow, redeem the land, and so repair the 
 family. This promise he backs with a solemn oath, for it was a 
 conditional contract of marriage

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>As the Lord liveth.</I> Thus keeping the matter in suspense, he bade
 her wait till morning.  Bishop Hall thus sums up this matter in his 
 contemplations:--"Boaz, instead of touching her as a wanton, blesseth 
 her as a father, encourageth her as a friend, promiseth her as a 
 kinsman, rewards her as a patron, and sends her away laden with hopes 
 and gifts, no less chaste, more happy, than she came. O admirable 
 temperance, worthy the progenitor of him in whose lips and heart there 
 was no guile!"</P>

 before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known
 that a woman came into the floor.
 &nbsp; 15 Also he said, Bring the vail that <I>thou hast</I> upon thee, and
 hold it. And when she held it, he measured six <I>measures</I> of
 barley, and laid <I>it</I> on her: and she went into the city.
 &nbsp; 16 And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who <I>art</I>

 We are here told, 

 I. How Ruth was dismissed by Boaz. It would not have been safe for her 
 to go home in the dead of the night; therefore <I>she lay at his 
 feet</I> (not by his side) <I>until morning.</I> But as soon as ever 
 the day broke, that she had light to go home by, she got away, 
 <I>before one could know another,</I> that, if she were seen, yet she 
 might not be known to be abroad so unseasonably. She was not shy of 
 being known to be a gleaner in the field, nor ashamed of that mark of 
 her poverty.  But she would not willingly be known to be a 
 night-walker, for her virtue was her greatest honour, and that which 
 she most valued. Boaz dismissed her, 
 
 1. With a charge to keep counsel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor,</I> and lay
 all night so near to Boaz; for, though they needed not to care much 
 what people said of them while they were both conscious to themselves 
 of an unspotted purity, yet, because few could have come so near the 
 fire as they did and not have been scorched, had it been known it would 
 have occasioned suspicions in some and reflections from others. Good 
 people would have been troubled, and bad people would have triumphed, 
 and therefore <I>let it not be known.</I> Note, We must always take 
 care, not only to keep a good conscience, but to keep a good name: 
 either we must not do that which, though innocent, is liable to be 
 misinterpreted, or, if we do, we must not <I>let it be known.</I> We 
 must avoid not only sin, but scandal. There was likewise a particular 
 reason for concealment here. If this matter should take wind, it might 
 prejudice the freedom of the other kinsman's choice, and he would make 
 this his reason for refusing Ruth, that Boaz and she had been together. 
 
 2. He dismissed her with a good present of corn, which would be very
 acceptable to her poor mother at home, and an evidence for her that he 
 had not sent her away in dislike, which Naomi might have suspected if 
 he had sent her away empty. He gave it to her in her <I>veil,</I> or 
 <I>apron,</I> or <I>mantle,</I> gave it to her by measure. Like a 
 prudent corn-master, he kept an account of all he delivered out. It was 
 <I>six measures,</I> that is six omers as is supposed, ten of which 
 made an ephah; whatever the measure was, it is probable he gave her as 
 much as she could well carry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 And the Chaldee says, <I>Strength was given her from the Lord to carry
 it;</I> and adds that now <I>it was told her by the spirit of prophecy 
 that from her should descend six of the most righteous men of their 
 age,</I> namely, <I>David, Daniel, his three companions, and the king 
 Messiah.</I></P>

 II. How she was welcomed by her mother-in-law. She asked her, "<I>Who 
 art thou, my daughter?</I> Art thou a bride or no? Must I give thee 
 joy?" So Ruth told her how the matter stood 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 whereupon her mother, 

 1. Advised her to be satisfied in what was done: <I>Sit still, my 
 daughter, till thou know how the matter will fall</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)--<I>how

 it is decreed in heaven,</I> so the Chaldee reads it, for marriages are
 made there. She had done all that was fit for her to do, and now she 
 must patiently wait the issue and not be perplexed about it. Let us 
 learn hence to cast our care upon providence, to follow that and attend 
 the motions of it, composing ourselves into an expectation of the 
 event, with a resolution to acquiesce in it, whatever it be.  Sometimes 
 that proves best done for us that is least our own doing. "<I>Sit 
 still,</I> therefore, <I>and see how the matter will fall,</I> and say, 
 Let it fall how it will, I am ready for it." 

 2. She assured her that Boaz, having undertaken this matter, would
 approve himself a faithful careful friend: <I>He will not be at rest 
 till he have finished the matter.</I> Though it was a busy time with 
 him in his fields and his floor, yet, having undertaken to serve his 
 friend, he would not neglect the business.  Naomi believes that Ruth 
 has won his heart, and that therefore he will not be easy till he knows 
 whether she be his or no.  This she gives as a reason why Ruth should 
 sit still and not perplex herself about it, that Boaz had undertaken 
 it, and he would be sure to manage it well. Much more reason have good 
 Christians to be <I>careful for nothing,</I> but <I>cast their care on 
 God,</I> because he has promised to <I>care for them:</I> and what need 
 have we to care if he do? <I>Sit still, and see how the matter will 
 fall,</I> for <I>the Lord will perfect that which concerns thee,</I> 
 and will make it to work for good to thee, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:4,5,138:8">Ps. xxxvii. 4, 5; cxxxviii. 8</A>.

 <I>Your strength is to sit still,</I>
