 We here find Ahaziah, the genuine son and successor of Ahab, on the 
 throne of Israel. His reign continued not two years; he died by a fall 
 in his own house, of which, after the mention of the revolt of Moab

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:1">ver. 1</A>),

 we have here an account.

 I. The message which, on that occasion, he sent to the god of Ekron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:2">ver. 2</A>.

 II. The message he received from the God of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:3-8">ver. 3-8</A>.

 III. The destruction of the messengers he sent to seize the prophet,
 once and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.

 IV. His compassion to, and compliance with, the third messenger, upon
 his submission, and the delivery of the message to the king himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>.

 IV. The death of Ahaziah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:17,18">ver. 17, 18</A>.

 In the story we may observe how great the prophet looks and how little 
 the prince.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
 &nbsp; 2 And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber
 that <I>was</I> in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and
 said unto them, Go, enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron whether
 I shall recover of this disease.
 &nbsp; 3 But the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise,
 go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto
 them, <I>Is it</I> not because <I>there is</I> not a God in Israel, <I>that</I>
 ye go to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?
 &nbsp; 4 Now therefore thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Thou shalt not come down
 from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
 And Elijah departed.
 &nbsp; 5 And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto
 them, Why are ye now turned back?
 &nbsp; 6 And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and
 said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say
 unto him, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>Is it</I> not because <I>there is</I> not
 a God in Israel, <I>that</I> thou sendest to enquire of Baal-zebub the
 god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on
 which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
 &nbsp; 7 And he said unto them, What manner of man <I>was he</I> which came
 up to meet you, and told you these words?
 &nbsp; 8 And they answered him, <I>He was</I> a hairy man, and girt with a
 girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It <I>is</I> Elijah
 the Tishbite.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Ahaziah, the wicked king of Israel, under God's rebukes 
 both by his providence and by his prophet, by his rod and by his 
 word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He is crossed in his affairs. How can those expect to prosper that 
 <I>do evil in the sight of the Lord,</I> and <I>provoke him to 
 anger?</I> When he rebelled against God, and revolted from his 
 allegiance to him, Moab rebelled against Israel, and revolted from the
 subjection that had long paid to the kings of Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The Edomites that bordered on Judah, and were tributaries to the kings
 of Judah, still continued so, as we find in the chapter before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>),
 
 till, in the wicked reign of Joram, they broke that yoke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:22"><I>ch.</I> viii. 22</A>)

 as the Moabites did now. If men break their covenants with us, and
 neglect their duty, we must reflect upon our breach of covenant with 
 God, and the neglect of our duty to him. Sin weakens and impoverishes 
 us. We shall hear of the Moabites,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+3:5"><I>ch.</I> iii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is seized with sickness in body, not from any inward cause, but 
 by a severe accident. <I>He fell down through a lattice,</I> and was 
 much bruised with the fall; perhaps it threw him into a fever, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Whatever we go, there is but a step between us and death. A man's house
 is his castle, but not to secure him against the judgments of God. The 
 cracked lattice is a fatal to the son, when God pleases to make it so, 
 as the bow drawn at a venture was to the father. Ahaziah would not 
 attempt to reduce the Moabites, lest he should perish in the field of 
 battle: but he is not safe, though he tarry at home. Royal palaces do 
 not always yield firm footing. The snare is laid for the sinner in the 
 ground where he thinks least of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:9,10">Job xviii. 9, 10</A>.

 The whole creation, which groans under the man's sin, will at length
 sink and break under the weight, like this lattice. He is never safe 
 that has God for his enemy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In his distress he sends messengers to enquire of the god Ekron 
 whether he should recover or no, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 And here,

 1. His enquiry was very foolish: <I>Shall I recover?</I> Even nature 
 itself would rather have asked, "What means may I use that I may 
 recover?" But as one solicitous only to know his fortune, not to know 
 his duty, his question is only this, <I>Shall I recover?</I> to which a 
 little time would give an answer. We should be more thoughtful what 
 will become of us after death than how, or when, or where, we shall 
 die, and more desirous to be told how we may conduct ourselves well in 
 our sickness, and get good to our souls by it, than whether we shall 
 recover from it. 

 2. His sending to Baal-zebub was very wicked; to make a dead and dumb
 idol, perhaps newly erected (for idolaters were fond of new gods), his 
 oracle, was not less a reproach to his reason than to his religion.  
 Baal-zebub, which signifies <I>the lord of a fly,</I> was one of their 
 Baals that perhaps gave his answers either by the power of the demons 
 or the craft of the priests, with a humming noise, like that of a great 
 fly, or that had (as they fancied) rid their country of the swarms of 
 flies wherewith it was infested, or of some pestilential disease 
 brought among them by flies. Perhaps this dunghill-deity was as famous 
 then as the oracle of Delphos was, long afterwards, in Greece. In the 
 New Testament <I>the prince of the devils</I> is called 
 <I>Beel-zebub</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:24">Matt. xii. 24</A>),

 for the gods of the Gentiles were devils, and this perhaps grew to be
 one of the most famous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Elijah, by direction from God, meets the messengers, and turns them 
 back with an answer that shall save them the labour of going to Ekron. 
 Had Ahaziah sent for Elijah, humbled himself, and begged his prayers, 
 he might have had an answer of peace; but if he send to the god of 
 Ekron, instead of the God of Israel, this, like Saul's consulting the 
 witch, shall fill the measure of his iniquity, and bring upon him a 
 sentence of death. Those that will not enquire of the word of God for 
 their comfort shall be made to hear it, whether they will or not, to 
 their amazement.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He faithfully reproves his sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Is it not because there is not</I> (that is, because you think there
 is not) a God in Israel (<I>because there is no God, none in 
 Israel,</I> so it may be read), <I>that you go to enquire of 
 Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron,</I> a despicable town of the Philistines

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:7">Zech. ix. 7</A>),

 long since vanquished by Israel? Here, 

 (1.) The sin was bad enough, giving that honour to the devil which is 
 due to God alone, which was done as much by their enquiries as by their 
 sacrifices. Note, It is a very wicked thing, upon any occasion or 
 pretence whatsoever, to consult with the devil. This wickedness reigned 
 in the heathen world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:12,13">Isa. xlvii. 12, 13</A>)

 and remains too much even in the Christian world, and the devil's
 kingdom is supported by it.

 (2.) The construction which Elijah, in God's name, puts upon it, makes 
 it much worse: "It is because you think not only that the God of Israel 
 is not able to tell you, but that there is no God at all in Israel, 
 else you would not send so far for a divine answer." Note, A practical 
 and constructive atheism is the cause and malignity of our departures 
 from God. Surely we think there is <I>no God in Israel</I> when we live 
 at large, make flesh our arm, and seek a portion in the things of this 
 world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He plainly reads his doom: Go, tell him <I>he shall surely die,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 "Since he is so anxious to know his fate, this is it; let him make the 
 best of it." The certain fearful looking for of judgment and 
 indignation which this message must needs cause cannot but cut him to 
 the heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The message being delivered to him by his servants, he enquires of 
 them by whom it was sent to him, and concludes, by their description of 
 him, that it must be Elijah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.
 
 For,

 1. His dress was the same that he had seen him in, in his father's 
 court. He was clad in a hairy garment, and had a leathern girdle about 
 him, was plain and homely in his garb. John Baptist, the Elias of the 
 New Testament, herein resembled him, for his clothes were made of hair 
 cloth, and he was girt with a leathern girdle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:4">Matt. iii. 4</A>.

 He that was clothed with the Spirit despised all rich and gay clothing.

 2. His message was such as he used to deliver to his father, to whom he 
 never prophesied good, but evil. Elijah is one of those witnesses that
 still torment the inhabitants of the earth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:10">Rev. xi. 10</A>.

 He that was a thorn in Ahab's eyes will be so in the eyes of his son
 while he treads in the steps of his father's wickedness; and he is 
 ready to cry out, as his father did, <I>Hast thou found me, O my 
 enemy?</I> Let sinners consider that the word which <I>took hold of 
 their fathers</I> is still as quick and powerful as ever. See

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his
 fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of
 a hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath
 said, Come down.
 &nbsp; 10 And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I
 <I>be</I> a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and
 consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven,
 and consumed him and his fifty.
 &nbsp; 11 Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with
 his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus
 hath the king said, Come down quickly.
 &nbsp; 12 And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I <I>be</I> a man of
 God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy
 fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed
 him and his fifty.
 &nbsp; 13 And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his
 fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell
 on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him,
 O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these
 fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.
 &nbsp; 14 Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the
 two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore
 let my life now be precious in thy sight.
 &nbsp; 15 And the angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Elijah, Go down with
 him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him
 unto the king.
 &nbsp; 16 And he said unto him, Thus saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Forasmuch as thou
 hast sent messengers to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron,
 <I>is it</I> not because <I>there is</I> no God in Israel to enquire of his
 word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which
 thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
 &nbsp; 17 So he died according to the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> which Elijah
 had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year
 of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had
 no son.
 &nbsp; 18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, <I>are</I> they
 not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The king issues out a warrant for the apprehending of Elijah.  If 
 the God of Ekron had told him he should die, it is probable he would 
 have taken it quietly; but now that a prophet of the Lord tells him so, 
 reproving him for his sin and reminding him of the God of Israel, he 
 cannot bear it. So far is he from making any good improvement of the 
 warning given him that he is enraged against the prophet; neither his 
 sickness, nor the thoughts of death, made any good impressions upon 
 him, nor possessed him with any fear of God. No external alarms will 
 startle and soften secure sinners, but rather exasperate them. Did the 
 king think Elijah a prophet, a true prophet? Why then durst he 
 persecute him? Did he think him a common person? What occasion was 
 there to send such a force, in order to seize him? Thus a band of men 
 must take our Lord Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The captain that was sent with his fifty soldiers found Elijah on
 the top of a hill (some think Carmel), and commanded him, in the king's 
 name, to surrender himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Elijah was now so far from absconding, as formerly, into the close
 recesses of a cave, that he makes a bold appearance on the top of a 
 hill; experience of God's protection makes him more bold. The captain 
 calls him <I>a man of God,</I> not that he believed him to be so, or 
 reverenced him a such a one, but because he was commonly called so. Had 
 he really looked upon him as a prophet, he would not have attempted to 
 make him his prisoner; and, had he thought him entrusted with the word 
 of God, he would not have pretended to command him with the word of a 
 king.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Elijah calls for fire from heaven, to consume this haughty daring 
 sinner, not to secure himself (he could have done that some other way), 
 nor to avenge himself (for it was not his own cause that he appeared 
 and acted in), but to prove his mission, and to <I>reveal the wrath of 
 God</I> from <I>heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of 
 men.</I> This captain had, in scorn, called him <I>a man of God:</I> 
 "If I be so," says Elijah, "thou shalt pay dearly for making a jest of 
 it." He valued himself upon his commission (the king has said, <I>Come 
 down</I>), but Elijah will let him know that the God of Israel is
 superior to the king of Israel and has a greater power to enforce his 
 commands. It was not long since Elijah had fetched fire from heaven, to 
 consume the sacrifice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+17:38">1 Kings xvii. 38</A>),

 in token of God's acceptance of that sacrifice as an atonement for the
 sins of the people; but, they having slighted that, now the fire falls, 
 not on the sacrifice, but on the sinners themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 See here,

 1. What an interest the prophets had in heaven; what the Spirit of God 
 in them demanded the power of God effected. Elijah did but speak, and 
 it was done. He that formerly had fetched water from heaven now fetches 
 fire. O the power of prayer! <I>Concerning the work of my hands,
 command you me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:11">Isa. xiv. 11</A>.

 2. What an interest heaven had in the prophets! God was always ready to
 plead their cause, and avenge the injuries done to them; kings shall 
 still be <I>rebuked for their sakes,</I> and charged to do <I>his 
 prophets no harm;</I> one Elijah is more to God than 10,000 captains 
 and their fifties. Doubtless Elijah did this by a divine impulse, and 
 yet our Saviour would not allow the disciples to draw it into a 
 precedent,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:54">Luke ix. 54</A>.

 They were now not far from the place where Elias did this act of
 justice upon provoking Israelites, and would needs, in like manner, 
 call for fire upon those provoking Samaritans. "No," says Christ, "by 
 no means, <I>you know not what manner of spirit you are of,</I>" that 
 is, 

 (1.) "You do not consider <I>what manner of spirit,</I> as disciples, 
 you are called to, and how different from that of the Old-Testament 
 dispensation; it was agreeable enough to that dispensation of terror, 
 and of the letter, for Elias to call for fire, but the dispensation of 
 the Spirit and of grace will by no means allow it." 

 (2.) "You are not aware what manner of spirit you are, upon this 
 occasion, actuated by, and how different from that of Elias: he did it 
 in holy zeal, you in passion; he was concerned for God's glory, you for 
 your own reputation only." God judges men's practices by their 
 principles, and his judgment is according to truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. This is repeated a second time; would one think it? 

 1. Ahaziah sends, a second time, to apprehend Elijah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 as if he were resolved not to be baffled by omnipotence itself.
 Obstinate sinners must be convinced and conquered, at last, by the fire 
 of hell, for fire from heaven, it seems, will not subdue them.

 2. Another captain is ready with his fifty, who, in his blind rage 
 against the prophet, and his blind obedience to the king, dares engage 
 in that service which had been fatal to the last undertakers. This is 
 as impudent and imperious as the last, and more in haste; not only, 
 "<I>Come down quietly,</I> and do not struggle," but without taking any 
 notice of what had been done, he says, "<I>Come down quickly,</I> and 
 do not trifle, the king's business requires haste; come down, or I will 
 fetch thee down." 

 3.  Elijah relents not, but calls for another flash of lightning, which
 instantly lays this captain and his fifty dead upon the spot. Those 
 that will sin like others must expect to suffer like them; God is 
 inflexibly just.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The third captain humbled himself and cast himself upon the mercy of 
 God and Elijah. It does not appear that Ahaziah ordered him to do so 
 (his stubborn heart is as hard as ever; so regardless is he of the 
 terrors of the Lord, so little affected with the manifestations of his 
 wrath, and withal so prodigal of the lives of his subjects, that he 
 sends a third with the same provoking message to Elijah), but he took 
 warning by the fate of his predecessors, who, perhaps, lay dead before 
 his eyes; and, instead of summoning the prophet down, fell down before 
 him, and begged for his life and the lives of his soldiers, 
 acknowledging their own evil deserts and the prophet's power 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>):

 <I>Let my life be precious in thy sight.</I> Note, There is nothing to
 be got by contending with God: if we would prevail with him, it must be 
 by supplication; if we would not fall before God, we must bow before 
 him; and those are wise for themselves who learn submission from the 
 fatal consequences of the obstinacy of others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Elijah does more than grant the request of this third captain. God 
 is not so severe with those that stand it out against him but he is as 
 ready to show mercy to those that repent and submit to him; never any 
 found it in vain to cast themselves upon the mercy of God. This 
 captain, not only has his life spared, but is permitted to carry his 
 point: Elijah, being so commanded by the angel, <I>goes down with him 
 to the king,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Thus he shows that he before refused to come, not because he feared the
 king or court, but because he would not be imperiously compelled, which 
 would lessen the honour of his master; he <I>magnifies his office.</I> 
 He comes boldly to the king, and tells him to his face (let him take it 
 as he may) what he had before sent to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 that he shall surely and shortly die; he mitigates not the sentence,
 either for fear of the king's displeasure or in pity to his misery. The 
 God of Israel has condemned him, let him send to see whether the god of 
 Ekron can deliver him. So thunder-struck is Ahaziah with this message, 
 when it comes from the prophet's own mouth, that neither he nor any of 
 those about him durst offer him any violence, nor so much as give him 
 an affront; but out of that den of lions he comes unhurt, like Daniel. 
 Who can harm those whom God will shelter?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The prediction is accomplished in a few days. Ahaziah 
 died 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 and, dying childless, left his kingdom to his brother Jehoram. His
 father reigned wickedly twenty-two years, he not two.  Sometimes the 
 <I>wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power;</I> but those who 
 therefore promise themselves prosperity in impiety may perhaps find 
 themselves deceived; for (as bishop Hall observes here), "Some sinners 
 live long, to aggravate their judgment, others die soon, to hasten it;" 
 but it is certain that evil pursues sinners, and, sooner or later, it 
 will overtake them; nor will any thing fill the measure sooner than 
 that complicated iniquity of Ahaziah--honouring the devil's oracles and 
 hating God's oracles.</P>
