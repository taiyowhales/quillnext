 We left David's army in triumph and yet David himself in tears: now
 here we have, 

 I. His return to himself, by the persuasion of Joab, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:1-8">ver.  1-8</A>.

 II. His return to his kingdom from his present banishment. 

 1. The men of Israel were forward of themselves to bring him back, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 2.  The men of Judah were dealt with by David's agents to do it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>)

 and did it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:15">ver. 15</A>.

 III. At the king's coming over Jordan, Shimei's treason is pardoned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:16-23">ver. 16-23</A>),

 Mephibosheth's failure is excused 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:24-30">ver. 24-30</A>),

 and Barzillai's kindness is thankfully owned, and recompensed to his
 son, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:31-39">ver. 31-39</A>.

 IV. The men of Israel quarrelled with the men of Judah, for not calling
 them to the ceremony of the king's restoration, which occasioned a new 
 rebellion, an account of which we have in the next chapter, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:40-43">ver. 40-43</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth
 for Absalom.
 &nbsp; 2 And the victory that day was <I>turned</I> into mourning unto all
 the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was
 grieved for his son.
 &nbsp; 3 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as
 people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
 &nbsp; 4 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud
 voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!
 &nbsp; 5 And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast
 shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day
 have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy
 daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy
 concubines;
 &nbsp; 6 In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends.
 For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither
 princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom
 had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee
 well.
 &nbsp; 7 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy
 servants: for I swear by the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, if thou go not forth, there
 will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse
 unto thee than all the evil that befel thee from thy youth until
 now.
 &nbsp; 8 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto
 all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate.
 And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled
 every man to his tent.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Soon after the messengers had brought the news of the defeat and death 
 of Absalom to the court of Mahanaim, Joab and his victorious army 
 followed, to grace the king's triumphs and receive his further orders. 
 Now here we are told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What a damp and disappointment it was to them to find the king in 
 tears for Absalom's death, which they construed as a token of 
 displeasure against them for what they had done, whereas they expected 
 him to have met them with joy and thanks for their good services: <I>It 
 was told Joab,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The report of it ran through the army
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 <I>how the king was grieved for his son.</I> The people will take
 particular notice what their princes say and do. The more eyes we have 
 upon us, and the greater our influence is, the more need we have to 
 speak and act wisely and to govern our passions strictly. When they 
 came to the city they found the king in close mourning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He covered his face, and would not so much as look up, nor take any
 notice of the generals when they attended him. It could not but 
 surprise them to find,

 1. How the king proclaimed his passion, of which he ought to have been
 ashamed, and which he would have striven to smother and conceal if he 
 had consulted either his reputation for courage, which was lessened by 
 his mean submission to the tyranny of so absurd a passion, or his 
 interest in the people, which would be prejudiced by his 
 discountenancing what was done in zeal for his honour and the public 
 safety. Yet see how he avows his grief: <I>He cries with a loud voice, 
 O my son Absalom!</I> "My servants have all come home safe, but where 
 is my son? He is dead; and, dying in sin, I fear he is lost for ever. I 
 cannot now say, <I>I shall go to him,</I> for my soul shall not be 
 gathered with such sinners; what shall be done for thee, <I>O Absalom! 
 my son, my son!</I>" 

 2. How he prolonged his passion, even till the army had come up to him,
 which must be some time after he received the first intelligence. If he 
 had contented himself with giving vent to his passion for an hour or 
 two when he first heard the news, it would have been excusable, but to 
 continue it thus for so bad a son as Absalom, like Jacob for so good a 
 son as Joseph, with a resolution to go to the grave mourning and to 
 stain his triumphs with his tears, was very unwise and very unworthy. 
 Now see how ill this was taken by the people.  They were loth to blame 
 the king, for <I>whatever he did used to please them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:36"><I>ch.</I> iii. 36</A>),
 
 but they took it as a great mortification to them.  <I>Their victory
 was turned into mourning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 <I>They stole into the city as men ashamed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 In compliment to their sovereign, they would not rejoice in that which
 they perceived so afflictive to him, and yet they could not but be 
 uneasy that they were thus obliged to conceal their joy. Superiors 
 ought not to put such hardships as these on their inferiors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How plainly and vehemently Joab reproved David for this indiscreet 
 management of himself in this critical juncture. David never more 
 needed the hearts of his subjects than now, nor was ever more concerned 
 to secure his interest in their affections; and therefore whatever 
 tended to disoblige them now was the most impolitic thing he could do, 
 and the greatest wrong imaginable to his friends that adhered to him. 
 Joab therefore censures him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.

 He speaks a great deal of reason, but not with the respect and
 deference which he owed to his prince.  <I>Is is fit to say to a king, 
 Thou art wicked?</I> A plain case may be fairly pleaded with those that 
 are above us, and they may be reproved for what they do amiss, but it 
 must not be done with rudeness and insolence. David did indeed need to 
 be roused and alarmed; and Joab thought it no time to dally with him. 
 If superiors do that which is foolish, they must neither think it 
 strange nor take it ill if their inferiors tell them of it, perhaps too 
 bluntly.

 1. Joab magnifies the services of David's soldiers: "<I>This day they 
 have saved thy life,</I> and therefore deserve to be taken notice of, 
 and have reason to resent it if they be not." It is implied that 
 Absalom, whom he honoured with his tears, sought his ruin and the ruin 
 of his family, while those whom by his tears he puts a slight upon were 
 such as preserved from ruin him and all that was dear to him. Great 
 mischiefs have arisen to princes from the contempt of great merits. 

 2.  He aggravates the discouragement David had given them: "<I>Thou
 hast shamed their faces;</I> for, while they have shown such a value 
 for thy life, thou hast shown no value for theirs, but preferrest a 
 spoiled wicked youth, a false traitor to his king and country, whom we 
 are happily rid of, before all thy wise counsellors, brave commanders, 
 and loyal subjects. What can be more absurd than to love thy enemies 
 and hate thy friends?" 

 3. He advises him to present himself immediately at the head of his 
 troops, to smile upon them, welcome them home, congratulate their 
 success, and return them thanks for their services.  Even those that 
 may be commanded yet expect to be thanked when they do well, and ought 
 to be. 

 4. He threatens him with another rebellion if he would not do this,
 intimating that rather than serve so ungrateful a prince he himself 
 would head a revolt from him, and then (so confident is Joab of his own 
 interest in the people) "<I>there will not tarry with thee one man.</I> 
 If I go, they will go. Thou hast now nothing to mourn for: but, if thou 
 persist, I will give thee something to mourn for (as Josephus expresses 
 it) with a true and more bitter mourning."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How prudently and mildly David took the reproof and counsel given 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He shook off his grief, anointed his head, and washed his face, that he
 might not appear unto men to mourn, and then made his appearance in 
 public in the gate, which was as the guild-hall of the city. Hither the 
 people flocked to him to congratulate his and their safety, and all was 
 well. Note, When we are convinced of a fault, we must amend, though we 
 are told of it by our inferiors, and indecently, or in heat and 
 passion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes
 of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our
 enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines;
 and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.
 &nbsp; 10 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle.
 Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?
 &nbsp; 11 And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,
 saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the
 last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of
 all Israel is come to the king, <I>even</I> to his house.
 &nbsp; 12 Ye <I>are</I> my brethren, ye <I>are</I> my bones and my flesh:
 wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?
 &nbsp; 13 And say ye to Amasa, <I>Art</I> thou not of my bone, and of my
 flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of
 the host before me continually in the room of Joab.
 &nbsp; 14 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as <I>the
 heart of</I> one man; so that they sent <I>this word</I> unto the king,
 Return thou, and all thy servants.
 &nbsp; 15 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to
 Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is strange that David did not immediately upon the defeat and 
 dispersion of Absalom's forces march with all expedition back to 
 Jerusalem, to regain the possession of his capital city, while the 
 rebels were in confusion and before they could rally again. What 
 occasion was there to bring him back? Could not he himself go back with 
 the victorious army he had with him in Gilead? He could, no doubt; but, 
 
 1. He would go back as a prince, with the consent and unanimous
 approbation of the people, and not as a conqueror forcing his way: he 
 would restore their liberties, and not take occasion to seize them, or 
 encroach upon them. 

 2. He would go back in peace and safety, and be sure that he should
 meet with no difficulty or opposition in his return, and therefore 
 would be satisfied that the people were well-affected to have him 
 before he would stir. 

 3. He would go back in honour, and like himself, and therefore would go 
 back, not at the head of his forces, but in the arms of his subjects; 
 for the prince that has wisdom and goodness enough to make himself his 
 people's darling, without doubt, looks greater and makes a much better 
 figure than the prince that has strength enough to make himself his 
 people's terror. It is resolved therefore that David must be brought 
 back to Jerusalem his own city, and his own house there, with some 
 ceremony, and here we have that matter concerted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The men of Israel (that is, the ten tribes) were the first that 
 talked of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 The people were at strife about it; it was the great subject of
 discourse and dispute throughout all the country. Some perhaps opposed 
 it: "Let him either come back himself or stay where he is;" others 
 appeared zealous for it, and reasoned as follows here, to further the 
 design,

 1. That David had formerly helped them, had fought their battles, 
 subdued their enemies, and done them much service, and therefore it was 
 a shame that he should continue banished from their country who had 
 been so great a benefactor to it. Note, Good services done to the 
 public, though they may be forgotten for a while, yet will be 
 remembered again when men come to their right minds. 

 2.  That Absalom had now disappointed them. "We were foolishly sick of
 the cedar, and chose the branch to reign over us; but we have had 
 enough of him: he is consumed, and we narrowly escaped being consumed 
 with him.  Let us therefore return to our allegiance, and think of 
 bringing the king back." Perhaps this was all the strife among them, 
 not a dispute whether the king should be brought back or no (all agreed 
 it was to be done), but whose fault is was that it was not done. As is 
 usual in such cases, every one justified himself and blamed his 
 neighbour. The people laid the fault on the elders, and the elders on 
 the people, and one tribe upon another. Mutual excitements to the doing 
 of a good work are laudable, but not mutual accusations for the not 
 doing of it; for usually when public services are neglected all sides 
 must share in the blame; every one might do more than he does, in the 
 reformation of manners, the healing of divisions, and the like.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The men of Judah, by David's contrivance, were the first that did 
 it. It is strange that they, being David's own tribe, were not so 
 forward as the rest. David had intelligence of the good disposition of 
 all the rest towards him, but nothing from Judah, though he had always 
 been particularly careful of them. But we do not always find the most 
 kindness from those from whom we have most reason to expect it. Yet 
 David would not return till he knew the sense of his own tribe. 
 <I>Judah was his lawgiver,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:7">Ps. lx. 7</A>.

 That his way home might be the more clear,

 1. He employed Zadok and Abiathar, the two chief priests, to treat with 
 the elders of Judah, and to excite them to give the king an invitation 
 back to his house, even to his house, which was the glory of their 
 tribe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 No men more proper to negociate this affair than the two priests, who
 were firm to David's interest, were prudent men, and had great 
 influence with the people. Perhaps the men of Judah were remiss and 
 careless, and did it not, because nobody put them on to do it, and then 
 it was proper to stir them up to it. Many will follow in a good work 
 who will not lead: it is a pity that they should continue idle for want 
 of being spoken to. Or perhaps they were so sensible of the greatness 
 of the provocation they had given to David, by joining with Absalom, 
 that they were afraid to bring him back, despairing of his favour; he 
 therefore warrants his agents to assure them of it, with this reason: 
 "<I>You are my brethren, my bone and my flesh,</I> and therefore I 
 cannot be severe with you." The Son of David has been pleased to call 
 us <I>brethren, his bone and his flesh,</I> which encourages us to hope 
 that we shall find favour with him. Or perhaps they were willing to see 
 what the rest of the tribes would do before they stirred, with which 
 they are here upbraided: "The speech of all Israel has come to the king 
 to invite him back, and shall Judah be the last, that should have been 
 the first? Where is now the celebrated bravery of that royal tribe? 
 Where is its loyalty?" Note, We should be stirred up to that which is 
 great and good by the examples both of our ancestors and of our 
 neighbours, and by the consideration of our rank.  Let not the first in 
 dignity be last in duty.

 2. He particularly courted into his interest Amasa, who had been
 Absalom's general, but was his own nephew as well as Joab, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He owns him for his kinsman, and promises him that, if he will appear
 for him now, he will make him captain-general of all his forces in the 
 room of Joab, will not only pardon him (which, it may be, Amasa 
 questioned), but prefer him.  Sometimes there is nothing lost in 
 purchasing the friendship of one that has been an enemy. Amasa's 
 interest might do David good service at this juncture.  But, if David 
 did wisely for himself in designating Amasa for this post (Joab having 
 now grown intolerably haughty), he did not do kindly by Amasa in 
 letting his design be known, for it occasioned his death by Joab's 
 hand,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+20:10"><I>ch.</I> xx. 10</A>.
 
 3. The point was hereby gained. He bowed the heart of the men of Judah
 to pass a vote, <I>nemine contradicente--unanimously,</I> for the recall
 of the king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 God's providence, by the priests' persuasions and Amasa's interest,
 brought them to this resolve. David stirred not till he received this 
 invitation, and then he came as far back as Jordan, at which river they 
 were to meet him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Our Lord Jesus will rule in those that invite him to the throne in
 their hearts and not till he be invited. He first bows the heart and 
 makes it willing in the day of his power, and then <I>rules in the 
 midst of his enemies,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which <I>was</I> of
 Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king
 David.
 &nbsp; 17 And <I>there were</I> a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and
 Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and
 his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before
 the king.
 &nbsp; 18 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's
 household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of
 Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;
 &nbsp; 19 And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto
 me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did
 perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem,
 that the king should take it to his heart.
 &nbsp; 20 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore,
 behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph
 to go down to meet my lord the king.
 &nbsp; 21 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not
 Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s
 anointed?
 &nbsp; 22 And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
 Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall
 there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I
 know that I <I>am</I> this day king over Israel?
 &nbsp; 23 Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And
 the king sware unto him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Perhaps Jordan was never passed with so much solemnity, nor with so 
 many remarkable occurrences, as it was now, since Israel passed it 
 under Joshua. David, in his afflictive flight, remembered God 
 particularly <I>from the land of Jordan</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:6">Ps. xlii. 6</A>),

 and now that land, more than any other, was graced with the glories of
 his return.  David's soldiers furnished themselves with accommodations 
 for their passage over this river, but, for his own family, <I>a 
 ferry-boat</I> was sent on purpose, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 <I>A fleet of boats,</I> say some; <I>a bridge of boats was made,</I>
 say others; the best convenience they had to serve him with. Two 
 remarkable persons met him on the banks of Jordan, both of whom had 
 abused him wretchedly when he was in his flight.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Ziba, who had abused him with his fair tongue, and by accusing his 
 master, had obtained from the king a grant of his estate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:4"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 4</A>.

 A greater abuse he could not have done him, than, by imposing upon his
 credulity, to draw him in to do a thing so unkind to the son of his 
 friend Jonathan. He comes now, with a retinue of sons and servants, to 
 meet the king

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 that he may obtain the king's favour, and so come off the better when
 Mephibosheth shall shortly undeceive him, and clear himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Shimei, who had abused him with his foul tongue, railed at him, and 
 cursed him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:5"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 5</A>.

 If David had been defeated, no doubt he would have continued to trample
 upon him, and have gloried in what he had done; but now that he sees 
 him coming home in triumph, and returning to his throne, he thinks it 
 his interest to make his peace with him. Those who now slight and abuse 
 the Son of David would be glad to make their peace too when he shall 
 come in his glory; but it will be too late.  Shimei, to recommend 
 himself to the king,

 1. Came with good company, with the men of Judah, as one in their 
 interest. 

 2. He brought a regiment of the men of Benjamin with him, 1000, of
 which perhaps he was chiliarch, or commander-in-chief, offering his own 
 and their service to the king; or perhaps they were volunteers, whom by 
 his interest he had got together to meet the king, which was the more 
 obliging because of all the tribes of Israel there were none, except 
 these and Judah, that appeared to pay him this respect. 

 3.  What he did he hastened to do; he lost no time. <I>Agree with thy 
 adversary quickly, while thou art in the way.</I> Here is,

 (1.) The criminal's submission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:18-20"><I>v.</I> 18-20</A>):

 <I>He fell down before the king,</I> as a penitent, as a supplicant;
 and, that he might be thought sincere, he did it publicly before all 
 David's servants, and his friends the men of Judah, yea, and before his 
 own thousand. The offence was public, therefore the submission ought to 
 be so. He owns his crime: <I>Thy servant doth know that I have 
 sinned.</I> He aggravates it: <I>I did perversely.</I> He begs the 
 king's pardon: <I>Let not the king impute iniquity to thy servant,</I> 
 that is, deal with me as I deserve.  He intimates that it was below the 
 king's great and generous mind to <I>take it to his heart;</I> and 
 pleads his early return to his allegiance, that he was <I>the first of 
 all the house of Joseph</I> (that is, of Israel, who in the beginning 
 of David's reign had distinguished themselves from Judah by their 
 adherence to Ishbosheth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+2:10"><I>ch.</I> ii. 10</A>)

 that came <I>to meet the king.</I> He came first, that by his example
 of duty the rest might be induced, and by his experience of the king's 
 clemency the rest might be encouraged to follow.

 (2.) A motion made for judgment against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>"Shall not Shimei be put to death</I> as a traitor? Let him, of all
 men, be made an example." This motion was made by Abishai, who would 
 have ventured his life to have been the death of Shimei when he was 
 cursing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:9"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 9</A>.

 David did not think fit to have it done then, because his judicial
 power was cut short; but, now that it was restored, why should not the 
 law have its course? Abishai herein consulted what he supposed to be 
 David's feelings more than his true interest. Princes have need to arm 
 themselves against temptations to severity.

 (3.) His discharge by the king's order, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.

 He rejected Abishai's motion with displeasure: <I>What have I to do
 with you, you sons of Zeruiah?</I> The less we have to do with those 
 who are of an angry revengeful spirit, and who put us upon doing what 
 is harsh and rigorous, the better. He looks upon these prosecutors as 
 adversaries to him, though they pretended friendship and zeal for his 
 honour. Those who advise us to what is wrong are really <I>Satans,</I> 
 adversaries to us.

 [1.] They were adversaries to his inclination, which was to clemency. 
 He knew that he was <I>this day king in Israel,</I> restored to, and 
 re-established in, his kingdom, and therefore his honour inclined him 
 to forgive. It is the glory of kings to forgive those that humble and 
 surrender themselves: <I>Satis est prostrasse leoni--it suffices the
 lion that he has laid his victim prostrate.</I> His joy inclined him to 
 forgive. The pleasantness of his spirit on this great occasion forbade 
 the entrance of any thing that was sour and peevish: joyful days should 
 be forgiving days. Yet this was not all; his experience of God's mercy 
 in restoring him to his kingdom, his exclusion from which he attributed 
 to his sin, inclined him to show mercy to Shimei. Those that are 
 forgiven must forgive. David had severely revenged the abuses done to 
 his ambassadors by the Ammonites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:31"><I>ch.</I> xii. 31</A>),

 but easily passes by the abuse done to himself by an Israelite. That
 was an affront to Israel in general, and touched the honour of his 
 crown and kingdom; this was purely personal, and therefore (according 
 to the usual disposition of good men) he could the more easily forgive 
 it.

 [2.] They were adversaries to his interest.  If he should put to death 
 Shimei, who cursed him, those would expect the same fate who had taken 
 up arms and actually levied war against him, which would drive them 
 from him, while he was endeavouring to draw them to him. Acts of 
 severity are seldom acts of policy. <I>The throne is established by 
 mercy.</I> Shimei, hereupon, had his pardon signed and sealed with an 
 oath, yet being bound, no doubt, to his good behaviour, and liable to 
 be prosecuted if he afterwards misbehaved; and thus he was reserved to 
 be, in due time, as much a monument of the justice of the government as 
 he was now of its clemency, and in both of its prudence.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king,
 and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor
 washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day
 he came <I>again</I> in peace.
 &nbsp; 25 And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet
 the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou
 with me, Mephibosheth?
 &nbsp; 26 And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me:
 for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride
 thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant <I>is</I> lame.
 &nbsp; 27 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but
 my lord the king <I>is</I> as an angel of God: do therefore <I>what is</I>
 good in thine eyes.
 &nbsp; 28 For all <I>of</I> my father's house were but dead men before my
 lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did
 eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry
 any more unto the king?
 &nbsp; 29 And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of
 thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.
 &nbsp; 30 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,
 forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own
 house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The day of David's return was a day of bringing to remembrance, a day 
 of account, in which what had passed in his flight was called over 
 again; among other things, after the case of Shimei, that of 
 Mephibosheth comes to be enquired into, and he himself brings it 
 on.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He went down in the crowd <I>to meet the king</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 and as a proof of the sincerity of his joy in the king's return, we are
 here told what a true mourner he was for the king's banishment. During 
 that melancholy time, when one of the greatest glories of Israel had 
 departed, Mephibosheth continued in a very melancholy state. He was 
 never trimmed, nor put on clean linen, but wholly neglected himself, as 
 one abandoned to grief for the king's affliction and the kingdom's 
 misery. In times of public calamity we ought to abridge our enjoyments 
 in the delights of sense, in conformity to the season. There are times 
 when God calls to weeping and mourning, and we must comply with the 
 call.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. When the king came to Jerusalem (since he could not sooner have an 
 opportunity) he made his appearance before him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>);

 and when the king asked him why he, being one of his family, had staid
 behind, and not accompanied him in his exile, he opened his case fully 
 to the king.

 1. He complained of Ziba, his servant who should have been his friend, 
 but had been in two ways his enemy; for, first, he had hindered him 
 from going along with the king, by taking the ass himself which he was 
 ordered to make ready for his master 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 basely taking advantage of his lameness and his inability to help
 himself; and, secondly, he had accused him to David of a design to 
 usurp the government, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 How much mischief is it in the power of a wicked servant to do to the
 best master!

 2. He gratefully acknowledged the king's great kindness to him when he
 and all his father's house lay at the king's mercy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 When he might justly have been dealt with as a rebel, he was treated as
 a friend, as a child: <I>Thou didst set thy servant among those that 
 did eat at thy own table.</I> This shows that Ziba's suggestion was 
 improbable; for could Mephibosheth be so foolish as to aim higher when 
 he lived so easily, so happily as he did? And could he be so very 
 disingenuous as to design any harm to David, of whose great kindness to 
 him he was thus sensible?

 (3.) He referred his cause to the king's pleasure (<I>Do what is good 
 in thy eyes</I> with me and my estate), depending on the king's wisdom, 
 and his ability to discern between truth and falsehood (<I>My lord the 
 king is as an angel from God</I>), and disclaiming all pretensions of
 his own merit: "So much kindness I have received above what I deserved, 
 and <I>what right have I to cry any more unto the king?</I> Why should 
 I trouble the king with my complaints when I have already been so 
 troublesome to him? Why should I think any thing hard that is put upon 
 me when I hitherto been so kindly treated?" We were all <I>as dead men 
 before God;</I> yet he has not only spared us, <I>but taken us to sit 
 at his table.</I> How little reason then have we to complain of any 
 trouble we are in, and how much reason to take all well that God 
 does!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. David hereupon recalls the sequestration of Mephibosheth's estate; 
 being deceived in his grant, he revokes it, and confirms his former 
 settlement of it: "<I>I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),
 
 that is, Let it be as I first ordered it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+9:10"><I>ch.</I> ix. 10</A>);

 the property shall still be vested in thee, but Ziba shall have
 occupancy: he shall till the land, paying thee a rent." Thus 
 Mephibosheth is where he was; no harm is done, only Ziba goes away 
 unpunished for his false and malicious information against his master. 
 David either feared him too much, or loved him too well, to do justice 
 upon him according to that law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:18,19">Deut. xix. 18, 19</A>;

 and he was now in the humour of forgiving and resolved to make every
 body easy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Mephibosheth drowns all he cares about his estate in his joy for 
 the king's return 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 "<I>Yea, let him take all,</I> the presence and favour of the king
 shall be to me instead of all." A good man can contentedly bear his own 
 private losses and disappointments, while he see Israel in peace, and 
 the throne of the Son of David exalted and established. Let Ziba take 
 all, so that David may be in peace.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went
 over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.
 &nbsp; 32 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, <I>even</I> fourscore years
 old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at
 Mahanaim; for he <I>was</I> a very great man.
 &nbsp; 33 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me,
 and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 34 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live,
 that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?
 &nbsp; 35 I <I>am</I> this day fourscore years old: <I>and</I> can I discern
 between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I
 drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing
 women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my
 lord the king?
 &nbsp; 36 Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king:
 and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
 &nbsp; 37 Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may
 die in mine own city, <I>and be buried</I> by the grave of my father
 and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over
 with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto
 thee.
 &nbsp; 38 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I
 will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and
 whatsoever thou shalt require of me, <I>that</I> will I do for thee.
 &nbsp; 39 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was
 come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he
 returned unto his own place.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David had already graced the triumphs of his restoration with the 
 generous remission of the injuries that had been done to him; we have 
 him here gracing them with a no less generous reward of the kindnesses 
 that had been shown to him. Barzillai, the Gileadite, who had a noble 
 seat at Rogelim, not far from Mahanaim, was the man who, of all the 
 nobility and gentry of that country, had been most kind to David in his 
 distress. If Absalom had prevailed, it is likely he would have suffered 
 for his loyalty; but now he and his shall be no losers by it. Here 
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Barzillai's great respect to David, not only as a good man, but as 
 his righteous sovereign: He <I>provided him with much sustenance,</I> 
 for himself and his family, <I>while he lay at Mahanaim,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 God had given him a large estate, <I>for he was a very great man,</I>
 and, it seems, he had a large heart to do good with it: what else but 
 that is a large estate good for? To reduced greatness generosity 
 obliges us, and to oppressed goodness piety obliges us, to be in a 
 particular manner kind, to the utmost of our power. Barzillai, to show 
 that he was not weary of David, though he was so great a charge to him, 
 attended him to Jordan, and went over with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Let subjects learn hence to render <I>tribute to whom tribute is
 due</I> and <I>honour to whom honour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:7">Rom. xiii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The kind invitation David gave to him to court 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>Come thou over with me.</I> He invited him,

 1. That he might have the pleasure of his company and the benefit of 
 his counsel; for we may suppose that he was very wise and good, as well 
 as very rich, otherwise he would not have been called here <I>a very 
 great man;</I> for it is what a man is, more than what he has, that 
 renders him truly great. 

 2.  That he might have an opportunity of returning his kindness: "<I>I
 will feed thee with me;</I> thou shalt fare as sumptuously as I fare, 
 and this at Jerusalem, the royal and holy city." David did not take 
 Barzillai's kindness to him as a debt (he was not one of those 
 arbitrary princes who think that whatever their subjects have is theirs 
 when they please), but accepted it and rewarded it as a favour. We must 
 always study to be grateful to our friends, especially to those who 
 have helped us in distress.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Barzillai's reply to this invitation, wherein,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He admires the king's generosity in making him this offer, lessening
 his service, and magnifying the king's return for it: <I>Why should the 
 king recompense it with such a reward?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 Will the master thank that servant who only does what was his duty to
 do? He though he had done himself honour enough in doing the king any 
 service. Thus, when the saints shall be called to inherit the kingdom 
 in consideration of what they have done for Christ in this world, they 
 will be amazed at the disproportion between the service and the 
 recompence.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:37">Matt. xxv. 37</A>,

 <I>Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He declines accepting the invitation. He begs his majesty's pardon 
 for refusing so generous an offer: he should think himself very happy 
 in being near the king, but, 

 (1.) He is old, and unfit to remove at all, especially to court. He is 
 old, and unfit for the <I>business</I> of the court: "Why <I>should I 
 go up with the king to Jerusalem?</I> I can do him no service there, in 
 the council, the camp, the treasury, or the courts of justice; for 
 <I>how long have I to live?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Shall I think of going into business, now that I am going out of this
 world?" He is old and unfit for the <I>diversions</I> of the court, 
 which will be ill-bestowed, and even thrown away, upon one that can 
 relish them so little, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 As it was in Moses's time, so it was in Barzillai's and it is not worse
 now, that, <I>if men be so strong that they come to fourscore years, 
 their strength then is labour and sorrow,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:10">Ps. xc. 10</A>.

 These were then, and are still, years of which men say they <I>have no
 pleasure in them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:1">Eccl. xii. 1</A>.

 Dainties are insipid when desire fails, and songs to the aged ear are
 little better than those sung to a heavy heart, very disagreeable: how 
 should they be otherwise when the daughters of music are brought low? 
 Let those that are old learn of Barzillai to be dead to the delights of 
 sense; let grace second nature, and make a virtue of the necessity. 
 Nay, Barzillai, being old, thinks he shall be <I>a burden to the 
 king,</I> rather than any credit to him; and a good man would not go 
 any where to be burdensome, or, if he must be so, will rather be so to 
 his own house than to another's.

 (2.) He is dying, and must begin to think of his long journey, his 
 removal out of the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 It is good for us all, but it especially becomes old people to think
 and speak much of dying. "Talk of going to court!" says Barzillai; "Let 
 me go home and <I>die in my own city,</I> the place of my father's 
 sepulchre; let me die <I>by the grave of my father,</I> that my bones 
 may be quietly carried to the place of their rest. The grave is ready 
 for me, let me go and get ready for it, go and die in my nest."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He desires the king to be kind to his son Chimham: <I>Let him go 
 over with my lord the king,</I> and have preferment at court. What 
 favour is done to him Barzillai will take as done to himself. Those 
 that are old must not grudge young people those delights which they 
 themselves are past the enjoyment of, nor confine them to their 
 retirements. Barzillai will go back himself, but he will not make 
 Chimham go back with him; though he could ill spare Chimham, yet, 
 thinking it would gratify and advance him, he is willing to do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. David's farewell to Barzillai. 

 1. He sends him back into his country with a kiss and a blessing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>),

 signifying that in gratitude for his kindnesses he would love him and
 pray for him, and with a promise that whatever request he should at any 
 time make to him he would be ready to oblige him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):
 
 <I>Whatsoever thou shalt think of,</I> when thou comest home, to <I>ask
 of me,</I> that <I>will I do for thee.</I> What is the chief excellency 
 of power but this, that it gives men a capacity of doing the more good? 
 
 2. He takes Chimham forward with him, and leaves it to Barzillai to
 choose him his preferment. I will <I>do to him what shall seem good to 
 thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 And, it should seem, Barzillai, who had experienced the innocency and
 safety of retirement, begged a country seat for him near Jerusalem, but 
 not in it; for, long after, we read of a place near Beth-lehem, David's 
 city, which is called <I>the habitation of Chimham,</I> allotted to 
 him, probably, not out of the crown-lands or the forfeited estates, but 
 out of David's paternal estate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>40  Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with
 him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also
 half the people of Israel.
 &nbsp; 41 And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and
 said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen
 thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all
 David's men with him, over Jordan?
 &nbsp; 42 And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because
 the king <I>is</I> near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for
 this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's <I>cost?</I> or hath
 he given us any gift?
 &nbsp; 43 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said,
 We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more <I>right</I> in
 David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should
 not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the
 men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David came over Jordan attended and assisted only by the men of Judah; 
 but when he had advanced as far as Gilgal, the first stage on this side 
 Jordan, <I>half the people of Israel</I> (that is, of their elders and 
 great men) had come to wait upon him, to kiss his hand, and
 congratulate him on his return, but found they came too late to witness 
 the solemnity of his first entrance. This put them out of humour, and 
 occasioned a quarrel between them and the men of Judah, which was a 
 damp to the joy of the day, and the beginning of further mischief. Here 
 is, 

 1. The complaint which the men of Israel brought to the king against 
 the men of Judah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>),

 that they had performed the ceremony of bringing the king over Jordan,
 and not given them notice, that they might have come to join in it.
 This reflected upon them, as if they were not so well affected to the
 king and his restoration as the men of Judah were, whereas the king
 himself knew that they had spoken of it before the men of Judah thought
 of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 It seemed likewise as if they intended to monopolize the king's favours
 when he had come back, and to be looked upon as his only friends. See 
 what mischief comes from pride and jealousy.

 2. The excuse which the men of Judah made for themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 (1.) They plead relations to the king: "<I>He is near of kin to us,</I> 
 and therefore in a matter of mere ceremony, as this was, we may claim 
 precedency. It was into our country that he was to be brought, and 
 therefore who so fit as we to bring him?" 

 (2.) They deny the insinuated charge of self-seeking in what they had 
 done: "<I>Have we eaten at all of the king's cost?</I> No, we have all 
 borne our own charges. <I>Hath he given us any gift?</I> No, we have no 
 design to engross the advantages of his return; you have come time 
 enough to share in them." Too many that attend princes do so only for 
 what they can get. 

 3. The men of Israel's vindication of their charge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 They pleaded, "<I>We have ten parts in the king</I>" (Judah having
 Simeon only, whose lot lay within his, to join with him), "and 
 therefore it is a slight upon us that our advice was not asked about 
 <I>bringing back the king.</I>" See how uncertain the multitude is.  
 They were lately striving against the king, to drive him out; now they 
 are striving about him, which shall honour him most. A good man and a 
 good cause will thus recover their credit and interest, though, for a 
 time, they may seem to have lost them. See what is commonly the origin 
 of strife, nothing so much as impatience of contempt or the least 
 seeming slight.  The men of Judah would have done better if they had 
 taken their brethren's advice and assistance; but, since they did not, 
 why should the men of Israel be so grievously offended? If a good work 
 be done, and well done, let us not be displeased, nor the work 
 disparaged, though we had no hand in it.

 4. The scripture takes notice, by way of blame, which of the contending
 parties managed the cause with most passion: <I>The words of the men of 
 Judah were fiercer than</I> those <I>of the men of Israel.</I> Though 
 we have right and reason on our side, yet, if we express ourselves with 
 fierceness, God takes notice of it and is much displeased with it.</P>
