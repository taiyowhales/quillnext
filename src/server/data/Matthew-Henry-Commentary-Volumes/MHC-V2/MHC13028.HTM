 The account we have of David's exit, in the beginning of the first book 
 of Kings, does not make his sun nearly so bright as that given in this 
 and the following chapter, where we have his solemn farewell both to 
 his son and his subjects, and must own that he finished well. In this 
 chapter we have, 

 I. A general convention of the states summoned to meet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. A solemn declaration of the divine entail both of the crown and of
 the honour of building the temple upon Solomon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:2-7">ver. 2-7</A>.

 III. An exhortation both to the people and to Solomon to make religion
 their business, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.

 IV. The model and materials delivered to Solomon for the building of
 the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:11-19">ver. 11-19</A>.

 V. Encouragement given him to undertake it and proceed in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:20,21">ver. 20, 21</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of
 the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to
 the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and
 captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the
 substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with the
 officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men,
 unto Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 2  Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear
 me, my brethren, and my people: <I>As for me,</I> I <I>had</I> in mine
 heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready
 for the building:
 &nbsp; 3  But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build a house for my
 name, because thou <I>hast been</I> a man of war, and hast shed blood.
 &nbsp; 4  Howbeit the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of Israel chose me before all the house
 of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen
 Judah <I>to be</I> the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of
 my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make
 <I>me</I> king over all Israel:
 &nbsp; 5  And of all my sons, (for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath given me many sons,)
 he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the
 kingdom of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> over Israel.
 &nbsp; 6  And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house
 and my courts: for I have chosen him <I>to be</I> my son, and I will
 be his father.
 &nbsp; 7  Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be
 constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.
 &nbsp; 8  Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all
 the commandments of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> your God: that ye may possess this
 good land, and leave <I>it</I> for an inheritance for your children
 after you for ever.
 &nbsp; 9  And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father,
 and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the
 imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found
 of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.
 &nbsp; 10  Take heed now; for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath chosen thee to build an
 house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do <I>it.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A great deal of service David had done in his day, had <I>served his 
 generation according to the will of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:36">Acts xiii. 36</A>.

 But now the time draws night that he must die, and, as a type of the
 Son of David, the nearer he comes to his end the more busy he is, and 
 does his work with all his might. He is now a little recovered from the 
 indisposition mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:1">1 Kings i. 1</A>,

 when they covered him with clothes, and he got no heat: but was cure is
 there for old age? He therefore improves his recovery, as giving him an 
 opportunity of doing God and his country a little more service.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He summoned all the great men to attend him, that he might take 
 leave of them all together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 Thus Moses did
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+31:28">Deut. xxxi. 28</A>),

 and Joshua,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+23:2,24:1"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 2; xxiv. 1</A>.

 David would not declare the settlement of the crown but in the
 presence, and to the satisfaction, of those that were the 
 representatives of the people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He addressed them with a great deal of respect and tenderness. He 
 not only exerted himself to rise from his bed, to give them the meeting 
 (the occasion putting new spirits into him), but he rose out of his 
 chair, and <I>stood up upon his feet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 in reverence to God whose will he was to declare, and in reverence to
 this solemn assembly of the Israel of God, as if he looked upon 
 himself, though <I>major singulis</I>--<I>greater than any individual 
 among them,</I> yet <I>minor universis</I>--<I>less than the whole of 
 them together.</I> His age and infirmities, as well as his dignity, 
 might well have allowed him to keep his seat; but he would show that he 
 was indeed humbled for the pride of his heart both in the numbers of 
 his people and his dominion over them. It had been too much his 
 pleasure that they were all his <I>servants</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:3"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 3</A>),

 but now he calls them his <I>brethren,</I> whom he loved, his people,
 whom he took care of, not his servants, whom he had command of: <I>Hear 
 me, my brethren, and my people.</I> It becomes superiors thus to speak 
 with affection and condescension even to their inferiors; they will not 
 be the less honoured for it, but the more beloved. Thus he engages 
 their attention to what he was about to say.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He declared the purpose he had formed to build a temple for God, 
 and God's disallowing that purpose, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 This he had signified to Solomon before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:7,8"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 7, 8</A>.

 <I>A house of rest for the ark</I> is here said to be <I>a house of
 rest for the footstool of our God;</I> for heaven is his throne of 
 glory; the earth, and the most magnificent temples that can be built 
 upon it, are but his footstool: so much difference is there between the 
 manifestations of the divine glory in the upper and lower world. Angels 
 surround his throne, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:1">Isa. vi. 1</A>.

 We poor worms do but <I>worship at his footstool</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:5,123:7">Ps. xcix. 5; cxxxii. 7</A>.
 
 As an evidence of the sincerity of his purpose to build the temple, he
 tells them that he had made ready for it, but that God would not suffer 
 him to proceed because he had appointed other work for him to do, which 
 was enough for one man, namely, the managing of the wars of Israel. He 
 must serve the public with the sword; another must do it with the line 
 and plummet. Times of rest are building times,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:31">Acts ix. 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He produced his own title first, and then Solomon's, to the crown; 
 both were undoubtedly <I>jure divino</I>--<I>divine.</I> They could make
 out such a title as no monarch on earth can; the Lord God of Israel 
 chose them both immediately, by prophecy, not providence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 No right of primogeniture is pretended. <I>Detur digniori, non
 seniori</I>--<I>It went by worth, not by age.</I>

 1. Judah was not the eldest son of Jacob, yet God chose that tribe to
 be the ruling tribe; Jacob entailed the sceptre upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</A>.

 2.  It does not appear that the family of Jesse was the senior house of
 that tribe; from Judah it is certain that it was not, for Shelah was 
 before Pharez; whether from Nahshon and Salmon is not certain. Ram, the 
 father of Nahshon, had a elder brother,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:9">1 Chron. ii. 9</A>.

 Perhaps so had Boaz, Obed, and Jesse. Yet "<I>God chose the house of my
 father.</I>" 

 3. David was the youngest son of Jesse, yet God liked him to make him
 king; so it seemed good unto him. God takes whom he likes, and likes 
 whom he makes like himself, as he did David, a man after his own heart. 
 
 4. Solomon was one of the youngest sons of David, and yet God chose him
 to sit upon the throne, because he was the likeliest of them all to 
 build the temple, the wisest and best inclined.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He opened to them God's gracious purposes concerning Solomon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>):

 <I>I have chosen him to be my son.</I> Thus he declares the decree,
 that the Lord had said to Solomon, as a type of Christ, <I>Thou art my 
 son</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:7">Ps. ii. 7</A>),

 the son of my love; for he was called <I>Jedidiah,</I> because the Lord
 loved him, and Christ is his beloved Son. Of him God said, as a figure 
 of him that was to come,

 1. <I>He shall build my house.</I> Christ is both the founder and the
 foundation of the gospel temple. 

 2.  <I>I will establish his kingdom for ever.</I> This must have its
 accomplishment in the kingdom of the Messiah, which shall continue in 
 his hands through all the ages of time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:7,Lu+1:33">Isa. ix. 7; Luke i. 33</A>)

 and shall then be delivered up to God, even the Father, yet perhaps to
 be delivered back to the Redeemer for ever. As to Solomon, this promise 
 of the establishment of his kingdom is here made conditional: <I>If he 
 be constant to do my commandments, as at this day.</I> Solomon was now 
 very towardly and good: "If he continue so, his kingdom shall continue, 
 otherwise not." Note, If we be constant to our duty, then, and not 
 otherwise, we may expect the continuance of God's favour. Let those 
 that are well taught, and begin well, take notice of this--if they be 
 constant, they are happy; perseverance wears the crown, though it wins 
 it not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He charged them to adhere stedfastly to God and their duty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Observe,

 1. The matter for this charge: <I>Keep, and seek for all the
 commandments of the Lord your God.</I> The Lord was their God; his 
 commandments must be their rule; they must have respect to them all, 
 must make conscience of keeping them, and, in order thereunto, must 
 seek for them, that is, must be inquisitive concerning their duty, 
 search the scriptures, take advice, seek the law at the mouth of those 
 whose lips were to keep this knowledge, and pray to God to teach and 
 direct them. God's commandments will not be kept without great care. 

 2.  The solemnity of it. He charged them in the sight of all Israel,
 who would all have notice of this public charge, and in the audience of 
 their God. "God is witness, and this congregation is witness, that they 
 have good counsel given them, and fair warning; if they do not take it, 
 it is their fault, and God and man will be witnesses against them." See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:21,2Ti+4:1">1 Tim. v. 21; 2 Tim. iv. 1</A>.

 Those that profess religion, as they tender the favour of God and their
 reputation with men, must be faithful to their profession. 

 3. The motive to observe this charge. It was the way to be happy, to
 have the peaceable possession of this good land themselves and to 
 preserve the entail of it upon their children.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. He concluded with a charge to Solomon himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 He was much concerned that Solomon should be religious. He was to be a
 great man, but he must not think religion below him--a wise man, and 
 this would be his wisdom.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The charge he gives him. He must look upon God and the God of his 
 father, his good father, who had devoted him to God and educated him 
 for God. He was born in God's house and therefore bound in duty to be 
 his, brought up in his house and therefore bound in gratitude. <I>Thy 
 own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not.</I> He must know God 
 and serve him. We cannot serve God aright if we do not know him; and in 
 vain do we know him if we do not serve him, serve him with heart and 
 mind. We make nothing of religion if we do not mind it, and make 
 heart-work of it. Serve him with a perfect, that is, an upright heart 
 (for sincerity is our gospel perfection), and with a willing mind, from 
 a principle of love, and as a willing people, cheerfully and with 
 pleasure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The arguments to enforce this charge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Two arguments of general inducement:--

 [1.] That the secrets of our souls are open before God; he searches all
 hearts, even the hearts of kings, which to men are unsearchable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:3">Prov. xxv. 3</A>.

 We must <I>therefore</I> be sincere, because, if we deal deceitfully,
 God sees it, and cannot be imposed upon; we must <I>therefore</I> 
 employ our thoughts, and engage them in God's service, because he fully 
 understands all the imaginations of them, both good and bad.

 [2.] That we are happy or miserable here, and for ever, according as we
 do, or do not, serve God. <I>If we seek him diligently, he will be 
 found of us,</I> and that is enough to make us happy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:6">Heb. xi. 6</A>.

 If we forsake him, desert his service and turn from following him, he
 will cast us off for ever, and that is enough to make us miserable. 
 Note, God never casts any off till they have first cast him off. Here 
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) One argument peculiar to Solomon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>Thou art to build a house for the sanctuary;</I> therefore seek and
 serve God, that that work may be done from a good principle, in a right 
 manner, and may be accepted."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The means prescribed in order hereunto, and they are prescribed to 
 us all. 

 (1.) Caution: <I>Take heed;</I> beware of every thing that looks like,
 or leads to, that which is evil. 

 (2.) Courage: <I>Be strong, and do it.</I> We cannot do our work as we
 should unless we put on resolution, and fetch in strength from divine 
 grace.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch,
 and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of
 the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof,
 and of the place of the mercy seat,
 &nbsp; 12  And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the
 courts of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and of all the chambers round
 about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the
 treasuries of the dedicated things:
 &nbsp; 13  Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for
 all the work of the service of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and for all
 the vessels of service in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 14  <I>He gave</I> of gold by weight for <I>things</I> of gold, for all
 instruments of all manner of service; <I>silver also</I> for all
 instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every
 kind of service:
 &nbsp; 15  Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their
 lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps
 thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, <I>both</I> for
 the candlestick, and <I>also</I> for the lamps thereof, according to
 the use of every candlestick.
 &nbsp; 16  And by weight <I>he gave</I> gold for the tables of showbread,
 for every table; and <I>likewise</I> silver for the tables of silver:
 &nbsp; 17  Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the
 cups: and for the golden basons <I>he gave gold</I> by weight for
 every bason; and <I>likewise silver</I> by weight for every bason of
 silver:
 &nbsp; 18  And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and
 gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread
 out <I>their wings,</I> and covered the ark of the covenant of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 19  All <I>this, said David,</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> made me understand in
 writing by <I>his</I> hand upon me, <I>even</I> all the works of this
 pattern.
 &nbsp; 20  And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good
 courage, and do <I>it:</I> fear not, nor be dismayed: for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 God, <I>even</I> my God, <I>will be</I> with thee; he will not fail thee,
 nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the
 service of the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 21  And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites,
 <I>even they shall be with thee</I> for all the service of the house
 of God: and <I>there shall be</I> with thee for all manner of
 workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service:
 also the princes and all the people <I>will be</I> wholly at thy
 commandment.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As for the general charge that David gave his son to seek God and serve 
 him, the book of the law was, in that, his only rule, and there needed 
 no other; but, in building the temple, David was now to give him three 
 things:--

 1. A model of the building, because it was to be such a building as
 neither he nor his architects ever saw. Moses had a pattern of the 
 tabernacle shown him in the mount 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:5">Heb. viii. 5</A>),

 so had David of the temple, by the immediate hand of God upon him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 It was given him in writing, probably by the ministry of an angel, or
 as clearly and exactly represented to his mind as if it had been in 
 writing. But it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 <I>He had this pattern by the Spirit.</I> The contrivance either of
 David's devotion or of Solomon's wisdom must not be trusted to in an 
 affair of this nature. The temple must be a sacred thing and a type of 
 Christ; there must be in it not only convenience and decency, but 
 significancy: it was a kind of sacrament, and therefore it must not be 
 left to man's art or invention to contrive it, but must be framed by 
 divine institution. Christ the true temple, the church the gospel 
 temple, and heaven the everlasting temple, are all framed according to 
 the divine councils, and the plan laid in the divine wisdom, ordained 
 before the world for God's glory and ours. This pattern David gave to 
 Solomon, that he might know what to provide and might go by a certain 
 rule. When Christ left with his disciples a charge to build his gospel 
 church he gave them an exact model of it, ordering them to observe 
 that, and that only, which he commanded. The particular models are here 
 mentioned, of the porch, which was higher than the rest, like a 
 steeple,--then the houses, both the holy place and the most holy, with 
 the rooms adjoining, which were for treasuries, chambers, and 
 parlours,--especially <I>the place of the mercy-seat</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),--

 of the courts likewise, and the chambers about them, in which the
 dedicated things were laid up. Bishop Patrick supposes that, among 
 other things, the tabernacle which Moses reared and all the utensils of 
 it, which there was now no further occasion for, were laid up here, 
 signifying that in the fulness of time all the Mosaic economy, all the 
 rites and ceremonies of that dispensation, should be respectfully laid 
 aside, and something better come in their room. He gave him a table of 
 the courses of the priests, patterns of the vessels of service

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and a pattern of the chariot of the cherubim,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Besides the two cherubim over the mercy-seat, there were two much
 larger, whose wings reached from wall to wall

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+6:23-28">1 Kings vi. 23</A>,

 &c.), and of these David here gave
 Solomon the pattern, called a <I>chariot;</I> for the angels are the 
 chariots of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:17">Ps. lxviii. 17</A>.

 2. Materials for the most costly of the utensils of the temple. That
 they might not be made any less than the patterns, he weighed out the 
 exact quantity for each vessel both of gold and silver, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 In the tabernacle there was but one golden candlestick; in the temple
 there were ten

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+7:49">1 Kings vii. 49</A>),

 besides silver ones, which, it is supposed, were hand-candlesticks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 In the tabernacle there was but one table; but in the temple, besides
 that on which the show-bread was set, there were ten others for other 
 uses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+4:8">2 Chron. iv. 8</A>),

 besides silver tables; for, this house being much larger than that, it
 would look bare if it had not furniture proportionable.  The gold for 
 the altar of incense is particularly said to be <I>refined gold</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 purer than any of the rest; for that was typical of the intercession of
 Christ, than which nothing is more pure and perfect.

 3.  Directions which way to look for help in this great undertaking.
 "Fear not opposition; fear not the charge, care, and trouble; fear not 
 miscarrying in it, as in the case of Uzza; fear not the reproach of the 
 foolish builder, that began to build and was not able to finish. Be not 
 dismayed.

 (1.) God will help thee, and thou must look up to him in the first
 place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>The Lord God, even my God,</I> whom I have chosen and served, who
 has all along been present with me and prospered me, and to whom, from 
 my own experience of his power and goodness, I recommend thee, he will 
 be with thee, to direct, strengthen, and prosper thee; he will not fail 
 thee nor forsake thee." Note, We may be sure that God, who owned our 
 fathers and carried them through the services of their day, will, in 
 like manner, if we be faithful to him, go along with us in our day, and 
 will never leave us, while he has any work to do in us or by us. The 
 same that was Joshua's encouragement

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+1:5">Josh. i. 5</A>),

 and Solomon's, is given to all believers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:5">Heb. xiii. 5</A>.

 <I>He will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</I> God never leaves any
 unless they first leave him.

 (2.) "Good men will help thee,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 The priests and Levites will advise thee, and thou mayest consult them.
 Thou hast good workmen, who are both willing and skilful;" and these 
 are two very good properties in a workman, especially in those that 
 work at the temple.  And, <I>lastly,</I> "The princes and the people 
 will be so far from opposing or retarding the work that they will be 
 wholly at thy command, every one in his place ready to further it." 
 Then good work is likely to go on when all parties concerned are hearty 
 in it, and none secretly clog it, but all drive on heartily in it.</P>
