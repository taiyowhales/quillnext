 We left two royal edicts in force, both given at the court of Shushan,
 one bearing date the thirteenth day of the first month, appointing that
 on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month then next ensuing all the 
 Jews should be killed; another bearing date the twenty-third day of the 
 third month, empowering the Jews, on the day appointed for their 
 slaughter, to draw the sword in their own defence and make their part 
 good against their enemies as well as they could. Great expectation 
 there was, no doubt, of this day, and the issue of it. The Jews' cause 
 was to be tried by battle and the day was fixed for the combat by 
 authority. Their enemies resolved not to lose the advantages given them 
 by the first edict, in hope to overpower them by numbers; the Jews 
 relied on the goodness of their God and the justice of their cause, and 
 resolved to make their utmost efforts against their enemies. The day 
 comes at length; and here we are told, 

 I. What a glorious day it was, that year, to the Jews, and the two days
 following--a day of victory and triumph, both in the city Shushan and in
 all the rest of the king's provinces, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:1-19">ver. 1-19</A>.

 II. What a memorable day it was made to posterity, by an annual feast, 
 in commemoration of this great deliverance, called "the feast of 
 Purim,"

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Now in the twelfth month, that <I>is,</I> the month Adar, on the
 thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his
 decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the
 enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was
 turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that
 hated them;)
 &nbsp; 2  The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities
 throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand
 on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them;
 for the fear of them fell upon all people.
 &nbsp; 3  And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and
 the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because
 the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.
 &nbsp; 4  For Mordecai <I>was</I> great in the king's house, and his fame
 went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai
 waxed greater and greater.
 &nbsp; 5  Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the
 sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would
 unto those that hated them.
 &nbsp; 6  And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five
 hundred men.
 &nbsp; 7  And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,
 &nbsp; 8  And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,
 &nbsp; 9  And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,
 &nbsp; 10  The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of
 the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.
 &nbsp; 11  On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan
 the palace was brought before the king.
 &nbsp; 12  And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain
 and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten
 sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's
 provinces? now what <I>is</I> thy petition? and it shall be granted
 thee: or what <I>is</I> thy request further? and it shall be done.
 &nbsp; 13  Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted
 to the Jews which <I>are</I> in Shushan to do to morrow also according
 unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon
 the gallows.
 &nbsp; 14  And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was
 given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.
 &nbsp; 15  For the Jews that <I>were</I> in Shushan gathered themselves
 together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew
 three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their
 hand.
 &nbsp; 16  But the other Jews that <I>were</I> in the king's provinces
 gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had
 rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five
 thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,
 &nbsp; 17  On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the
 fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of
 feasting and gladness.
 &nbsp; 18  But the Jews that <I>were</I> at Shushan assembled together on
 the thirteenth <I>day</I> thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and
 on the fifteenth <I>day</I> of the same they rested, and made it a day
 of feasting and gladness.
 &nbsp; 19  Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the
 unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar <I>a day
 of</I> gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending
 portions one to another.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a decisive battle fought between the Jews and their 
 enemies, in which the Jews were victorious. Neither side was surprised; 
 for both had notice of it long enough before, so that it was a fair 
 trial of skill between them. Nor could either side call the other 
 <I>rebels,</I> for they were both supported by the royal authority.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The enemies of the Jews were the aggressors. They hoped, 
 notwithstanding the latter edict, <I>to have power over them,</I> by 
 virtue of the former 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and made assaults upon them accordingly; they formed themselves into
 bodies, and joined in confederacy against them, to <I>seek their 
 hurt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The Chaldee paraphrase says that none appeared against the Jews but
 Amalekites only, who were infatuated, and had their hearts hardened, as 
 Pharaoh's against Israel, to take up arms to their own destruction. 
 Some had such an inveterate implacable malice against the Jews that 
 Haman's fall and Mordecai's advancement, instead of convincing them, 
 did but exasperate them, and make them the more outrageous and resolute 
 to cut all their throats.  The sons of Haman, particularly, vowed to 
 avenge their father's death, and pursue his designs, which they call 
 <I>noble and brave,</I> whatever hazards they run; and a strong party 
 they had formed both in Shushan and in the provinces in order hereunto. 
 Fight they would, though they plainly saw Providence fight against 
 them; and thus they were infatuated to their own destruction. If they 
 would have sat still, and attempted nothing against the people of God, 
 not a hair of their head would have fallen to the ground: but they 
 cannot persuade themselves to do that; they must be meddling, though it 
 prove to their own ruin, and roll a burdensome stone, which will return 
 upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. But the Jews were the conquerors. That very day when the king's 
 decree for their destruction was to be put in execution, and which the 
 enemies thought would have been <I>their</I> day, proved <I>God's</I> 
 day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:13">Ps. xxxvii. 13</A>.

 It was <I>turned to the contrary</I> of what was expected, and <I>the
 Jews had rule over those that hated them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What the Jews did for themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>They gathered themselves together in their cities,</I> embodied, and
 stood upon their defence, offering violence to none, but bidding 
 defiance to all. If they had not had an edict to warrant them, they 
 durst not have done it, but, being so supported, they strove lawfully. 
 Had they acted separately, each family apart, they would have been an 
 easy prey to their enemies; but acting in concert, and gathering 
 together in their cities, they strengthened one another, and durst face 
 their enemies. <I>Vis unita fortior--forces act most powerfully when 
 combined.</I> Those that write of the state of the Jews at this day 
 give this as a reason why, though they are very numerous in many parts, 
 and very rich, they are yet so despicable, because they are generally 
 so selfish that they cannot incorporate, and, being under the curse of 
 dispersion, they cannot unite, nor (as here) <I>gather together,</I> 
 for, if they could, they might with their numbers and wealth threaten 
 the most potent states.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the rulers of the provinces did for them, under the influence 
 of Mordecai. All the officers of the king, who, by the bloody edict, 
 were ordered to help forward their destruction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:12,13"><I>ch.</I> iii. 12, 13</A>),

 conformed to the latter edict (which, being an estopel against an 
 estopel, had set the matter at large, and left them at liberty to 
 observe which they pleased) and <I>helped the Jews,</I> which turned 
 the scale on their side, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The provinces would generally do as the rulers of the provinces
 inclined, and therefore their favouring the Jews would greatly further 
 them. But why did they help them? Not because they had any kindness for 
 them, but because <I>the fear of Mordecai fell upon them,</I> he having 
 manifestly the countenance both of God and the king. They all saw it 
 their interest to help Mordecai's friends because he was not only great 
 in the king's house, and caressed by the courtiers (as many are who 
 have no intrinsic worth to support their reputation), but <I>his 
 fame</I> for wisdom and virtue <I>went out</I> thence <I>throughout all 
 the provinces:</I> in all places he was extolled as a great man. He was 
 looked upon also as a thriving man, and one that <I>waxed greater and 
 greater</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 and therefore for fear of him all the king's officers helped the Jews.
 Great men may, by their influence, do a great deal of good; many that 
 fear not God will stand in awe of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What God did for them: he struck <I>all people</I> with a <I>fear of 
 them</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:2">(<I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 as the Canaanites were made afraid of Israel
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+2:9,5:1">Josh. ii. 9, v. 1</A>),

 so that, though they had so much hardiness as to assault them, yet they
 had not courage to prosecute the assault. Their hearts failed them when 
 they came to engage, and <I>none of the men of might could find their 
 hands.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. What execution they did hereupon: <I>No man could withstand them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 but <I>they did what they would to those that hated them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 So strangely were the Jews strengthened and animated, and their enemies
 weakened and dispirited, that none of those who had marked themselves 
 for their destruction escaped, but they <I>smote them with the stroke 
 of the sword.</I> Particularly,

 (1.) On the thirteenth day of the month Adar they slew in the city
 Shushan 500 men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 and the ten sons of <I>Haman,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The Jews, when on the feast of Purim they read this book of Esther,
 oblige themselves to read the names of Haman's ten sons all in one 
 breath, without any pause, because they say that they were all killed 
 together, and all gave up the ghost just in the same moment.--<I>Buxt. 
 Synag. Jud.</I> c. 24. The Chaldee paraphrase says that, when these ten 
 were slain, Zeresh, with seventy more of his children, escaped, and 
 afterwards begged their bread from door to door.

 (2.) On the fourteenth day they slew in Shushan 300 more, who had
 escaped the sword on the former day of execution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This Esther obtained leave of the king for them to do, for the greater
 terror of their enemies, and the utter crushing of that malignant party 
 of men.  The king had taken account of the numbers that were put to the 
 sword the first day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 and told Esther
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and asked her what more she desired. "Nothing," says she, "but
 commission to do such another day's work." Esther surely was none of 
 the blood-thirsty, none of those that delight in slaughter, but she had 
 some very good reasons that moved her to make this request. She also 
 desired that the dead bodies of Haman's ten sons might be hanged up on 
 the gallows on which their father was hanged, for the greater disgrace 
 of the family and terror of the party

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and it was done accordingly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It is supposed that they were hanged in chains and left hanging for
 some time.

 (3.) The Jews in the country kept to their orders, and slew no more of
 their enemies than what were slain the thirteenth day, which were in 
 all, among all the provinces, 75,000, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 If all these were Amalekites (as the Jews say), surely now it was that
 the remembrance of Amalek was <I>utterly put out,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:14">Exod. xvii. 14</A>.

 However, that which justifies them in the execution of so many is that
 they did it in their own just and necessary defence; they <I>stood for 
 their lives,</I> authorized to do so by the law of self-preservation, 
 as well as by the king's decree.  

 (4.) In these several executions it is taken notice of that on the prey
 they laid not their hand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:10,15,16"><I>v.</I> 10, 15, 16</A>.

 The king's commission had warranted them to <I>take the spoil</I> of
 their enemies <I>for a prey</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+8:11"><I>ch.</I> viii. 11</A>),

 and a fair opportunity they had of enriching themselves with it; if
 Haman's party had prevailed, no doubt, they would have made use of 
 their authority to seize the goods and estates of the Jews,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+3:13"><I>ch.</I> iii. 13</A>.

 But the Jews would not do so by them, 

 [1.] That they might, to the honour of their religion, evidence a holy
 and generous contempt of worldly wealth, in imitation of their father 
 Abraham, who scorned to enrich himself with the spoils of Sodom. 

 [2.] That they might make it appear that they aimed at nothing but
 their own preservation, and used their interest at court for the saving 
 of their lives, not for the raising of their estates. 

 [3.] Their commission empowered them to destroy the families of their
 enemies, even the <I>little ones</I> and <I>the women,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+8:11"><I>ch.</I> viii. 11</A>.

 But their humanity forbade them to do that, though that was designed
 against them. They slew none but those they found in arms; and 
 therefore they did not take the spoil, but left it to the women and 
 little ones, whom they spared, for their subsistence; otherwise as good 
 slay them as starve them, take away their lives as take away their 
 livelihoods. Herein they acted with a consideration and compassion well 
 worthy of imitation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. What a satisfaction they had in their deliverance. The Jews in the 
 country cleared themselves of their enemies on the thirteenth day of 
 the month, and they rested on the fourteenth day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 and made that a thanksgiving day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The Jews in Shushan, the royal city, took two days for their military
 execution, so that they rested on the fifteenth day, and made that 
 their thanksgiving-day,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Both of them celebrated their festival the very day after they had
 finished their work and gained their point. When we have received 
 signal mercies from God we ought to be quick and speedy in making our 
 thankful returns to him, while the mercy is fresh and the impressions 
 of it are most sensible.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all
 the Jews that <I>were</I> in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus,
 <I>both</I> nigh and far,
 &nbsp; 21  To stablish <I>this</I> among them, that they should keep the
 fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the
 same, yearly,
 &nbsp; 22  As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and
 the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from
 mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of
 feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and
 gifts to the poor.
 &nbsp; 23  And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as
 Mordecai had written unto them;
 &nbsp; 24  Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy
 of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them,
 and had cast Pur, that <I>is,</I> the lot, to consume them, and to
 destroy them;
 &nbsp; 25  But when <I>Esther</I> came before the king, he commanded by
 letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the
 Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons
 should be hanged on the gallows.
 &nbsp; 26  Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of
 Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and <I>of that</I>
 which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come
 unto them,
 &nbsp; 27  The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed,
 and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should
 not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their
 writing, and according to their <I>appointed</I> time every year;
 &nbsp; 28  And <I>that</I> these days <I>should be</I> remembered and kept
 throughout every generation, every family, every province, and
 every city; and <I>that</I> these days of Purim should not fail from
 among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.
 &nbsp; 29  Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai
 the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter
 of Purim.
 &nbsp; 30  And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred
 twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, <I>with</I>
 words of peace and truth,
 &nbsp; 31  To confirm these days of Purim in their times <I>appointed,</I>
 according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined
 them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed,
 the matters of the fastings and their cry.
 &nbsp; 32  And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim;
 and it was written in the book.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may well imagine how much affected Mordecai and Esther were with the 
 triumphs of the Jews over their enemies, and how they saw the issue of 
 that decisive day with a satisfaction proportionable to the care and 
 concern with which they expected it.  How were their hearts enlarged 
 with joy in God and his salvation, and what new songs of praise were 
 put into their mouths! But here we are told what course they took to 
 spread the knowledge of it among their people, and to perpetuate the 
 remembrance of it to posterity, for the honour of God and the 
 encouragement of his people to trust in him at all times.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The history was written, and copies of it were dispersed among all 
 the Jews in all the provinces of the empire, <I>both nigh and far,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 They all knew something of the story, being nearly concerned in
 it--were by the first edict made sensible of their danger and by the 
 second of their deliverance; but how this amazing turn was given they 
 could not tell. Mordecai therefore <I>wrote all these things.</I> And 
 if this book be the same that he wrote, as many think it is, I cannot 
 but observe what a difference there is between Mordecai's style and 
 Nehemiah's. Nehemiah, at every turn, takes notice of divine Providence 
 and the <I>good hand of his God</I> upon him, which is very proper to 
 stir up devout affections in the minds of his readers; but Mordecai 
 never so much as mentions the name of God in the whole story. Nehemiah 
 wrote his book at Jerusalem, where religion was in fashion and an air 
 of it appeared in men's common conversation; Mordecai wrote his at 
 Shushan the palace, where policy reigned more then piety, and he wrote 
 according to the genius of the place. Even those that have the root of 
 the matter in them are apt to lose the savour of religion, and let 
 their leaf wither, when they converse wholly with those that have 
 little religion.  Commend me to Nehemiah's way of writing; <I>that</I> 
 I would imitate, and yet learn from Mordecai's that men may be truly 
 devout though they do not abound in the shows and expressions of 
 devotion, and therefore that we must not judge nor despise our 
 brethren.  But, because there is so little of the language of Canaan in 
 this book, many think it was not written by Mordecai, but was an 
 extract out of the journals of the kings of Persia, giving an account 
 of the matter of fact, which the Jews themselves knew how to comment 
 upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A festival was instituted, to be observed yearly from generation to 
 generation by the Jews, in remembrance of this wonderful work which God 
 wrought for them, that <I>the children who should be born</I> might 
 know it, and <I>declare it to their children, that they might set their 
 hope in God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:6,7">Ps. lxxviii. 6, 7</A>.

 It would be for the honour of God as the protector of his people, and
 the honour of Israel as the care of Heaven, a confirmation of the 
 fidelity of God's covenant, an invitation to strangers to come into the 
 bonds of it, and an encouragement to God's own people cheerfully to 
 depend upon his wisdom, power, and goodness, in the greatest straits. 
 Posterity would reap the benefit of this deliverance, and therefore 
 ought to celebrate the memorial of it.  Now concerning this festival we 
 are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When it was observed--every year on <I>the fourteenth and fifteenth
 days of the twelfth month,</I> just a month before the passover, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 Thus the first month and the last month of the year kept in remembrance
 the months that were past, even <I>the days when God preserved 
 them.</I> They kept two days together as thanksgiving days, and did not 
 think them too much to spend in praising God. Let us not be niggardly 
 in our returns of praise to him who bestows his favours so liberally 
 upon us. Observe, They did not keep the day when they fought, but the 
 days when they rested, and on the fifteenth those in Shushan, and both 
 those days they kept. The sabbath was appointed not on the day that God 
 finished his work, but on the day that he <I>rested from it.</I> The 
 modern Jews observe the thirteenth day, the day appointed for their 
 destruction, as a fasting-day, grounding the practice on 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>,

 <I>the matters of their fastings and cry.</I> But that refers to what
 was in the day of their distress

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+4:3,16"><I>ch.</I> iv. 3, 16</A>),

 which was not to be continued when God had turned their fasts into
 <I>joy and gladness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:19">Zech. viii. 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How it was called--<I>The feast of Purim</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:26">(<I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 from <I>Pur,</I> a Persian word which signified <I>a lot,</I> because
 Haman had by lot determined this to be the time of the Jews' 
 destruction, but the Lord, at whose disposal the lot is, had determined 
 it to be the time of their triumph. The name of this festival would 
 remind them of the sovereign dominion of the God of Israel, who served 
 his own purposes by the foolish superstitions of the heathen, and 
 outwitted the <I>monthly prognosticators</I> in their own craft

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:13">Isa. xlvii. 13</A>),
 
 <I>frustrating the tokens of the liars and making the diviners mad,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:25,26">Isa. xliv. 25, 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. By whom it was instituted and enacted. It was not a divine 
 institution, and therefore it is not called a <I>holy day,</I> but a 
 human appointment, by which it was made a <I>good day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:19,22"><I>v.</I> 19, 22</A>.
 
 (1.) The Jews ordained it, and took it upon themselves
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),
 
 voluntarily <I>undertook to do as they had begun.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 They bound themselves to this by common consent.

 (2.) Mordecai and Esther confirmed their resolve, that it might be the
 more binding on posterity, and might come well recommended by those
 great names. They <I>wrote,</I> 
 
 [1.] <I>With all authority</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 as well they might, Esther being queen and Mordecai prime-minister of
 state. It is well when those who are in authority use their authority 
 to authorize that which is good.  

 [2.] <I>With words of peace and truth.</I> Though they wrote with
 authority, they wrote with tenderness, not imperious, not imposing, but 
 in such language as the council at Jerusalem use in their decree

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+15:29">Acts xv. 29</A>):

 "If you do so and so, <I>you shall do well.  Fare you well.</I>" Such
 was the style of these letters, or such the salutation or valediction 
 of them: <I>Peace and truth be with you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. By whom it was to be observed--by <I>all the Jews,</I> and by
 <I>their seed,</I> and by all such as <I>joined themselves to them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 The observance of this feast was to be both universal and perpetual;
 the proselytes must observe it, in token of their sincere affection to 
 the Jewish nation and their having united interests with them. A 
 concurrence in joys and praises is one branch of the communion of 
 saints.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Why it was to be observed--that the memorial of the great things God
 had done for his church might never <I>perish from their seed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 God does not work wonders for a day, but to be had in everlasting
 remembrance. <I>What he does shall be forever,</I> and therefore should 
 for ever be had in mind,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:14">Eccl. iii. 14</A>.

 In this affair they would remember,

 (1.) Haman's bad practices against the church, to his perpetual
 reproach

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Because he had devised against the Jews to destroy them.</I> Let
 this be kept in mind, that God's people may never be secure, while they 
 have such malicious enemies, on whom they ought to have a jealous eye. 
 Their enemies aim at no less then their destruction; on God therefore 
 let them depend for salvation.

 (2.) Esther's good services to the church, to her immortal honour. When
 Esther, in peril of her life, <I>came before the king,</I> he repealed 
 the edict, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 This also must be remembered, that wherever this feast should be kept,
 and this history read in explication of it, this which she did might be 
 <I>told for a memorial of her.</I> Good deeds done for the Israel of 
 God ought to be remembered, for the encouragement of others to do the 
 like. God will not forget them, and therefore we must not.

 (3.) Their own prayers, and the answers given to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>The matters of their fastings and their cry.</I> The more cries we
 have offered up in our trouble, and the more prayers for deliverance, 
 the more we are obliged to be thankful to God for deliverance. <I>Call 
 upon me in the time of trouble,</I> and then <I>offer to God 
 thanksgiving.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. How it was to be observed. And of this let us see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What was here enjoined, which was very good, that they should make 
 it, 
 
 [1.] A day of cheerfulness, <I>a day of feasting and joy</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+9:22"><I>v.</I>  22</A>),
 
 and <I>a feast was made for laughter,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:19">Eccl. x. 19</A>.

 When God gives us cause to rejoice why should we not express our joy?
 
 [2.] A day of generosity, <I>sending portions one to another,</I> in
 token of their pleasantness and mutual respect, and their being knit by 
 this and other public common dangers and deliverances so much the 
 closer to each other in love.  Friends have their goods in common. 

 [3.] A day of charity, sending <I>gifts to the poor.</I> It is not to
 our kinsmen and rich neighbours only that we are to send tokens, but to 
 <I>the poor and the maimed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:12,13">Luke xiv. 12, 13</A>.

 Those that have received mercy must, in token of their gratitude, show
 mercy; and there never wants occasion, for the poor we have always with 
 us. Thanksgiving and almsgiving should go together, that, when we are 
 rejoicing and blessing God, the heart of the poor may rejoice with us 
 and their loins may bless us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What was added to this, which was much better. They always, at the
 feast, read the whole story over in the synagogue each day, and put up 
 three prayers to God, in the first of which they praise God for
 counting them worthy to attend this divine service; in the second they 
 thank him for the miraculous preservation of their ancestors; in the 
 third they praise him that they have lived to observe another festival 
 in memory of it. So bishop Patrick.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) What it has since degenerated to, which is much worse. Their own 
 writers acknowledge that this feast is commonly celebrated among them 
 with gluttony, and drunkenness, and excess of riot. Their Talmud says 
 expressly that, in the feast of Purim, a man should drink till he knows 
 not the difference between <I>Cursed be Haman,</I> and <I>Blessed be
 Mordecai.</I> See what the corrupt and wicked nature of man often 
 brings that to which was at first well intended: here is a religious 
 feast turned into a carnival, a perfect revel, as wakes are among us. 
 Nothing more purifies the heart and adorns religion than holy joy; 
 nothing more pollutes the heart and reproaches religion than carnal 
 mirth and sensual pleasure. <I>Corruptio optimi est pessima--What is 
 best becomes when corrupted the worst.</I></P>
