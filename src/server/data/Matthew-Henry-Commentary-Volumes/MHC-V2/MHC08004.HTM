 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter we have the wedding between Boaz and Ruth, in the 
 circumstances of which there was something uncommon, which is kept upon 
 record for the illustration, not only of the law concerning the 
 marrying of a brother's widow 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:5-10">Deut.  xxv. 5</A>,

 &c.), for cases help to expound laws, but of the gospel too, for from
 this marriage descended David, and the Son of David, whose espousals to 
 the Gentile church were hereby typified. We are here told, 

 I. How Boaz got clear of his rival, and fairly shook him off,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. How his marriage with Ruth was publicly solemnized, and attended
 with the good wishes of his neighbours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.

 III. The happy issue that descended from this marriage, Obed, the
 grandfather of David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:13-17">ver.  13-17</A>.

 And so the book concludes with the pedigree of David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:18-22">ver.  18-22</A>.

 Perhaps it was to oblige him that the blessed Spirit directed the
 inserting of this story in the sacred canon, he being desirous that the 
 virtues of his great-grandmother Ruth, together with her Gentile 
 extraction and the singular providences that attended her, should be 
 transmitted to posterity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,
 behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he
 said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned
 aside, and sat down.
 &nbsp; 2 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit
 ye down here. And they sat down.
 &nbsp; 3 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out
 of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which <I>was</I> our
 brother Elimelech's:
 &nbsp; 4 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy <I>it</I> before the
 inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt
 redeem <I>it,</I> redeem <I>it:</I> but if thou wilt not redeem <I>it, then</I>
 tell me, that I may know: for <I>there is</I> none to redeem <I>it</I>
 beside thee; and I <I>am</I> after thee. And he said, I will redeem
 <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 5 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of
 Naomi, thou must buy <I>it</I> also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of
 the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
 &nbsp; 6 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem <I>it</I> for myself, lest I
 mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I
 cannot redeem <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 7 Now this <I>was the manner</I> in former time in Israel concerning
 redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a
 man plucked off his shoe, and gave <I>it</I> to his neighbour: and
 this <I>was</I> a testimony in Israel.
 &nbsp; 8 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy <I>it</I> for thee. So
 he drew off his shoe.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. Boaz calls a court immediately. It is probable he was himself one of
 the elders (or aldermen) of the city; for he was a mighty man of 
 wealth. Perhaps he was father of the city, and sat chief; for he seems 
 here to have gone up to the gate as one having authority, and not as a 
 common person; like Job,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:7-25"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 7</A>,

 &c. We cannot suppose him less than a magistrate in his city who was
 grandson to Nahshon, prince of Judah; and his lying at the end of a 
 heap of corn in the threshing-floor the night before was not at all 
 inconsistent, in those days of plainness, with the honour of his 
 sitting judge in the gate. But why was Boaz so hasty, why so fond of 
 the match? Ruth was not rich, but lived upon alms; not honourable, but 
 a poor stranger. She was never said to be beautiful; if ever she had 
 been so, we may suppose that weeping, and travelling, and gleaning, had 
 withered her lilies and roses. But that which made Boaz in love with 
 her, and solicitous to expedite the affair, was that all her neighbours 
 agreed she was a virtuous woman.  This set her price with him <I>far 
 above rubies</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:10">Prov. xxxi. 10</A>);

 and therefore he thinks, if by marrying her he might do her a real
 kindness, he should also do himself a very great kindness. He will 
 therefore bring it to a conclusion immediately.  It was not court-day, 
 but he got ten men of the elders of the city to meet him in the 
 town-hall over the gate, where public business used to be transacted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 So many, it is probable, by the custom of the city, made a full court.
 Boaz, though a judge, would not be judge in his own cause, but desired 
 the concurrence of other elders. Honest intentions dread not a public 
 cognizance. 

 2. He summons his rival to come and hear the matter that was to be
 proposed to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>Ho, such a one,</I> sit down here." He called him by his name, no
 doubt, but the divine historian thought not fit to record it, for, 
 because he refused to raise up the name of the dead, he deserved not to 
 have his name preserved to future ages in this history.  Providence 
 favoured Boaz in ordering it so that this kinsman should come by thus 
 opportunely, just when the matter was ready to be proposed to him.  
 Great affairs are sometimes much furthered by small circumstances, 
 which facilitate and expedite them. 

 3.  He proposes to the other kinsman the redemption of Naomi's land,
 which, it is probable, had been mortgaged for money to buy bread with 
 when the famine was in the land

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Naomi has a parcel of land to sell,</I> namely, the equity of the
 redemption of it out of the hands of the mortgagee, which she is 
 willing to part with;" or, as some think, it was her jointure for her 
 life, and, wanting money, for a small matter she would sell her 
 interest to the heir at law, who was fittest to be the purchaser.  This 
 he gives the kinsman legal notice of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that he might have the refusal of it. Whoever had it must pay for it,
 and Boaz might have said, "My money is as good as my kinsman's; if I 
 have a mind to it, why may not I buy it privately, since I had the 
 first proffer of it, and say nothing to my kinsman?" No, Boaz, though 
 fond enough of the purchase, would not do so mean a thing as to take a 
 bargain over another man's head that was nearer a-kin to it; and we are 
 taught by his example to be not only just and honest, but fair and 
 honourable, in all our dealings, and to do nothing which we are 
 unwilling should see the light, but be above-board. 

 4. The kinsman seemed forward to redeem the land till he was told that, 
 if he did that, he must marry the widow, and then he flew off. He liked 
 the land well enough, and probably caught at that the more greedily 
 because he hoped that the poor widow being under a necessity of selling 
 he have so much the better bargain: "<I>I will redeem it</I>" (said he) 
 "with all my heart," thinking it would be a fine addition to his 
 estate, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 But Boaz told him there was a young widow in the case, and, if he have
 the land, he must take her with it, <I>Terra transit cum onere--The 
 estate passes with this incumbrance;</I> either the divine law or the 
 usage of the country would oblige him to it, or Naomi insisted upon it 
 that she would not sell the land but upon this condition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Some think this does not relate to the law of marrying the brother's
 widow (for that seems to oblige only the children of the same father,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:5">Deut.  xxv. 5</A>,

 unless by custom it was afterwards made to extend to the next of kin), 
 but to the law of redemption of inheritances 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:24,25">Lev. xxv. 24, 25</A>),

 for it is a <I>goel,</I> a <I>redeemer,</I> that is here enquired for;
 and if so it was not by the law, but by Naomi's own resolution, that 
 the purchaser was to marry the widow. However it was, this kinsman, 
 when he heard the conditions of the bargain, refused it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>I cannot redeem it for myself.</I> I will not meddle with it upon
 these terms, lest I mar my own inheritance." The land, he thought, 
 would be an improvement of his inheritance, but not the land with the 
 woman; that would mar it. Perhaps he thought it would be a 
 disparagement to him to marry such a poor widow that had come from a 
 strange country, and almost lived upon alms. He fancied it would be a 
 blemish to his family, it would mar his blood, and disgrace his 
 posterity. Her eminent virtues were not sufficient in his eye to 
 counterbalance this. The Chaldee paraphrase makes his reason for this 
 refusal to be that he had another wife, and, if he should take Ruth, it 
 might occasion strife and contention in his family, which would mar the 
 comfort of his inheritance. Or he thought she might bring him a great 
 many children, and they would all expect shares out of his estate, 
 which would scatter it into too many hands, so that the family would 
 make the less figure.  This makes many shy of the great redemption: 
 they are not willing to espouse religion. They have heard well of it, 
 and have nothing to say against it; they will give it their good word, 
 but at the same time they will give their good word with it; they are 
 willing to part with it, and cannot be bound to it, for fear of marring 
 their own inheritance in this world. Heaven they could be glad of, but 
 holiness they can dispense with; it will not agree with the lusts they 
 have already espoused, and therefore, let who will purchase heaven at 
 that rate, they cannot. 

 5. The right of redemption is fairly resigned to Boaz. If this nameless
 kinsman lost a good bargain, a good estate, and a good wife too, he may 
 thank himself for not considering it better, and Boaz will thank him 
 for making his way clear to that which he valued and desired above any 
 thing. In those ancient times it was not the usage to pass estates by 
 writings, as afterwards

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+32:10-12">Jer. xxxii. 10</A>,

 &c.), but by some sign or ceremony, as with us by livery and seisin, as
 we commonly call it, that is, the delivery of seisin, seisin of a house 
 by giving the key, of land by giving turf and a twig. The ceremony here 
 used was, he that surrendered <I>plucked off his shoe</I> (the Chaldee 
 says it was <I>the glove of his right hand</I>) and gave it to him to 
 whom he made the surrender, intimating thereby that, whatever right he 
 had to tread or go upon the land, he conveyed and transferred it, upon 
 a valuable consideration, to the purchaser: this was a <I>testimony in 
 Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 And it was done in this case, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 If this kinsman had been bound by the law to marry Ruth, and his
 refusal had been a contempt of that law, Ruth must have <I>plucked off 
 his shoe</I> and <I>spit in his face,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+25:9">Deut. xxv. 9</A>.

 But, though his relation should in some measure oblige him to the duty,
 yet the distance of his relation might serve to excuse him from the 
 penalty, or Ruth might very well dispense with it, since his refusal 
 was all she desired from him. But bishop Patrick, and the best 
 interpreters, think this had no relation to that law, and that the 
 drawing off of the shoe was not any disgrace as there, but a 
 confirmation of the surrender, and an evidence that it was not 
 fraudulently nor surreptitiously obtained. Note, Fair and open dealing 
 in all matters of contract and commerce is what all those must make 
 conscience of that would approve themselves Israelites indeed, without 
 guile. How much more honourably and honestly does Boaz come by this 
 purchase than if he had secretly undermined his kinsman, and privately 
 struck up a bargain with Naomi, unknown to him. Honesty will be found 
 the best policy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Boaz now sees his way clear, and therefore delays not to perform his 
 promise made to Ruth that he would do the kinsman's part, but in the 
 gate of the city, before the elders and all the people, publishes a 
 marriage-contract between himself and Ruth the Moabitess, and therewith 
 the purchase of all the estate that belonged to the family of 
 Elimelech. If he had not been 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:1"><I>ch.</I> ii. 1</A>)

 <I>a mighty man of wealth,</I> he could not have compassed this
 redemption, nor done this service to his kinsman's family.  What is a 
 great estate good for, but that it enables a man to do so much the more 
 good in his generation, and especially to those of his own household, 
 if he have but a heart to use it so! Now concerning this marriage it 
 appears,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That it was solemnized, or at least published, before many 
 witnesses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.
 
 "You are witnesses,"

 1. "That I have bought the estate. Whoever has it, or any part of it,
 mortgaged to him, let him come to me and he shall have his money, 
 according to the value of the land," which was computed by the number 
 of years to the year of jubilee

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:15">Lev. xxv. 15</A>),

 when it would have returned of course to Elimelech's family. The more
 public the sales of estates are the better they are guarded against 
 frauds. 

 2.  "That I have purchased the widow to be my wife." He had no portion
 with her; what jointure she had was encumbered, and he could not have 
 it without giving as much for it as it was worth, and therefore he 
 might well say he purchased her; and yet, being a virtuous woman, he 
 reckoned he had a good bargain.  <I>House and riches are the 
 inheritance of fathers,</I> but a prudent wife is more valuable, is 
 from the Lord as a special gift. He designed, in marrying her, to 
 preserve the memory of the dead, that the name of Mahlon, though he 
 left no son to bear it up, might not be cut off from the gate of his 
 place, but by this means might be preserved, that it should be inserted 
 in the public register that Boaz married Ruth the widow of Mahlon, the 
 son of Elimelech, which posterity, whenever they had occasion to 
 consult the register, would take particular notice of.  And this 
 history, being preserved for the sake of that marriage and the issue of 
 it, proved an effectual means to perpetuate the name of Mahlon, even 
 beyond the thought or intention of Boaz, to the world's end. And 
 observe that because Boaz did this honour to the dead, as well as this 
 kindness to the living, God did him the honour to bring him into the 
 genealogy of the Messiah, by which his family was dignified above all 
 the families of Israel; while the other kinsman, that was so much 
 afraid of diminishing himself, and marring his inheritance, by marrying 
 the widow, has his name, family, and inheritance, buried in oblivion 
 and disgrace. A tender and generous concern for the honour of the dead 
 and the comfort of poor widows and strangers, neither of which can 
 return the kindness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:14">Luke xiv. 14</A>),

 is sure what God will be well pleased with and will surely recompense.
 Our Lord Jesus is our <I>Goel,</I> our <I>Redeemer,</I> our everlasting 
 Redeemer. He looked, like Boaz, with compassion on the deplorable state 
 of fallen mankind.  At a vast expense he redeemed the heavenly 
 inheritance for us, which by sin was mortgaged, and forfeited into the 
 hands of divine justice, and which we should never have been able to 
 redeem. He likewise purchased a peculiar people, whom he would espouse 
 to himself, though strangers and foreigners, like Ruth, poor and 
 despised, that the name of that dead and buried race might not be cut 
 off for ever. He ventured the marring of his own inheritance, to do 
 this, for, <I>though he was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor;</I> 
 but he was abundantly recompensed for it by his Father, who, because he 
 thus humbled himself, hath <I>highly exalted him, and given him a name 
 above every name.</I> Let us own our obligations to him, make sure our 
 contract with him, and study all our days how to do him honour. Boaz, 
 by making a public declaration of this marriage and purchase, not only 
 secured his title against all pretenders, as it were by a fine with 
 proclamations, but put honour upon Ruth, showed that he was not ashamed 
 of her, and her parentage and poverty, and left a testimony against 
 clandestine marriages. It is only that which is evil that hates the 
 light and comes not to it. Boaz called witnesses to what he did, for it 
 was what he could justify, and would never disown; and such regard was 
 then had, even to the contemned crowd, that not only the elders, but 
 all the people that were in the gate, passing and re-passing, were 
 appealed to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 and hearkened to
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 when they said, <I>We are witnesses.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That it was attended with many prayers. The elders and all the 
 people, when they witnessed to it, wished well to it, and blessed it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 Ruth, it should seem, was now sent for; for they speak of her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>)

 as present: <I>This young woman;</I> and, he having taken her to wife,
 they look upon her as already come into his house. And very heartily 
 they pray for the new-married couple.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The senior elder, it is likely, made this prayer, and the rest of 
 the elders, with the people, joined in it, and therefore it is spoken 
 of as made by them all; for in public prayers, though but one speaks, 
 we must all pray. Observe, 

 (1.) Marriages ought to be blessed, and accompanied with prayer,
 because every creature and every condition are that to us, and no more, 
 that God makes them to be. It is civil and friendly to wish all 
 happiness to those who enter into that condition; and what good we 
 desire we should pray for from the fountain of all good. The minister 
 who gives himself to the word and prayer, as he is the fittest person 
 to exhort, so he is the fittest to bless and pray for those that enter 
 into this relation.

 (2.) We ought to desire and pray for the welfare and prosperity one of
 another, so far from envying or grieving at it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Now here, 

 (1.) They prayed for Ruth: <I>The Lord make the woman that has come
 into thy house like Rachel and Leah,</I> that is, "God make her a good 
 wife and a fruitful mother." Ruth was a virtuous woman, and yet needed 
 the prayers of her friends, that by the grace of God she might be made 
 a blessing to the family she had come into. They prayed that she might 
 be like Rachel and Leah, rather than like Sarah and Rebekah, for Sarah 
 had but one son, and Rebekah but one that was in covenant, the other 
 was Esau, who was rejected; but Rachel and Leah did <I>build up the 
 house of Israel:</I> all their children were in the church, and their 
 offspring was numerous. "May she be a flourishing, fruitful, faithful 
 <I>vine by thy house side.</I>"

 (2.) They prayed for Boaz, that he might continue to do worthily in the
 city to which he was an ornament, and might there be more and more 
 famous. They desired that the wife might be a blessing in the private 
 affairs of the house, and the husband a blessing in the public business 
 of the town, that she in her place, and he in his, might be wise, 
 virtuous, and successful.  Observe, The way to be famous is to do 
 worthily. Great reputation must be obtained by great merits. It is not 
 enough not to do unworthily, to be harmless and inoffensive, but we 
 must do worthily, be useful and serviceable to our generation. Those 
 that would be truly illustrious must in their places shine as lights.

 (3.) They prayed for the family: "<I>Let thy house be like the house of
 Pharez,</I>" that is, "let it be very numerous, let it greatly increase 
 and multiply, as the house of Pharez did." The Bethlehemites were of 
 the house of Pharez, and knew very well how numerous it was; in the 
 distribution of the tribes, that grandson of Jacob had the honour which 
 none of the rest had but Manasseh and Ephraim, that his posterity was 
 subdivided into two distinct families, Hezron and Hamul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+26:21">Num. xxvi. 21</A>.
 
 Now they prayed that the family of Boaz, which was one branch of that
 stock, might in process of time become as numerous and great as the 
 whole stock now was.</P>

 nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth
 thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.
 &nbsp; 16 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and
 became nurse unto it.
 &nbsp; 17 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There
 is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he <I>is</I>
 the father of Jesse, the father of David.
 &nbsp; 18 Now these <I>are</I> the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat
 Hezron,
 &nbsp; 19 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,
 &nbsp; 20 And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
 &nbsp; 21 And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
 &nbsp; 22 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

 Here is, 

 I. Ruth a wife. Boaz took her, with the usual solemnities, to his 
 house, and <I>she became his wife</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 all the city, no doubt, congratulating the preferment of a virtuous
 woman, purely for her virtues. We have reason to think that Orpah, who 
 returned from Naomi to her people and her gods, was never half so well 
 preferred as Ruth was.  He that forsakes all for Christ shall find more 
 than all with him; it shall be recompensed a hundred-fold in this 
 present time. Now Orpah wished she had gone with Naomi too; but she, 
 like the other kinsman, stood in her own light. Boaz had prayed that 
 this pious proselyte might receive a full reward of her courage and 
 constancy from the God of Israel, <I>under whose wings she had come to 
 trust;</I> and now he became an instrument of that kindness, which was 
 an answer to his prayer, and helped to make his own words good. Now she 
 had the command of those servants with whom she had associated and of 
 those fields in which she had gleaned. Thus sometimes <I>God raiseth up 
 the poor out of the dust, to set them with princes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:7,8">Ps. cxiii. 7, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Ruth a mother: <I>The Lord gave her conception;</I> for <I>the 
 fruit of the womb is his reward,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:3">Ps. cxxvii. 3</A>.

 It is one of the keys he hath in his hand; and he sometimes makes the
 barren woman that had been long so to be <I>a joyful mother of 
 children,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:9,Isa+54:1">Ps. cxiii. 9; Isa. liv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Ruth still a daughter-in-law, and the same that she always was, to 
 Naomi, who was so far from being forgotten that she was a principal 
 sharer in these new joys. The good women that were at the labour when 
 this child was born congratulated Naomi upon it more than either Boaz 
 or Ruth, because she was the match-maker, and it was the family of her 
 husband that was hereby built up. See here, as before, what an air of 
 devotion there was then even in the common expressions of civility 
 among the Israelites. Prayer to God attended the birth of the child. 
 What a pity it is that such pious language should either be disused 
 among Christians or degenerate into a formality. "<I>Blessed be the 
 Lord</I> that has sent thee this grandson," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 1. Who was the preserver of the name of her family, and who, they
 hoped, would be famous, because his father was so. 

 2. Who would be hereafter dutiful and kind to her, so they hoped,
 because his mother was so. If he would but take after her, he would be 
 a comfort to his aged grandmother, a restorer of her life, and, if 
 there should be occasion, would have wherewithal to be the nourisher of 
 her old age. It is a great comfort to those that are going into years 
 to see any of those that descend from them growing up, that are likely, 
 by the blessing of God, to be a stay and support to them, when the 
 years come wherein they will need such, and of which they will say they 
 have no pleasure in them.  Observe, They say of Ruth that she loved 
 Naomi, and therefore was better to her than seven sons. See how God in 
 his providence sometimes makes up the want and loss of those relations 
 from whom we expected most comfort in those from whom we expected 
 least. The bonds of love prove stronger than those of nature, and there 
 is a <I>friend that sticks closer than a brother;</I> so here there was 
 a daughter-in-law better than an own child. See what wisdom and grace 
 will do. Now here,

 (1.) The child is named by the neighbours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The good women would have it called <I>Obed, a servant,</I> either in
 remembrance of the meanness and poverty of the mother or in prospect of 
 his being hereafter a servant, and very serviceable, to his 
 grandmother. It is no dishonour to those that are ever so well born to 
 be servants to God, their friends, and their generation. The motto of 
 the princes of Wales is <I>Ich dien--I serve.</I>

 (2.) The child is nursed by the grandmother, that is, dry-nursed, when
 the mother had weaned him from the breast, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 She laid it in her bosom, in token of her tender affection to it and
 care of it.  Grandmothers are often the most fond.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Ruth is hereby brought in among the ancestors of David and Christ, 
 which was the greatest honour. The genealogy is here drawn from Pharez, 
 through Boaz and Obed, to David, and so leads towards the Messiah, and 
 therefore it is not an endless genealogy.</P>
