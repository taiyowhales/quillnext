 It was a much larger and more particular account of the building of the 
 temple which we had in the book of Kings than is here in this book of 
 Chronicles. In this chapter we have, 

 I. The place and time of building the temple, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The dimensions and rich ornaments of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:3-9">ver.  3-9</A>.

 III. The cherubim in the most holy place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:10-13">ver. 10-13</A>.

 IV. The veil, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:14">ver.  14</A>.

 V.  The two pillars, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>.

 Of all this we have already and an account,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then Solomon began to build the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> at
 Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where <I>the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT></I> appeared unto David
 his father, in the place that David had prepared in the
 threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
 &nbsp; 2  And he began to build in the second <I>day</I> of the second
 month, in the fourth year of his reign.
 &nbsp; 3  Now these <I>are the things wherein</I> Solomon was instructed for
 the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the
 first measure <I>was</I> threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty
 cubits.
 &nbsp; 4  And the porch that <I>was</I> in the front <I>of the house,</I> the
 length <I>of it was</I> according to the breadth of the house, twenty
 cubits, and the height <I>was</I> a hundred and twenty: and he
 overlaid it within with pure gold.
 &nbsp; 5  And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he
 overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.
 &nbsp; 6  And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty:
 and the gold <I>was</I> gold of Parvaim.
 &nbsp; 7  He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the
 walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved
 cherubims on the walls.
 &nbsp; 8  And he made the most holy house, the length whereof <I>was</I>
 according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the
 breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold,
 <I>amounting</I> to six hundred talents.
 &nbsp; 9  And the weight of the nails <I>was</I> fifty shekels of gold. And
 he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The place where the temple was built. Solomon was neither at liberty
 to choose nor at a loss to fix the place. It was before determined

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:1">1 Chron. xxii. 1</A>),

 which was an ease to his mind. 

 1. It must be at Jerusalem; for that was the place where God had chosen
 to put his name there. The royal city must be the holy city. 
 <I>There</I> must be <I>the testimony of Israel;</I> <I>for there are 
 set the thrones of judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:4,5">Ps.  cxxii. 4, 5</A>.

 2. It must be on Mount Moriah, which, some think, was that very place
 in the land of Moriah where Abraham offered Isaac, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:2">Gen. xxii. 2</A>.

 So the Targum says expressly, adding, <I>But he was delivered by the
 word of the Lord, and a ram provided in his place.</I> That was typical 
 of Christ's sacrifice of himself; therefore fitly was the temple, which 
 was likewise a type of him, built there. 

 3. It must be <I>where the Lord appeared to David,</I> and <I>answered
 him by fire,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+21:18,26">1 Chron. xxi. 18, 26</A>.

 There atonement was made once; and therefore, in remembrance of that, 
 there atonement must still be made.  Where God has met with me it is to
 be hoped that he will still manifest himself. 

 4. It must be in the place which David has prepared, not only which he
 had purchased with his money, but which he had purchased with his 
 money, but which he had pitched upon divine direction. It was Solomon's 
 wisdom not to enquire out a more convenient place, but to acquiesce in 
 the appointment of God, whatever might be objected against it. 

 5. It must be in the threshold floor of Ornan, which, if (as a
 Jebusite) it gives encouragement to the Gentiles, obliges us to look 
 upon temple-work as that which requires the labour of the mind, no less 
 than threshing-work does that of the body.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The time when it was begun; not till the fourth year of Solomon's 
 reign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Not that the first three years were trifled away, or spent in
 deliberating whether they should build the temple or no; but they were 
 employed in the necessary preparations for it, wherein three years 
 would be soon gone, considering how many hands were to be got together 
 and set to work. Some conjecture that this was a sabbatical year, or 
 year of release and rest to the land, when the people, being discharged 
 from their husbandry, might more easily lend a hand to the beginning of 
 this work; and then the year in which it was finished would fall out to 
 be another sabbatical year, when they would likewise have leisure to 
 attend the solemnity of the dedication of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The dimensions of it, in which Solomon was instructed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 as he was in other things, by his father. <I>This was the
 foundation</I> (so it may be read) <I>which Solomon laid for the 
 building of the house.</I> This was the rule he went by, so many cubits 
 the length and breadth, <I>after the first measure,</I> that is, 
 according to the measure first fixed, which there was no reason to make 
 any alteration of when the work came to be done; for the dimensions 
 were given by divine wisdom, and <I>what God does shall be for ever; 
 nothing can be put to it, or taken from it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:14">Eccl. iii. 14</A>.

 His first measure will be the last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The ornaments of the temple. The timber-work was very fine, and 
 yet, within, it was <I>overlaid with pure gold</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 with <I>fine gold</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and that embossed with <I>palm-trees and chains.</I> It was gold of
 <I>Parvaim</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 the best gold. The <I>beams</I> and <I>posts,</I> the <I>walls</I> and
 <I>doors,</I> were <I>overlaid with gold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The most holy place, which was ten yards square, was all <I>overlaid
 with fine gold</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 even the <I>upper chambers,</I> or rather the <I>upper floor or
 roof</I>--top, bottom, and sides, were all overlaid with gold. Every 
 nail, or screw, or pin, with which the golden plates were fastened to 
 the walls that were overlaid with them, weighed fifty shekels, or was 
 worth so much, workmanship and all. A great many precious stones were 
 dedicated to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:2,8">1 Chron. xxix. 2, 8</A>),

 and these were set here and there, where they would show to the best
 advantage. The finest houses now pretend to no better garnishing than 
 good paint on the roof and walls; but the ornaments of the temple were 
 most substantially rich. It was set with <I>precious stones,</I> 
 because it was a type of the new Jerusalem, which has no temple in it 
 because it is all temple, and the walls, gates, and foundations of 
 which are said to be of <I>precious stones and pearls,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:18,19,21">Rev. xxi. 18, 19, 21</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image
 work, and overlaid them with gold.
 &nbsp; 11  And the wings of the cherubims <I>were</I> twenty cubits long:
 one wing <I>of the one cherub was</I> five cubits, reaching to the
 wall of the house: and the other wing <I>was likewise</I> five cubits,
 reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
 &nbsp; 12  And <I>one</I> wing of the other cherub <I>was</I> five cubits,
 reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing <I>was</I> five
 cubits <I>also,</I> joining to the wing of the other cherub.
 &nbsp; 13  The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty
 cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces <I>were</I>
 inward.
 &nbsp; 14  And he made the vail <I>of</I> blue, and purple, and crimson, and
 fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.
 &nbsp; 15  Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five
 cubits high, and the chapiter that <I>was</I> on the top of each of
 them <I>was</I> five cubits.
 &nbsp; 16  And he made chains, <I>as</I> in the oracle, and put <I>them</I> on
 the heads of the pillars; and made a hundred pomegranates, and
 put <I>them</I> on the chains.
 &nbsp; 17  And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the
 right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of
 that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left
 Boaz.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is an account of 
 
 1. The two cherubim, which were set up in the
 holy of holies. There were two already over the ark, which covered the 
 mercy-seat with their wings; these were small ones. Now that the most 
 holy place was enlarged, though these were continued (being 
 appurtenances to the ark, which was not to be made new, as all the 
 other utensils of the tabernacle were), yet those two large ones were 
 added, doubtless by divine appointment, to fill up the holy place, 
 which otherwise would have looked bare, like a room unfurnished. These 
 cherubim are said to be of <I>image-work</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 designed, it is likely, to represent the angels who attend the divine
 Majesty. Each wing extended five cubits, so that the whole was twenty 
 cubits

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>),

 which was just the breadth of the most holy place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 They stood on their feet, as servants, their faces inward toward the
 ark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 that it might appear they were not set there to be adored (for then
 they would have been made sitting, as on a throne, and their faces 
 towards their worshippers), but rather as themselves attendants on the 
 invisible God. We must not worship angels, but we must worship 
 <I>with</I> angels; for we have come into communion with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22">Heb. xii. 22</A>),

 and must do the will of God as the angels do it. The thought that we
 are worshipping him before whom the angels cover their faces will help 
 to inspire us with reverence in all our approaches to God.  Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:10,Isa+6:2">1 Cor. xi. 10 with Isa. vi. 2</A>.

 2. The veil that parted between the temple and the most holy place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This denoted the darkness of that dispensation, and the distance which
 the worshippers were kept at; but, at the death of Christ, this veil 
 was rent; for through him we are made nigh, and have boldness not only 
 to look, but to enter, into the holiest. On this he was wrought 
 cherubim. Heb. <I>he caused them to ascend,</I> that is, they were made 
 in raised work, embossed. Or he made them on the wing in an ascending 
 posture, as the other two that stood on their feet in an attending 
 posture, to remind the worshippers to lift up their hearts, and to soar 
 upwards in their devotions.

 3. The two pillars which were set up before the temple. Both together
 were somewhat above thirty-five cubits in length

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 about eighteen cubits high a-piece. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+7:15-22">1 Kings vii. 15</A>,

 &c., where we took a view of those
 pillars, <I>Jachin</I> and <I>Boaz, establishment</I> and 
 <I>strength</I> in temple-work and by it.</P>
