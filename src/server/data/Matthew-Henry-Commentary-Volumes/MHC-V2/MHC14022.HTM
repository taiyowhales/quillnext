 We read, in the foregoing chapter, of the carrying away of Jehoram's 
 sons and his wives; but here we find one of his sons and one of his 
 wives left, his son Ahaziah and his wife Athaliah, both reserved to be 
 the shame and plague of his family.  

 I.  Ahaziah was the shame of it as a partaker, 
 
 1. In the sin, and,

 2.  In the destruction, of the house of Ahab, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+22:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. Athaliah was the plague of it, for she destroyed all the
 seed-royal, and usurped the throne,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest
 son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the
 Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son
 of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.
 &nbsp; 2  Forty and two years old <I>was</I> Ahaziah when he began to reign,
 and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also
 <I>was</I> Athaliah the daughter of Omri.
 &nbsp; 3  He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his
 mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.
 &nbsp; 4  Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> like the house
 of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his
 father to his destruction.
 &nbsp; 5  He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the
 son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at
 Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.
 &nbsp; 6  And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds
 which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of
 Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to
 see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.
 &nbsp; 7  And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram:
 for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the
 son of Nimshi, whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had anointed to cut off the house of
 Ahab.
 &nbsp; 8  And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment
 upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the
 sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he
 slew them.
 &nbsp; 9  And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid
 in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain
 him, they buried him: Because, said they, he <I>is</I> the son of
 Jehoshaphat, who sought the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with all his heart. So the house
 of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the reign of Ahaziah, a short reign (of one 
 year only), yet long enough, unless it had been better. He was called 
 <I>Jeho-ahaz</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+21:17"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 17</A>);

 here he is called <I>Ahaz-iah,</I> which is the same name and of the
 same signification, only the words of which it is compounded are 
 transposed. He is here said to be forty-two years old when he began to 
 reign 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+22:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 which could not be, for his father, his immediate predecessor, was but
 forty when he died, and it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+8:26">2 Kings  viii. 26</A>)

 that he was twenty-two years old when <I>he began to reign.</I> Some
 make this forty-two to be the age of his mother Athaliah, for in the 
 original it is, <I>he was the son of forty-two years,</I> that is, the 
 son of a mother that was of that age; and justly is her age put for 
 his, in reproach to him, because she managed him, and did what she 
 would--she, in effect, reigned, and he had little more than the title 
 of king. Many good expositors are ready to allow that this, with some 
 few more such difficulties, arise from the mistake of some transcriber, 
 who put forty-two for twenty-two, and the copies by which the error 
 should have been corrected might be lost. Many ancient translations 
 read it here twenty-two. Few books are now printed without some 
 <I>errata,</I> yet the authors do not therefore disown them, nor are 
 the errors of the press imputed to the author, but the candid reader 
 amends them by the sense, or by comparing them with some other part of 
 the work, as we may easily do this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The history of Ahaziah's reign is briefly summed up in two clauses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+22:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 His mother and her relations were his counselors to do wickedly, and it
 was to his destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He did wickedly. Though by a special providence of God he was 
 preserved alive, when all his brethren were slain, and reserved for the 
 crown, notwithstanding he was the youngest of them--though <I>the
 inhabitants of Jerusalem,</I> when they had buried his father 
 ingloriously, made him king, in hopes he would take warning by that not 
 to tread in his steps, but would do better for himself and his 
 kingdom--yet he was not influenced by the favours either of God or man,
 but <I>walked in the way of the house of Ahab, did evil in the sight of 
 the Lord</I> like them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+22:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>),

 that is, he worshipped, Baalim and Ashtaroth, supposing (as the learned
 bishop Patrick thinks) that by these demons, as mediators, they might 
 have easier access to the supreme <I>Numen,</I> the God of Israel, or 
 that <I>these they might resort to at all times</I> and <I>for all 
 matters,</I> as being <I>nearer at hand,</I> and <I>not of so high a 
 dignity,</I> but of a <I>middle nature</I> between the immortal God and 
 mortal men--deified heroes; so they worshipped them as the church of 
 Rome does saints and angels. That was sufficiently bad; but I wish 
 there was no reason to suspect worse. I am apprehensive that they 
 looked upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers, to be altogether such a 
 one as these Baalim, and them to be as great and as good as he, nay, 
 upon one account, more eligible inasmuch as these Baalim encouraged in 
 their worshippers all manner of lewdness and sensuality, which the God 
 of Israel strictly forbade.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He was counselled by his mother and her relations to do so. <I>She 
 was his counsellor</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+22:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 and so were <I>they, after the death of his father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 While his father lived <I>he</I> took care to keep him to idolatry;
 but, when he was dead, the house of Ahab feared lest his father's 
 miserable end should deter him from it, and therefore they were very 
 industrious to keep him closely to it, and to make him <I>seven 
 times</I> more a <I>child of hell than themselves.</I> The counsel of 
 the ungodly is the ruin of many young persons when they are setting out 
 in the world. This young prince might have had better advice if he had 
 pleased from the princes and the judges, the priests and the Levites, 
 that had been famous in his good grandfather's time for teaching in the 
 knowledge of God; but the house of Ahab humoured him, and <I>he walked 
 after their counsel,</I> gave himself up to be led by them, and did 
 just as they would have him. Thus do those debase and destroy 
 themselves that forsake the divine guidance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He was counselled by them to his destruction. So it proved. Those 
 that counsel us to do wickedly counsel us to our destruction; while 
 they fawn, and flatter, and pretend friendship, they are really our 
 worst enemies. Those that debauch young men destroy them. It was bad 
 enough that they exposed him to the sword of the Syrians, drawing him 
 in to join with Joram king of Israel in an expedition to Ramoth-Gilead, 
 where Joram was wounded, an expedition that was not for his honour. 
 Those that give us bad counsel in the affairs of religion, if regarded 
 by us, may justly be made of God our counsellors to do foolishly in our 
 own affairs. But that was not all: by engaging him in an intimacy with 
 Joram king of Israel, they involved him in the common ruin of the house 
 of Ahab. He came on a visit to Joram 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+22:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 just at the time that Jehu was executing the judgment of God upon that
 idolatrous family, and so was cut off with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+22:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.
 
 Here,

 1. See and dread the mischief of bad company--of joining in with
 sinners. If not the infection, yet let the destruction be feared. 
 <I>Come out from Babylon,</I> that falling house, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:4">Rev. xviii. 4</A>.

 2. See and acknowledge the justice of God. His providence brought 
 Ahaziah, just at this fatal juncture, to see Joram, that he might fall 
 with him and be taken as in a snare. This we had an account of before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:27,28">2 Kings ix. 27, 28</A>.

 It is here added that he was decently buried (not as Jehoram, whose
 dead body was cast into Naboth's vineyard,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+9:26">2 Kings ix. 26</A>),

 and the reason given is because he was the son (that is, the grandson)
 of good Jehoshaphat, <I>who sought the Lord with his heart.</I> Thus is 
 <I>he</I> remembered with honour long after his death, and some respect 
 shown even to his degenerate unworthy seed for his sake. <I>The memory 
 of the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rot.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
 dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of
 Judah.
 &nbsp; 11  But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the
 son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that
 were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So
 Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada
 the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from
 Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
 &nbsp; 12  And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and
 Athaliah reigned over the land.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here what we had before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:1-16">2 Kings xi. 1</A>,

 &c.

 1. A wicked woman endeavouring to destroy the house of David, that she
 might set up a throne for herself upon the ruins of it. Athaliah 
 barbarously cut off all the seed-royal 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+22:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 perhaps intending to transmit the crown of Judah after herself to some
 of her own relations, that though her family was cut off in Israel by 
 Jehu it might be planted in Judah. 

 2. A good woman effectually preserving it from being wholly extirpated. 
 One of the late king's sons, a child of a year old, was rescued from 
 among the dead, and saved alive by the care of Jehoiada's wife

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+22:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>),

 that a <I>lamp might be ordained for God's anointed;</I> for no word of
 God shall fall to the ground.</P>
