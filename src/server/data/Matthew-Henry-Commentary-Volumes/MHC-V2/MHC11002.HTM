 In this chapter we have David setting and Solomon at the same time 
 rising. 
 
 I. The conclusion of David's reign with his life. 

 1. The charge he gives to Solomon upon his death-bed, in general, to
 serve God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>),

 in particular, concerning Joab, Barzillai, and Shimei,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.

 2. His death and burial, and the years of his reign,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 II. The beginning of Solomon's reign,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:12">ver. 12</A>.

 Though he was to be a prince of peace, he began his reign with some
 remarkable acts of justice, 

 1. Upon Adonijah, whom he put to death for his aspiring pretensions,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:13-25">ver. 13-25</A>.

 2. Upon Abiathar, whom he deposed from the high priesthood for siding
 with Adonijah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:26,27">ver. 26, 27</A>.

 3. Upon Joab, who he put to death for his late treasons and former
 murders, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:28-35">ver. 28-35</A>.

 4. Upon Shimei, whom, for cursing David, he confined to Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:36-38">ver. 36-38</A>),

 and three years after, for transgressing the rules, put to death,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:39-46">ver. 39-46</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he
 charged Solomon his son, saying,
 &nbsp; 2 I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and
 show thyself a man;
 &nbsp; 3 And keep the charge of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> thy God, to walk in his ways,
 to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments,
 and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that
 thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever
 thou turnest thyself:
 &nbsp; 4 That the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> may continue his word which he spake concerning
 me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk
 before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul,
 there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 5 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did
 to me, <I>and</I> what he did to the two captains of the hosts of
 Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of
 Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put
 the blood of war upon his girdle that <I>was</I> about his loins, and
 in his shoes that <I>were</I> on his feet.
 &nbsp; 6 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar
 head go down to the grave in peace.
 &nbsp; 7 But show kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,
 and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came
 to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
 &nbsp; 8 And, behold, <I>thou hast</I> with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a
 Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in
 the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at
 Jordan, and I sware to him by the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, I will not put
 thee to death with the sword.
 &nbsp; 9 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou <I>art</I> a wise
 man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar
 head bring thou down to the grave with blood.
 &nbsp; 10 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
 of David.
 &nbsp; 11 And the days that David reigned over Israel <I>were</I> forty
 years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three
 years reigned he in Jerusalem.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, that great and good man, is here a dying man 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and a dead man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 It is well there is another life after this, for death stains all the
 glory of this, and lays it in the dust. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The charge and instructions which David, when he was dying, gave to 
 Solomon, his son and declared successor. He feels himself declining, 
 and is not backward to own it, nor afraid to hear or speak of dying: 
 <I>I go the way of all the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Heb. <I>I am walking in it.</I> Note, Death is a way; not only a period
 of this life, but a passage to a better. It is <I>the way of all the 
 earth,</I> of all mankind who dwell on earth, and are themselves earth, 
 and therefore must return to their earth. Even the sons and heirs of 
 heaven must <I>go the way of all the earth,</I> they must needs die; 
 but they walk with pleasure in this way, <I>through the valley of the 
 shadow of death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:4">Ps. xxiii. 4</A>.

 Prophets, and even kings, must go this way to brighter light and honour
 than prophecy or sovereignty. David is going this way, and therefore 
 gives Solomon directions what to do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He charges him, in general, to keep God's commandments and to make 
 conscience of his duty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>.
 
 He prescribes to him,

 (1.) A good rule to act by--the divine will: "Govern thyself by that." 
 David's charge to him is to <I>keep the charge of the Lord</I> his 
 <I>God.</I> The authority of a dying father is much, but nothing to 
 that of a living God. There are great trusts which we are charged with 
 by the Lord our God--let us keep them carefully, as those that must 
 give account; and excellent statutes, which we must be ruled by--let us 
 also keep them. The written word is our rule. Solomon must himself do
 <I>as was written in the law of Moses.</I> 

 (2.) A good spirit to act with: Be <I>strong and show thyself a 
 man,</I> though in years but a child. Those that would keep the charge 
 of the Lord their God must put on resolution.

 (3.) Good reasons for all this. This would effectually conduce, 

 [1.] To the prosperity of his kingdom. It is the way to <I>prosper in 
 all thou doest,</I> and to succeed with honour and satisfaction in 
 every undertaking. 

 [2.] To the perpetuity of it: <I>That the Lord may continue</I> and so 
 confirm <I>his word which he spoke concerning me.</I> Those that 
 rightly value the treasure of the promise, that sacred 
 <I>depositum,</I> cannot but be solicitous to preserve the entail of 
 it, and very desirous that those who come after them may do nothing to 
 cut it off. Let each, in his own age, successively, keep God's charge, 
 and then God will be sure to continue his word. We never let fall the 
 promise till we let fall the precept. God had promised David that the
 Messiah should come from his loins, and that promise was absolute: but 
 the promise that there should not fail him <I>a man on the throne of 
 Israel</I> was conditional--if his seed behave themselves as they 
 should. If Solomon, in his day, fulfil the condition, he does his part 
 towards the perpetuating of the promise. The condition is that he walk
 before God in all his institutions, in sincerity, with zeal and 
 resolution; and, in order hereunto, that he <I>take heed to his 
 way.</I> In order to our constancy in religion, nothing is more 
 necessary than caution and circumspection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He gives him directions concerning some particular persons, what to 
 do with them, that he might make up his deficiencies in justice to some 
 and kindness to others. 

 (1.) Concerning Joab, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 David was now conscious to himself that he had not done well to spare
 him, when he had made himself once again obnoxious to the law, but the 
 murder of Abner first and afterwards of Amasa, both of them great men, 
 <I>captains of the hosts of Israel.</I> He slew them treacherously 
 (<I>shed the blood of war in peace</I>), and injuriously to David:
 <I>Thou knowest what</I> he <I>did to me</I> therein. The murder of a 
 subject is a wrong to the prince, it is a loss to him, and is against 
 the peace of our sovereign lord the king. These murders were 
 particularly against David, reflecting upon his reputation, he being, 
 at that time, in treaty with the victims, and hazarded his interest, 
 which they were very capable of serving. Magistrates are the avengers
 of the blood of those they have the charge of. It aggravated Joab's 
 crime that he was neither ashamed of the sin nor afraid of the 
 punishment, but daringly wore the girdle and shoes that were stained 
 with innocent blood, in defiance of the justice both of God and the 
 king. David refers him to Solomon's wisdom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 with an intimation that he left him to his justice. Say not, "He has a
 hoary head; it is a pity it should be cut off, for it will shortly fall 
 of itself." No, let it not <I>go down to the grave in peace.</I> Though 
 he has been long reprieved, he shall be reckoned with at last; time 
 does not wear out the guilt of any sin, particularly that of murder.

 (2.) Concerning Barzillai's family, to whom he orders him to be kind 
 for Barzillai's sake, who, we may suppose, by this time, was dead, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 When David, upon his death-bed, was remembering the injuries that had
 been done, he could not forget the kindnesses that had been shown, but 
 leaves it as a charge upon his son to return them. Note, the kindnesses 
 we have received from our friends must not be buried either in their 
 graves or ours, but our children must return them to theirs. Hence,
 perhaps, Solomon fetched that rule

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:10">Prov. xxvii. 10</A>),

 <I>Thy own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not.</I> Paul prays
 for the house of Onesiphorus, who had often refreshed him.

 (3.) Concerning Shimei, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 [1.] His crime is remembered: <I>He cursed me with a grievous 
 curse;</I> the more grievous because he insulted him when he was in 
 misery and poured vinegar into his wounds. The Jews say that one thing
 which made this a grievous curse was that, besides all that is 
 mentioned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+16:1-23">2 Sam. xvi.</A>),

 Shimei upbraided him with his descent from Ruth the Moabitess. 

 [2.] His pardon is not forgotten. David owned he had sworn to him that 
 he would not himself put him to death, because he seasonably submitted, 
 and cried <I>Peccavi--I have sinned,</I> and he was not willing, 
 especially at that juncture, to use the sword of public justice for the 
 avenging of wrongs done to himself. But, 

 [3.] His case, as it now stands, is left with Solomon, as one that knew 
 what was fit to be done and would do as he found occasion. David 
 intimates to him that his pardon was not designed to be perpetual, but 
 only a reprieve for David's life: "<I>Hold him not guiltless;</I> do 
 not think him any true friend to thee or thy government, nor fit to be 
 trusted. He has no less malice than he had then, though he has more 
 sense to conceal it. He is still a debtor to the public justice for 
 what he did then; and, though I promised him that I would not put him 
 to death, I never promised that my successor should not. His turbulent 
 spirit will soon give thee an occasion, which thou shouldst not fail to 
 take, for the bringing of his <I>hoary head to the grave with 
 blood.</I>" This proceeded not from personal revenge, but a prudent 
 zeal for the honour of the government and the covenant God had made 
 with his family, the contempt of which ought not to go unpunished. Even 
 a hoary head, if a guilty and forfeited head, ought not to be any man's 
 protection from justice. <I>The sinner, being a hundred years old,
 shall be accursed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:20">Isa. lxv. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David's death and burial 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 He <I>was buried in the city of David,</I> not in the burying place of
 his father, as Saul was, but in his own city, which he was the founder 
 of. There were set the thrones, and there the tombs, of the house of 
 David. Now <I>David, after he had served his own generation, by the 
 will of God, fell asleep, and was laid to his fathers, and saw 
 corruption,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:36">Acts xiii. 36</A>,

 and see
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:29">Acts ii. 29</A>.

 His epitaph may be taken from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:1">2 Sam. xxiii. 1</A>.

 Here lies <I>David the son of Jesse, the man who was raised up on high,
 the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel,</I> 
 adding his own words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:9">Ps. xvi. 9</A>),

 <I>My flesh also shall rest in hope.</I> Josephus says that, besides
 the usual magnificence with which his son Solomon buried him, he put 
 into his sepulchre a vast deal of money; and that 1300 years after (so 
 he reckons) it was opened by Hircanus the high priest, in the time of 
 Antiochus, and 3000 talents were taken out for the public service. The 
 years of his reign are here computed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 to be forty years; the odd six months which he reigned above seven
 years in Hebron are not reckoned, but the even sum only.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and
 his kingdom was established greatly.
 &nbsp; 13 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother
 of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said,
 Peaceably.
 &nbsp; 14 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she
 said, Say on.
 &nbsp; 15 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and
 <I>that</I> all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign:
 howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's:
 for it was his from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 16 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she
 said unto him, Say on.
 &nbsp; 17 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for
 he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite
 to wife.
 &nbsp; 18 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the
 king.
 &nbsp; 19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto
 him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed
 himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat
 to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.
 &nbsp; 20 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; <I>I pray
 thee,</I> say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my
 mother: for I will not say thee nay.
 &nbsp; 21 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to
 Adonijah thy brother to wife.
 &nbsp; 22 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why
 dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him
 the kingdom also; for he <I>is</I> mine elder brother; even for him,
 and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
 &nbsp; 23 Then king Solomon sware by the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, saying, God do so to
 me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against
 his own life.
 &nbsp; 24 Now therefore, <I>as</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> liveth, which hath established
 me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath
 made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death
 this day.
 &nbsp; 25 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of
 Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. Solomon's accession to the throne,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He came to it much more easily and peaceably than David did, and much
 sooner saw his government established. It is happy for a kingdom when 
 the end of one good reign is the beginning of another, as it was 
 here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His just and necessary removal of Adonijah his rival, in order to 
 the establishment of his throne. Adonijah had made some bold 
 pretensions to the crown, but was soon obliged to let them fail and 
 throw himself upon Solomon's mercy, who dismissed him upon his good 
 behaviour, and, had he been easy, he might have been safe. But here we 
 have him betraying himself into the hands of Solomon's justice, and 
 falling by it, the righteous God leaving him to himself, that he might 
 be punished for his former treason and that Solomon's throne might be 
 established. Many thus ruin themselves, because they know not when they 
 are well off, or well done to; and sinners, by presuming on God's 
 patience, treasure up wrath to themselves. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Adonijah's treasonable project, which was to marry Abishag, David's 
 concubine, not because he was in love with her, but because, by her, he 
 hoped to renew his claim to the crown, which might stand him in stead, 
 or because it was then looked upon as a branch of the government to 
 have <I>the wives of the predecessor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:8">2 Sam. xii. 8</A>.

 Absalom thought his pretensions much supported by lying with his
 father's concubines. Adonijah flatters himself that if he may succeed
 him in his bed, especially with the best of his wives, he may by that 
 means step up to succeed him in his throne. Restless and turbulent 
 spirits reach high. It was but a small game to play at, as it should
 seem, yet he hoped to make it an after-game for the kingdom, and now to 
 gain that by a wife which he could not gain by force.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The means he used to compass this. He durst not make suit to Abishag
 immediately (he knew she was at Solomon's disposal, and he would justly 
 resent it if his consent were not first obtained, as even Ishbosheth 
 did, in a like case, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:7">2 Sam. iii. 7</A>),

 nor durst he himself apply immediately to Solomon, knowing that he lay
 under his displeasure; but he engaged Bathsheba to be his friend in 
 this matter, who would be forward to believe it a matter of love, and 
 not apt to suspect it a matter of policy. Bathsheba was surprised to 
 see Adonijah in her apartment, and asked him if he did not come with a 
 design to do her a mischief, because she had been instrumental to crush 
 his late attempt. "No," says he, "I come <I>peaceably</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and to beg a favour"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 that she would use the great interest she had in her son to gain his
 consent, that he might marry Abishag

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>),

 and, if he may but obtain this, he will thankfully accept it,

 (1.) As a compensation for his loss of the kingdom. He insinuates 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 "Thou knowest the kingdom was mine, as my father's eldest son, living
 at the time of his death, <I>and all Israel set their faces on me.</I>" 
 This was false; they were but a few that he had on his side; yet thus 
 he would represent himself as an object of compassion, that had been 
 deprived of a crown, and therefore might well be gratified in a wife.
 If he may not inherit his father's throne, yet let him have something 
 valuable that was his father's, to keep for his sake, and let it be 
 Abishag.

 (2.) As his reward for his acquiescence in that loss. He owns Solomon's 
 right to the kingdom: "<I>It was his from the Lord.</I> I was foolish 
 in offering to contest it; and now that it is turned about to him I am 
 satisfied." Thus he pretends to be well pleased with Solomon's 
 accession to the throne, when he is doing all he can to give him 
 disturbance. <I>His words were smoother than butter, but war was in his 
 heart.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Bathsheba's address to Solomon on his behalf. She promised to speak 
 to the king for him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 and did so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Solomon received her with all the respect that was due to a mother,
 though he himself was a king: He <I>rose up to meet her, bowed himself 
 to her,</I> and caused her <I>to sit on his right hand,</I> according 
 to the law of the fifth commandment. Children, not only when grown up, 
 but when grown great, must give honour to their parents, and behave 
 dutifully and respectfully towards them. <I>Despise not thy mother when 
 she is old.</I> As a further instance of the deference he paid to his 
 mother's wisdom and authority, when he understood she had a petition to 
 present to him, he promised not to say her nay, a promise which both he 
 and she understood with this necessary limitation, provided it be just 
 and reasonable and fit to be granted; but, if it were otherwise, he was 
 sure he should convince her that it was so, and that then she would 
 withdraw it. She tells him her errand at last

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Let Abishag be given to Adonijah thy brother.</I> It was strange
 that she did not suspect the treason, but more strange that she did not 
 abhor the incest, that was in the proposal. But either she did not take 
 Abishag to be David's wife, because the marriage was not consummated, 
 or she thought it might be dispensed with to gratify Adonijah, in 
 consideration of his tame submission to Solomon. This was her weakness 
 and folly: it was well that she was not regent. Note, Those that have 
 the ear of princes and great men, as it is their wisdom not to be too 
 prodigal of their interest, so it is their duty never to use it for the 
 assistance of sin or the furtherance of any wicked design. Let not 
 princes be asked that which they ought not to grant. It ill becomes a 
 good man to prefer a bad request or appear in a bad cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Solomon's just and judicious rejection of the request. Though his 
 mother herself was the advocate, and called it <I>a small petition,</I> 
 and perhaps it was the first she had troubled him with since he was 
 king, yet he denied it, without violation of the general promise he had 
 made, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 If Herod had not had a mind to cut off John Baptist's head, he would
 not have thought himself obliged to do it by a general promise, like 
 this, made to Herodias. The best friend we have in the world must not 
 have such an interest in us as to bring us to do a wrong thing, either 
 unjust or unwise.

 (1.) Solomon convinces his mother of the unreasonableness of the 
 request, and shows her the tendency of it, which, before, she was not 
 aware of. His reply is somewhat sharp: "<I>Ask for him the kingdom 
 also,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 To ask that he may succeed the king in his bed is, in effect, to ask
 that he may succeed him in his throne; for that is it he aims at." 
 Probably he had information, or cause for a strong suspicion, that 
 Adonijah was plotting with Joab and Abiathar to give him disturbance, 
 which warranted him to put this construction upon Adonijah's request.

 (2.) He convicts and condemns Adonijah for his pretensions, and both 
 with an oath. He convicts him out of his own mouth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 His own tongue shall fall upon him; and a heavier load a man needs not
 fall under. Bathsheba may be imposed upon, but Solomon cannot; he 
 plainly sees what Adonijah aims at, and concludes, "He has <I>spoken 
 this word against his own life;</I> he is snared in the words of his 
 own lips; now he shows what he would be at." He condemns him to die 
 immediately: <I>He shall be put to death this day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 God had himself declared with an oath that he would establish David's
 throne

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:35">Ps. lxxxix. 35</A>),

 and therefore Solomon pledges the same assurance to secure that
 establishment, by cutting off the enemies of it. "As God liveth, that 
 establisheth the government, Adonijah shall die, that would unsettle 
 it." Thus the ruin of the enemies of Christ's kingdom is as sure as the 
 stability of his kingdom, and both are as sure as the being and life of 
 God, the founder of it. The warrant is immediately signed for his 
 execution, and no less a man than Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, general 
 of the army, is ordered to be the executioner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 It is strange that Adonijah may not be heard to speak for himself: but
 Solomon's wisdom did not see it needful to examine the matter any 
 further; it was plain enough that Adonijah aimed at the crown, and 
 Solomon could not be safe while he lived. Ambitious turbulent spirits 
 commonly prepare for themselves the instruments of death. Many a head 
 has been lost by catching at a crown.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>26 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to
 Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou <I>art</I> worthy of death:
 but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou
 barest the ark of the Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> before David my father, and
 because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was
 afflicted.
 &nbsp; 27 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; that he might fulfil the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, which he spake
 concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
 &nbsp; 28 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after
 Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto
 the tabernacle of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and caught hold on the horns of the
 altar.
 &nbsp; 29 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the
 tabernacle of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and, behold, <I>he is</I> by the altar. Then
 Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon
 him.
 &nbsp; 30 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and said
 unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but
 I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying,
 Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
 &nbsp; 31 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall
 upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent
 blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.
 &nbsp; 32 And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall return his blood upon his own head, who
 fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew
 them with the sword, my father David not knowing <I>thereof, to
 wit,</I> Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and
 Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
 &nbsp; 33 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab,
 and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon
 his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be
 peace for ever from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 34 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him,
 and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the
 wilderness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Abiathar and Joab were both aiding and abetting in Adonijah's 
 rebellious attempt, and it is probable were at the bottom of this new 
 motion made of Adonijah for Abishag, and it should seem Solomon knew 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 This was, in both, an intolerable affront both to God and to the
 government, and the worse because of their high station and the great 
 influence their examples might have upon many. They therefore come next 
 to be reckoned with. They are both equally guilty of the treason, but, 
 in the judgment passed upon them, a difference is made and with good 
 reason.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Abiathar, in consideration of his old services, is only degraded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 1. Solomon convicts him, and by his great wisdom finds him guilty:
 "<I>Thou art worthy of death,</I> for joining with Adonijah, when thou 
 knewest on whose head God intended to set the crown." 

 2. He calls to mind the respect he had formerly shown to David his
 father, and that he had both ministered to him in holy things (<I>had 
 borne before him the ark of the Lord</I>), and also had tenderly
 sympathized with him in his afflictions and been afflicted in them all, 
 particularly when he was in exile and distress both by Saul's 
 persecution and Absalom's rebellion. Note, Those that show kindness to
 God's people shall have it remembered to their advantage one time or 
 other. 

 3. For this reason he spares Abiathar's life, but deposes him from his
 offices, and confines him to his country seat at Anathoth, forbids him 
 the court, the city, the tabernacle, the altar, and all inter-meddling 
 in public business, with an intimation likewise that he was upon his 
 good behaviour, and that though Solomon did not put him to death at 
 this time he might another time, if he did not conduct himself well. 
 But, for the present, he was only thrust out from being priest, as 
 rendered unworthy that high station by the opposition he had given to 
 that which he knew to be the will of God. Saul, for a supposed crime, 
 had barbarously slain Abiathar's father, and eighty-five priests, their 
 families, and city. Solomon spares Abiathar himself, though guilty of
 a real crime. Thus was Saul's government ruined and Solomon's 
 established. As men are to God's ministers, they will find him to them. 
 
 4. The depriving of Abiathar was the fulfilling of the threatening
 against the house of Eli

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:30">1 Sam. ii. 30</A>),

 for he was the last high priest of that family. It was now above eighty
 years since the ruin was threatened; but God's judgments, though not 
 executed speedily, will be executed surely.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Joab, in consideration of his old sins, is put to death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His guilty conscience sent him to the horns of the altar. He heard 
 that Adonijah was executed and Abiathar deposed, and therefore, fearing 
 his turn would be next, he fled for refuge to the altar. Many that, in 
 the day of their security, care not for the service of the altar, will 
 be glad of the protection of it in the day of their distress. Some 
 think Joab designed thereby to devote himself for the future to a 
 constant attendance upon the altar, hoping thereby to obtain his 
 pardon, as some that have lived a dissolute life all their days have 
 thought to atone for their crimes by retiring into a monastery when 
 they are old, leaving the world when it has left them and no thanks to 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Solomon ordered him to be put to death there for the murder of Abner 
 and Amasa; for these were the crimes upon which he thought fit to 
 ground the sentence, rather than upon his treasonable adherence to 
 Adonijah. Joab was indeed worthy of death for turning after Adonijah, 
 in contempt of Solomon and his designation to the throne, <I>though he 
 had not turned after Absalom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 Former fidelity will not serve to excuse any after treachery; yet,
 besides that, Joab had merited well of the house of David, to which and 
 to his country he had done a great deal of good service in his day, in 
 consideration of which, it is probable, Solomon would have pardoned him 
 his offence against him (for clemency gives great reputation and 
 establishment to an infant government), and would have only displaced 
 him as he did Abiathar; but he must die for the murders he had formerly 
 been guilty of, which his father had charged Solomon to call him to an 
 account for. The debt he owed to the innocent blood that was shed, by 
 answering its cries with the blood of him that shed, he could not pay 
 himself, but left it to his son to pay it, who, having power 
 wherewithal, failed not to do it. On this he grounds the sentence,
 aggravating the crime

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 that he <I>fell upon two men more righteous and better than he,</I>
 that had done him no wrong nor meant him any, and, had they lived, 
 might probably have done David better service (if the blood shed be not 
 only innocent, but excellent, the life more valuable that common lives, 
 the crime is the more heinous), that David knew not of it, and yet the 
 case was such that he would be suspected as privy to it; so that Joab 
 endangered his prince's reputation in taking away the life of his 
 rivals, which was a further aggravation. For these crimes,

 (1.) He must die, and die by the sword of public justice. <I>By man 
 must his blood be shed,</I> and it lies upon his own head 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 as theirs does whom he had murdered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 Woe to the head that lies under the guilt of blood! Vengeance for
 murder was long in coming upon Joab; but, when it did come, it remained 
 the longer, being here entailed <I>upon the head of his seed for 
 ever</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 who, instead of deriving honour, as otherwise they might have done,
 from his heroic actions, derived guilt, and shame, and a curse, from 
 his villainous actions, on account of which they fared the worse in 
 this world. The seed of such evil doers shall never be renowned.

 (2.) He must die at the altar, rather than escape. Joab resolved not to 
 stir from the altar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 hoping thereby either to secure himself or else to render Solomon
 odious to the people, as a profaner of the holy place, if he should put 
 him to death there. Benaiah made a scruple of either killing him there 
 or dragging him thence; but Solomon knew the law, that the altar of God 
 should give no protection to wilful murderers.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:14">Exod. xxi. 14</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt take him from my altar that he may die,</I> may die a
 sacrifice. In case of such sins as the blood of beasts would atone for 
 the altar was a refuge, but not in Joab's case. He therefore orders him 
 to be executed there, if he could not be got thence, to show that he 
 feared not the censure of the people in doing his duty, but would 
 rectify their mistake, and let them know that the administration of 
 justice is better than sacrifice, and that the holiness of any place 
 should never countenance the wickedness of any person. Those who, by a 
 lively faith, take hold on Christ and his righteousness, with a 
 resolution, if they perish, to perish there, shall find in him a more 
 powerful protection than Joab found at the horns of the altar. Benaiah 
 slew him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 with the solemnity, no doubt, of a public execution. The law being
 thus satisfied, he was <I>buried in his own house in the 
 wilderness,</I> privately, like a criminal, not pompously, like a 
 soldier; yet no indignity was done to his dead body. It is not for man 
 to lay the iniquity upon the bones, whatever God does.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Solomon pleased himself with this act of justice, not as it 
 gratified any personal revenge, but as it was the fulfilling of his 
 father's orders and a real kindness to himself and his own government. 
 
 (1.) Guilt was hereby removed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 By returning the innocent blood that had been shed upon the head of him
 that shed it, it was taken away from him and from the house of his 
 father, which implies that the blood which is not required from the 
 murderer will be required from the magistrate, at least there is danger 
 lest it should. Those that would have their houses safe and built up 
 must put away iniquity far from them.

 (2.) Peace was hereby secured 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>)

 upon David. He does not mean his person, but, as he explains himself in
 the next words, Upon <I>his seed, his house, and his throne,</I> shall 
 there be <I>peace for ever from the Lord;</I> thus he expresses his 
 desire that it may be so and his hope that it shall be so. "Now that 
 justice is done, and the cry of blood is satisfied, the government will 
 prosper." Thus <I>righteousness and peace kiss each other.</I> Now that 
 such a turbulent man as Joab is removed there shall be peace. <I>Take 
 away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be 
 established in righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:5">Prov. xxv. 5</A>.

 Solomon, in this blessing of peace upon his house and throne, piously
 looks upward to God as the author of it. "It shall be peace from the
 Lord, and peace for ever from the Lord." The Lord of peace himself give 
 us that peace which is everlasting.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>35 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room
 over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room
 of Abiathar.
 &nbsp; 36 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
 Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not
 forth thence any whither.
 &nbsp; 37 For it shall be, <I>that</I> on the day thou goest out, and
 passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that
 thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
 &nbsp; 38 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying <I>is</I> good: as my
 lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt
 in Jerusalem many days.
 &nbsp; 39 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of
 the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king
 of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants <I>be</I>
 in Gath.
 &nbsp; 40 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to
 Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his
 servants from Gath.
 &nbsp; 41 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem
 to Gath, and was come again.
 &nbsp; 42 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
 Did I not make thee to swear by the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and protested unto
 thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and
 walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou
 saidst unto me, The word <I>that</I> I have heard <I>is</I> good.
 &nbsp; 43 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and the
 commandment that I have charged thee with?
 &nbsp; 44 The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the
 wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to
 David my father: therefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall return thy wickedness
 upon thine own head;
 &nbsp; 45 And king Solomon <I>shall be</I> blessed, and the throne of David
 shall be established before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for ever.
 &nbsp; 46 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which
 went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was
 established in the hand of Solomon.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The preferment of Benaiah and Zadok, two faithful friends to Solomon 
 and his government,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 Joab being put to death, Benaiah was advanced to be general of the
 forces in his room, and, Abiathar being deposed, Zadok was made high 
 priest in his room, and therein was fulfilled the word of God, when he 
 threatened to cut off the house of Eli

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:35">1 Sam. ii. 35</A>),

 <I>I will raise me up a faithful priest, and will build him a sure
 house.</I> Though sacred offices may be disgraced, they shall not be 
 destroyed, by the mal-administration of those that are entrusted with 
 them, nor shall God's work ever stand still for want of hands to carry 
 it on. No wonder that he who was a king so immediately of God's making 
 was empowered to make whom he though fit high priest; and he exercised 
 this power with equity, for the ancient right was in Zadok, he being of 
 the family of Eleazar, whereas Eli and his house were of Ithamar.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The course that was taken with Shimei. He is sent for, by a 
 messenger, from his house at Bahurim, expecting perhaps no better than 
 Adonijah's doom, being conscious of his enmity to the house of David; 
 but Solomon knows how to make a difference of crimes and criminals. 
 David had promised Shimei his life for his time. Solomon is not bound 
 by that promise, yet he will not go directly contrary to it. 

 1. He confines him to Jerusalem, and forbids him, upon any pretence
 whatsoever, to go out of the city any further than the brook Kidron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>.

 He would suffer him to continue at his country seat lest he should make
 mischief among his neighbours, but took him to Jerusalem, where he kept 
 him prisoner at large. This might make Shimei's confinement easy to 
 himself, for Jerusalem was beautiful for situation, <I>the joy of the 
 whole earth,</I> the royal city, the holy city (he had no reason to 
 complain of being shut up in such a paradise); it would also make it 
 the more safe for Solomon, for there he would have him under his eye 
 and be able to watch his motions; and he plainly tells him that if he 
 ever go out of the rules he shall certainly die for it. This was a fair 
 trial of his obedience, and such a test of his loyalty as he had no 
 reason to complain of. He has his life upon easy terms: he shall live 
 if he will but be content to live at Jerusalem.

 2. Shimei submits to the confinement, and thankfully takes his life
 upon those terms. He enters into recognizance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 under the penalty of death, not to stir out of Jerusalem, and owns that
 the saying is good. Even those that perish cannot but own the
 conditions of pardon and life unexceptionable, so that their blood, 
 like Shimei's, must rest upon their own heads. Shimei promised, with an 
 oath, to keep within his bounds, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 3. Shimei forfeits his recognizance, which was the thing Solomon
 expected; and God was righteous in suffering him to do it, that he 
 might now suffer for his old sins. Two of his servants (it seems, 
 though he was a prisoner, he lived like himself, well attended) ran 
 from him to the land of the Philistines, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 Thither he pursued them, and thence brought them back to Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 For the keeping of it private he <I>saddled his ass</I> himself,
 probably went in the night, and came home he thought undiscovered.
 "Seeking his servants," says bishop Hall, "he lost himself; those 
 earthly things either are, or should be, our servants. How commonly do 
 we see men run out of the bounds set by God's law, to hunt after them, 
 till their souls incur a fearful judgment!"

 4. Solomon takes the forfeiture. Information is given him that Shimei
 has transgressed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.
 
 The king sends for him, and,

 (1.) charges him with the present crime 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:42,43"><I>v.</I> 42, 43</A>),

 that he had put a great contempt upon the authority and wrath both of
 God and the king, that he had broken <I>the oath of the Lord</I> and 
 disobeyed the commandment of his prince, and by this it appeared what 
 manner of spirit he was of, that he would not be held by the bonds of 
 gratitude or conscience. Had he represented to Solomon the urgency of 
 the occasion, and begged leave to go, perhaps Solomon might have given 
 him leave; but to presume either upon his ignorance or his connivance 
 was to affront him in the highest degree.

 (2.) He condemns him for his former crime, cursing David, and throwing 
 stones at him in the day of his affliction: <I>The wickedness which thy 
 heart is privy to,</I>

 There was no need to examine witnesses for the proof of the fact, his
 own conscience was instead of a thousand witnesses. That wickedness 
 which men's <I>own hearts</I> alone <I>are privy to</I> is enough, if 
 duly considered, to fill them with confusion, in expectation of its 
 return upon <I>their own heads;</I> for if the heart be privy to it, 
 God is greater than the heart and knoweth all things. Others knew of 
 Shimei's cursing David, but Shimei himself knew of the wicked 
 principles of hatred and malice against David which he displayed in 
 cursing him and that his submission was but feigned and forced.

 (3.) He blessed himself and his government 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:45"><I>v.</I> 45.</A>):

 <I>King Solomon shall be blessed,</I> notwithstanding Shimei's impotent
 curses, which perhaps, in fury and despair, he now vented freely: 
 <I>Let them curse, but bless thou.</I> And <I>the throne of David shall 
 be established,</I> by taking away those that would undermine it. It is 
 a comfort, in reference to the enmity of the church's enemies, that, 
 how much soever they rage, it is a vain thing they imagine. Christ's 
 throne is established, and they cannot shake it.

 (4.) He gives orders for the execution of Shimei immediately, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:46">v. 46</A>.
 
 All judgment is committed to the Lord Jesus, and, though he be King of
 peace, he will be found a King of righteousness; and this will shortly 
 be his word of command concerning all his enemies, that would not have 
 him to reign over them: <I>Bring them forth, and slay them before 
 me;</I> the reproaches of those that blasphemed him will fall on 
 themselves, to their eternal condemnation.</P>
