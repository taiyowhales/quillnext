 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a
 day may bring forth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A good caution against presuming upon time to come: <I>Boast not
 thyself,</I> no, not <I>of to-morrow,</I> much less of many days or 
 years to come. This does not forbid preparing for to-morrow, but 
 presuming upon to-morrow. We must not promise ourselves the continuance 
 of our lives and comforts till to-morrow, but speak of it with 
 submission to the will of God and as those who with good reason are 
 kept at uncertainty about it. We must not <I>take thought for the 
 morrow</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:34">Matt. vi. 34</A>),

 but we must cast our care concerning it upon God. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:13-15">James iv. 13-15</A>.

 We must not put off the great work of conversion, that one thing
 needful, till to-morrow, as if we were sure of it, <I>but to-day, while 
 it is called to-day,</I> hear God's voice.

 2. A good consideration, upon which this caution is grounded: <I>We
 know not what a day may bring forth,</I> what event may be in the 
 teeming womb, of time; it is a secret till it is born, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:5">Eccl. xi. 5</A>.

 A little time may produce considerable changes, and such as we little
 think of. We <I>know not what</I> the present <I>day may bring 
 forth;</I> the evening must commend it. <I>Nescis quid serus vesper 
 vehat--Thou knowest not what the close of evening may bring with 
 it.</I> God has wisely kept us in the dark concerning future events, 
 and reserved to himself the knowledge of them, as a flower of the 
 crown, that he may train us up in a dependence upon himself and a 
 continued readiness for every event, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:7">Acts i. 7</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr27_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a
 stranger, and not thine own lips.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note,

 1. We must do that which is commendable, for which even strangers may
 praise us. Our <I>light</I> must <I>shine before men,</I> and we must
 do good works that may be seen, though we must not do them on purpose
 that they may be seen. Let our own works be such as will praise us,
 even <I>in the gates,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:8">Phil. iv. 8</A>.

 2. When we have done it we must not commend ourselves, for that is an
 evidence of pride, folly, and self-love, and a great lessening to a
 man's reputation. Every one will be forward to run him down that cries
 himself up. There may be a just occasion for us to vindicate ourselves,
 but it does not become us to applaud ourselves. <I>Proprio laus sordet
 in ore--Self-praise defiles the mouth.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  A stone <I>is</I> heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath
 <I>is</I> heavier than them both.
 &nbsp; 4  Wrath <I>is</I> cruel, and anger <I>is</I> outrageous; but who <I>is</I>
 able to stand before envy?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These two verses show the intolerable mischief, 

 1. Of ungoverned passion. The wrath of a fool, who when he is provoked
 cares not what he says and does, is more grievous than a great stone or 
 a load of sand. It lies heavily upon himself. Those who have no
 command of their passions do themselves even sink under the load of 
 them. The wrath of a fool lies heavily upon those he is enraged at, to 
 whom, in his fury, he will be in danger of doing some mischief. It is 
 therefore our wisdom not to give provocation to a fool, but, if he be 
 in a passion, to get out of his way. 

 2. Of rooted malice, which is as much worse than the former as coals of 
 juniper are worse than a fire of thorns. <I>Wrath</I> (it is true)
 <I>is cruel,</I> and does many a barbarous thing, <I>and anger is 
 outrageous;</I> but a secret enmity at the person of another, an envy 
 at his prosperity, and a desire of revenge for some injury or affront, 
 are much more mischievous. One may avoid a sudden heat, as David 
 escaped Saul's javelin, but when it grows, as Saul's did, to a settled 
 envy, there is no <I>standing before it;</I> it will pursue; it will 
 overtake. He that grieves at the good of another will be still 
 contriving to do him hurt, and will keep his anger for ever.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Open rebuke <I>is</I> better than secret love.
 &nbsp; 6  Faithful <I>are</I> the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an
 enemy <I>are</I> deceitful.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is good for us to be reproved, and told of our faults, by our 
 friends. If true love in the heart has but zeal and courage enough to 
 show itself in dealing plainly with our friends, and reproving them for 
 what they say and do amiss, this is really <I>better,</I> not only than 
 secret hatred (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:17">Lev. xix. 17</A>),

 but <I>than secret love,</I> that love to our neighbours which does not
 show itself in this good fruit, which compliments them in their sins, 
 to the prejudice of their souls. <I>Faithful are the reproofs of a
 friend,</I> though for the present they are painful as <I>wounds.</I> 
 It is a sign that our friends are faithful indeed if, in love to our 
 souls, they will not suffer sin upon us, nor let us alone in it. The 
 physician's care is to cure the patient's disease, not to please his 
 palate.

 2. It is dangerous to be caressed and flattered by <I>an enemy,</I> 
 whose <I>kisses are deceitful</I> We can take no pleasure in them 
 because we can put no confidence in them (Joab's kiss and Judas's were 
 deceitful), and therefore we have need to stand upon our guard, that we 
 be not deluded by them; they are to be deprecated. Some read it: <I>The 
 Lord deliver us from an enemy's kisses, from lying lips, and from a 
 deceitful tongue.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul
 every bitter thing is sweet.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon here, as often in this book, shows that the poor have in some 
 respects the advantage of the rich; for, 

 1. They have a better relish of their enjoyments than the rich have.
 Hunger is the best sauce. Coarse fare, with a good appetite to it has
 a sensible pleasantness in it, which those are strangers to whose 
 hearts are <I>overcharged with surfeiting.</I> Those that fare 
 sumptuously every day nauseate even delicate food, as the Israelites 
 did the quails; whereas those that have no more than their necessary 
 food, though it be such as <I>the full soul</I> would call 
 <I>bitter,</I> to them it <I>is sweet;</I> they eat it with pleasure, 
 digest it, and are refreshed by it. 

 2. They are more thankful for their enjoyments: <I>The hungry</I> will 
 bless God for bread and water, while those that are <I>full</I> think 
 the greatest dainties and varieties scarcely worth giving thanks for. 
 The virgin Mary seems to refer to this when she says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:53">Luke i. 53</A>),

 <I>The hungry,</I> who know how to value God's blessings, <I>are filled
 with good things,</I> but <I>the rich,</I> who despise them, are justly 
 <I>sent empty away.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so <I>is</I> a man that
 wandereth from his place.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. There are many that do not know when they are well off, but are 
 uneasy with their present condition, and given to change. God, in his 
 providence, has appointed them a place fit for them and has made it 
 comfortable to them; but they affect unsettledness; they love to 
 wander; they are glad of a pretence to go abroad, and do not care for 
 staying long at a place; they needlessly absent themselves from their 
 own work and care, and meddle with that which belongs not to them. 

 2. Those that thus desert the post assigned to them are like <I>a bird
 that wanders from her nest.</I> It is an instance of their folly; they 
 are like a silly bird; they are always wavering, like the wandering 
 bird that hops from bough to bough and rests nowhere. It is unsafe; the 
 bird that wanders is exposed; a man's place is his castle; he that 
 quits it makes himself an easy prey to the fowler. When the bird 
 wanders from her nest the eggs and young ones there are neglected.
 Those that love to be abroad leave their work at home undone. <I>Let 
 every man therefore, in the calling wherein he is called, therein 
 abide,</I> therein abide <I>with God.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so <I>doth</I> the
 sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.
 &nbsp; 10  Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not;
 neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity:
 <I>for</I> better <I>is</I> a neighbour <I>that is</I> near than a brother far
 off.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A charge given to be faithful and constant to our friends, our old 
 friends, to keep up an intimacy with them, and to be ready to do them 
 all the offices that lie in our power. It is good to have a friend, a 
 bosom-friend, whom we can be free with, and with whom we may 
 communicate counsels. It is not necessary that this friend should be a 
 relation, or any way akin to us, though it is happiest when, among 
 those who are so, we find one fit to make a friend of. Peter and Andrew 
 were brethren, so were James and John; yet Solomon frequently 
 distinguishes between a friend and a brother. But it is advisable to 
 choose a friend among our neighbours who live near us, that 
 acquaintance may be kept up and kindnesses the more frequently 
 interchanged. It is good also to have a special respect to those who 
 have been friends to our family: "<I>Thy own friend,</I> especially if 
 he have been <I>thy father's friend, forsake not;</I> fail not both to 
 serve him and to use him, as there is occasion. He is a tried friend; 
 he knows thy affairs; he has a particular concern for thee; therefore 
 be advised by him." It is a duty we owe to our parents, when they are 
 gone, to love their friends and consult with them. Solomon's son undid 
 himself by forsaking the counsel of his father's friends. 

 2. A good reason given why we should thus value true friendship and be 
 choice of it.

 (1.) Because of the pleasure of it. There is a great deal of
 <I>sweetness</I> in conversing and consulting with a cordial friend. It 
 is like <I>ointment and perfume,</I> which are very grateful to the 
 smell, and exhilarate the spirits. It <I>rejoices the heart;</I> the 
 burden of care is made lighter by unbosoming ourselves to our friend, 
 and it is a great satisfaction to us to have his sentiments concerning 
 our affairs. <I>The sweetness of</I> friendship lies not in hearty 
 mirth, and hearty laughter, but in <I>hearty counsel,</I> faithful 
 advice, sincerely given and without flattery, <I>by counsel of the 
 soul</I> (so the word is), counsel which reaches the case, and comes to 
 the heart, counsel about soul-concerns, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:16">Ps. lxvi. 16</A>.

 We should reckon that the most pleasant conversation which is about
 spiritual things, and promotes the prosperity of the soul.

 (2.) Because of the profit and advantage of it, especially in a <I>day
 of calamity.</I> We are here advised not to go into a <I>brother's 
 house,</I> not to expect relief from a kinsman merely for kindred-sake, 
 for the obligation of that commonly goes little further than calling 
 cousin and fails when it comes to the trial of a real kindness, but 
 rather to apply ourselves to our neighbours, who are at hand, and will 
 be ready to help us at an exigence. It is wisdom to oblige them by 
 being neighbourly, and we shall have the benefit of it in distress, by 
 finding them so to us,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Children are here exhorted to be wise and good, 

 1. That they may be a comfort to their parents and may <I>make their
 hearts glad,</I> even when <I>the evil days come,</I> and so recompense 
 them for their care,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:15"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 15</A>.

 2. That they may be a credit to them: "<I>That I may answer him that
 reproaches me</I> with having been over-strict and severe in bringing 
 up my children, and having taken a wrong method with them in 
 restraining them from the liberties which other young people take.
 <I>My son, be wise,</I> and then it will appear, in the effect, that I 
 went the wisest way to work with my children." Those that have been 
 blessed with a religious education should in every thing conduct 
 themselves so as to be a credit to their education and to silence those 
 who say, <I>A young saint, an old devil;</I> and to prove the contrary, 
 <I>A young saint, an old angel.</I></P>

 This we had before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:3"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 3</A>.
 
 Note,

 1. Evil may be foreseen. Where there is temptation, it is easy to 
 foresee that if we thrust ourselves into it there will be sin, and as 
 easy to foresee that if we venture upon the evil of sin there will 
 follow the evil of punishment; and, commonly, God warns before he 
 wounds, having <I>set watchmen over us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:17">Jer. vi. 17</A>.

 2. It will be well or ill with us according as we do or do not improve 
 the foresight we have of evil before us: The <I>prudent man, foreseeing 
 the evil,</I> forecasts accordingly, <I>and hides himself, but the 
 simple</I> is either so dull that he does not foresee it or so wilful 
 and slothful that he will take no care to avoid it, and so he <I>passes 
 on</I> securely <I>and is punished.</I> We do well for ourselves when 
 we provide for hereafter.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a

 This also we had before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:16"><I>ch.</I> xx. 16</A>.

 1. It shows who those are that are hastening to poverty, those that 
 have so little consideration as to be bound for every body that will 
 ask them and those that are given to women. Such as these will take up 
 money as far as ever their credit will go, but they will certainly 
 cheat their creditors at last, nay, they are cheating them all along. 
 An honest man may be made a beggar, but he is not honest that makes 
 himself one. 

 2. It advises us to be so discreet in ordering our affairs as not to 
 lend money to those who are manifestly wasting their estates, unless 
 they give very good security for it. Foolish lending is injustice to 
 our families. He does not say, "Get another to be bound with him," for 
 he that makes himself a common voucher will have those to be his 
 security who are as insolvent as himself; therefore <I>take his 
 garment.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early
 in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is a great folly to be extravagant in praising even the best of 
 our friends and benefactors. It is our duty to give every one his due 
 praise, to applaud those who excel in knowledge, virtue, and 
 usefulness, and to acknowledge the kindnesses we have received with 
 thankfulness; but to do this <I>with a loud voice, rising early in the 
 morning,</I> to be always harping on this string, in all companies, 
 even to our friend's face, or so as that he may be sure to hear it, to 
 do it studiously, as we do that which we rise early to, to magnify the 
 merits of our friend above measure and with hyperboles, is fulsome, and 
 nauseous, and savours of hypocrisy and design. Praising men for what 
 they have done is only to get more out of them; and every body 
 concludes the parasite hopes to be well paid for his panegyric or 
 epistle dedicatory. We must not give that praise to our friend which is 
 due to God only, as some think is intimated in <I>rising early</I> to 
 do it; for in the morning God is to be praised. We must not <I>make
 too much haste to praise men</I> (so some understand it), not cry up 
 men too soon for their abilities and performances, but let them first 
 be proved; lest they be lifted up with pride, and laid to sleep in 
 idleness. 

 2. It is a greater folly to be fond of being ourselves extravagantly 
 praised. A wise man rather counts it <I>a curse,</I> and a reflection 
 upon him, not only designed to pick his pocket, but which may really 
 turn to his prejudice. Modest praises (as a great man observes) invite 
 such as are present to add to the commendation, but immodest immoderate 
 praises tempt them to detract rather, and to censure one that they hear 
 over-commended. And, besides, over-praising a man makes him the object 
 of envy; every man puts in for a share of reputation, and therefore 
 reckons himself injured if another monopolize it or have more given him 
 than his share. And the greatest danger of all is that it is a 
 temptation to pride; men are apt to think of themselves above what is 
 meet when others speak of them above what is meet. See how careful 
 blessed Paul was not to be over-valued,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, as before, Solomon laments the case of him that has a peevish 
 passionate wife, that is continually chiding, and making herself and 
 all about her uneasy. 

 1. It is a grievance that there is no avoiding, for it is like <I>a
 continual dropping in a very rainy day.</I> The contentions of a 
 neighbour may be like a sharp shower, troublesome for the time, yet, 
 while it lasts, one may take shelter; but <I>the contentions of a 
 wife</I> are like a constant soaking rain, for which there is no remedy 
 but patience See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+19:13"><I>ch.</I> xix. 13</A>.

 2. It is a grievance that there is no concealing. A wise man would hide
 it if he could, for the sake both of his own and his wife's reputation, 
 but he cannot, any more than he can conceal the noise of the wind when 
 it blows or the smell of a strong perfume. Those that are froward and 
 brawling will proclaim their own shame, even when their friends, in 
 kindness to them, would cover it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of
 his friend.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This intimates both the pleasure and the advantage of conversation. One 
 man is nobody; nor will poring upon a book in a corner accomplish a man 
 as the reading and studying of men will. Wise and profitable discourse 
 sharpens men's wits; and those that have ever so much knowledge may by 
 conference have something added to them. It sharpens men's looks, and, 
 by cheering the spirits, puts a briskness and liveliness into the 
 countenance, and gives a man such an air as shows he is pleased himself 
 and makes him pleasing to those about him. Good men's graces are 
 sharpened by converse with those that are good, and bad men's lusts and 
 passions are sharpened by converse with those that are bad, as iron is 
 sharpened by its like, especially by the file. Men are filed, made 
 smooth, and bright, and fit for business (who were rough, and dull, and 
 inactive), by conversation. This is designed, 

 1. To recommend to us this expedient for sharpening ourselves, but with
 a caution to take heed whom we choose to converse with, because the 
 influence upon us is so great either for the better or for the worse. 
 
 2. To direct us what we must have in our eye in conversation, namely to 
 improve both others and ourselves, not to pass away time or banter one 
 another, but to <I>provoke one another to love and to good works</I> 
 and so to make one another wiser and better.</P>

 This is designed to encourage diligence, faithfulness, and constancy, 
 even in mean employments. Though the calling be laborious and 
 despicable, yet those who keep to it will find there is something to be 
 got by it. 

 1. Let not a poor gardener, who <I>keeps the fig-tree,</I> be
 discouraged; though it require constant care and attendance to nurse up 
 fig-trees, and, when they have grown to maturity, to keep them in good 
 order, and gather the figs in their season, yet he shall be paid for 
 his pains: He <I>shall eat the fruit</I> of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+9:7">1 Cor. ix. 7</A>.

 2. Nay, let not a poor servant think himself incapable of thriving and 
 being preferred; for if he be diligent in <I>waiting on his master,</I> 
 observant of him and obedient to him, if <I>he keep his master</I> (so 
 the word is), if he do all he can for the securing of his person and 
 reputation and take care that his estate be not wasted or damaged, such 
 a one <I>shall be honoured,</I> shall not only get a good word, but be 
 preferred and rewarded. God is a Master who has engaged to put an 
 honour on those that serve him faithfully,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This shows us that there is a way, 

 1. Of knowing ourselves. As the water is a looking-glass in which we
 may see our faces by reflection, so there are mirrors by which the 
 <I>heart of a man</I> is discovered to <I>a man,</I> that is, to 
 himself. Let a man examine his own conscience, his thoughts, 
 affections, and intentions. Let him behold his <I>natural face in the 
 glass</I> of the divine law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:23">Jam. i. 23</A>),

 and he may discern what kind of man he is and what is his true
 character, which it will be of great use to every man rightly to know.

 2. Of knowing one another by ourselves; for, as there is a similitude 
 between the face of a man and the reflection of it in the water, so 
 there is between one man's heart and another's for God has fashioned 
 men's hearts alike; and in many cases we may judge of others by 
 ourselves, which is one of the foundations on which that rule is built

 <I>Nihil est unum uni tam simile, tam par, quam omnes inter nosmet

 thing is so like another as man is to man. No person is so like himself 
 as each person is to all besides. Cic. de Legib. lib.</I>

 1. One corrupt heart is like another, and so is one sanctified heart,

 never satisfied.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things are here said to be insatiable, and they are two things near 
 of kin--death and sin. 

 1. Death is insatiable. The first death, the second death, both are so.
 The grave is not clogged with the multitude of dead bodies that are 
 daily thrown into it, but is still an <I>open sepulchre,</I> and cries, 
 <I>Give, give.</I> Hell also has enlarged itself, and still has room 
 for the damned spirits that are committed to that prison. <I>Tophet is 
 deep and large,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:33">Isa. xxx. 33</A>.

 2. Sin is insatiable: <I>The eyes of man are never satisfied,</I> nor 
 the appetites of the carnal mind towards profit or pleasure. The <I>eye 
 is not satisfied with seeing,</I> nor is he that <I>loves silver
 satisfied with silver.</I> Men labour for that which surfeits, but 
 satisfies not; nay, it is dissatisfying; but satisfies not; nay, it is 
 dissatisfying; such a perpetual uneasiness have men justly been doomed 
 to ever since our first parents were not satisfied with all the trees 
 of Eden, but they must meddle with the forbidden tree. Those whose
 eyes are ever toward the Lord in him are satisfied, and shall for ever 
 be so.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  <I>As</I> the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so
 <I>is</I> a man to his praise.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This gives us a touchstone by which we may try ourselves. Silver and 
 gold are tried by putting them into the furnace and fining-pot; so is 
 man tried by praising him. Let him be extolled and preferred, and then 
 he will show himself what he is. 

 1. If a man be made, by the applause that is given him, proud,
 conceited, and scornful,--if he take the glory to himself which he 
 should transmit to God, as Herod did,--if, the more he is praised, the 
 more careless he is of what he says and does,--if he <I>lie in bed till 
 noon</I> because <I>his name is up,</I> thereby it will appear that he 
 is a vain foolish man, and a man who, though he be praised, has nothing 
 in him truly praise-worthy. 

 2. If, on the contrary, a man is made by his praise more thankful to 
 God, more respectful to his friends, more watchful against every thing 
 that may blemish his reputation, more diligent to improve himself, and 
 do good to others, that he may answer the expectations of his friends 
 from him, by this it will appear that he is a wise and good man. He has 
 a good temper of mind who knows how to pass by evil report and good 
 report, and is still the same,

 with a pestle, <I>yet</I> will not his foolishness depart from him.

 Solomon had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:15"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 15</A>),

 <I>The foolishness</I> which <I>is bound in the heart of a child may be
 driven out by the rod of correction,</I> for then the mind is to be 
 moulded, the vicious habits not having taken root; but here he shows 
 that, if it be not done then, it will be next to impossible to do it 
 afterwards; if the disease be inveterate, there is a danger of its 
 being incurable. <I>Can the Ethiopian change his skin?</I> Observe, 

 1. Some are so bad that rough and severe methods must be used with
 them, after gentle means have been tried in vain; they must be 
 <I>brayed in a mortar.</I> God will take this way with them by his 
 judgments; the magistrates must take this way with them by the rigour 
 of the law. Force must be used with those that will not be ruled by
 reason, and love, and their own interest. 

 2. Some are so incorrigibly bad that even those rough and severe 
 methods do not answer the end, their <I>foolishness will not depart 
 from them,</I> so fully are their <I>hearts set in them to do evil;</I> 
 they are often under the rod and yet not humbled, in the furnace and 
 yet not refined, but, like Ahaz, trespass yet more

 and what remains then but that they should be rejected as reprobate

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, <I>and</I> look
 well to thy herds.
 &nbsp; 24  For riches <I>are</I> not for ever: and doth the crown <I>endure</I>
 to every generation?

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A command given us to be diligent in our callings. It is directed to 
 husbandmen and shepherds, and those that deal in cattle, but it is to 
 be extended to all other lawful callings; whatever our business is, 
 within doors or without, we must apply our minds to it. This command 
 intimates, 

 1. That we ought to have some business to do in this world and not to
 live in idleness. 

 2. We ought rightly and fully to understand our business, and know what 
 we have to do, and not meddle with that which we do not understand. 

 3. We ought to have an eye to it ourselves, and not turn over all the
 care of it to others. We should, with our own eyes, inspect the 
 <I>state of our flocks,</I> it is the master's eye that makes them fat. 
 
 4. We must be discreet and considerate in the management of our
 business, <I>know the state</I> of things, and <I>look well</I> to 
 them, that nothing may be lost, no opportunity let slip, but every 
 thing done in proper time and order, and so as to turn to the best 
 advantage. 

 5. We must be <I>diligent</I> and take pains; not only sit down and
 contrive, but be up and doing: "Set thy heart to thy herds, as one in 
 care; lay thy hands, lay thy bones, to thy business."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reasons to enforce this command. Consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The uncertainty of worldly wealth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Riches are not for ever.</I>

 (1.) Other riches are not so durable as these are: "<I>Look well to thy
 flocks and herds,</I> thy estate in the country and the stock upon 
 that, for these are staple commodities, which, in a succession, will be 
 for ever, whereas riches in trade and merchandise will not be so; the 
 <I>crown</I> itself may perhaps not be so sure to thy family as thy 
 flocks and herds." 

 (2.) Even these riches will go to decay if they be not well looked
 after. If a man had <I>an abbey</I> (as we say), and were slothful and 
 wasteful, he might make an end of it. Even the crown and the revenues 
 of it, if care be not taken, will suffer damage, nor will it 
 <I>continue to every generation</I> without very good management. 
 Though David had the crown entailed on his family, yet he <I>looked 
 well to his flocks,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+27:29,31">1 Chron. xxvii. 29, 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The bounty and liberality of nature, or rather of the God of nature, 
 and his providence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>The hay appears.</I> In taking care of the <I>flocks and herds,</I>

 (1.) "There needs no great labour, no ploughing or sowing; the food for
 them is the spontaneous product of the ground; thou hast nothing to do 
 but to turn them into it in the summer, <I>when the grass shows 
 itself,</I> and to <I>gather the herbs of the mountains</I> for them 
 against winter. God has done his part; thou art ungrateful to him, and 
 unjustly refusest to serve his providence, if thou dost not do thine." 
 
 (2.) "There is an opportunity to be observed and improved, a time when
 <I>the hay appears;</I> but, if thou let slip that time, thy flocks and 
 herds will fare the worse for it. As for ourselves, so for our cattle, 
 we ought, with the ant, to provide meat in summer."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The profit of good husbandry in a family: "Keep thy sheep, and thy 
 sheep will help to keep thee; thou shalt have food for thy children and 
 servants, <I>goats' milk enough</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 and <I>enough is as good as a feast.</I> Thou shalt have raiment
 likewise: the <I>lambs' wool shall be for thy clothing.</I> Thou shalt 
 have money to pay thy rent; the goats thou shalt have to sell shall be 
 <I>the price of thy field;</I>" nay, as some understand it, "<I>Thou 
 shalt become a purchaser,</I> and buy land to leave to thy children,"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>).
 
 Note,
 
 (1.) If we have food and raiment, and wherewithal to give every body
 his own, we have enough, and ought to be not only content, but 
 thankful. 

 (2.) Masters of families must provide not only for themselves, but for
 their families, and see that their servants have a fitting maintenance. 
 
 (3.) Plain food and plain clothing, if they be but competent, are all
 we should aim at. "Reckon thyself well done to if thou be clothed with 
 home-spun cloth with the fleece of thy own lambs, and fed with goats' 
 milk; let that serve for thy food which serves for the <I>food of thy 
 household and the maintenance of thy maidens.</I> Be not desirous of 
 dainties, <I>far-fetched and dear-bought.</I>" 

 (4.) This should encourage us to be careful and industrious about our
 business, that that will bring in a sufficient maintenance for our
 families; we shall <I>eat the labour of our hands.</I></P>
