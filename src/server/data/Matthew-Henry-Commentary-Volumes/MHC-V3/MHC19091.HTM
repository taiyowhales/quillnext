 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some of the ancients were of opinion that Moses was the penman, not 
 only of the foregoing psalm, which is expressly said to be his, but 
 also of the eight that next follow it; but that cannot be, for 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:1-11">Ps. xcv.</A>
 
 is expressly said to be penned by David, and long after Moses, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:7">Heb. iv. 7</A>.

 It is probable that this psalm also was penned by David; it is a writ
 of protection for all true believers, not in the name of king David, or 
 under his broad seal; he needed it himself, especially if the psalm was 
 penned, as some conjecture it was, at the time of the pestilence which 
 was sent for his numbering the people; but in the name of the King of 
 kings, and under the broad seal of Heaven. Observe, 

 I. The psalmist's own resolution to take God for his keeper
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:2">ver. 2</A>),

 from which he gives both direction and encouragement to others,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:9">ver. 9</A>.
 
 II. The promises which are here made, in God's name, to all those that
 do so in sincerity. 

 1. They shall be taken under the peculiar care of Heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:1,4">ver. 1, 4</A>.

 2. They shall be delivered from the malice of the powers of darkness
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:3,5,6">ver. 3, 5, 6</A>),

 and that by a distinguishing preservation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.

 3. They shall be the charge of the holy angels,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:10-12">ver. 10-12</A>.

 4. They shall triumph over their enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:13">ver. 13</A>.

 5. They shall be the special favourites of God himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:14-16">ver. 14-16</A>.

 In singing this we must shelter ourselves under, and then solace 
 ourselves in, the divine protection. Many think that to Christ, as
 Mediator, these promises do primarily belong

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:2">Isa. xlix. 2</A>),

 not because to him the devil applied one of these promises 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:6">Matt. iv. 6</A>),
 
 but because to him they are very applicable, and, coming through him, 
 they are more sweet and sure to all believers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall
 abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
 &nbsp; 2  I will say of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>He is</I> my refuge and my fortress: my
 God; in him will I trust.
 &nbsp; 3  Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,
 <I>and</I> from the noisome pestilence.
 &nbsp; 4  He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings
 shalt thou trust: his truth <I>shall be thy</I> shield and buckler.
 &nbsp; 5  Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; <I>nor</I> for
 the arrow <I>that</I> flieth by day;
 &nbsp; 6  <I>Nor</I> for the pestilence <I>that</I> walketh in darkness; <I>nor</I>
 for the destruction <I>that</I> wasteth at noonday.
 &nbsp; 7  A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
 right hand; <I>but</I> it shall not come nigh thee.
 &nbsp; 8  Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of
 the wicked.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A great truth laid down in general, That all those who live a life 
 of communion with God are constantly safe under his protection, and may 
 therefore preserve a holy serenity and security of mind at all times 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>He that dwells,</I> that sits down, <I>in the secret place of the
 Most High, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty;</I> he that by 
 faith chooses God for his guardian shall find all that in him which he 
 needs or can desire. Note,

 1. It is the character of a true believer that he <I>dwells in the
 secret place of the Most High;</I> he is at home in God, returns to 
 God, and reposes in him as his rest; he acquaints himself with inward 
 religion, and makes heart-work of the service of God, worships within 
 the veil, and loves to be alone with God, to converse with him in 
 solitude. 

 2. It is the privilege and comfort of those that do so that they 
 <I>abide under the shadow of the Almighty;</I> he shelters them, and 
 comes between them and every thing that would annoy them, whether storm 
 or sunshine. They shall not only have an admittance, but a residence, 
 under God's protection; he will be their rest and refuge for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The psalmist's comfortable application of this to himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 <I>I will say of the Lord,</I> whatever others say of him, "<I>He is my
 refuge;</I> I choose him as such, and confide in him. Others make idols 
 their refuge, but I will say of Jehovah, the true and living God, He is 
 <I>my refuge:</I> any other is a <I>refuge of lies.</I> He is a refuge 
 that will not fail me; for he is <I>my fortress and strong-hold.</I>" 
 Idolaters called their idols <I>Mahuzzim,</I> their <I>most 
 strong-hold</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:39">Dan. xi. 39</A>),

 but therein they deceived themselves; those only secure themselves that
 make the Lord their God, their fortress. There being no reason to 
 question his sufficiency, fitly does it follow, <I>In him will I 
 trust.</I> If Jehovah be our God, our refuge, and our fortress, what 
 can we desire which we may not be sure to find in him? He is neither 
 fickle nor false, neither weak nor mortal; he is God and not man, and 
 therefore there is no danger of being disappointed in him. <I>We know 
 whom we have trusted.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The great encouragement he gives to others to do likewise, not 
 only from his own experience of the comfort of it (for in that there 
 might possibly be a fallacy), but from the truth of God's promise, in 
 which there neither is nor can be any deceit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>,

 &c.): <I>Surely he shall deliver thee.</I> Those who have themselves
 found the comfort of making God their refuge cannot but desire that 
 others may do so. Now here it is promised,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That believers shall be kept from those mischiefs which they are in 
 imminent danger of, and which would be fatal to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>from the snare of the fowler,</I> which is laid unseen and catches
 the unwary prey on a sudden, and <I>from the noisome pestilence,</I> 
 which seizes men unawares and against which there is no guard. This 
 promise protects,

 (1.) The natural life, and is often fulfilled in our preservation from 
 those dangers which are very threatening and very near, while yet we 
 ourselves are not apprehensive of them, any more than the bird is of 
 <I>the snare of the fowler.</I> We owe it, more than we are sensible, 
 to the care of the divine Providence that we have been kept from 
 infectious diseases and out of the hands of the wicked and 
 unreasonable. 

 (2.) The spiritual life, which is protected by divine grace from the 
 temptations of Satan, which are as the <I>snares of the fowler,</I> and 
 from the contagion of sin, which is the <I>noisome pestilence.</I> He 
 that has given grace to be the glory of the soul will create a defence 
 upon all that glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That God himself will be their protector; those must needs be safe 
 who have him for their keeper, and successful for whom he undertakes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 
 <I>He shall cover thee,</I> shall keep thee <I>secret</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:20">Ps. xxxi. 20</A>),

 and so keep thee safe,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:5">Ps. xxvii. 5</A>.

 God protects believers, 

 (1.) With the greatest tenderness and affection, which is intimated in
 that, <I>He shall cover thee with his feathers, under his wings,</I>
 which alludes to the hen <I>gathering her chickens under wings,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37">Matt. xxiii. 37</A>.

 By natural instinct she not only protects them, but calls them under
 that protection when she sees them in danger, not only keeps them safe, 
 but cherishes them and keeps them warm. To this the great God is 
 pleased to compare his care of his people, who are helpless as the 
 chickens, and easily made a prey of, but are invited to trust under the 
 shadow of the wings of the divine promise and providence, which is the 
 periphrasis of a proselyte to the true religion, that he has come to 
 <I>trust under the wings of the God of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:12">Ruth ii. 12</A>.

 (2.) With the greatest power and efficacy. Wings and feathers, though
 spread with the greatest tenderness, are yet weak, and easily broken 
 through, and therefore it is added, <I>His truth shall be thy shield 
 and buckler,</I> a strong defence. God is willing to guard his people 
 as the hen is to guard the chickens, and as able as a man of war in 
 armour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he will not only keep them from evil, but from the fear of 
 evil, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.
 
 Here is,

 (1.) Great danger supposed; the mention of it is enough to frighten us; 
 night and day we lie exposed, and those that are apt to be timorous 
 will in neither period think themselves safe. When we are retired into
 our chambers, our beds, and have made all as safe as we can about us, 
 yet there is terror by night, from thieves and robbers, winds and 
 storms, besides those things that are the creatures of fancy and 
 imagination, which are often most frightful of all. We read of <I>fear 
 in the night,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:8">Cant. iii. 8</A>.

 There is also a <I>pestilence that walketh in darkness,</I> as that was
 which slew the first-born of the Egyptians, and the army of the 
 Assyrians. No locks nor bars can shut out diseases, while we carry 
 about with us in our bodies the seeds of them. But surely in the 
 day-time, when we can look about us, we are not so much in danger; yes, 
 there is an <I>arrow that flieth by day</I> too, and yet flies unseen; 
 there is a destruction that wasteth at high-noon, when we are awake and 
 have all our friends about us; even then we cannot secure ourselves, 
 nor can they secure us. It was in the day-time that that pestilence
 wasted which was sent to chastise David for numbering the people, on 
 occasion of which some think this psalm was penned. But,

 (2.) Here is great security promised to believers in the midst of this 
 danger: "<I>Thou shalt not be afraid.</I> God by his grace will keep 
 thee from disquieting distrustful fear (that fear which hath torment) 
 in the midst of the greatest dangers. Wisdom shall keep thee from being 
 causelessly afraid, and faith shall keep thee from being inordinately 
 afraid. Thou shalt not be afraid of the arrow, as knowing that though 
 it may hit thee it cannot hurt thee; if it take away the natural life, 
 yet it shall be so far from doing any prejudice to the spiritual life 
 that it shall be its perfection." A believer <I>needs not</I> fear, and 
 therefore <I>should not</I> fear, any arrow, because the point is off, 
 the poison is out. <I>O death! where is thy sting?</I> It is also
 under divine direction, and will hit where God appoints and not 
 otherwise. Every bullet has its commission. Whatever is done our 
 heavenly Father's will is done; and we have no reason to be afraid of 
 that.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That they shall be preserved in common calamities, in a 
 distinguishing way 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "When death rides in triumph, and diseases rage, so that <I>thousands
 and ten thousands</I> fall, fall by sickness, or fall by the sword in 
 battle, <I>fall at thy side, at thy right hand,</I> and the sight of 
 their fall is enough to frighten thee, and if they fall by the 
 pestilence their falling so near thee may be likely to infect thee, 
 <I>yet it shall not come nigh thee,</I> the death shall not, the fear 
 of death shall not." Those that preserve their purity in times of 
 general corruption may trust God with their safety in times of general 
 desolation. When multitudes die round about us, though thereby we must 
 be awakened to prepare for our own death, yet we must not be <I>afraid 
 with any amazement,</I> nor make ourselves subject to bondage, as many 
 do all their life-time, <I>through fear of death,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:15">Heb. ii. 15</A>.

 The sprinkling of blood secured the first-born of Israel when thousands
 fell. Nay, it is promised to God's people that they shall have the 
 satisfaction of seeing, not only God's promises fulfilled to them, but 
 his threatenings fulfilled upon those that hate them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Only with thy eyes shalt thou behold and see the just reward of the
 wicked,</I> which perhaps refers to the destruction of the first-born 
 of Egypt by the pestilence, which was both the punishment of the 
 oppressors and the enlargement of the oppressed; this Israel saw when 
 they saw themselves unhurt, untouched. As it will aggravate the 
 damnation of sinners that with their eyes they shall behold and see the 
 reward of the righteous

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:28">Luke xiii. 28</A>),

 so it will magnify the salvation of the saints that with their eyes
 they shall behold and see the destruction of the wicked,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:24,Ps+58:10">Isa. lxvi. 24; Ps. lviii. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are more promises to the same purport with those in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:1-8">foregoing verses</A>,

 and they are exceedingly great and precious, and sure to all the
 seed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The psalmist assures believers of divine protection, from his own 
 experience; and that which he says is the word of God, and what we may 
 rely upon. Observe, 

 1. The character of those who shall have the benefit and comfort of
 these promises; it is much the same with that,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They are such as make <I>the Most High their habitation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 as are continually with God and rest in him, as make his name both
 their temple and their strong tower, as dwell in love and so dwell in 
 God. It is our duty to be at home in God, to make our choice of him, 
 and then to live our life in him as our habitation, to converse with 
 him, and delight in him, and depend upon him; and then it shall be our 
 privilege to be at home in God; we shall be welcome to him as a man to 
 his own habitation, without any let, hindrance, or molestation, from 
 the arrests of the law or the clamours of conscience; then too we shall 
 be safe in him, shall be kept in <I>perfect peace,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:3">Isa. xxvi. 3</A>.

 To encourage us to make the Lord our habitation, and to hope for safety 
 and satisfaction in him, the psalmist intimates the comfort he had had 
 in doing so: "He whom thou makest thy <I>habitation is my refuge;</I> 
 and I have found him firm and faithful, and in him there is room 
 enough, and shelter enough, both for thee and me." <I>In my father's 
 house</I> there <I>are many mansions,</I> one needs not crowd another, 
 much less crowd out another. 

 2. The promises that are sure to all those who have thus made <I>the 
 Most High</I> their <I>habitation.</I>

 (1.) That, whatever happens to them, nothing shall hurt them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 "<I>There shall no evil befal thee;</I> though trouble or affliction
 befal thee, yet there shall be no real evil in it, for it shall come 
 from the love of God and shall be sanctified; it shall come, not for 
 thy hurt, but for thy good; and though, for <I>the present, it be not 
 joyous but grievous,</I> yet, in the end, it shall yield so well that 
 thou thyself shalt own <I>no evil befel thee.</I> It is not an evil, an 
 only evil, but there is a mixture of good in it and a product of good 
 by it. Nay, not thy person only, but thy dwelling, shall be taken under 
 the divine protection: <I>There shall no plague come nigh</I> that, 
 nothing to do thee or thine any damage." <I>Nihil accidere bono viro 
 mali potest--No evil can befal a good man.</I> Seneca <I>De 
 Providentia.</I> 

 (2.) That the angels of light shall be serviceable to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.
 
 This is a precious promise, and speaks a great deal both of honour and
 comfort to the saints, nor is it ever the worse for being quoted and 
 abused by the devil in tempting Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:6">Matt. iv. 6</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 [1.] The charge given to the angels concerning the saints. He who is
 the Lord of the angels, who gave them their being and gives laws to 
 them, whose they are and whom they were made to serve, <I>he shall give 
 his angels a charge over thee,</I> not only over the church in general, 
 but over every particular believer. The angels <I>keep the charge of 
 the Lord their God;</I> and this is the charge they receive from him. 
 It denotes the great care God takes of the saints, in that the angels 
 themselves shall be charged with them, and employed for them. The 
 charge is <I>to keep thee in all thy ways;</I> here is a limitation of 
 the promise: They <I>shall keep thee in thy ways,</I> that is, "as long 
 as thou keepest in the way of thy duty;" those that go out of that way 
 put themselves out of God's protection. This word the devil left out 
 when he quoted the promise to enforce a temptation, knowing how much it 
 made against him. But observe the extent of the promise; it is <I>to 
 keep thee in all thy ways:</I> even where there is no apparent danger 
 yet we need it, and where there is the most imminent danger we shall 
 have it. Wherever the saints go the angels are charged with them, as 
 the servants are with the children. 

 [2.] The care which the angels take of the saints, pursuant to this 
 charge: <I>They shall bear thee up in their hands,</I> which denotes 
 both their great ability and their great affection. They are able to 
 bear up the saints out of the reach of danger, and they do it with all 
 the tenderness and affection wherewith the nurse carries the little 
 child about in her arms; it speaks us helpless and them helpful. They 
 are condescending in their ministrations; they keep the feet of the 
 saints, lest they <I>dash them against a stone,</I> lest they stumble 
 and fall into sin and into trouble. 

 [3.] That the powers of darkness shall be triumphed over by them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder.</I> The devil is called
 <I>a roaring lion, the old serpent, the red dragon;</I> so that to this 
 promise the apostle seems to refer in that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+16:20">Rom. xvi. 20</A>),

 <I>The God of peace shall tread Satan under your feet.</I> Christ has
 broken the serpent's head, spoiled our spiritual enemies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col. ii. 15</A>),

 and through him <I>we are more than conquerors;</I> for Christ calls
 us, as Joshua called the captains of Israel, to come and set our feet 
 on the necks of vanquished enemies. Some think that this promise had
 its full accomplishment in Christ, and the miraculous power which he 
 had over the whole creation, healing the sick, casting out devils, and 
 particularly putting it into his disciples' commission that they should 
 <I>take up serpents,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:18">Mark xvi. 18</A>.

 It may be applied to that care of the divine Providence by which we are
 preserved from ravenous noxious creatures (<I>the wild beasts of the
 field shall be at peace with thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:23">Job v. 23</A>);

 nay, and have ways and means of taming them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:7">Jam. iii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He brings in God himself speaking words of comfort to the saints, 
 and declaring the mercy he had in store for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:14-16"><I>v.</I> 14-16</A>.

 Some make this to be spoken to the angels as the reason of the charge
 given them concerning the saints, as if he had said, "Take care of 
 them, for they are dear to me, and I have a tender concern for them." 
 And now, as before, we must observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To whom these promises do belong; they are described by three 
 characters:--

 (1.) They are such as know God's name. His nature we cannot fully know; 
 but by his name he has made himself known, and with that we must 
 acquaint ourselves. 

 (2.) They are such as have set their love upon him; and those who 
 rightly know him will love him, will place their love upon him as the 
 only adequate object of it, will let out their love towards him with 
 pleasure and enlargement, and will fix their love upon him with a 
 resolution never to remove it to any rival. 

 (3.) They are such as call upon him, as by prayer keep up a constant 
 correspondence with him, and in every difficult case refer themselves 
 to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the promises are which God makes to the saints. 

 (1.) That he will, in due time, deliver them out of trouble: <I>I will
 deliver him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>
 
 and again

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 denoting a double deliverance, living and dying, a deliverance in
 trouble and a deliverance out of trouble. If God proportions the
 degree and continuance of our troubles to our strength, if he keeps us 
 from offending him in our troubles, and makes our death our discharge, 
 at length, from all our troubles, then this promise is fulfilled. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:19,2Ti+3:11,4:18">Ps. xxxiv. 19; 
 2 Tim. iii. 11; iv. 18</A>.

 (2.) That he will, in the mean time, <I>be with them in trouble,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 If he does not immediately put a period to their afflictions, yet they
 shall have his gracious presence with them in their troubles; he will 
 take notice of their sorrows, and <I>know their souls in adversity,</I> 
 will visit them graciously by his word and Spirit, and converse with 
 them, will take their part, will support and comfort them, and sanctify 
 their afflictions to them, which will be the surest token of his 
 presence with them in their troubles.

 (3.) That herein he will answer their prayers: <I>He shall call upon 
 me;</I> I will pour upon him the spirit of prayer, <I>and</I> then <I>I 
 will answer,</I> answer by promises

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:8">Ps. lxxxv. 8</A>),

 answer by providences, bringing in seasonable relief, and answer by
 graces, <I>strengthening them with strength in their souls</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+138:3">Ps. cxxxviii. 3</A>);

 thus he answered Paul with <I>grace sufficient,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:9">2 Cor. xii. 9</A>.

 (4.) That he will exalt and dignify them: <I>I will set him on
 high,</I> out of the reach of trouble, above the stormy region, on a
 rock <I>above the waves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:16">Isa. xxxiii. 16</A>.

 They shall be enabled, by the grace of God, to look down upon the
 things of this world with a holy contempt and indifference, to look up
 to the things of the other world with a holy ambition and concern; and 
 then they are set on high. <I>I will honour him;</I> those are truly 
 honourable whom God puts honour upon by taking them into covenant and 
 communion with himself and designing them for his kingdom and glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:26">John xii. 26</A>.

 (5.) That they shall have a sufficiency of life in this world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):
 
 <I>With length of days will I satisfy him;</I> that is,

 [1.] They shall live long enough: they shall be continued in this world 
 till they have done the work they were sent into this world for and are 
 ready for heaven, and that is long enough. Who would wish to live a day 
 longer than God has some work to do, either by him or upon him? 

 [2.] They shall think it long enough; for God by his grace shall wean 
 them from the world and make them willing to leave it. A man may die 
 young, and yet die full of days, <I>satur dierum--satisfied with 
 living.</I> A wicked worldly man is not satisfied, no, not with long 
 life; he still cries, <I>Give, give.</I> But he that has his treasure 
 and heart in another world has soon enough of this; he would not live 
 always. 

 (6.) That they shall have an eternal life in the other world. This
 crowns the blessedness: <I>I will show him my salvation,</I> show him 
 <I>the Messiah</I> (so some); good old Simeon was then satisfied with 
 long life when he could say, <I>My eyes have seen thy salvation,</I> 
 nor was there any greater joy to the Old-Testament saints than to see 
 Christ's day, though at a distance. It is more probably that the word 
 refers to the better country, that is, the heavenly, which the 
 patriarchs desired and sought: he <I>will show him</I> that, bring him 
 to that blessed state, the felicity of which consists so much in seeing 
 that face to face which we here see through a glass darkly; and, in the 
 mean time, he will give him a prospect of it. All these promises, some 
 think, point primarily at Christ, and had their accomplishment in his 
 resurrection and exaltation.</P>
