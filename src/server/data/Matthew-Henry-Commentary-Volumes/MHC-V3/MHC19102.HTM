 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some think that David penned this psalm at the time of Absalom's
 rebellion; others that Daniel, Nehemiah, or some other prophet, penned
 it for the use of the church, when it was in captivity in Babylon,
 because it seems to speak of the ruin of Zion and of a time set for the
 rebuilding of it, which Daniel understood by books,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:2">Dan. ix. 2</A>.

 Or perhaps the psalmist was himself in great affliction, which he
 complains of in the beginning of the psalm, but (as in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:1-20">
 Ps. lxxvii.</A>

 and elsewhere) he comforts himself under it with the consideration of
 God's eternity, and the church's prosperity and perpetuity, how much
 soever it was now distressed and threatened. But it is clear, from the
 application of
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:25,26">ver. 25, 26</A>,
 
 to Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:10-12">Heb. i. 10-12</A>),

 that the psalm has reference to the days of the Messiah, and speaks 
 either of his affliction or of the afflictions of his church for his 
 sake. In the psalm we have,

 I. A sorrowful complaint which the psalmist makes, either for himself
 or in the name of the church, of great afflictions, which were very 
 pressing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. Seasonable comfort fetched in against these grievances, 

 1. From the eternity of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:12,24,27">ver. 12, 24, 27</A>.

 2. From a believing prospect of the deliverance which God would, in due
 time, work for his afflicted church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:13-22">ver. 13-22</A>)

 and the continuance of it in the world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:28">ver. 28</A>.

 In singing this psalm, if we have not occasion to make the same 
 complaints, yet we may take occasion to sympathize with those that 
 have, and then the comfortable part of this psalm will be the more 
 comfortable to us in the singing of it.</P>

 <P>A prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, 
 <BR>and poureth out his complaint before the Lord. </P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Hear my prayer, O
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and let my cry come unto thee.
 &nbsp; 2  Hide not thy face from me in the day <I>when</I> I am in trouble;
 incline thine ear unto me: in the day <I>when</I> I call answer me
 speedily.
 &nbsp; 3  For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned
 as a hearth.
 &nbsp; 4  My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I
 forget to eat my bread.
 &nbsp; 5  By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my
 skin.
 &nbsp; 6  I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of
 the desert.
 &nbsp; 7  I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
 &nbsp; 8  Mine enemies reproach me all the day; <I>and</I> they that are mad
 against me are sworn against me.
 &nbsp; 9  For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
 weeping,
 &nbsp; 10  Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast
 lifted me up, and cast me down.
 &nbsp; 11  My days <I>are</I> like a shadow that declineth; and I am
 withered like grass.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The title of this psalm is very observable; it is <I>a prayer of the 
 afflicted.</I> It was composed by one that was himself afflicted, 
 afflicted with the church and for it; and on those that are of a public 
 spirit afflictions of that kind lie heavier than any other. It is 
 calculated for an afflicted state, and is intended for the use of 
 others that may be in the like distress; for <I>whatsoever things were 
 written aforetime were written</I> designedly <I>for our use.</I> The 
 whole word of God is of use to direct us in prayer; but here, as often 
 elsewhere, the Holy Ghost has drawn up our petition for us, has put 
 words into our mouths. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:2">
 Hos. xiv. 2</A>, 

 <I>Take with you words.</I> Here is a prayer put into the hands of the
 afflicted: let them set, not their hands, but their hearts to it, and 
 present it to God. Note,

 1. It is often the lot of the best saints in this world to be sorely
 affected.  

 2. Even good men may be almost overwhelmed with their afflictions, and 
 may be ready to faint under them. 

 3. When our state is afflicted, and our spirits are overwhelmed, it is
 our duty and interest to pray, and by prayer to <I>pour out our 
 complaints before the Lord,</I> which intimates the leave God gives us 
 to be free with him and the liberty of speech we have before him, as 
 well as liberty of access to him; it intimates also what an ease it is 
 to an afflicted spirit to unburden itself by a humble representation of 
 its grievances and griefs. Such a representation we have here, in 
 which,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The psalmist humbly begs of God to take notice of his affliction, 
 and of his prayer in his affliction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 When we pray in our affliction,

 1. It should be our care that God would graciously hear us; for, if our
 prayers be not pleasing to God, they will be to no purpose to 
 ourselves. Let this therefore be in our eye that our prayer may <I>come 
 unto God,</I> even <I>to his ears</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:6">Ps. xviii. 6</A>);

 and, in order to that, let us <I>lift up the prayer,</I> and our souls
 with it. 

 2. It may be our hope that God will graciously hear us, because he has 
 appointed us to seek him and has promised we shall not seek him in 
 vain. If we put up a <I>prayer in faith,</I> we may in faith say, 
 <I>Hear my prayer, O Lord!</I> "Hear me," that is,

 (1.) "Manifest thyself to me, <I>hide not thy face from me</I> in 
 displeasure, <I>when I am in trouble.</I> If thou dost not quickly free 
 me, yet let me know that thou favourest me; if I see not the operations 
 of thy hand for me, yet let me see the smiles of thy face upon me." 
 God's hiding his face is trouble enough to a good man even in his 
 prosperity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:7">Ps. xxx. 7</A>,

 <I>Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled</I>); but if, when we 
 are in trouble, God hides his face, the case is sad indeed. 

 (2.) "Manifest thyself for me; not only hear me, but answer me; grant 
 me the deliverance I am in want of and in pursuit of; answer me 
 speedily, even <I>in the day when I call.</I>" When troubles press hard 
 upon us, God gives us leave to be thus pressing in prayer, yet with 
 humility and patience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He makes a lamentable complaint of the low condition to which he 
 was reduced by his afflictions. 

 1. His body was macerated and emaciated, and he had become a perfect
 skeleton, nothing but skin and bones. As prosperity and joy are 
 represented by <I>making fat the bones,</I> and the <I>bones 
 flourishing like a herb,</I> so great trouble and grief are here 
 represented by the contrary: <I>My bones are burnt as a hearth</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:3"><I>v.</I>  3</A>);
 
 they <I>cleave to my skin</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 nay, <I>my heart is smitten, and withered like grass</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 it touches the vitals, and there is a sensible decay there. <I>I am
 withered like grass</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 scorched with the burning heat of my troubles. If we be thus brought
 low by bodily distempers, let us not think it strange; the body is like 
 grass, weak and of the earth, no wonder then that it withers. 

 2. He was very melancholy and of a sorrowful spirit. He was so taken up 
 with the thoughts of his troubles that he <I>forgot to eat his 
 bread</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 he had no appetite to his necessary food nor could he relish it. When
 God hides his face from a soul the delights of sense will be sapless 
 things. He was always <I>sighing</I> and <I>groaning,</I> as one 
 pressed above measure

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:5"><I>v.</I>  5</A>),

 and this wasted him and exhausted his spirits. He affected solitude, as
 melancholy people do. His friends deserted him and were shy of him, and 
 he cared as little for their company

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>):

 "<I>I am like a pelican of the wilderness,</I> or a <I>bittern</I> (so
 some) that make a doleful noise; <I>I am like an owl,</I> that affects 
 to lodge in deserted ruined buildings; <I>I watch, and am as a sparrow 
 upon the house-top.</I> I live in a garret, and there spend my hours in 
 poring on my troubles and bemoaning myself." Those who do thus, when 
 they are in sorrow, humour themselves indeed; but they prejudice 
 themselves, and know not what they do, nor what advantage they hereby 
 give to the tempter. In affliction we should sit alone to consider our 
 ways

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:28">Lam. iii. 28</A>),
 
 but not sit alone to indulge an inordinate grief.

 3.  He was evil-spoken of by his enemies, and all manner of evil was
 said against him. When his friends went off from him his foes set 
 themselves against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>My enemies reproach me all the day,</I> designing thereby both to
 create vexation to him (for an ingenuous mind regrets reproach) and to 
 bring an odium upon him before men. When they could not otherwise reach 
 him they shot these arrows at him, even <I>bitter words.</I> In this 
 they were unwearied; they did it <I>all the day;</I> it was a continual 
 dropping.  His enemies were very outrageous: <I>They</I> are <I>mad 
 against me,</I> and very obstinate and implacable. <I>They</I> are 
 <I>sworn against me;</I> as the Jews that bound themselves with an oath 
 that they would kill Paul; or, <I>They have sworn against me</I> as 
 accusers, to take away my life.

 4.  He fasted and wept under the tokens of God's displeasure 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>):

 "<I>I have eaten ashes like bread;</I> instead of eating my bread, I
 have lain down in dust and ashes, and <I>I have mingled my drink with 
 weeping;</I> when I should have refreshed myself with drinking I have 
 only eased myself with weeping." And what is the matter? He tells us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Because of thy wrath.</I> It was not so much the trouble itself that
 troubled him as the wrath of God which he was under the apprehensions 
 of as the cause of the trouble. This, this was the <I>wormwood and the 
 gall</I> in the affliction and the misery: <I>Thou hast lifted me up 
 and cast me down,</I> as that which we cast to the ground with a design 
 to dash it to pieces; we lift up first, that we may throw it down with 
 the more violence; or, "Thou hast formerly lifted me up in honour, and 
 joy, and uncommon prosperity; but the remembrance of that aggravates 
 the present grief and makes it the more grievous." We must eye the hand 
 of God both in lifting us up and casting us down, and say, "Blessed be 
 the name of the Lord, who both gives and takes away."

 5. He looked upon himself as a dying man: <I>My days are consumed like
 smoke</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 which vanishes away quickly.  Or, They are consumed <I>in smoke,</I> of
 which nothing remains; they are <I>like a shadow that declines</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 like the evening-shadow, or a forerunner of approaching night. Now all
 this, though it seems to speak the psalmist's personal calamities, and 
 therefore is properly a prayer for a particular person afflicted, yet 
 is supposed to be a description of the afflictions of the church of 
 God, with which the psalmist sympathizes, making public grievances his 
 own. The mystical body of Christ is sometimes, like the psalmist's body 
 here, <I>withered</I> and <I>parched,</I> nay, like <I>dead and dry 
 bones.</I> The church sometimes is forced <I>into the wilderness,</I> 
 seems lost, and gives up herself for gone, under the tokens of God's 
 displeasure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  But thou, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance
 unto all generations.
 &nbsp; 13  Thou shalt arise, <I>and</I> have mercy upon Zion: for the time
 to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.
 &nbsp; 14  For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the
 dust thereof.
 &nbsp; 15  So the heathen shall fear the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and all the
 kings of the earth thy glory.
 &nbsp; 16  When the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his
 glory.

 their prayer.

 &nbsp; 19  For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary;
 from heaven did the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> behold the earth;
 &nbsp; 20  To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that
 are appointed to death;
 &nbsp; 21  To declare the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in Zion, and his praise in
 Jerusalem;
 &nbsp; 22  When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to
 serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Many exceedingly great and precious comforts are here thought of, and 
 mustered up, to balance the foregoing complaints; for <I>unto the 
 upright there arises light in the darkness,</I> so that, though they 
 are cast down, they are not in despair. It is bad with the psalmist 
 himself, bad with the people of God; but he has many considerations to 
 revive himself with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are dying creatures, and our interests and comforts are dying, 
 but God is an everliving everlasting God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>My days are like a shadow;</I> there is no remedy; night is coming
 upon me; but, <I>thou, O Lord! shalt endure for ever.</I> Our life is 
 transient, but thine is permanent; our friends die, but thou our God 
 diest not; what threatened us cannot touch thee; our names will be 
 written in the dust and buried in oblivion, but <I>thy remembrance 
 shall be unto all generations;</I> to the end of time, nay, to 
 eternity, thou shalt be known and honoured." A good man loves God 
 better than himself, and therefore can balance his own sorrow and death 
 with the pleasing thought of the unchangeable blessedness of the 
 Eternal Mind. God <I>endures forever,</I> his church's faithful patron 
 and protector; and, his honour and perpetual remembrance being very 
 much bound up in her interests, we may be confident that they shall not 
 be neglected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Poor Zion is now in distress, but there will come a time for her 
 relief and succour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion.</I> The hope of
 deliverance is built upon the goodness of God--"Thou wilt <I>have mercy 
 upon Zion,</I> for she has become an object of thy pity;" and upon the 
 power of God--"Thou shalt arise and have mercy, shalt stir up thyself 
 to do it, shalt do it in contempt of all the opposition made by the 
 church's enemies." <I>The zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this.</I> 
 That which is very encouraging is that there is a time set for the 
 deliverance of the church, which not only will come some time, but will 
 come at the time appointed, the time which Infinite Wisdom has 
 appointed (and therefore it is the best time) and which Eternal Truth 
 has fixed it to, and therefore it is a certain time, and shall not be 
 forgotten nor further adjourned. At the end of seventy years, the time 
 to favour Zion, by delivering her from the daughter of Babylon, was to 
 come, and at length it did come. Zion was now in ruins, that is, the 
 temple that was built in the city of David: the favouring of Zion is 
 the building of the temple up again, as it is explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 This is expected from the favour of God; that will set all to rights,
 and nothing but that, and therefore Daniel prays

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:17">Dan. ix. 17</A>),

 <I>Cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary, which is desolate.</I> 
 The building up of Zion is as great a favour to any people as they can 
 desire. No blessing more desirable to a ruined state than the restoring 
 and re-establishing of their church-privileges. Now this is here wished 
 for and longed for, 

 1. Because it would be a great rejoicing to Zion's friends 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):
 
 <I>Thy servants take pleasure</I> even in <I>the stones</I> of the
 temple, though they were thrown down and scattered, and <I>favour the 
 dust,</I> the very rubbish and ruins of it. Observe here, When the 
 temple was ruined, yet the stones of it were to be had for a new 
 building, and there were those who encouraged themselves with that, for 
 they had a favour even for the dust of it.  Those who truly love the 
 church of God love it when it is in affliction as well as when it is in 
 prosperity; and it is a good ground to hope that God will favour the 
 ruins of Zion when he puts it into the heart of his people to favour 
 them, and to show that they do so by their prayers and by their 
 endeavours; as it is also a good plea with God for mercy for Zion that 
 there are those who are so affectionately concerned for her, and are 
 <I>waiting for the salvation of the Lord.</I> 

 2.  Because it would have a good influence upon Zion's neighbours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 It will be a happy means perhaps of their conversion, at least of their
 conviction; for <I>so the heathen shall fear the name of the Lord,</I> 
 shall have high thoughts of him and his people, and even the kings of 
 the earth shall be affected with his glory. They shall have better 
 thoughts of the church of God than they have had, when God by his 
 providence thus puts an honour upon it; they shall be afraid of doing 
 any thing against it when they see God taking its part; nay, they shall 
 say, We will go with you, for we have <I>seen that God is with you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23">Zech. viii. 23</A>.
 
 Thus it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+8:17">Esth. viii. 17</A>)

 that <I>many of the people of the land became Jews, for the fear of the
 Jews fell upon them.</I> 

 3.  Because it would redound to the honour of Zion's God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):
 
 <I>When the Lord shall build up Zion.</I> They take it for granted it
 will be done, for God himself has undertaken it, and <I>he shall then 
 appear in his glory;</I> and for that reason all that have made his 
 glory their highest end desire it and pray for it. Note, The edifying 
 of the church will be the glorifying of God, and therefore we may be 
 assured it will be done in the set time. Those that pray in faith, 
 <I>Father, glorify thy name,</I> may receive the same answer to that 
 prayer which was given to Christ himself by a voice from heaven, <I>I 
 have both glorified it and I will glorify it yet again,</I> though now 
 for a time it may be eclipsed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The prayers of God's people now seem to be slighted and no notice 
 taken of them, but they will be reviewed and greatly encouraged 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:17"><I>v.</I>  17</A>):

 <I>He will regard the prayer of the destitute.</I> It was said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:16"><I>v.</I>  16</A>)

 that God will <I>appear in his glory,</I> such a glory as kings
 themselves shall <I>stand in awe of,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 When great men <I>appear in their glory</I> they are apt to look with
 disdain upon the poor that apply to them; but the great God will not do 
 so. Observe,

 1.  The meanness of the petitioners; they are the <I>destitute.</I> It
 is an elegant word that is here used, which signifies the heath in the 
 wilderness, a low shrub, or bush, like the hyssop of the wall. They are 
 supposed to be in a low and broken state, enriched with spiritual 
 blessings, but destitute of temporal good things--the poor, the weak, 
 the desolate, the stripped; thus variously is the word rendered; or it 
 may signify that low and broken spirit which God looks for in all that 
 draw nigh to him and which he will graciously look upon. This will 
 bring them to their knees. Destitute people should be praying people, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:5">1 Tim. v. 5</A>.

 2. The favour of God to them, notwithstanding their meanness: <I>He
 will regard their prayer,</I> and will look at it, will peruse their 
 petition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+6:40">2 Chron. vi. 40</A>),

 and he <I>will not despise their prayer.</I> More is implied than is
 expressed: he will value it and be well pleased with it, and will 
 return an answer of peace to it, which is the greatest honour that can 
 be put upon it. But it is thus expressed because others despise their 
 praying, they themselves fear God will despise it, and he was thought 
 to despise it while their affliction was prolonged and their prayers 
 lay unanswered. When we consider our own meanness and vileness, our 
 darkness and deadness, and the manifold defects in our prayers, we have 
 cause to suspect that our prayers will be received with disdain in 
 heaven; but we are here assured of the contrary, for we have an 
 advocate with the Father, and are under grace, not under the law.  This 
 instance of God's favour to his praying people, though they are 
 destitute, will be a lasting encouragement to prayer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>This shall be written for the generation to come, that none may
 despair,</I> though they be destitute, nor think their prayers 
 forgotten because they have not an answer to them immediately.  The 
 experiences of others should be our encouragements to seek unto God and 
 trust in him. And, if we have the comfort of the experiences of others, 
 it is fit that we should give God the glory of them: <I>The people who 
 shall be created shall praise the Lord</I> for what he has done both 
 for them and for their predecessors.  Many that are now unborn shall, 
 by reading the history of the church, be wrought upon to turn 
 proselytes. The people that shall be created anew by divine grace, that 
 are a kind of <I>first-fruits of his creatures,</I> shall praise the 
 Lord for his answers to their prayers when they were more 
 destitute.</P>

 IV. The prisoners under condemnation unjustly seem as sheep appointed 
 for the slaughter, but care shall be taken for their discharge 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>):

 God has <I>looked down from the height of his sanctuary, from
 heaven,</I> where he has prepared his throne, that high place, that 
 holy place; thence did <I>the Lord behold the earth,</I> for it is a 
 place of prospect, and nothing on this earth is or can be hidden from 
 his all-seeing eye; he looks down, not to take a view of the kingdoms 
 of the world and the glory of them, but to do acts of grace, <I>to hear 
 the groaning of the prisoners</I> (which we desire to be out of the 
 hearing of), and not only to hear them, but to help them, <I>to loose 
 those that are appointed to death,</I> then when there is but a step 
 between them and it. Some understand it of the release of the Jews out 
 of their captivity in Babylon. God heard their groaning there as he did 
 when they were in Egypt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:7,9">Exod. iii. 7, 9</A>)

 and came down to deliver them. God takes notice not only of the prayers
 of his afflicted people, which are the language of grace, but even of
 their groans, which are the language of nature. See the divine pity in
 hearing the prisoner's groans, and the divine power in loosing the
 prisoner's bonds, even when they are appointed to death and are
 pinioned and double-shackled. We have an instance in Peter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:6">Acts xii. 6</A>.
 
 Such instances as these of the divine condescension and compassion will
 help, 

 1. <I>To declare the name of the Lord in Zion,</I> and to make it
 appear that he answers to his name, which he himself proclaimed, <I>The 
 Lord God, gracious and merciful;</I> and this declaration of his name 
 in Zion shall be the matter of his praise in Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 If God by his providences declare his name, we must by our
 acknowledgments of them declare his praise, which ought to be the echo 
 of his name. God will discharge his people that were prisoners and 
 captives in Babylon, <I>that they may declare his name in Zion,</I> the 
 place he has chosen to put his name there, <I>and his praise in 
 Jerusalem,</I> at their return thither; in the land of their captivity 
 they could not sing the songs of Zion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:3,4">Ps.  cxxxvii. 3, 4</A>),

 and God brought them again to Jerusalem in order that they might sing
 them there. For this end God gives liberty from bondage (<I>Bring my 
 soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+142:7">Ps.  cxlii. 7</A>),

 and life from the dead. <I>Let my soul live, and it shall praise
 thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:175">Ps. cxix. 175</A>.

 2. They will help to draw in others to the worship of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):
 
 <I>When the people of God are gathered together</I> at Jerusalem (as
 they were after their return out of Babylon) many out of the kingdoms
 joined with them <I>to serve the Lord.</I> This was fulfilled 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+6:21">Ezra vi. 21</A>,

 where we find that not only the children of Israel that had come out of
 captivity, but many that had <I>separated themselves from them among 
 the heathen,</I> did <I>keep the feast of unleavened bread with 
 joy.</I> But it may look further, at the conversion of the Gentiles to 
 the faith of Christ in the latter days.  Christ has proclaimed 
 <I>liberty to the captives,</I> and <I>the opening of the prison to 
 those that were bound,</I> that they may declare the name of the Lord 
 in the gospel-church, in which Jews and Gentiles shall unite.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The imminent danger that the Jewish church was in of being quite 
 extirpated and cut off by the captivity in Babylon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>He weakened my strength in the way.</I> They were for many ages in
 the way to the performance of the great promise made to their fathers 
 concerning the Messiah, longing as much for it as ever a traveller did 
 to be at his journey's end. The legal institutions led them in the way; 
 but when the ten tribes were lost in Assyria, and the two almost lost 
 in Babylon, the strength of that nation was weakened, and, in all 
 appearance, its day shortened; for they said, <I>Our hope is lost; we 
 are cut off for our parts,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:11">Ezek. xxxvii. 11</A>.

 And then what becomes of the promise that Shiloh should arise out of
 Judah, the star out of Jacob, and the Messiah out of the family of
 David? If these fail, the promise fails. This the psalmist speaks of as
 in his own person, and it is very applicable to two of the common
 afflictions of this time:--

 1. To be sickly. Bodily distempers soon <I>weaken our strength in the
 way,</I> make the keepers of the house to tremble and the strong men to 
 bow themselves. 

 2. To be short-lived.  Where the former is felt, this is feared; when 
 in the midst of our days, according to a course of nature, our strength 
 is weakened, what can we expect but that the <I>number of our months 
 should be cut off in the midst?</I> and what should we do but provide 
 accordingly? We must own God's hand in it (for in his hand our strength 
 and time are), and must reconcile it to his love, for it has often been 
 the lot of those that have used their strength well to have it 
 weakened, and of those that could very ill be spared to have their days 
 shortened.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A prayer for the continuance of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 "<I>O my God! take me not away in the midst of my days;</I> let not
 this poor church be cut off in the midst of the days assigned it by the 
 promise; let it not be cut off till the Messiah shall come.  <I>Destroy 
 it not, for that blessing is in it,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:8">Isa. lxv. 8</A>.

 She is a criminal, but, for the sake of that blessing which is in her, 
 she pleads for a reprieve. This is a prayer for the afflicted, and 
 which, with submission to the will of God, we may in faith put up, that 
 God would not <I>take us away in the midst of our days,</I> but that, 
 if it be his will, he would spare us to do him further service and to 
 be made riper for heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A plea to enforce this prayer taken from the eternity of the 
 Messiah promised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:25-27"><I>v.</I> 25-27</A>.
 
 The apostle quotes these verses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:10-12">Heb.  i. 10-12</A>)

 and tells us, <I>He saith this to the Son,</I> and in that exposition
 we must acquiesce. It is very comfortable, in reference to all the 
 changes that pass over the church, and all the dangers it is in, that 
 <I>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.  Thy years 
 are throughout all generations,</I> and cannot be shortened.  It is 
 likewise comfortable in reference to the decay and death of our own 
 bodies, and the removal of our friends from us, that God is an 
 everliving God, and that therefore, if he be ours, in him we may have 
 everlasting consolation. In this plea observe how, to illustrate the 
 eternity of the Creator, he compares it with the mutability of the 
 creature; for it is God's sole prerogative to be unchangeable. 

 1. God made the world, and therefore had a being before it from
 eternity. The Son of God, the eternal Word, made the world. It is 
 expressly said, <I>All things were made by him, and without him was not 
 any thing made that was made;</I> and <I>therefore the same was in the 
 beginning</I> from eternity <I>with God, and was God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1-3,Col+1:16,Eph+3:9,Heb+1:2">John i. 1-3; 
 Col. i. 16; Eph. iii. 9; Heb. i. 2</A>.

 Earth and heaven, and the hosts of both, include the universe and its
 fulness, and these derive their being from God by his Son 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth,</I> which is
 founded <I>on the seas</I> and <I>on the floods</I> and yet <I>it 
 abides;</I> much more shall the church, which is <I>built upon a 
 rock.</I> The <I>heavens are the work of thy hands,</I> and by thee are 
 all their motions and influences directed;" God is therefore the 
 fountain, not only of all being, but of all power and dominion. See how 
 fit the great Redeemer is to be entrusted with all power, both in 
 heaven and in earth, since he himself, as Creator of both, perfectly 
 knows both and is entitled to both. 

 2. God will unmake the world again, and therefore shall have a being to 
 eternity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>):

 <I>They shall perish,</I> for <I>thou shalt change them</I> by the same
 almighty power that made them, and therefore, no doubt, <I>thou shalt 
 endure; thou art the same.</I> God and the world, Christ and the 
 creature, are rivals for the innermost and uppermost place in the soul 
 of man, the immortal soul; now what is here said, one would think, were 
 enough to decide the controversy immediately and to determine us for 
 God and Christ. For,

 (1.) A portion in the creature is fading and dying: <I>They shall 
 perish;</I> they will not last so long as we shall last.  The day is 
 coming when <I>the earth and all the works that are therein shall be 
 burnt up;</I> and then what will become of those that have laid up 
 their treasure in it?  Heaven and earth shall <I>wax old as a 
 garment,</I> not by a gradual decay, but, when the set time comes, they 
 shall be laid aside like an old garment that we have no more occasion 
 for: <I>As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be 
 changed,</I> not annihilated, but altered, it may be so that they shall 
 not be at all the same, but <I>new heavens and a new earth.</I> See 
 God's sovereign dominion over heaven and earth. He can change them as 
 he pleases and when he pleases; and the constant changes they are 
 subject to, in the revolutions of day and night, summer and winter, are 
 earnests of their last and final change, when <I>the heavens</I> and 
 <I>time</I> (which is measured by them) <I>shall be no more.</I> 

 (2.) A portion in God is perpetual and everlasting: <I>Thou art the 
 same,</I> subject to no change; and <I>thy years have no end,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:27"><I>v.</I>  27</A>.

 Christ will be the same in the performance that he was in the promise,
 the same to his church in captivity that he was to his church at 
 liberty.  Let not the church fear the weakening of her strength, or the 
 shortening of her days, while Christ himself is both her strength and 
 her life; he is the same, and has said, <I>Because I live you shall 
 live also.</I> Christ came in the fulness of time, and set up his 
 kingdom in spite of the power of the Old-Testament Babylon, and he will 
 keep it up in spite of the power of the New-Testament Babylon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A comfortable assurance of an answer to this prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>The children of thy servants shall continue;</I> since Christ is the
 same, the church shall continue from one generation to another; from 
 the eternity of the head we may infer the perpetuity of the body, 
 though often weak and distempered, and even at death's door. Those that 
 hope to <I>wear out the saints of the Most High</I> will be mistaken.  
 Christ's servants shall have children; those children shall have a 
 seed, a succession, of professing people; the church, as well as the 
 world, is under the influence of that blessing, <I>Be fruitful and 
 multiply.</I> These <I>children shall continue,</I> not in their own 
 persons, by reason of death, but in their seed, which shall be 
 established before God (that is, in his service, and by his grace); the 
 entail of religion shall not be cut off while the world stands, but, as 
 one generation of good people passes away, another shall come, and thus 
 the throne of Christ shall endure.</P>
