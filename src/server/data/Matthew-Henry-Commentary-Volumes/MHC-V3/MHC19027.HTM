 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some think David penned this psalm before his coming to the throne, 
 when he was in the midst of his troubles, and perhaps upon occasion of 
 the death of his parents; but the Jews think he penned it when he was 
 old, upon occasion of the wonderful deliverance he had from the sword 
 of the giant, when Abishai succoured him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:16,17">2 Sam. xxi. 16, 17</A>)

 and his people thereupon resolved he should never venture his life
 again in battle, lest he should quench the light of Israel. Perhaps it 
 was not penned upon any particular occasion; but it is very expressive 
 of the pious and devout affections with which gracious souls are 
 carried out towards God at all times, especially in times of trouble. 
 Here is, 

 I.  The courage and holy bravery of his faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II.  The complacency he took in communion with God and the benefit he
 experienced by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4-6">ver.  4-6</A>.

 III. His desire towards God, and his favour and grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:7-9,11,12">ver. 7-9, 11, 12</A>.
 
 IV. His expectations from God, and the encouragement he gives to others 
 to hope in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:10,13,14">ver. 10, 13, 14</A>.

 And let our hearts be thus affected in singing this psalm.</P>

 <P>A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> my light and my
 salvation; whom shall I fear? the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> the strength of my
 life; of whom shall I be afraid?
 &nbsp; 2  When the wicked, <I>even</I> mine enemies and my foes, came upon
 me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
 &nbsp; 3  Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not
 fear: though war should rise against me, in this <I>will</I> I <I>be</I>
 confident.
 &nbsp; 4  One <I>thing</I> have I desired of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that will I seek
 after; that I may dwell in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> all the days of
 my life, to behold the beauty of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and to enquire in his
 temple.
 &nbsp; 5  For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion:
 in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me
 up upon a rock.
 &nbsp; 6  And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round
 about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of
 joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. With what a lively faith David triumphs in God, glories in his holy 
 name, and in the interest he had in him. 

 1. <I>The Lord is my light.</I> David's subjects called him <I>the
 light of Israel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+21:17">2 Sam. xxi. 17</A>.

 And he was indeed a burning and a shining light: but he owns that he
 shone, as the moon does, with a borrowed light; what light God darted
 upon him reflected upon them: <I>The Lord is my light.</I> God is a 
 light to his people, to show them the way when they are in doubt, to 
 comfort and rejoice their hearts when they are in sorrow. It is in his 
 light that they now walk on in their way, and in his light they hope to 
 see light for ever. 

 2. "He is <I>my salvation,</I> in whom I am safe and by whom I shall be 
 saved." 

 3. "He is <I>the strength of my life,</I> not only the protector of my 
 exposed life, who keeps me from being slain, but the strength of my 
 frail weak life, who keeps me from fainting, sinking, and dying away." 
 God, who is a believer's light, is the strength of his life, not only 
 by whom, but in whom, he lives and moves. In God therefore let us 
 strengthen ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. With what an undaunted courage he triumphs over his enemies; no 
 fortitude like that of faith. If God be for him, who can be against 
 him? <I>Whom shall I fear? Of whom shall I be afraid?</I> If 
 Omnipotence be his guard, he has no cause to fear; if he knows it to be 
 so, he has no disposition to fear. If God be his light, he fears no 
 shades; if God be his salvation, he fears no colours. He triumphs over 
 his enemies that were already routed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 His enemies came upon him, <I>to eat up his flesh,</I> aiming at no 
 less and assured of that, but they fell; not, "He smote them and they 
 fell," but, "<I>They stumbled and fell;</I>" they were so confounded 
 and weakened that they could not go on with their enterprise. Thus 
 those that came to take Christ with a word's speaking were made to 
 stagger and fall to the ground,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:6">John xviii. 6</A>.

 The ruin of some of the enemies of God's people is an earnest of the 
 complete conquest of them all. And therefore, these having fallen, he 
 is fearless of the rest: "Though they be numerous, <I>a host</I> of 
 them,--though they be daring and their attempts threatening,--though they
 <I>encamp against me,</I> an army against one man,--though they wage war
 upon me, yet <I>my heart shall not fear.</I>" Hosts cannot hurt us if 
 the Lord of hosts protect us. Nay, in this assurance that God is for me 
 "<I>I will be confident.</I>" Two things he will be confident of:--

 1.  That he shall be safe. "If God is my salvation, <I>in the time of
 trouble he shall hide me;</I> he shall set me out of danger and above 
 the fear of it." God will not only find out a shelter for his people in 
 distress (as he did

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:26">Jer. xxxvi. 26</A>),

 but he will himself be their hiding-place,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:7">Ps. xxxii. 7</A>.

 His providence will, it may be, keep them safe; at least his grace will 
 make them easy. His name is the strong tower into which by faith they 
 run, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:10">Prov. xviii. 10</A>.

 "<I>He shall hide me,</I> not in the strongholds of En-gedi

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:29">1 Sam. xxiii. 29</A>),

 but <I>in the secret of his tabernacle.</I>" The gracious presence of
 God, his power, his promise, his readiness to hear prayer, the witness 
 of his Spirit in the hearts of his people--these are the secret of his 
 tabernacle, and in these the saints find cause for that holy security 
 and serenity of mind in which they dwell at ease. This sets them upon a 
 rock which will not sink under them, but on which they find firm 
 footing for their hopes; nay, it sets them <I>up upon a rock</I> on 
 high, where the raging threatening billows of a stormy sea cannot touch 
 them; it is a rock that is <I>higher than we,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+61:2">Ps.  lxi. 2</A>.

 2. That he shall be victorious

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies,</I> not only so as 
 that they cannot reach it with their darts, but so as that I shall be 
 exalted to bear rule over them." David here, by faith in the promise of 
 God, triumphs before the victory, and is as sure, not only of the 
 laurel, but of the crown, as if it were already upon his head.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. With what a gracious earnestness he prays for a constant communion 
 with God in holy ordinances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 It greatly encouraged his confidence in God that he was conscious to 
 himself of an entire affection to God and to his ordinances, and that 
 he was in his element when in the way of his duty and in the way of 
 increasing his acquaintance with him. If our hearts can witness for us 
 that we delight in God above any creature, that may encourage us to 
 depend upon him; for it is a sign we are of those whom he protects as 
 his own. Or it may be taken thus: He desired to dwell in the house of 
 the Lord that there he might be safe from the enemies that surrounded 
 him. Finding himself surrounded by threatening hosts, he does not say, 
 "<I>One thing have I desired,</I> in order to my safety, that I may 
 have my army augmented to such a number," or that I may be master of 
 such a city or such a castle, but "<I>that I may dwell in the house of 
 the Lord,</I> and then I am well." Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What it is he desires--<I>to dwell in the house of the Lord.</I> In
 the courts of God's house the priests had their lodgings, and David 
 wished he had been one of them. Disdainfully as some look upon God's 
 ministers, one of the greatest and best of kings that ever was would 
 gladly have taken his lot, have taken his lodging, among them. Or, 
 rather, he desires that he might duly and constantly attend on the 
 public service of God, with other faithful Israelites, according as the 
 duty of every day required. He longed to see an end of the wars in 
 which he was now engaged, not that he might live at ease in his own 
 palace, but that he might have leisure and liberty for a constant 
 attendance in God's courts. Thus Hezekiah, a genuine son of David, 
 wished for the recovery of his health, not that he might go up to the 
 thrones of judgment, but that he might <I>go up to the house of the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:22">Isa. xxxviii. 22</A>.

 Note, All God's children desire to dwell in God's house; where should
 they dwell else? Not to sojourn there as a wayfaring man, that turns 
 aside to tarry but for a night, nor to dwell there for a time only, as 
 the servant that abides not in the house for ever, but to dwell there 
 all the days of their life; for there the Son abides ever. Do we hope 
 that praising God will be the blessedness of our eternity? Surely then
 we ought to make it the business of our time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How earnestly he covets this: "This is the <I>one thing I have 
 desired of the Lord</I> and which I will seek after." If he were to ask 
 but one thing of God, this should be it; for this he had at heart more 
 than any thing. He desired it as a good thing; he desired it of the 
 Lord as his gift and a token of his favour. And, having fixed his 
 desire upon this as the one thing needful, he sought after it; he 
 continued to pray for it, and contrived his affairs so as that he might 
 have this liberty and opportunity. Note, Those that truly desire 
 communion with God will set themselves with all diligence to seek after 
 it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:1">Prov.  xviii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What he had in his eye in it. He would dwell in God's house, not for 
 the plenty of good entertainment that was there, in the feasts upon the 
 sacrifices, nor for the music and good singing that were there, but 
 <I>to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple.</I> 
 He desired to attend in God's courts, 

 (1.) That he might have the pleasure of meditating upon God. He knew 
 something of the beauty of the Lord, the infinite and transcendent 
 amiableness of the divine being and perfections; his holiness is his 
 beauty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>),
 
 his goodness is his beauty,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:17">Zech. ix. 17</A>.

 The harmony of all his attributes is the beauty of his nature. With an
 eye of faith and holy love we with pleasure behold this beauty, and 
 observe more and more in it that is amiable, that is admirable. When 
 with fixedness of thought, and a holy flame of devout affections, we 
 contemplate God's glorious excellencies, and entertain ourselves with 
 the tokens of his peculiar favour to us, this is that view of the 
 beauty of the Lord which David here covets, and it is to be had in his 
 ordinances, for there he manifests himself. 

 (2.) That he might have the satisfaction of being instructed in his 
 duty; for concerning this he would <I>enquire in God's temple.</I> 
 Lord, <I>what wilt thou have me to do?</I> For the sake of these two 
 things he desired that one thing, to <I>dwell in the house of the Lord 
 all the days of his life;</I> for blessed are those that do so; they 
 will be still praising him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:4">Ps.  lxxxiv. 4</A>),

 both in speaking to him and in hearing from him. Mary's sitting at 
 Christ's feet to hear his word Christ calls the <I>one thing 
 needful,</I> and <I>the good part.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. What advantage he promised himself by it. Could he but have a place
 in God's house, 

 (1.) There he should be quiet and easy: there troubles would not find 
 him, for he should be hid in secret; there troubles would not reach 
 him, for he should be set on high, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Joash, one of David's seed, was hidden in the house of the Lord six 
 years, and there not only preserved from the sword, but reserved to the 
 crown,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+11:3">2 Kings xi. 3</A>.

 The temple was thought a safe place for Nehemiah to abscond in,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:10">Neh. vi. 10</A>.

 The safety of believers however is not in the walls of the temple, but
 in the God of the temple and their comfort in communion with him. 

 (2.) There he should be pleasant and cheerful: there he would offer 
 sacrifices of joy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 For God's work is its own wages.  There <I>he would sing, yea, he would 
 sing praises to the Lord.</I> Note, Whatever is the matter of our joy 
 ought to be the matter of our praise; and, when we attend upon God in 
 holy ordinances, we ought to be much in joy and praise. It is for the 
 glory of our God that we should sing in his ways; and, whenever God 
 lifts us up above our enemies, we ought to exalt him in our praises. 
 <I>Thanks be to God, who always causeth us to triumph,</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David in these verses expresses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His desire towards God, in many petitions. If he cannot now go up to 
 the house of the Lord, yet, wherever he is, he can find a way to the 
 throne of grace by prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He humbly bespeaks, because he firmly believes he shall have, a 
 gracious audience: "<I>Hear, O Lord, when I cry,</I> not only with my 
 heart, but, as one in earnest, <I>with my voice too.</I>" He bespeaks 
 also an answer of peace, which he expects, not from his own merit, but 
 God's goodness: <I>Have mercy upon me, and answer me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 If we pray and believe, God will graciously hear and answer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He takes hold of the kind invitation God had given him to this duty, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It is presumption for us to come into the presence of the King of kings 
 uncalled, nor can we draw near with any assurance unless he <I>hold 
 forth to us the golden sceptre.</I> David therefore going to pray 
 fastens, in his thoughts, upon the call God had given him to the throne 
 of his grace, and reverently touches, as it were, the top of the golden 
 sceptre which was thereby held out to him. <I>My heart said unto 
 thee</I> (so it begins in the original) or <I>of</I> thee, <I>Seek you 
 my face;</I> he first revolved that, and preached that over again to 
 himself (and that is the best preaching: it is hearing twice what God 
 speaks once)--<I>Thou saidst</I> (so it may be supplied), <I>Seek you
 my face;</I> and then he returns what he had so meditated upon, in this 
 pious resolution, <I>Thy face, Lord, will I seek.</I> Observe here,

 (1.) The true nature of religious worship; it is seeking the face of 
 God. This it is in God's precept: <I>Seek you my face;</I> he would 
 have us seek him for himself, and make his favour our chief good; and 
 this it is in the saint's purpose and desire: "<I>Thy face, Lord, will 
 I seek,</I> and nothing less will I take up with." The opening of his 
 hand will satisfy the desire of other living things 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:16">Ps. cxlv. 16</A>),

 but it is only the shining of his face that will satisfy the desire of 
 a living soul, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6,7">Ps. iv. 6, 7</A>.

 (2.) The kind of invitation of a gracious God to this duty: <I>Thou 
 saidst, Seek you my face;</I> it is not only permission, but a precept; 
 and his commanding us to seek implies a promise of finding; for he is 
 too kind to say, <I>Seek you me in vain.</I> God calls us to seek his 
 face in our conversion to him and in our converse with him. He calls 
 us, by the whispers of his Spirit to and with our spirits, to seek his 
 face; he calls us by his word, by the stated returns of opportunities 
 for his worship, and by special providences, merciful and afflictive. 
 When we are foolishly making our court to lying vanities God is, in 
 love to us, calling us in him to seek our own mercies. 

 (3.) The ready compliance of a gracious soul with this invitation. The 
 call is immediately returned: <I>My heart answered, Thy face, Lord, 
 will I seek.</I> The call was general; "<I>Seek you my face;</I>" but, 
 like David, we must apply it to ourselves, "<I>I will seek it.</I>" The 
 word does us no good when we transfer it to others, and do not 
 ourselves accept the exhortation. The call was, <I>Seek you my 
 face;</I> the answer is express, <I>Thy face, Lord, will I seek;</I> 
 like that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:22">Jer. iii. 22</A>),

 <I>Behold, we come unto thee.</I> A gracious heart readily echoes to
 the call of a gracious God, being made willing in the day of his 
 power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He is very particular in his requests. 

 (1.) For the favour of God, that he might not be shut out from that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Thy face, Lord, will I seek,</I> in obedience to thy command; 
 therefore <I>hide not thy face from me;</I> let me never want the 
 reviving sense of the favour; love me, and let me know that thou lovest 
 me; <I>put not thy servant away in anger.</I>" He owns he had deserved 
 God's displeasure, but begs that, however God might correct him, he 
 would not cast him away from his presence; for what is hell but that?

 (2.) For the continuance of his presence with him: "<I>Thou hast been 
 my help</I> formerly, and <I>thou are the God of my salvation;</I> and 
 therefore whither shall I go but to thee? <I>O leave me not, neither 
 forsake me;</I> withdraw not the operations of thy power from me, for
 then I am helpless; withdraw not the tokens of thy good-will to me, for 
 then I am comfortless." 

 (3.) For the benefit of divine guidance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:11"><I>v.</I>  11</A>):

 "<I>Teach me thy way, O Lord!</I> give me to understand the meaning of 
 thy providences towards me and make them plain to me; and give me to 
 know my duty in every doubtful case, that I may not mistake it, but may 
 walk rightly, and that I may not do it with hesitation, but may walk 
 surely." It is not policy, but plainness (that is, downright honesty) 
 that will direct us into and keep us in the way of our duty.  He begs 
 to be guided <I>in a plain path, because of his enemies,</I> or (as the 
 margin reads it) his <I>observers.</I> His enemies watched for his 
 halting, that they may find occasion against him. Saul eyed David,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:9">1 Sam. xviii. 9</A>.

 This quickened him to pray, "Lord, <I>lead me in a plain path,</I> that
 they may have nothing ill, or nothing that looks ill, to lay to my 
 charge." 

 (4.) For the benefit of a divine protection
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>Deliver me not over to the will of my enemies.</I> Lord, let them 
 not gain their point, for it aims at my life, and no less, and in such 
 a way as that I have no fence against them, but thy power over their 
 consciences; for <I>false witnesses have risen up against me,</I> that 
 aim further than to take away my reputation or estate, for they 
 <I>breathe out cruelty;</I> it is the blood, the precious blood, they 
 thirst after." Herein David was a type of Christ; for false witnesses 
 rose up against him, and such as breathed out cruelty; but though he 
 was delivered into their wicked hands, he was not delivered over to 
 their will, for they could not prevent his exaltation.</P>

 II. He expresses his dependence upon God,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he would help and succour him when all other helps and succours 
 failed him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>When my father and my mother forsake me,</I> the nearest and 
 dearest friends I have in the world, from whom I may expect most relief 
 and with most reason, when they die, or are at a distance from me, or 
 are disabled to help me in time of need, or are unkind to me or 
 unmindful of me, and will not help me, when I am as helpless as ever 
 poor orphan was that was left fatherless and motherless, then I know 
 <I>the Lord will take me up,</I> as a poor wandering sheep is taken up, 
 and saved from perishing." His time to help those that trust in him is 
 when all other helpers fail, when it is most for his honour and their 
 comfort. With him <I>the fatherless find mercy.</I> This promise has 
 often been fulfilled in the letter of it.  Forsaken orphans have been 
 taken under the special care of the divine Providence, which has raised 
 up relief and friends for them in a way that one would not have 
 expected. God is a surer and better friend than our earthly parents are 
 or can be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That in due time he should see the displays of his goodness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 He believed he should <I>see the goodness of the Lord in the land of
 the living;</I> and, if he had not done so, he would <I>have 
 fainted</I> under his afflictions. Even the best saints are subject to 
 faint when their troubles become grievous and tedious, their spirits 
 are overwhelmed, and their flesh and heart fail. But then faith is a 
 sovereign cordial; it keeps them from desponding under their burden and 
 from despairing of relief, keeps them hoping, and praying, and waiting, 
 and keeps up in them good thoughts of God, and the comfortable 
 enjoyment of themselves. But what was it the belief of which kept David 
 from fainting?--<I>that he should see the goodness of the Lord,</I>
 which now seemed at a distance. Those that walk by faith in the 
 goodness of the Lord shall in due time walk in the sight of that 
 goodness. This he hopes to see in the land of the living, that is, 

 (1.) In this world, that he should outlive his troubles and not perish 
 under them. It is his comfort, not so much that he shall see the land 
 of the living as that he shall see the goodness of God in it; for that 
 is the comfort of all creature-comforts to a gracious soul. 

 (2.) In the land of Canaan, and in Jerusalem where the lively oracles 
 were. In comparison with the heathen, that were dead in sin, the land 
 of Israel might fitly be called <I>the land of the living;</I> there 
 God was known, and there David hoped to see his goodness; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:25,26">2 Sam. xv. 25, 26</A>.
 
 Or, 

 (3.), In heaven. It is that alone that may truly be called <I>the land 
 of the living,</I> where there is no more death. This earth is the land 
 of the dying. There is nothing like the believing hope of eternal life, 
 the foresights of that glory, and foretastes of those pleasures, to 
 keep us from fainting under all the calamities of this present 
 time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That in the mean time he should be strengthened to bear up under his 
 burdens 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 whether he says it to himself, or to his friends, it comes all to one; 
 this is that which encourages him: <I>He shall strengthen thy 
 heart,</I> shall sustain thy spirit, and then the spirit shall sustain 
 the infirmity. In that strength,

 (1.) Keep close to God and to your duty. <I>Wait on the Lord</I> by 
 faith, and prayer, and a humble resignation to his will; <I>wait, I 
 say, on the Lord;</I> whatever you do, grow not remiss in your 
 attendance upon God. 

 (2.) Keep up your spirits in the midst of the greatest dangers and 
 difficulties: <I>Be of good courage;</I> let your hearts be fixed, 
 trusting in God, and your minds stayed upon him, and then let none of 
 these things move you. Those that wait upon the Lord have reason to be 
 of good courage.</P>
