 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  A false balance <I>is</I> abomination to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: but a just
 weight <I>is</I> his delight.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As religion towards God is a branch of universal righteousness (he is 
 not an honest man that is not devout), so righteousness towards men is 
 a branch of true religion, for he is not a godly man that is not 
 honest, nor can he expect that his devotion should be accepted; for, 

 1. Nothing is more offensive to God than deceit in commerce. <I>A
 false balance</I> is here put for all manner of unjust and fraudulent 
 practices in dealing with any person, which are all an <I>abomination 
 to the Lord,</I> and render those abominable to him that allow 
 themselves in the use of such accursed arts of thriving. It is an 
 affront to justice, which God is the patron of, as well as a wrong to 
 our neighbour, whom God is the protector of. Men make light of such 
 frauds, and think there is no sin in that which there is money to be 
 got by, and, while it passes undiscovered, they cannot blame themselves 
 for it; a blot is no blot till it is hit,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:7,8">Hos. xii. 7, 8</A>.

 But they are not the less an abomination to God, who will be the 
 avenger of those that are defrauded by their brethren. 

 2. Nothing is more pleasing to God than fair and honest dealing, nor 
 more necessary to make us and our devotions acceptable to him: <I>A 
 just weight is his delight.</I> He himself goes by a just weight, and 
 holds the scale of judgment with an even hand, and therefore is pleased 
 with those that are herein followers of him. A balance cheats, under 
 pretence of doing right most exactly, and therefore is the greater 
 abomination to God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  <I>When</I> pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly
 <I>is</I> wisdom.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. How he that exalts himself is here abased, and contempt put upon
 him. <I>When pride comes then comes shame.</I> Pride is a sin which men 
 have reason to be themselves ashamed of; it is a shame to a man who 
 springs out of the earth, who lives upon alms, depends upon God, and 
 has forfeited all he has, to be proud. It is a sin which others cry out 
 shame on and look upon with disdain; he that is haughty makes himself 
 contemptible; it is a sin for which God often brings men down, as he 
 did Nebuchadnezzar and Herod, whose ignominy immediately attended their 
 vain-glory; for God <I>resists the proud,</I> contradicts them, and 
 counterworks them, in the thing they are proud of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:11">Isa. ii. 11</A>,

 &c.

 2. How he that humbles himself is here exalted, and a high character is
 given him. As with the proud there is folly, and will be shame, so 
 <I>with the lowly there is wisdom,</I> and will be honour, for a man's 
 wisdom gains him respect and makes his face to shine before men; or, if 
 any be so base as to trample upon the humble, God will give them grace 
 which will be their glory. Considering how safe, and quiet, and easy, 
 those are that are of a humble spirit, what communion they have with 
 God and comfort in themselves, we will say, <I>With the lowly is 
 wisdom.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the
 perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is not only promised that God will guide the upright, and threatened 
 that he will destroy the transgressors, but, that we may be the more 
 fully assured of both, it is here represented as if the nature of the 
 thing were such on both sides that it would do it itself. 

 1. The integrity of an honest man will itself be his guide in the way
 of duty and the way of safety. His principles are fixed, his rule is 
 certain, and therefore his way is plain; his sincerity keeps him 
 steady, and he needs not tack about every time the wind turns, having 
 no other end to drive at than to keep a good conscience. <I>Integrity 
 and uprightness</I> will <I>preserve</I> men,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:21">Ps. xxv. 21</A>.

 2. The iniquity of a bad man will itself be his ruin. As the plainness 
 of a good man will be his protection, though he is ever so much 
 exposed, so the perverseness of sinners will be their destruction, 
 though they think themselves ever so well fortified. They shall fall
 into pits of their own digging,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness
 delivereth from death.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. The <I>day of death</I> will be a <I>day of wrath.</I> It is a
 messenger of God's wrath; therefore when Moses had meditated on man's 
 mortality he takes occasion thence to admire <I>the power of God's 
 anger,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:11">Ps. xc. 11</A>.

 It is a debt owing, not to nature, but to God's justice. <I>After death 
 the judgment,</I> and that is a <I>day of wrath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:17">Rev. vi. 17</A>.

 2. Riches will stand men in no stead that day. They will neither put
 by the stroke nor ease the pain, much less take out the sting; what 
 profit will this world's birth-rights be of then? In the day of public
 judgments riches often expose men rather than protect them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:19">Ezek. vii. 19</A>.

 3. It is righteousness only that will <I>deliver from</I> the evil of 
 <I>death.</I> A good conscience will make death easy, and take off the 
 terror of it; it is the privilege of the righteous only not to be hurt 
 of the second death, and so not much hurt by the first.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but
 the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
 &nbsp; 6  The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but
 transgressors shall be taken in <I>their own</I> naughtiness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These two verses are, in effect, the same, and both to the same purport 
 with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 For the truths are here of such certainty and weight that they cannot 
 be too often inculcated. Let us govern ourselves by these 
 principles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the ways of religion are plain and safe, and in them we may 
 enjoy a holy security. A living principle of honesty and grace will be, 

 1. Our best direction in the right way, in every doubtful case to say 
 to us, <I>This is the way, walk in it.</I> He that acts without a guide 
 looks right on and sees his way before him. 

 2. Our best deliverance from every false way: <I>The righteousness of 
 the upright</I> shall be armour of proof to them, to deliver them from 
 the allurements of the devil and the world, and from their menaces.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The ways of wickedness are dangerous and destructive: <I>The wicked 
 shall fail</I> into misery and ruin <I>by their own wickedness,</I> and 
 be <I>taken in their own naughtiness</I> as in a snare. <I>O Israel! 
 thou hast destroyed thyself.</I> Their sin will be their punishment; 
 that very thing by which they contrived to shelter themselves will make 
 against them.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr11_7"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  When a wicked man dieth, <I>his</I> expectation shall perish: and
 the hope of unjust <I>men</I> perisheth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Even wicked men, while they live, may keep up a confident
 expectation of a happiness when they die, or at least a happiness in 
 this world. The hypocrite has his hope, in which he wraps himself as 
 the spider in her web. The worldling expects great matters from his 
 wealth; he calls it <I>goods laid up for many years,</I> and hopes to 
 take his ease in it and to be merry; but in death their expectation 
 will be frustrated: the worldling must leave this world which he 
 expected to continue in and the hypocrite will come short of that world 
 which he expected to remove to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:8">Job xxvii. 8</A>.

 2. It will be the great aggravation of the misery of wicked people that 
 their hopes will sink into despair just when they expect them to be 
 crowned with fruition. When a godly man dies his expectations are
 out-done, and all his fears vanish; but when a wicked man dies his 
 expectations are dashed, dashed to pieces; in that very day his 
 thoughts perish with which he had pleased himself, his hopes 
 vanish.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr11_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked
 cometh in his stead.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As always in death, so sometimes in life, the righteous are remarkably 
 favoured and the wicked crossed. 

 1. Good people are helped out of the distresses which they thought
 themselves lost in, and their feet are set in a large room,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:12,34:19">Ps. lxvi. 12; xxxiv. 19</A>.

 God has found out a way to deliver his people even when they have 
 despaired and their enemies have triumphed, as if the wilderness had 
 shut them in. 

 2. The wicked have fallen into the distresses which they thought 
 themselves far from, nay, which they had been instrumental to bring the 
 righteous into, so that they seem to come in their stead, as a ransom 
 for the just. Mordecai is saved from the gallows, Daniel from the 
 lion's den, and Peter from the prison; and their persecutors <I>come in 
 their stead.</I> The Israelites are delivered out of the Red Sea and 
 the Egyptians drowned in it. So precious are the saints in God's eye 
 that he <I>gives men for them,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 1. Hypocrisy designing ill. It is not only the murderer with his sword,
 but the <I>hypocrite with his mouth,</I> that <I>destroys his 
 neighbour,</I> decoying him into sin, or into mischief, by the specious 
 pretences of kindness and good-will. <I>Death and life are in the power 
 of the tongue,</I> but no tongue more fatal than the flattering tongue. 

 2. Honesty defeating the design and escaping the snare: <I>Through 
 knowledge</I> of the devices of Satan <I>shall the just be 
 delivered</I> from the snares which the hypocrite has laid for him; 
 seducers shall not deceive the elect. By the knowledge of God, and the 
 scriptures, and their own hearts, shall the just be delivered from 
 those that lie in wait to deceive, and so to destroy,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth:
 and when the wicked perish, <I>there is</I> shouting.
 &nbsp; 11  By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it
 is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is here observed,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That good men are generally well-beloved by their neighbours, but 
 nobody cares for wicked people. 

 1. It is true there are some few that are enemies to the righteous,
 that are prejudiced against God and godliness, and are therefore vexed 
 to see good men in power and prosperity; but all indifferent persons, 
 even those that have no great stock of religion themselves, have a good 
 word for a good man; and therefore <I>when it goes well with the 
 righteous,</I> when they are advanced and put into a capacity of doing 
 good according to their desire, it is so much the better for all about 
 them, and <I>the city rejoices.</I> For the honour and encouragement of 
 virtue, and as it is the accomplishment of the promise of God, we 
 should be glad to see virtuous men prosper in the world, and brought 
 into reputation. 

 2. Wicked people may perhaps have here and there a well-wisher among
 those who are altogether such as themselves, but among the generality 
 of their neighbours they get ill-will; they may be feared, but they are 
 not loved, and therefore <I>when they perish there is shouting;</I> 
 every body takes a pleasure in seeing them disgraced and disarmed, 
 removed out of places of trust and power, chased out of the world, and 
 wishes no greater loss may come to the town, the rather because they 
 hope <I>the righteous may come in their stead,</I> as they into trouble 
 instead of the righteous,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Let a sense of honour therefore keep us in the paths of virtue, that we 
 may live desired and die lamented, and not be hissed off the stage,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:23,Ps+52:6">Job xxvii. 23; Ps. lii. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That there is good reason for this, because those that are good do 
 good, but (<I>as saith the proverb of the ancients) wickedness proceeds 
 from the wicked.</I> 

 1. <I>Good men are public blessings</I>--<I>Vir bonus est commune
 bonum. By the blessing of the upright,</I> the blessings with which 
 they are blessed, which enlarge their sphere of usefulness,--by the 
 blessings with which they bless their neighbours, their advice, their 
 example, their prayers, and all the instances of their serviceableness 
 to the public interest,--by the blessings with which God blesses others 
 for their sake,--by these <I>the city is exalted</I> and made more 
 comfortable to the inhabitants, and more considerable among its 
 neighbours. 

 2. Wicked men are public nuisances, not only the burdens, but the 
 plagues of their generation. The city is <I>overthrown by the mouth of 
 the wicked,</I> whose evil communications corrupt good manners, are 
 enough to debauch a town, to ruin virtue in it, and bring down the 
 judgments of God upon it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man
 of understanding holdeth his peace.
 &nbsp; 13  A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful
 spirit concealeth the matter.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Silence is here recommended as an instance of true friendship, and a 
 preservative of it, and therefore an evidence, 

 1. Of wisdom: <I>A man of understanding,</I> that has rule over his own
 spirit, if he be provoked, <I>holds his peace,</I> that he may neither 
 give vent to his passion nor kindle the passion of others by any 
 opprobrious language or peevish reflections. 

 2. Of sincerity: <I>He that is of a faithful spirit,</I> that is true,
 not only to his own promise, but to the interest of his friend, 
 <I>conceals every matter</I> which, if divulged, may turn to the 
 prejudice of his neighbour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. This prudent friendly concealment is here opposed to two very bad 
 vices of the tongue:--

 1. Speaking scornfully of a man to his face: <I>He that is void of
 wisdom</I> discovers his folly by this; he <I>despises his 
 neighbour,</I> calls him <I>Raca,</I> and <I>Thou fool,</I> upon the 
 least provocation, and tramples upon him as not worthy to be set with 
 the dogs of his flock. He undervalues himself who thus undervalues one 
 that is made of the same mould. 

 2. Speaking spitefully of a man behind his back: <I>A tale-bearer,</I> 
 that carries all the stories he can pick up, true or false, from house 
 to house, to make mischief and sow discord, <I>reveals secrets</I> 
 which he has been entrusted with, and so breaks the laws, and forfeits 
 all the privileges, of friendship and conversation.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Where no counsel <I>is,</I> the people fall: but in the multitude

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The bad omen of a kingdom's ruin: <I>Where no counsel is,</I> no
 consultation at all, but every thing done rashly, or no prudent 
 consultation for the common good, but only caballing for parties and 
 divided interests, <I>the people fall,</I> crumble into factions, fall 
 to pieces, fall together by the ears, and fall an easy prey to their 
 common enemies. Councils of war are necessary to the operations of war; 
 two eyes see more than one; and mutual advice is in order to mutual 
 assistance. 

 2. The good presage of a kingdom's prosperity: <I>In the multitude of 
 counsellors,</I> that see their need one of another, and act in concert 
 and with concern for the public welfare, <I>there is safety;</I> for 
 what prudent methods one discerns not another may. In our private 
 affairs we shall often find it to our advantage to advise with many; if 
 they agree in their advice, our way will be the more clear; if they 
 differ, we shall hear what is to be said on all sides, and be the 
 better able to determine.</P>

 he that hateth suretiship is sure.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we are taught, 

 1. In general, that we may not use our estates as we will (he that gave
 them to us has reserved to himself a power to direct us how we shall 
 use them, for they are not our own; we are but stewards), and further 
 that God in his law consults our interests and teaches us that charity 
 which begins at home, as well as that which must not end there. There 
 is a good husbandry which is good divinity, and a discretion in 
 ordering our affairs which is part of the character of a good man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:5">Ps. cxii. 5</A>.

 Every man must be just to his family, else he is not true to his 
 stewardship. 

 2. In particular, that we must not enter rashly into suretiship,

 (1.) Because there is danger of bringing ourselves into trouble by it, 
 and our families too when we are gone: <I>He that is surety for a 
 stranger,</I> for any one that asks him and promises him to be bound 
 for him another time, for one whose person perhaps he knows, and thinks 
 he knows his circumstances, but is mistaken, he <I>shall smart for it. 
 Contritione conteretur--he shall be certainly and sadly crushed and 
 broken by it,</I> and perhaps become a bankrupt. Our Lord Jesus was
 surety for us when we were strangers, nay, enemies, and he smarted for 
 it; <I>it pleased the Lord to bruise him.</I> 

 (2.) Because he that resolves against all such suretiship keeps upon 
 sure grounds, which a man may do if he take care not to launch out any 
 further into business than his own credit will carry him, so that he 
 needs not ask others to be bound for him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong <I>men</I> retain

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. It is allowed that <I>strong men retain riches,</I> that those who
 bustle in the world, who are men of spirit and interest, and are able 
 to make their part good against all who stand in their way, are likely 
 to keep what they have and to get more, while those who are weak are 
 preyed upon by all about them. 

 2. It is taken for granted that <I>a gracious woman</I> is as 
 solicitous to preserve her reputation for wisdom and modesty, humility 
 and courtesy, and all those other graces that are the true ornaments of 
 her sex, as strong men are to secure their estates; and those women who 
 are truly gracious will, in like manner, effectually secure their 
 honour by their prudence and good conduct. <I>A gracious woman</I> is

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is a common principle, Every one for himself. <I>Proximus egomet 
 mihi--None so near to me as myself.</I> Now, if this be rightly
 understood, it will be a reason for the cherishing of gracious 
 dispositions in ourselves and the crucifying of corrupt ones. We are 
 friends or enemies to ourselves, even in respect of present comfort, 
 according as we are or are not governed by religious principles. 

 1. A <I>merciful,</I> tender, good humoured <I>man, does good to his
 own soul,</I> makes and keeps himself easy. He has the pleasure of 
 doing his duty, and contributing to the comfort of those that are to 
 him as <I>his own soul;</I> for <I>we are members one of another.</I> 
 He that waters others with his temporal good things shall find that God 
 will water him with his spiritual blessings, which will do the best 
 <I>good to his own soul.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:7">Isa. lviii. 7</A>,

 &c. <I>If thou hide not thy eyes from thy own flesh,</I> but do good to
 others, as to thyself, if thou do good with thy own soul and <I>draw 
 that out to the hungry,</I> thou wilt do good to thy own soul; for the 
 Lord shall <I>satisfy thy soul</I> and <I>make fat thy bones.</I> Some 
 make it part of the character of a <I>merciful man,</I> that he will 
 make much of himself; that disposition which inclines him to be 
 charitable to others will oblige him to allow himself also that which 
 is convenient and to <I>enjoy the good of all his labour.</I> We may by 
 the <I>soul</I> understand the <I>inward man,</I> as the apostle calls 
 it, and then it teaches us that the first and great act of mercy is to 
 provide well for our own souls the necessary supports of the spiritual 
 life. 

 2. A <I>cruel,</I> froward, ill-natured man, <I>troubles his own 
 flesh,</I> and so his sin becomes his punishment; he starves and dies 
 for want of what he has, because he has not a heart to use it either 
 for the good of others or for his own. He is vexatious to his nearest
 relations, that are, and should be, to him as his own flesh,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  As righteousness <I>tendeth</I> to life: so he that pursueth evil
 <I>pursueth it</I> to his own death.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is here shown that righteousness, not only by the divine judgment, 
 will end in life, and wickedness in death, but that righteousness, in 
 its own nature, has a direct tendency to life and wickedness to death. 

 1. True holiness is true happiness; it is a preparative for it, a 
 pledge and earnest of it. <I>Righteousness</I> inclines, disposes, and 
 leads, the soul <I>to life.</I> 

 2. In like manner, those that indulge themselves in sin are fitting 
 themselves for destruction. The more violent a man is in sinful 
 pursuits the more eagerly bent he is upon his own destruction; he 
 awakens it when it seemed to slumber and hastens it when it seemed to 
 linger.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It concerns us to know what God hates and what he loves, that we may 
 govern ourselves accordingly, may avoid his displeasure and recommend 
 ourselves to his favour. Now here we are told, 

 1. That nothing is more offensive to God than hypocrisy and
 double-dealing, for these are signified by the word which we translate 
 <I>frowardness,</I> pretending justice, but intending wrong, walking in 
 crooked ways, to avoid discovery. Those <I>are of a froward heart</I> 
 who act in contradiction to that which is good, under a profession of 
 that which is good, and such are, more than any sinners, an 
 <I>abomination to the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:5">Isa. lxv. 5</A>.

 2. That nothing is more pleasing to God than sincerity and 
 plain-dealing: <I>Such as are upright in their way,</I> such as aim and 
 act with integrity, such as have their conversation in the world <I>in 
 simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom,</I> these God 
 delights in, these he even boasts of (<I>Hast thou considered my 
 servant Job?</I>) and will have us to admire. <I>Behold an Israelite 
 indeed!</I></P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. That confederacies in sin shall certainly be broken, and shall not
 avail to protect the sinners: <I>Though hand join in hand,</I> though 
 there are many that concur by their practice to keep wickedness in 
 countenance, and engage to stand by one another in defending it against 
 all the attacks of virtue and justice,--though they are in league for 
 the support and propagation of it,--though wicked children tread in the 
 steps of their wicked parents, and resolve to keep up the trade, in 
 defiance of religion,--yet all this will not protect them from the 
 justice of God; they shall not be held guiltless; it will not excuse 
 them to say that they did as the most did and as their company did; 
 they <I>shall not be unpunished;</I> witness the flood that was brought 
 upon a whole world of ungodly men. Their number, and strength, and 
 unanimity in sin will stand them in no stead when the day of vengeance 
 comes. 

 2. That entails of religion shall certainly be blessed: <I>The seed of 
 the righteous,</I> that follow the steps of their righteousness, though 
 they may fall into trouble, shall, in due time, <I>be delivered.</I> 
 Though justice may come slowly to punish the wicked, and mercy may come 
 slowly to save the righteous, yet both will come surely. Sometimes 
 <I>the seed of the righteous,</I> though they are not themselves 
 righteous, are delivered for the sake of their godly ancestors, as 
 Israel often, and the seed of David.</P>

 woman which is without discretion.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 By <I>discretion</I> here we must understand <I>religion</I> and 
 <I>grace,</I> a true taste and relish (so the word signifies) of the 
 honours and pleasures that attend an unspotted virtue; so that <I>a 
 woman without discretion</I> is a woman of a loose and dissolute 
 conversation; and then observe, 

 1. It is taken for granted here that beauty or comeliness of body is
 <I>as a jewel of gold,</I> a thing very valuable, and, where there is 
 wisdom and grace to guard against the temptations of it, it is a great 
 ornament, (<I>Gratior est pulchro veniens de corpore virtus--Virtue 
 appears peculiarly graceful when associated with beauty</I>); but a 
 foolish wanton woman, of a light carriage, is fitly compared to a 
 swine, though she be ever so handsome, wallowing in the mire of filthy 
 lusts, with which the mind and conscience are defiled, and, though 
 washed, returning to them. 

 2. It is lamented that beauty should be so abused as it is by those 
 that have not modesty with it. It seems ill-bestowed upon them; it is 
 quite misplaced, <I>as a jewel in a swine's snout,</I> with which he 
 roots in the dunghill. If beauty be not guarded by virtue, the virtue 
 is exposed by the beauty. It may be applied to all other bodily 
 endowments and accomplishments; it is a pity that those should have 
 them who have not discretion to use them well.</P>

 This tells us what <I>the desire</I> and <I>expectation of the

 1. <I>The righteous</I> would have <I>good, only good;</I> all they
 desire is that it may go well with all about them; they wish no hurt to 
 any, but happiness to all; as to themselves, their desire is not to 
 gratify any evil lust, but to obtain the favour of a good God and to 
 preserve the peace of a good conscience; and good they shall have, that 
 good which they desire,

 2. <I>The wicked</I> would have <I>wrath;</I> they desire the woeful 
 day, that God's judgments may gratify their passion and revenge, may 
 remove those that stand in their way, and that they may make an 
 advantage to themselves by fishing in troubled waters; and wrath they 
 shall have, so shall their doom be. They expect and desire mischief to 
 others, but it shall return upon themselves; as they loved cursing,
 they shall have enough of it.</P>

 Note, 

 1. It is possible a man may grow rich by prudently spending what he
 has, may scatter in works of piety, charity, and generosity, and yet 
 may increase; nay, by that means may increase, as the corn is increased 
 by being sown. By cheerfully using what we have our spirits are 
 exhilarated, and so fitted for the business we have to do, by minding 
 which closely what we have is increased; it gains a reputation which 
 contributes to the increase. But it is especially to be ascribed to 
 God; he blesses the giving hand, and so makes it a getting hand,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:10">2 Cor. ix. 10</A>.

 <I>Give, and it shall be given you.</I> 

 2. It is possible a man may grow poor by meanly sparing what he has, 
 <I>withholding more than is meet,</I> not paying just debts, not 
 relieving the poor, not providing what is convenient for the family, 
 not allowing necessary expenses for the preservation of the goods; this 
 <I>tends to poverty;</I> it cramps men's ingenuity and industry, 
 weakens their interest, destroys their credit, and forfeits the 
 blessing of God: and, let men be ever so saving of what they have, if 
 God blast it and blow upon it, it comes to nothing. <I>A fire not 
 blown</I> shall <I>consume it,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 So backward we are to works of charity, and so ready to think that 
 giving undoes us, that we need to have it very much pressed upon us how 
 much it is for our own advantage to do good to others, as before, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 1. We shall have the comfort of it in our own bosoms: <I>The liberal
 soul,</I> the soul of blessing, that prays for the afflicted and 
 provides for them, that scatters blessings with gracious lips and 
 generous hands, that soul <I>shall be made fat</I> with true pleasure 
 and enriched with more grace. 

 2. We shall have the recompence of it both from God and man: <I>He that 
 waters</I> others with the streams of his bounty <I>shall be also 
 watered himself;</I> God will certainly return it in the dews, in the 
 plentiful showers, of his blessing, which he will <I>pour out, till 
 there be not room enough to receive it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:10">Mal. iii. 10</A>.

 Men that have any sense of gratitude will return it if there be 
 occasion; the <I>merciful shall find mercy</I> and the kind be kindly 
 dealt with. 

 3. We shall be enabled still to do yet more good: <I>He that waters,
 even he shall be as rain</I> (so some read it); he shall be recruited 
 as the clouds are which return after the rain, and shall be further 
 useful and acceptable, as the rain to the new-mown grass. <I>he that
 teaches shall learn</I> (so the Chaldee reads it); he that uses his 
 knowledge in teaching others shall himself be taught of God; to him 
 that has, and uses what he has, more shall be given.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here,

 1. What use we are to make of the gifts of God's bounty; we must not
 hoard them up merely for our own advantage, that we may be enriched by 
 them, but we must bring them forth for the benefit of others, that they 
 may be supported and maintained by them. It is a sin, when corn is dear 
 and scarce, to withhold it, in hopes that it will still grow dearer, so 
 to keep up and advance the market, when it is already so high that the 
 poor suffer by it; and at such a time it is the duty of those that have 
 stocks of corn by them to consider the poor, and to be willing to sell 
 at the market-price, to be content with moderate profit, and not aim to 
 make a gain of God's judgments. It is a noble and extensive piece of 
 charity for those that have stores wherewithal to do it to help to keep 
 the markets low when the price of our commodities grows excessive. 

 2. What regard we are to have to the voice of the people. We are not
 to think it an indifferent thing, and not worth heeding, whether we 
 have the ill will and word, or the good will and word, of our 
 neighbours, their prayers or their curses; for here we are taught to 
 dread their curses, and forego our own profit rather than incur them; 
 and to court their blessings, and be at some expense to purchase them. 
 Sometimes, <I>vox populi est vox Dei</I>--<I>the voice of the people is 
 the voice of God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two extremes in the management of family-affairs are here condemned and 
 the ill consequences of them foretold:--

 1. Carefulness and carnal policy, on the one hand. There are those that 
 by their extreme earnestness in pursuit of the world, their anxiety 
 about their business and fretfulness about their losses, their 
 strictness with their servants and their niggardliness towards their 
 families, <I>trouble their own houses</I> and give continual vexation 
 to all about them; while others think, by supporting factions and feuds 
 in their families, which are really a trouble to their houses, to serve 
 some turn for themselves, and either to get or to save by it. But they 
 will both be disappointed; they will <I>inherit the wind.</I> All they 
 will get by these arts will not only be empty and worthless as the 
 wind, but noisy and troublesome, vanity and vexation. 

 2. Carelessness and want of common prudence, on the other. He that is a 
 fool in his business, that either minds it not or goes awkwardly about 
 it, that has no contrivance and consideration, not only loses his
 reputation and interest, but becomes a <I>servant to the wise in 
 heart.</I> He is impoverished, and forced to work for his living; while 
 those that manage wisely raise themselves, and come to have dominion 
 over him, and others like him. It is rational, and very fit, that 
 <I>the fool</I> should <I>be servant to the wise in heart,</I> and upon 
 that account, among others, we are bound to submit our wills to the 
 will of God, and to be subject to him, because we are fools and he is 
 infinitely wise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This shows what great blessings good men are, especially those that are 
 eminently wise, to the places where they live, and therefore how much 
 to be valued. 

 1. The righteous are as <I>trees of life;</I> the fruits of their piety
 and charity, their instructions, reproofs, examples, and prayers, their 
 interest in heaven, and their influence upon earth, are like the fruits 
 of that tree, precious and useful, contributing to the support and 
 nourishment of the spiritual life in many; they are the ornaments of 
 paradise, God's church on earth, for whose sake it stands.

 2. The wise are something more; they are as trees of knowledge, not 
 forbidden, but commanded knowledge. <I>He that is wise,</I> by 
 communicating his wisdom, <I>wins souls,</I> wins upon them to bring 
 them in love with God and holiness, and so wins them over into the 
 interests of God's kingdom among men. The wise are said to <I>turn many 
 to righteousness,</I> and that is the same with winning souls here,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth:
 much more the wicked and the sinner.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This, I think, is the only one of Solomon's proverbs that has that note 
 of attention prefixed to it, <I>Behold!</I> which intimates that it 
 contains not only an evident truth, which may be beheld, but an eminent 
 truth, which must be considered. 

 1. Some understand both parts of a recompence in displeasure: <I>The
 righteous,</I> if they do amiss, shall be punished for their offences 
 in this world; much more shall wicked people be punished for theirs, 
 which are committed, not through infirmity, but with a high hand. If 
 judgment begin at the house of God, what will become of the ungodly?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:17,18,Lu+23:31">1 Pet. iv. 17, 18; Luke xxiii. 31</A>.

 2. I rather understand it of a recompence of reward to the righteous 
 and punishment to sinners. Let us behold providential retributions. 
 There are some recompences <I>in the earth,</I> in this world, and in 
 the things of this world, which prove that <I>verily there is a God 
 that judges in the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:11">Ps. lviii. 11</A>);

 but they are not universal; many sins go unpunished in the earth, and 
 services unrewarded, which indicates that there is a judgment to come, 
 and that there will be more exact and full retributions in the future 
 state. Many times <I>the righteous</I> are <I>recompensed</I> for their 
 righteousness here <I>in the earth,</I> though that is not the 
 principal, much less the only reward either intended for them or 
 intended by them; but whatever the word of God has promised them, or 
 the wisdom of God sees good for them, they shall have <I>in the earth. 
 The wicked</I> also, <I>and the sinner,</I> are sometimes remarkably 
 punished in this life, nations, families, particular persons. And if 
 the righteous, who do not deserve the least reward, yet have part of 
 their recompence here on earth, much more shall the wicked, who deserve 
 the greatest punishment, have part of their punishment on earth, as an 
 earnest of worse to come. Therefore <I>stand in awe and sin not.</I> If 
 those have two heavens that merit none, much more shall those have two 
 hells that merit both.</P>
