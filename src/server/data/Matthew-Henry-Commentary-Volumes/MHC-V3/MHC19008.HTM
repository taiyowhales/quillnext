 <HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=50>
 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is a solemn meditation on, and admiration of, the glory and
 greatness of God, of which we are all concerned to think highly and
 honourably. It begins and ends with the same acknowledgment of the
 transcendent excellency of God's name. It is proposed for proof

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:1">ver. 1</A>)

 that God's name is excellent in all the earth, and then it is repeated
 as proved (with a "quod erat demonstrandum"--which was to be
 demonstrated) in the
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:9">last verse</A>.

 For the proof of God's glory the psalmist gives instances of his
 goodness to man; for God's goodness is his glory. God is to be 
 glorified,

 I. For making known himself and his great name to us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. For making use of the weakest of the children of men, by them to
 serve his own purposes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:2">ver. 2</A>.

 III. For making even the heavenly bodies useful to man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 IV.  For making him to have dominion over the creatures in this lower
 world, and thereby placing him but little lower then the angels, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:5-8">ver. 5-8</A>.

 This psalm is, in the New Testament, applied to Christ and the work of 
 our redemption which he wrought out; the honour given by the children 
 of men to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:2,Mt+21:16">ver. 2, 
 compared with Matt. xxi. 16</A>)

 and the honour put upon the children of men by him, both in his
 humiliation, when he was made a little lower then the angels, and in
 his exaltation, when he was crowned with glory and honour. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:5,6,Heb+2:6-8,1Co+15:27">ver. 5, 6, 
 with Heb. ii. 6-8; 1 Cor. xv. 27</A>.

 When we are observing the glory of God in the kingdom of nature and
 providence we should be led by that, and through that, to the
 contemplation of his glory in the kingdom of grace.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician upon Gittith. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our Lord, how excellent 
 <I>is</I> thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
 &nbsp; 2  Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
 strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the
 enemy and the avenger.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist here sets himself to give to God the glory due to his 
 name. Dr. Hammond grounds a conjecture upon the title of this psalm 
 concerning the occasion of penning it. It is said to be upon 
 <I>Gittith,</I> which is generally taken for the tune, or musical 
 instrument, with which this psalm was to be sung; but he renders it 
 upon the <I>Gittite,</I> that is, <I>Goliath the Gittite,</I> whom he 
 vanquished and slew 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:1-58">1 Sam. xvii.</A>);

 that enemy was stilled by him who was, in comparison, but a babe and a
 suckling. The conjecture would be probable enough but that we find two 
 other psalms with the same title, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:1-16,84:1-12">Ps. lxxxi. and lxxxiv.</A>.

 Two things David here admires:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How plainly God displays his glory himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He addresses himself to God with all humility and reverence, as the 
 Lord and his people's Lord: <I>O Lord our Lord!</I> If we believe that 
 God is the Lord, we must avouch and acknowledge him to be ours. He is 
 ours, for he made us, protects us, and takes special care of us. He 
 must be ours, for we are bound to obey him and submit to him; we must 
 own the relation, not only when we come to pray to God, as a plea with 
 him to show us mercy, but when we come to praise him, as an argument 
 with ourselves to give him glory: and we shall never think we can do 
 that with affection enough if we consider, 

 1. How brightly God's glory shines even in this lower world: <I>How 
 excellent is his name in all the earth!</I> The works of creation and 
 Providence evince and proclaim to all the world that there is an 
 infinite Being, the fountain of all being, power, and perfection, the 
 sovereign ruler, powerful protector, and bountiful benefactor of all 
 the creatures. How great, how illustrious, how magnificent, is his name 
 in all the earth! The light of it shines in men's faces every where 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:20">Rom. i. 20</A>);

 if they shut their eyes against it, that is their fault.  There is no
 speech or language but the voice of God's name either is heard in it or 
 may be. But this looks further, to the gospel of Christ, by which the 
 name of God, as it is notified by divine revelation, which before was 
 great in Israel only, came to be so in all the earth, the utmost ends 
 of which have thus been made to <I>see God's great salvation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:15,16">Mark xvi. 15, 16</A>.

 2.  How much more brightly it shines in the upper world: <I>Thou hast
 set thy glory above the heavens.</I> 

 (1.) God is infinitely more glorious and excellent than the noblest of 
 creatures and those that shine most brightly. 

 (2.) Whereas we, on this earth, only hear God's excellent name, and 
 praise that, the angels and blessed spirits above see his glory, and 
 praise that, and yet he is exalted far above even their blessing and 
 praise. 

 (3.) In the exaltation of the Lord Jesus to the right hand of God, who 
 is the brightness of his Father's glory and the express image of his 
 person, God set his glory above the heavens, far above all 
 principalities and powers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How powerfully he proclaims it by the weakest of his creatures 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained 
 strength,</I> or perfected praise, the praise of thy strength,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:16">Matt. xxi. 16</A>.

 This intimates the glory of God, 

 1. In the kingdom of nature.  The care God takes of little children 
 (when they first come into the world the most helpless of all animals), 
 the special protection they are under, and the provision nature has 
 made for them, ought to be acknowledged by every one of us, to the 
 glory of God, as a great instance of his power and goodness, and the 
 more sensibly because we have all had the benefit of it, for to this we 
 owe it that we <I>died not from the womb,</I> that the knees then 
 prevented us, <I>and the breasts, that we should suck.</I> "This is 
 such an instance of thy goodness, as may for ever put to silence the 
 enemies of thy glory, who say, There is no God." 

 2.  In the kingdom of Providence. In the government of this lower world 
 he makes use of the children of men, some that know him and others that 
 do not 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:4">Isa. xlv. 4</A>),

 and these such as have been babes and sucklings; nay, sometimes he is
 pleased to serve his own purposes by the ministry of such as are still, 
 in wisdom and strength, little better than babes and sucklings.

 3. In the kingdom of grace, the kingdom of the Messiah.  It is here
 foretold that by the apostles, who were looked upon but as babes, 
 <I>unlearned and ignorant men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:13">Acts iv. 13</A>),

 mean and despicable, and <I>by the foolishness of their preaching,</I>
 the devil's kingdom should be thrown down as Jericho's walls were by 
 the sound of rams' horns. The gospel is called <I>the arm of the 
 Lord</I> and <I>the rod of his strength;</I> this was ordained to work 
 wonders, not out of the mouth of philosophers or orators, politicians 
 or statesmen, but of a company of poor fishermen, who lay under the 
 greatest external disadvantages; yea, we hear children crying, 
 <I>Hosanna to the Son of David,</I> when the chief priests and 
 Pharisees owned him not, but despised and rejected him; to that 
 therefore our Saviour applied this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:16">Matt. xxi. 16</A>)

 and by it stilled the enemy. Sometimes the grace of God appears
 wonderfully in young children, and he <I>teaches</I> those
 <I>knowledge, and makes</I> those <I>to understand doctrine, who
 are</I> but <I>newly weaned from the milk and drawn from the
 breasts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:9">Isa. xxviii. 9</A>.

 Sometimes the power of God brings to pass great things in his church by
 very weak and unlikely instruments, and confounds the noble, wise, and 
 mighty, by the base, and weak, and foolish things of the world, that no 
 flesh may glory in his presence, but the excellency of the power may 
 the more evidently appear to be of God, and not of man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:27,28">1 Cor. i. 27, 28</A>.

 This he does <I>because of his enemies,</I> because they are insolent
 and haughty, that he may still them, may put them to silence, and put 
 them to shame, and so be justly avenged on the avengers; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:14,6:10">Acts iv. 14; vi. 10</A>.

 The devil is the great enemy and avenger, and by the preaching of the
 gospel he was in a great measure stilled, his oracles were silenced, 
 the advocates of his cause were confounded, and unclean spirits 
 themselves were not suffered to speak.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this let us give God the glory of his great name, and of the 
 great things he has done by the power of his gospel, in the chariot of 
 which the exalted Redeemer rides forth conquering and to conquer, and 
 ought to be attended, not only with our praises, but with our best 
 wishes. Praise is perfected (that is, God is in the highest degree 
 glorified) when strength is ordained out of the mouth of babes and 
 sucklings.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the

 man, that thou visitest him?

 hast crowned him with glory and honour.

 thou hast put all <I>things</I> under his feet:

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here goes on to magnify the honour of God by recounting the 
 honours he has put upon man, especially the man Christ Jesus. The 
 condescensions of the divine grace call for our praises as much as the 
 elevations of the divine glory. How God has condescended in favour to 
 man the psalmist here observes with wonder and thankfulness, and 
 recommends it to our thoughts. See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What it is that leads him to admire the condescending favour of God 
 to man; it is his consideration of the lustre and influence of the 
 heavenly bodies, which are within the view of sense 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>I consider thy heavens,</I> and there, particularly, <I>the moon and 
 the stars.</I> But why does he not take notice of the sun, which much 
 excels them all? Probably because it was in a night-walk, but 
 moon-light, that he entertained and instructed himself with this 
 meditation, when the sun was not within view, but only the moon and the 
 stars, which, though they are not altogether so serviceable to man as 
 the sun is, yet are no less demonstrations of the wisdom, power, and 
 goodness of the Creator. Observe,

 1. It is our duty to consider the heavens. We see them, we cannot but 
 see them. By this, among other things, man is distinguished from the 
 beasts, that, while <I>they</I> are so framed as to look downwards to 
 the earth, man is made erect to look upwards towards heaven. <I>Os 
 homini sublime dedit, coelumque tueri jussit--To man he gave an erect 
 countenance, and bade him gaze on the heavens,</I> that thus he may be 
 directed to set his affections on things above; for what we see has not 
 its due influence upon us unless we consider it. 

 2. We must always consider the heavens as God's heavens, not only as 
 all the world is his, even the earth and the fulness thereof, but in a 
 more peculiar manner. <I>The heavens, even the heavens, are the 
 Lord's</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:16">Ps.  cxv. 16</A>);

 they are the place of the residence of his glory and we are taught to
 call him <I>Our Father in heaven.</I>

 3.  They are <I>therefore</I> his, because they are the work of his
 fingers. He made them; he made them easily. The stretching out of the 
 heavens needed not any outstretched arm; it was done with a word; it 
 was but <I>the work of his fingers.</I> He made them with very great 
 curiosity and fineness, like a nice piece of work which the artist 
 makes with his fingers. 

 4. Even the inferior lights, the moon and stars, show the glory and 
 power of the Father of lights, and furnish us with matter for praise. 

 5. The heavenly bodies are not only the creatures of the divine power,
 but subject to the divine government.  God not only made them, but
 <I>ordained</I> them, and the ordinances of heaven can never be
 altered. But how does this come in here to magnify God's favour to man?

 (1.) When we consider how the glory of God shines in the upper world we
 may well wonder that he should take cognizance of such a mean creature
 as man, that he who resides in that bright and blessed part of the
 creation, and governs it, should humble himself to behold the things
 done upon this earth; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:5,6">Ps. cxiii. 5, 6</A>.

 (2.) When we consider of what great use the heavens are to men on
 earth, and how the lights of heavens are <I>divided unto all
 nations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:19,Ge+1:15">Deut. iv. 19, Gen. i. 15</A>),

 we may well say, "<I>Lord, what is man</I> that thou shouldst settle 
 the ordinances of heaven with an eye to him and to his benefit, and 
 that his comfort and convenience should be so consulted in the making 
 of the lights of heaven and directing their motions!"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he expresses this admiration 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Lord, what is man</I> (<I>enosh,</I> sinful, weak, miserable man, a 
 creature so forgetful of thee and his duty to thee) <I>that thou 
 art</I> thus <I>mindful of him,</I> that thou takest cognizance of him 
 and of his actions and affairs, that in the making of the world thou 
 hadst a respect to him!  What is the <I>son of man, that thou visitest 
 him,</I> that thou not only feedest him and clothest him, protectest 
 him and providest for him, in common with other creatures, but visited 
 him as one friend visits another, art pleased to converse with him and 
 concern thyself for him! What is man--(so mean a creature), that he 
 should be thus honoured--(so sinful a creature), that he should be thus 
 countenanced and favoured!" Now this refers,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To mankind in general. Though man is a worm, and the son of man is a 
 worm 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+25:6">Job xxv. 6</A>),

 yet God puts a respect upon him, and shows him abundance of kindness;
 man is, above all the creatures in this lower world, the favourite and 
 darling of Providence.  For,

 (1.) He is of a very honourable rank of beings. We may be sure he takes 
 precedence of all the inhabitants of this lower world, for he is made 
 but a <I>little lower than the angels</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 lower indeed, because by his body he is allied to the earth and to the 
 beasts that perish, and yet by his soul, which is spiritual and 
 immortal, he is so near akin to the holy angels that he may be truly 
 said to be but <I>a little lower than they,</I> and is, in order, next 
 to them. He is but for a little while lower than the angels, while his 
 great soul is cooped up in a house of clay, but the children of the 
 resurrection shall be <B><I>isangeloi</I></B>--<I>angels' peers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:36">Luke xx. 36</A>)

 and no longer lower than they. 

 (2.) He is endued with noble faculties and capacities: <I>Thou hast 
 crowned him with glory and honour.</I> He that gave him his being has 
 distinguished him, and qualified him for a dominion over the inferior 
 creatures; for, having <I>made him wiser than the beasts of the earth 
 and the fowls of heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:11">Job xxxv. 11</A>),

 he has made him fit to rule them and it is fit that they should be
 ruled by him. Man's reason is his crown of glory; let him not profane 
 that crown by disturbing the use of it nor forfeit that crown by acting 
 contrary to its dictates.

 (3.) He is invested with a sovereign dominion over the inferior 
 creatures, under God, and is constituted their lord.  He that made 
 them, and knows them, and whose own they are, has <I>made man to have 
 dominion over them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:6"><I>v.</I>  6</A>.

 His charter, by which he holds this royalty, bears equal date with his
 creation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:28">Gen. i. 28</A>)

 and was renewed after the flood, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:2">Gen. ix. 2</A>.

 God has put all things under man's feet, that he might serve himself,
 not only of the labour, but of the productions and lives of the 
 inferior creatures; they are all delivered into his hand, nay, they are 
 all <I>put under his feet.</I> He specifies some of the inferior 
 animals

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>),

 not only <I>sheep and oxen,</I> which man takes care of and provides 
 for, but <I>the beasts of the field,</I> as well as those of the flood, 
 yea, and those creatures which are most at a distance from man, as 
 <I>the fowl of the air,</I> yea, <I>and the fish of the sea,</I> which 
 live in another element and pass unseen through the paths of the seas. 
 Man has arts to take these; though many of them are much stronger and 
 many of them much swifter than he, yet, one way or other, he is too 
 hard for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:7">Jam. iii. 7</A>.

 <I>Every kind of beasts, and birds, and things in the sea, is tamed,
 and has been tamed.</I> He has likewise liberty to use them as he has 
 occasion. <I>Rise, Peter, kill and eat,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:13">Acts x. 13</A>.

 Every time we partake of fish or of fowl we realize this dominion which
 man has over the works of God's hands; and this is a reason for our 
 subjection to God, our chief Lord, and to his dominion over us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But this refers, in a particular manner, to Jesus Christ. Of him we 
 are taught to expound it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:6-8">Heb. ii. 6-8</A>,

 where the apostle, to prove the sovereign dominion of Christ both in
 heaven and in earth, shows that he is that man, that son of man, here 
 spoken of, whom God <I>has crowned with glory and honour</I> and made 
 to <I>have dominion over the works of his hands.</I> And it is certain 
 that the greatest favour that ever was shown to the human race, and the 
 greatest honour that ever was put upon the human nature, were 
 exemplified in the incarnation and exaltation of the Lord Jesus; these 
 far exceed the favours and honours done us by creation and providence, 
 though they also are great and far more than we deserve. We have reason 
 humbly to value ourselves by it and thankfully to admire the grace of 
 God in it,

 (1.) That Jesus Christ assumed the nature of man, and, in that nature, 
 humbled himself. He became the <I>Son of man,</I> a partaker of flesh 
 and blood; being so, God visited him, which some apply to his 
 sufferings for us, for it is said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:9">Heb. ii. 9</A>),

 <I>For the suffering of death,</I> a visitation in wrath, <I>he was
 crowned with glory and honour.</I> God visited him; having laid upon 
 him the iniquity of us all, he reckoned with him for it, visited him 
 with a rod and with stripes, that we by them might be healed. He was, 
 <I>for a little while</I> (so the apostle interprets it), made lower 
 than the angels, when he took upon him the form of a servant and made 
 himself of no reputation.

 (2.) That, in that nature, he is exalted to be Lord of all. God the 
 Father exalted him, because he had humbled himself, <I>crowned him with 
 glory and honour,</I> the glory which he had with him before the worlds 
 were, set not only the <I>head of the church,</I> but <I>head over all 
 things to the church,</I> and gave all things into his hand, entrusted 
 him with the administration of the kingdom of providence in conjunction 
 with and subserviency to the kingdom of grace. All the creatures are 
 put under his feet; and, even in the days of his flesh, he gave some 
 specimens of his power over them, as when he commanded the winds and 
 the seas, and appointed a fish to pay his tribute. With good reason 
 therefore does the psalmist conclude as he began, <I>Lord, how 
 excellent is thy name in all the earth,</I> which has been honoured 
 with the presence of the Redeemer, and is still enlightened by his 
 gospel and governed by his wisdom and power!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this and praying it over, though we must not forget to 
 acknowledge, with suitable affections, God's common favours to mankind, 
 particularly in the serviceableness of the inferior creatures to us,
 yet we must especially set ourselves to give glory to our Lord Jesus, 
 by confessing that he is Lord, submitting to him as our Lord, and 
 waiting till we see all things put under him and all his enemies made 
 his footstool.</P>
