 In this chapter, after the title of the book

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:1">ver. 1</A>),

 we have Christ and his church, Christ and a believer, expressing their
 esteem for each other.

 I. The bride, the church, speaks to the bridegroom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>),

 to the daughters of Jerusalem

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>),

 and then to the bridegroom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:7">ver. 7</A>.

 II. Christ, the bridegroom, speaks in answer to the complaints and
 requests of his spouse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 III. The church expresses the great value she has for Christ, and the
 delights she takes in communion with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.

 IV. Christ commends the church's beauty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:15">ver. 15</A>.

 V. The church returns the commendation,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>.

 Where there is a fire of true love to Christ in the heart this will be 
 of use to blow it up into a flame.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The song of songs, which <I>is</I> Solomon's.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the title of this book, showing, 

 1. The nature of it; it is a <I>song,</I> that it might the better 
 answer the intention, which is to stir up the affections and to heat 
 them, which poetry will be very instrumental to do. The subject is 
 pleasing, and therefore fit to be treated of in a song, in singing 
 which we may <I>make melody with our hearts unto the Lord.</I> It is 
 evangelical; and gospel-times should be times of joy, for gospel-grace 
 puts a <I>new song</I> into our mouths, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+98:1">Ps. xcviii. 1</A>.

 2. The dignity of it; it is <I>the song of songs,</I> a most excellent 
 song, not only above any human composition, or above all other songs 
 which Solomon penned, but even above any other of the scripture-songs, 
 as having more of Christ in it. 

 3. The penman of it; it is Solomon's. It is not the song of fools, as
 many of the songs of love are, but the song of the wisest of men; nor 
 can any man give a better proof of his wisdom than to celebrate the 
 love of God to mankind and to excite his own love to God and that of 
 others with it. Solomon's songs were a thousand and five
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:32">1 Kings iv. 32</A>);
 
 those that were of other subjects are lost, but this of seraphic love
 remains, and will to the end of time. Solomon, like his father, was
 addicted to poetry, and, which way soever a man's genius lies, he 
 should endeavor to honour God and edify the church with it. One of 
 Solomon's names was <I>Jedidiah</I>--<I>beloved of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:25">2 Sam. xii. 25</A>);

 and none so fit to write of the Lord's love as he that had himself so
 great an interest in it; none of all the apostles wrote so much of love 
 as he that was himself the beloved disciple and lay in Christ's bosom.
 Solomon, as a king, had great affairs to mind and manage, which took up 
 much of his thoughts and time, yet he found heart and leisure for this 
 and other religious exercises. Men of business ought to be devout men, 
 and not to think that business will excuse them from that which is 
 every man's great business--to keep up communion with God. It is not 
 certain when Solomon penned this sacred song. Some think that he penned 
 it after he recovered himself by the grace of God from his 
 backslidings, as a further proof of his repentance, and as if by doing 
 good to many with this song he would atone for the hurt he had perhaps 
 done with loose, vain, amorous songs, when he <I>loved many strange 
 wives;</I> now he turned his wit the right way. It is more probable 
 that he penned it in the beginning of his time, while he kept close to 
 God and kept up his communion with him; and perhaps he put this song, 
 with his father's psalms, into the hands of the chief musician, for the 
 service of the temple, not without a key to it, for the right 
 understanding of it. Some think that it was penned upon occasion of
 his marriage with Pharaoh's daughter, but that is uncertain; the tower 
 of Lebanon, which is mentioned in this book

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:4"><I>ch.</I> vii. 4</A>),

 was not built, as is supposed, till long after the marriage. We may
 reasonably think that when in the height of his prosperity he <I>loved 
 the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:3">1 Kings iii. 3</A>)

 he thus <I>served him with joyfulness and gladness of heart in the
 abundance of all things.</I> It may be rendered, <I>The song of songs, 
 which is concerning Solomon,</I> who as the son and successor of David, 
 on whom the covenant of royalty was entailed, as the founder of the 
 temple, and as one that excelled in wisdom and wealth, was a type of 
 Christ, in whom are <I>hidden all the treasures of wisdom and 
 knowledge,</I> and yet is a greater than Solomon; this is therefore a 
 song concerning him. It is here fitly placed after <I>Ecclesiastes;</I> 
 for when by the book we are thoroughly convinced of the vanity of the 
 creature, and its insufficiency to satisfy us and make a happiness for 
 us, we shall be quickened to seek for happiness in the love of Christ, 
 and that true transcendent pleasure which is to be found only in 
 communion with God through him. The voice in the wilderness, that was 
 to prepare Christ's way, cried, <I>All flesh is grass.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love
 <I>is</I> better than wine.
 &nbsp; 3  Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name <I>is as</I>
 ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.
 &nbsp; 4  Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me
 into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will
 remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.
 &nbsp; 5  I <I>am</I> black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the
 tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
 &nbsp; 6  Look not upon me, because I <I>am</I> black, because the sun hath
 looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they
 made me the keeper of the vineyards; <I>but</I> mine own vineyard have
 I not kept.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The spouse, in this dramatic poem, is here first introduced addressing 
 herself to the bridegroom and then to the daughters of Jerusalem.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To the bridegroom, not giving him any name or title, but beginning 
 abruptly: <I>Let him kiss me;</I> like Mary Magdalen to the supposed 
 gardener 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:15">John xx. 15</A>),

 <I>If thou have borne him hence,</I> meaning Christ, but not naming
 him. The heart has been before taken up with the thoughts of him, and 
 to this relative those thoughts were the antecedent, that good matter 
 which the heart was inditing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:1">Ps. xlv. 1</A>.

 Those that are full of Christ themselves are ready to think that others
 should be so too. Two things the spouse desires, and pleases herself 
 with the thoughts of:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The bridegroom's friendship 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,</I> that is, be 
 reconciled to me, and let me know that he is so; let me have the token 
 of his favour." Thus the Old-Testament church desired Christ's 
 manifesting himself in the flesh, to be no longer under the law as a 
 schoolmaster, under a dispensation of bondage and terror, but to 
 receive the communications of divine grace in the gospel, in which God 
 is reconciling the world unto himself, binding up and healing what by 
 the law was torn and smitten; as the mother kisses the child that she 
 has chidden. "Let him no longer send to me, but come himself, no longer 
 speak by angels and prophets, but let me have the word of his own 
 mouth, those <I>gracious words</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:22">Luke iv. 22</A>),

 which will be to me as the <I>kisses of the mouth,</I> sure tokens of
 reconciliation, as Esau's kissing Jacob was." All gospel duty is summed 
 up in our kissing the Son

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:12">Ps. ii. 12</A>);

 so all gospel-grace is summed up in his kissing us, as the father of
 the prodigal kissed him when he returned a penitent. It is a kiss of
 peace. Kisses are opposed to wounds

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:6">Prov. xxvii. 6</A>),

 so are the kisses of grace to the wounds of the law. Thus all true
 believers earnestly desire the manifestations of Christ's love to their 
 souls; they desire no more to make them happy than the assurance of his 
 favour, the lifting up of the light of his countenance upon them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6,7">Ps. iv. 6, 7</A>),

 and the knowledge of that love of his which surpasses knowledge; this
 is the one thing they desire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:4">Ps. xxvii. 4</A>.

 They are ready to welcome the manifestation of Christ's love to their
 souls by his Spirit, and to return them in the humble professions of 
 love to him and complacency in him, above all. <I>The fruit of his
 lips is peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:19">Isa. lvii. 19</A>.

 "Let him give me ten thousand kisses whose very fruition makes me
 desire him more, and, whereas all other pleasures sour and wither by 
 using, those of the Spirit become more delightful." So bishop Reynolds.
 She gives several reasons for this desire.

 (1.) Because of the great esteem she has for his love: <I>Thy love is 
 better than wine.</I> Wine <I>makes glad the heart,</I> revives the 
 drooping spirits, and exhilarates them, but gracious souls take more 
 pleasure in loving Christ and being beloved of him, in the fruits and 
 gifts of his love and in the pledges and assurances of it, than any man 
 ever took in the most exquisite delights of sense, and it is more 
 reviving to them than ever the richest cordial was to one ready to 
 faint. Note,

 [1.] Christ's love is in itself, and in the account of all the saints, 
 more valuable and desirable than the best entertainments this world can 
 give. 

 [2.] Those only may expect the kisses of Christ's mouth, and the 
 comfortable tokens of his favour, who prefer his love before all 
 delights of the children of men, who would rather forego those delights 
 than forfeit his favour, and take more pleasure in spiritual joys than 
 in any bodily refreshments whatsoever. Observe here the change of the
 person: <I>Let him kiss me;</I> there she speaks of him as absent, or 
 as if she were afraid to speak to him; but, in the next words, she sees 
 him near at hand, and therefore directs her speech to him: "<I>Thy 
 love, thy loves</I>" (so the word is), "I so earnestly desire, because 
 I highly esteem it." 

 (2.) Because of the diffuse fragrancy of his love and the fruits of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Because of the savour of thy good ointment</I> (the agreeableness 
 and acceptableness of thy graces and comforts to all that rightly 
 understand both them and themselves), <I>thy name is as ointment poured 
 forth,</I> thou art so, and all that whereby thou hast made thyself 
 known; thy very name is precious to all the saints; it is an ointment 
 and perfume which rejoice the heart." The unfolding of Christ's name is 
 as the opening of a box of precious ointment, which the room is filled 
 with the odour of. The preaching of his gospel was the <I>manifesting 
 the savour of his knowledge in every place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:14">2 Cor. ii. 14</A>.

 The Spirit was the <I>oil of gladness</I> wherewith Christ was anointed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:9">Heb. i. 9</A>),
 
 and all true believers have that <I>unction</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:27">1 John ii. 27</A>),

 so that he is precious to them, and they to him and to one another.
 <I>A good name</I> is <I>as precious ointment,</I> but Christ's name is 
 more fragrant than any other. Wisdom, like oil, <I>makes the face to
 shine;</I> but the Redeemer outshines, in beauty, all others. The name 
 of Christ is not now like ointment sealed up, as it had been long 
 (<I>Ask not after my name, for it is secret</I>), but like <I>ointment 
 poured forth,</I> which denotes both the freeness and fulness of the 
 communications of his grace by the gospel.

 (3.) Because of the general affection that all holy souls have to him: 
 <I>Therefore do the virgins love thee.</I> It is <I>Christ's love shed 
 abroad in our hearts</I> that draws them out in love to him; all that 
 are pure from the corruptions of sin, that preserve the chastity of 
 their own spirits, and are true to the vows by which they have devoted 
 themselves to God, that not only suffer not their affections to be 
 violated but cannot bear so much as to be solicited by the world and 
 the flesh, those are the virgins that love Jesus Christ and <I>follow 
 him whithersoever he goes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:4">Rev. xiv. 4</A>.

 And, because Christ is the darling of all the <I>pure in heart,</I> let
 him be ours, and let our desires be towards him and towards the 
 <I>kisses of his mouth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The bridegroom's fellowship, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Her petition for divine grace: <I>Draw me.</I> This implies sense 
 of distance from him, desire of union with him. "Draw me to thyself, 
 draw me nearer, draw me home to thee." She had prayed that he would 
 draw nigh to her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 in order to that, she prays that he would draw her nigh to him. 
 "<I>Draw me,</I> not only with the moral suasion which there is in the 
 fragrancy of the good ointments, not only with the attractives of that 
 name which is as ointment poured forth, but with supernatural grace, 
 with the <I>cords of a man</I> and the <I>bands of love,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:4">Hos. xi. 4</A>.

 Christ has told us that none come to him but such as the Father draws,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:44">John vi. 44</A>.

 We are not only weak, and cannot come of ourselves any further than we
 are helped, but we are naturally backward and averse to come, and 
 therefore must pray for those influences and operations of the Spirit, 
 by the power of which we are unwilling made willing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.

 "<I>Draw me,</I> else I move not; overpower the world and the flesh
 that would draw me from thee." We are not driven to Christ, but drawn 
 in such a way as is agreeable to rational creatures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Her promise to improve that grace: <I>Draw me,</I> and then <I>we 
 will run after thee.</I> See how the doctrine of special and effectual 
 grace consists with our duty, and is a powerful engagement and 
 encouragement to it, and yet reserves all the glory of all the good 
 that is in us to God only. Observe, 

 [1.] The flowing forth of the soul after Christ, and its ready 
 compliance with him, are the effect of his grace; we could not run 
 after him if he did not draw us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:5,Php+4:13">2 Cor. iii. 5; Phil. iv. 13</A>.

 [2.] The grace which God gives us we must diligently improve. When 
 Christ by his Spirit draws us we must with our spirits run after him. 
 As God says, <I>I will,</I> and <I>you shall</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+36:27">Ezek. xxxvi. 27</A>),

 so we must say, "<I>Thou shalt</I> and <I>we will;</I> thou shalt
 <I>work in us both to will and to do,</I> and therefore we will work 
 out our own salvation"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:12,13">Phil. ii. 12, 13</A>);

 not only we will walk, but we will run after thee, which denotes
 eagerness of desire, readiness of affection, vigour of pursuit, and 
 swiftness of motion. <I>When thou shalt enlarge my heart</I> then <I>I
 will run the way of thy commandments</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:32">Ps. cxix. 32</A>);

 when <I>thy right hand upholds me</I> then <I>my soul follows hard
 after thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:8">Ps. lxiii. 8</A>);

 when with lovingkindness to us he draws us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:3">Jer. xxxi. 3</A>)

 we with lovingkindness to him must run after him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:31">Isa. xl. 31</A>.

 Observe the difference between the petition and the promise: "Draw me,
 and then we will run." When Christ pours out his Spirit upon the church 
 in general, which is his bride, all the members of it do thence receive 
 enlivening quickening influences, and are made to run to him with the 
 more cheerfulness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:5">Isa. lv. 5</A>.

 Or, "Draw me" (says the believing soul) "and then I will not only
 follow thee myself as fast as I can, but will bring all mine along with 
 me: <I>We will run after thee,</I> I and the <I>virgins that love 
 thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 I and all that I have any interest in or influence upon, <I>I and my 
 house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+24:15">Josh. xxiv. 15</A>),

 I and the <I>transgressors whom I will teach thy ways,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:13">Ps. li. 13</A>.
 
 Those that put themselves forth, in compliance with divine grace, shall
 find that their <I>zeal will provoke many,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:2">2 Cor. ix. 2</A>.

 Those that are lively will be active; when Philip was drawn to Christ
 he drew Nathanael; and they will be exemplary, and so will win those 
 that would not be won by the word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The immediate answer that was given to this prayer: <I>The King 
 has</I> drawn me, has <I>brought me into his chambers.</I> It is not so 
 much an answer fetched by faith from the world of Christ's grace as an 
 answer fetched by experience from the workings of his grace. If we 
 observe, as we ought, the returns of prayer, we may find that 
 sometimes, <I>while we are yet speaking,</I> Christ hears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:24">Isa. lxv. 24</A>.

 The bridegroom is a king; so much the more wonderful is his
 condescension in the invitations and entertainments that he gives us, 
 and so much the greater reason have we to accept of them and to <I>run 
 after him.</I> God is the King that has made the <I>marriage-supper</I> 
 for his Son

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:2">Matt. xxii. 2</A>)

 and brings in even <I>the poor and the maimed,</I> and even the most
 shy and bashful are <I>compelled to come in.</I> Those that are drawn 
 to Christ are brought, not only into his courts, into his palaces

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:15">Ps. xlv. 15</A>),

 but into his presence-chamber, where his secret is with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:21">John xiv. 21</A>),

 and where they are safe in his pavilion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:5,Isa+26:20">Ps. xxvii. 5; Isa. xxvi. 20</A>.

 Those that <I>wait at wisdom's gates</I> shall be <I>made to come</I>
 (so the word is) <I>into her chambers;</I> they shall be led into truth 
 and comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) The wonderful complacency which the spouse takes in the honour 
 which the king put upon her. Being <I>brought into the chamber,</I> 
 
 [1.] "We have what we would have. Our desires are crowned with 
 unspeakable delights; all our griefs vanish, and <I>we will be glad and 
 rejoice.</I> If <I>a day in the courts,</I> much more an hour in the 
 chambers, <I>is better than a thousand,</I> than ten thousand, 
 elsewhere." Those that are, through grace, brought into covenant and 
 communion with God, have reason to <I>go on their way rejoicing,</I> as 
 the eunuch 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:39">Acts viii. 39</A>),

 and that joy will enlarge our hearts and be our strength, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:10">Neh. viii. 10</A>.

 [2.] All our joy shall centre in God: "<I>We will rejoice,</I> not in 
 the ointments, or the chambers, but <I>in thee.</I> It is God only that 
 is our <I>exceeding joy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+43:4">Ps. xliii. 4</A>.

 We have no joy but in Christ, and which we are indebted to him for."
 <I>Gaudium in Domino</I>--<I>Joy in the Lord,</I> was the ancient 
 salutation, and <I>Salus in Domino sempiterna</I>--<I>Eternal salvation 
 in the Lord.</I>

 [3.] "We will retain the relish and savour of this kindness of thine 
 and never forget it: <I>We will remember thy loves more than wine;</I> 
 not only thy love itself
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 but the very remembrance of it shall be more grateful to us than the 
 strongest cordial to the spirits, or the most palatable liquor to the 
 taste. We will remember to give thanks for thy love, and it shall make 
 more durable impressions upon us than any thing in this world."</P>

 (5.) The communion which a gracious soul has with all the saints in 
 this communion with Christ. In the chambers to which we are brought we 
 not only meet with him, but meet with one another 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:7">1 John i. 7</A>);

 for <I>the upright love thee;</I> the congregation, the generation, of
 the <I>upright love thee.</I> Whatever others do, all that are 
 Israelites indeed, and faithful to God, will love Jesus Christ. 
 Whatever differences of apprehension and affection there may be among 
 Christians in other things, this they are all agreed in, Jesus Christ 
 is precious to them. <I>The upright</I> here are the same with the 
 <I>virgins,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 All that <I>remember his love more than wine</I> will love him with a
 superlative love. Nor is any love acceptable to Christ but the love of 
 <I>the upright,</I> love in sincerity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:24">Eph. vi. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To <I>the daughters of Jerusalem,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 The church in general, being in distress, speaks to particular churches 
 to guard them against the danger they were in of being offended at the 
 church's sufferings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+3:3">1 Thess. iii. 3</A>.

 Or the believer speaks to those that were professors at large in the
 church, but not of it, or to weak Christians, babes in Christ, that 
 labour under much ignorance, infirmity, and mistake, not perfectly 
 instructed, and yet willing to be taught in the things of God. She 
 observed these by-standers look disdainfully upon her because of her 
 blackness, in respect both of sins and sufferings, upon the account of 
 which they though she had little reason to expect the kisses she wished 
 for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 or to expect that they should join with her in her joys,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 She therefore endeavors to remove this offence; she owns she is 
 <I>black.</I> Guilt blackens; the heresies, scandals, and offences, 
 that happen in the church, make her <I>black;</I> and the best saints 
 have their failings. Sorrow blackens; that seems to be especially 
 meant; the church is often in a low condition, mean, and poor, and in 
 appearance despicable, her beauty sullied and her face foul with 
 weeping; she is in mourning weeds, clothed with sackcloth, as the 
 Nazarites that had become <I>blacker than a coal,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:8">Lam. iv. 8</A>.

 Now, to take off this offence,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She asserts her own comeliness notwithstanding 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>I am black, but comely,</I> black <I>as the tents of Kedar,</I> in 
 which the shepherds lived, which were very coarse, and never whitened, 
 weather-beaten and discoloured by long use, but comely <I>as the 
 curtains of Solomon,</I> the furniture of whose rooms, no doubt, was 
 sumptuous and rich, in proportion to the stateliness of his houses. The 
 church is sometimes <I>black</I> with persecution, <I>but comely</I> in 
 patience, constancy, and consolation, and never the less amiable in the 
 eyes of Christ, <I>black in the account of men, but comely</I> in God's 
 esteem, <I>black</I> in some that are a scandal to her, <I>but 
 comely</I> in others that are sincere and are an honour to her. True 
 believers are <I>black</I> in themselves, <I>but comely</I> in Christ, 
 with the comeliness that he puts upon them, <I>black</I> outwardly, for 
 <I>the world knows them not,</I> but <I>all glorious within,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:13">Ps. xlv. 13</A>.
 
 St. Paul was <I>weak,</I> and yet <I>strong,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:10">2 Cor. xii. 10</A>.
 
 And so the church is <I>black</I> and yet <I>comely;</I> a believer is
 a sinner and yet a saint; his own righteousnesses are <I>as filthy 
 rags,</I> but he is clothed with the robe of Christ's righteousness.
 The Chaldee Paraphrase applies it to the people of Israel's blackness 
 when they made the golden calf and their comeliness when they repented 
 of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She gives an account how she came to be so black. The blackness was 
 not natural, but contracted, and was owing to the hard usage that had 
 been given her: <I>Look not upon me</I> so scornfully <I>because I am 
 black.</I> We must take heed with what eye we look upon the church, 
 especially when she is in black. <I>Thou shouldst not have looked upon 
 the day of thy brother,</I> the day of his affliction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ob+1:12">Obad. 12</A>.

 Be not offended; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) <I>I am black</I> by reason of my sufferings: <I>The sun has 
 looked upon me.</I> She was fair and comely; whiteness was her proper 
 colour; but she got this blackness by <I>the burden and heat of the 
 day,</I> which she was forced to bear. She was sun-burnt, scorched with 
 tribulation and persecution 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:6,21">Matt. xiii. 6, 21</A>);

 and the greatest beauties, if exposed to the weather, are soonest
 tanned. Observe how she mitigates her troubles; she does not say, as 
 Jacob

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:40">Gen. xxxi. 40</A>),

 <I>In the day the drought consumed me,</I> but, <I>The sun has looked
 upon me;</I> for it becomes not God's suffering people to make the 
 worst of their sufferings. But what was the matter?

 [1.] She fell under the displeasure of those of her own house: <I>My 
 mother's children were angry with me.</I> She was <I>in perils by false 
 brethren;</I> her foes were <I>those of her own house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:36">Matt. x. 36</A>),
 
 brethren by nature as men, by profession as members of the same sacred
 corporation, the children of the church her mother, but not of God her 
 Father; they <I>were angry with</I> her. The Samaritans, who claimed 
 kindred to the Jews, were vexed at any thing that tended to the 
 prosperity of Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:10">Neh. ii. 10</A>.

 Note, It is no new thing for the people of God to fall under the anger
 of their own mother's children. <I>It was thou, a man, my equal,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:12,13">Ps. lv. 12, 13</A>.

 This makes the trouble the more irksome and grievous; from such it is
 taken unkindly, and the anger of such is implacable. <I>A brother 
 offended is hard to be won.</I>

 [2.] They dealt very hardly with her: <I>They made me the keeper of the 
 vineyards,</I> that is, <I>First,</I> "They seduced me to sin, drew me 
 into false worships, to serve their gods, which was like dressing the 
 vineyards, <I>keeping the vine of Sodom;</I> and they would not let me 
 <I>keep my own vineyard,</I> serve my own God, and observe those pure 
 worships which he gave me in charge, and which I do and ever will own 
 for mine." These are grievances which good people complain most of in a 
 time of persecution, that their consciences are forced, and that those 
 who rule them with rigour say <I>to their souls, Bow down, that we may 
 go over,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:23">Isa. li. 23</A>.

 Or, <I>Secondly,</I> "They brought me into trouble, imposed that upon
 me which was toilsome, and burdensome, and very disgraceful." Keeping 
 the vineyards was base servile work, and very laborious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:5">Isa. lxi. 5</A>.

 Her mother's children made her the drudge of the family. <I>Cursed be
 their anger, for it was fierce, and their wrath, for it was cruel.</I> 
 The spouse of Christ has met with a great deal of hard usage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) "My sufferings are such as I have deserved; for <I>my own vineyard 
 have I not kept.</I> How unrighteous soever my brethren are in 
 persecuting me, God is righteous in permitting them to do so. I am 
 justly made a slavish keeper of men's vineyards, because I have been a 
 careless keeper of the vineyards God has entrusted me with." Slothful 
 servants of God are justly made to serve their enemies, <I>that they 
 may know his service, and the service of the kings of the 
 countries,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:8,De+28:47,48,Eze+20:23,24">2 Chron. xii. 8;
 Deut. xxviii. 47, 48; Ezek. xx. 23, 24</A>.

 "Think not the worse of the ways of God for my sufferings, for I smart
 for my own folly." Note, When God's people are oppressed and persecuted 
 it becomes them to acknowledge their own sin to be the procuring cause 
 of their troubles, especially their carelessness in keeping their 
 vineyards, so that it has been like <I>the field of the 
 slothful.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest,

 be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. The humble petition which the spouse presents to her 
 beloved, the shepherdess to the shepherd, the church and every believer 
 to Christ, for a more free and intimate communion with him. She turns 
 from the <I>daughters of Jerusalem,</I> to whom she had complained both 
 of her sins and of her troubles, and looks up to heaven for relief and 
 succour against both, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Here observe,

 1. The title she gives to Christ: <I>O thou whom my soul loveth.</I> 
 Note, It is the undoubted character of all true believers that their 
 souls love Jesus Christ, which intimates both the sincerity and the 
 strength of their love; they <I>love him with all their hearts;</I> and 
 those that do so may come to him boldly and may humbly plead it with 
 him. 

 2. The opinion she has of him as the good shepherd of the sheep; she 
 doubts not but he <I>feeds his flock</I> and <I>makes them rest at 
 noon.</I> Jesus Christ graciously provides both repast and repose for 
 his sheep; they are not starved, but well fed, not scattered upon the 
 mountains, but fed together, fed <I>in green pastures</I> and in the 
 hot time of the day <I>led by the still waters</I> and made to lie down 
 under a cool refreshing shade. Is it with God's people a noon-time of 
 outward troubles, inward conflicts? Christ has rest for them; he
 <I>carries them in his arms,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11">Isa. xl. 11</A>.

 3. Her request to him that she might be admitted into his society:
 <I>Tell me where thou feedest.</I> Those that would be told, that would 
 be taught, what they are concerned to know and do, must apply to Jesus 
 Christ, and beg of him to teach them, to tell them. "Tell me where to 
 find thee, where I may have conversation with thee, <I>where thou 
 feedest</I> and tendest thy flock, that there I may have some of my 
 company." Observe, by the way, We should not, in love to our friends 
 and their company, tempt them or urge them to neglect their business, 
 but desire such an enjoyment of them as will consist with it, and 
 rather, if we can, to join with them in their business and help to 
 forward it. "<I>Tell me where thou feedest,</I> and there I will sit 
 with thee, walk with thee, feed my flocks with thine, and not hinder 
 thee nor myself, but bring my work with me." Note, Those whose souls 
 love Jesus Christ earnestly desire to have communion with him, by his 
 word in which he speaks to us and by prayer in which we speak to him, 
 and to share in the privileges of his flock; and we may learn from the 
 care he takes of his church, to provide convenient food and rest for 
 it, how to take care of our own souls, which are our charge. 

 4. The plea she uses for the enforcing of this request: "<I>For why 
 should I be as one that turns aside by</I> (or after) <I>the flocks of 
 thy companions,</I> that pretend to be so, but are really thy 
 competitors, and rivals with thee." Note, Turning aside from Christ 
 after other lovers is that which gracious souls dread, and deprecate, 
 more than any thing else. "Thou wouldst not have me to <I>turn 
 aside,</I> no, nor to <I>be as one that turns aside;</I> <I>tell me</I> 
 then, O tell me, where I may be near thee, and I will never leave 
 thee."

 (1.) "<I>Why should I</I> lie under suspicion, and look as if I 
 belonged to some other and not to thee? <I>Why should I be</I> thought 
 <I>by the flocks of our companions</I> to be a deserter from thee, and 
 a retainer to some other shepherd?" Good Christians will be afraid of 
 giving any occasion to those about them to question their faith in 
 Christ and their love to him; they would not do any thing that looks 
 like unconcernedness about their souls; or uncharitableness towards 
 their brethren, or that savours of indifference and disaffection to 
 holy ordinances; and we should pray to God to direct us into and keep 
 us in the way of our duty, that we may not so much as <I>seem to come 
 short,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:1">Heb. iv. 1</A>.

 (2.) "<I>Why should I</I> lie in temptation to <I>turn aside,</I> as I 
 do while I am absent from thee?" We should be earnest with God for a 
 settled peace in communion with God through Christ, that we may not be 
 as waifs and strays, ready to be picked up by him that next passes 
 by.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The gracious answer which the bridegroom gives to this request, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 See how ready God is to answer prayer, especially prayers for 
 instruction; even while she is yet speaking, he hears. Observe,

 1. How affectionately he speaks to her: <I>O thou fairest among 
 women!</I> Note, Believing souls are fair, in the eyes of the Lord 
 Jesus, above any other. Christ sees a beauty in holiness, whether we do 
 or no. The spouse has called herself black, but Christ calls her fair. 
 Those that are low in their own eyes are so much the more amiable in 
 the eyes of Jesus Christ. Blushing at their own deformity (says Mr. 
 Durham) is a chief part of their beauty. 

 2. How mildly he checks her for her ignorance, in these words, <I>If 
 thou know not,</I> intimating that she might have known it if it had 
 not been her own fault. What! dost thou not know where to find me and
 my flock? Compare Christ's answer to a like address of Philip's 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:9">John xiv. 9</A>),

 <I>Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me,
 Philip?</I> But,

 3. With what tenderness he acquaints her where she might find him. If
 men say, <I>Lo, here is Christ, or, Lo, he is there, believe them not, 
 go not after them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:23,26">Matt. xxiv. 23, 26</A>.
 
 But,

 (1.) <I>Walk in the way of good men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:20">Prov. ii. 20</A>),

 follow the track, ask for the good old way, observe <I>the footsteps of
 the flock,</I> and <I>go forth by</I> them. It will not serve to sit
 still and cry, "Lord, show me the way," but we must bestir ourselves to 
 enquire out the way; and we may find it by looking which way <I>the 
 footsteps of the flock</I> lead, what has been the practice of godly 
 people all along; let that practice be ours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:12,1Co+11:1">Heb. vi. 12; 1 Cor. xi. 1</A>.

 (2.) Sit under the direction of good ministers: "<I>Feed</I> thyself 
 <I>and thy kids besides the tents of the under-shepherds.</I> Bring thy 
 charge with thee" (it is probable that the custom was to commit the 
 lambs and kids to the custody of the women, the shepherdesses); "they
 shall all be welcome; <I>the shepherds</I> will be no hindrance to 
 thee, as they were to Reuel's daughters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:17">Exod. ii. 17</A>),

 but helpers rather, and therefore abide by their tents." Note, Those
 that would have acquaintance and communion with Christ must closely and 
 conscientiously adhere to holy ordinances, must join themselves to his 
 people and attend his ministers. Those that have the charge of families 
 must bring them with them to religious assemblies; let their 
 <I>kids,</I> their children, their servants, have the benefit of <I>the 
 shepherds' tents.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The high encomiums which the bridegroom gives of his spouse. To be 
 <I>given in marriage,</I> in the Hebrew dialect, is to be 
 <I>praised</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:63">Ps. lxxviii. 63</A>,

 margin), so this spouse is here; her <I>husband praises</I> this
 <I>virtuous woman</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:28">Prov. xxxi. 28</A>);

 he praises her, as is usual in poems, by similitudes.

 1. He calls her his <I>love</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 it is an endearing compellation often used in this book: "My friend, my 
 companion, my familiar."

 2. He compares her to a set of strong and stately <I>horses in 
 Pharaoh's chariots.</I> Egypt was famous for the best horses. Solomon 
 had his thence; and Pharaoh, no doubt, had the choicest the country 
 afforded for his own chariots. The church had complained of her own 
 weakness, and the danger she was in of being made a prey of by her 
 enemies: "Fear not," says Christ; "<I>I have made thee like a company 
 of horses;</I> I have put strength into thee as I have done into <I>the 
 horse</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:19">Job xxxix. 19</A>),

 so that thou shalt with a gracious boldness <I>mock at fear, and not be
 affrighted,</I> like <I>the lion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:1">Prov. xxviii. 1</A>.

 <I>The Lord has made thee as his goodly horse in the day of battle,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+10:3">Zech. x. 3</A>.

 <I>I have compared thee to my company of horses</I> which triumphed
 over <I>Pharaoh's chariots,</I> the holy angels, <I>horses of 
 fire.</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:15">Hab. iii. 15</A>,

 <I>Thou didst walk through the sea with thy horses;</I> and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:13">Isa. lxiii. 13</A>.

 We are weak in ourselves, but if Christ make us as horses, strong and
 bold, we need not fear what all the powers of darkness can do against 
 us.

 3. He admires the beauty and ornaments of her countenance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 <I>Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels,</I> the attire of the 
 head, curls of hair, or favourites (so some), or knots of ribbons; 
 <I>thy neck also with chains,</I> such as persons of the first rank 
 wear, <I>chains of gold.</I> The ordinances of Christ are the ornaments 
 of the church. The graces, gifts, and comforts of the Spirit, are the 
 adorning of every believing soul, and beautify it; these render it, 
 <I>in the sight of God, of great price.</I> The ornaments of the saints 
 are many, but all orderly disposed in <I>rows</I> and <I>chains,</I> in 
 which there is a mutual connexion with and dependence upon each other.
 The beauty is not from any thing in themselves, from the <I>neck</I> or 
 from the <I>cheeks,</I> but from ornaments with which they are set off.
 It was <I>comeliness which I put upon thee, said the Lord God;</I> for 
 we were born not only naked, but polluted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:14">Ezek. xvi. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His gracious purpose to add to her ornaments; for where God has 
 given true grace he will give more grace; <I>to him that has shall be 
 given.</I> Is the church courageous in her resistance of sin, as the 
 <I>horses in Pharaoh's chariots?</I> Is she <I>comely</I> in the 
 exercise of grace, as <I>with rows of jewels</I> and <I>chains of 
 gold?</I> She shall be yet further beautified 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>We will make thee borders of gold,</I> inlaid, or enamelled, <I>with 
 studs of silver.</I> Whatever is wanting shall be made up, till the 
 church and every true believer come to be <I>perfect in beauty;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:14">Ezek. xvi. 14</A>.

 This is here undertaken to be done by the concurring power of the three
 persons in the Godhead: <I>We will</I> do it; like that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:26">Gen. i. 26</A>),

 "<I>Let us make man;</I> so let us new-make him, and perfect his
 beauty." The same that is the author will be the finisher of the good 
 work; and it cannot miscarry.</P>

 1. The humble reverence believers have for Christ as their Sovereign, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He is a <I>King</I> in respect both of dignity and dominion; he wears 
 the crown of honour, he bears the sceptre of power, both which are the 
 unspeakable satisfaction of all his people. This King has his royal 
 table spread in the gospel, in which is <I>made for all nations a feast 
 of fat things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:6">Isa. xxv. 6</A>.
 
 Wisdom has <I>furnished her table,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:1">Prov. ix. 1</A>.
 
 He <I>sits at this table</I> to <I>see his guests</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:11">Matt. xxii. 11</A>),

 to see that nothing be wanting that is fit for them; he <I>sups with
 them</I> and <I>they with him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:20">Rev. iii. 20</A>);

 he has fellowship with them and rejoices in them; he <I>sits at his
 table</I> to bid them welcome, and to carve for them, as Christ 
 <I>broke the five loaves</I> and gave to his disciples, that they might 
 distribute to the multitude. He sits there to receive petitions, as
 Ahasuerus admitted Esther's petition at <I>the banquet of wine.</I> He 
 has promised to be present with his people in his ordinances always.
 Then believers do him all the honour they can, and study how to express 
 their esteem of him and gratitude to him, as Mary did when she anointed 
 his head with <I>the ointment of spikenard</I> that was <I>very 
 costly,</I> one pound of it worth <I>three hundred pence,</I> and so 
 fragrant that <I>the house was filled with the pleasing odour of it</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:3">John xii. 3</A>),

 which story seems as if it were designed to refer to this passage, for
 Christ was then <I>sitting at table.</I> When good Christians, in any 
 religious duty, especially in the ordinance of the Lord's supper, where 
 the King is pleased, as it were, to <I>sit</I> with us <I>at his</I> 
 own <I>table,</I> have their graces exercised, their hearts broken by 
 repentance, healed by faith, and inflamed with holy love and desires 
 toward Christ, with joyful expectations of the glory to be revealed, 
 then the <I>spikenard sends forth the smell thereof.</I> Christ is 
 pleased to reckon himself honoured by it, and to accept of it as an 
 instance of respect to him, as it was in the wise men of the east, who 
 paid their homage to the new-born King of the Jews by presenting to him 
 <I>frankincense and myrrh.</I> The graces of God's Spirit in the hearts 
 of believers are exceedingly precious in themselves and pleasing to 
 Christ, and his presence in ordinances draws them out into act and 
 exercise. If he withdraw, graces wither and languish, as plants in the 
 absence of the sun; if he approach, the face of the soul is renewed, as 
 of the earth in the spring; and then it is time to bestir ourselves, 
 that we may not lose the gleam, not lose the gale; for nothing is done 
 acceptably but what grace does, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:28">Heb. xii. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The strong affection they have for Christ as their <I>beloved,</I> 
 their <I>well-beloved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Christ is not only <I>beloved</I> by all believing souls, but is their 
 <I>well-beloved,</I> their best-beloved, their only beloved; he has 
 that place in their hearts which no rival can be admitted to, the 
 innermost and uppermost place. Observe,

 (1.) How Christ is accounted of by all believers: He is <I>a bundle of 
 myrrh</I> and <I>a cluster of camphire,</I> something, we may be sure, 
 nay, every thing, that is pleasant and delightful. The doctrine of his 
 gospel, and the comforts of his Spirit, are very refreshing to them, 
 and they rest in his love; none of all the delights of sense are 
 comparable to the spiritual pleasure they have in meditating on Christ 
 and enjoying him. There is a complicated sweetness in Christ and an 
 abundance of it; there is <I>a bundle of myrrh</I> and <I>a cluster of 
 camphire.</I> We are not straitened in him whom there is <I>all 
 fulness.</I> The word translated <I>camphire</I> is <I>copher,</I> the 
 same word that signifies <I>atonement</I> or <I>propitiation.</I> 
 Christ is <I>a cluster</I> of merit and righteousness to all believers; 
 <I>therefore</I> he is dear to them because <I>he is the propitiation 
 for their sins.</I> Observe what stress the spouse lays upon the 
 application: He <I>is unto me,</I> and again <I>unto me,</I> all that 
 is sweet; whatever he is to others, he is so <I>to me.</I> He <I>loved 
 me, and gave himself for me.</I> He <I>is my Lord, and my God.</I> 

 (2.) How he is accepted: <I>He shall lie all night between my 
 breasts,</I> near my heart. Christ lays the beloved disciples in his 
 bosom; why then should not they lay their beloved Saviour in their 
 bosoms? Why should not they embrace him with both arms, and hold him 
 fast, with a resolution never to let him go? Christ must <I>dwell in
 the heart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:17">Eph. iii. 17</A>),

 and, in order to that, the adulteries must be put from <I>between the
 breasts</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+2:2">Hos. ii. 2</A>),

 no pretender must have his place in the soul. He shall be as <I>a
 bundle of myrrh,</I> or perfume bag, between <I>my breasts,</I> always 
 sweet to me; or his effigies in miniature, his love-tokens, shall be 
 hung between <I>my breasts,</I> according to the custom of those that 
 are dear to each other. He shall not only be laid their for a while, 
 but shall lie there, shall abide there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Jesus Christ has a great complacency in his church and in every 
 true believer; they are amiable in his eyes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Behold, thou art fair, my love;</I> and again, <I>Behold, thou art 
 fair.</I> He says this, not to make her proud (humility is one 
 principal ingredient in spiritual beauty), but,

 1. To show that there is a real beauty in holiness, that all who are 
 sanctified are thereby beautified; they are truly fair. 

 2. That he takes great delight in that good work which his grace has 
 wrought on the souls of believers; so that though they have their 
 infirmities, whatever they think of themselves, and the world thinks of 
 them, he thinks them fair. He calls them friends. The <I>hidden man of 
 the heart, in that which is not corruptible,</I> is <I>in the sight of 
 God of great price,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:4">1 Pet. iii. 4</A>.

 3. To comfort weak believers, who are discouraged by their own
 blackness; let them be told again and again that they are fair. 

 4. To engage all who are sanctified to be very thankful for that grace
 which has made them fair, who by nature were deformed, and changed the 
 Ethiopian's skin. One instance of the beauty of the spouse is here 
 mentioned, that she <I>has doves' eyes,</I> as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:1"><I>ch.</I> iv. 1</A>.

 Those are fair, in Christ's account, who have, not the piercing eye of
 the eagle, but the pure and chaste eye of the <I>dove,</I> not like the 
 hawk, who, when he soars upwards, still has his eye upon the prey on 
 earth, but a humble modest eye, such an eye as discovers a simplicity 
 and godly sincerity and a dove-like innocency, eyes enlightened and 
 guided by the Holy Spirit, that blessed Dove, weeping eyes. I did 
 <I>mourn as a dove,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:16">Ezek. vii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The church expresses her value for Christ, and returns esteem 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Behold, thou art fair.</I> See how Christ and believers praise one 
 another. Israel saith of God, <I>Who is like thee?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:11">Exod. xv. 11</A>.

 And God saith of Israel, <I>Who is like thee?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:29">Deut. xxxiii. 29</A>.

 Lord, saith the church, "Dost thou call me <I>fair?</I> No; if we speak
 of strength, <I>thou art strong</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:19">Job ix. 19</A>),

 so, if of beauty, <I>thou art fair.</I> I am fair no otherwise than as
 I have thy image stamped upon me. Thou art the great Original; I am but 
 a faint and imperfect copy, I am but thy <I>umbra</I>--<I>the shadow of 
 thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:16,3:34">John i. 16; iii. 34</A>.

 Thou art fair in thyself and (which is more) <I>pleasant</I> to all
 that are thine. Many are fair enough to look at, and yet the sourness
 of their temper renders them unpleasant; but <I>thou art fair, yea, 
 pleasant.</I>" Christ is pleasant, as he is ours, in covenant with us, 
 in relation to us. "Thou art pleasant now, when the <I>King sits at his 
 table.</I>" Christ is always precious to believers, but in a special 
 manner pleasant when they are admitted into communion with him, when 
 they hear his voice, and see his face, and taste his love. <I>It is 
 good to be here.</I> Having expressed her esteem of her husband's 
 person, she next, like a loving spouse, that is transported with joy 
 for having disposed of herself so well, applauds the accommodations he 
 had for her entertainment, his <I>bed,</I> his <I>house,</I> his 
 <I>rafters</I> or <I>galleries</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 which may be fitly applied to those holy ordinances in which believers 
 have fellowship with Jesus Christ, receive the tokens of his love and 
 return their pious and devout affections to him, increase their 
 acquaintance with him and improve their advantages by him. Now,

 1. These she calls <I>ours,</I> Christ and believers having a
 joint-interest in them. As husband and wife are <I>heirs together</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:7">1 Pet. iii. 7</A>),

 so believers are <I>joint-heirs with Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:17">Rom. viii. 17</A>.

 They are his institutions and their privileges; in them Christ and
 believers meet. She does not call them <I>mine,</I> for a believer will 
 own nothing as his but what Christ shall have an interest in, nor 
 <I>thine,</I> for Christ has said, <I>All that I have is thine,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+15:31">Luke xv. 31</A>.

 All is <I>ours</I> if we are Christ's. Those that can by faith lay
 claim to Christ may lay claim to all that is his.

 2. These are the best of the kind. Does the colour of the bed, and the 
 furniture belonging to it, help to set it off? <I>Our bed is green,</I> 
 a colour which, in a pastoral, is preferred before any other, because 
 it is the colour of the fields and groves where the shepherd's business 
 and delight are. It is a refreshing colour, good for the eyes; and it 
 denotes fruitfulness. <I>I am like a green olive-tree,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:8">Ps. lii. 8</A>.
 
 We are <I>married to</I> Christ, <I>that we should bring forth unto
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:4">Rom. vii. 4</A>.
 
 <I>The beams of our house are cedar</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),
 
 which probably refers to the temple Solomon had lately built for 
 communion between God and Israel, which was of <I>cedar,</I> a strong 
 sort of wood, sweet, durable, and which will never rot, typifying the 
 firmness and continuance of the church, the gospel-temple. The 
 galleries for walking are <I>of fir,</I> or <I>cypress,</I> some sort 
 of wood that was pleasing both to the sight and to the smell, 
 intimating the delight which the saints take in walking with Christ and 
 conversing with him. Every thing in the covenant of grace (on which 
 foot all their treaties are carried on) is very firm, very fine, and 
 very fragrant.</P>
