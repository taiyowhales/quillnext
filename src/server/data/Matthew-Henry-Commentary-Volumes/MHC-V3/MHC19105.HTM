 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some of the psalms of praise are very short, others very long, to teach 
 us that, in our devotions, we should be more observant how our hearts 
 work than how the time passes and neither overstretch ourselves by 
 coveting to be long nor over-stint ourselves by coveting to be short, 
 but either the one or the other as we find in our hearts to pray. This 
 is a long psalm; the general scope is the same with most of the psalms, 
 to set forth the glory of God, but the subject-matter is particular. 
 Every time we come to the throne of grace we may, if we please, furnish 
 ourselves out of the word of God (out of the history of the New 
 Testament, as this out of the history of the Old) with new songs, with 
 fresh thoughts--so copious, so various, so inexhaustible is the subject.
 In the foregoing psalm we are taught to praise God for his wondrous 
 works of common providence with reference to the world in general. In 
 this we are directed to praise him for his special favours to his 
 church. We find the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:1-11,1Ch+16:8-18">first eleven verses</A>

 of this psalm in the beginning of that psalm which David delivered to
 Asaph to be used (as it should seem) in the daily service of the
 sanctuary when the ark was fixed in the place he had prepared for it,
 by which it appears both who penned it and when and upon what occasion
 it was penned,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:7-36">1 Chron. xvi. 7</A>,

 &c. David by it designed to instruct his people in the obligations
 they lay under to adhere faithfully to their holy religion. Here is the 
 preface

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>)

 and the history itself in several articles.

 I. God's covenant with the patriarchs,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 II. His care of them while they were strangers,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 III. His raising up Joseph to be the shepherd and stone of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:16-22">ver. 16-22</A>.

 IV. The increase of Israel in Egypt and their deliverance out of Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:23-38">ver. 23-38</A>.

 V. The care he took of them in the wilderness and their settlement in 
 Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:39-45">ver. 39-45</A>.

 In singing this we must give to God the glory of his wisdom and power, 
 his goodness and faithfulness, must look upon ourselves as concerned in 
 the affairs of the Old-Testament church, both because to it were 
 committed the oracles of God, which are our treasure, and because out 
 of it Christ arose, and these things happened to it for ensamples.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O give thanks unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; call upon his name: make known
 his deeds among the people.
 &nbsp; 2  Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his
 wondrous works.
 &nbsp; 3  Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
 seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 4  Seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and his strength: seek his face evermore.
 &nbsp; 5  Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders,
 and the judgments of his mouth;
 &nbsp; 6  O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his
 chosen.
 &nbsp; 7  He <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God: his judgments <I>are</I> in all the
 earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Our devotion is here warmly excited; and we are stirred up, that we may 
 stir up ourselves to praise God. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The duties to which we are here called, and they are many, but the 
 tendency of them all is to give unto God the glory due unto his name. 

 1. We must <I>give thanks to him,</I> as one who has always been our 
 bountiful benefactor and requires only that we give him thanks for his 
 favours--poor returns for rich receivings. 

 2. <I>Call upon his name,</I> as one whom you depend upon for further
 favours. Praying for further mercies is accepted as an acknowledgment 
 of former mercies. <I>Because he has inclined his ear unto me, 
 therefore will I call upon him.</I> 

 3. <I>Make known his deeds</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 that others may join with you in praising him. <I>Talk of all his 
 wondrous works</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 as we talk of things that we are full of, and much affected with, and 
 desire to fill others with. God's wondrous works ought to be the 
 subject of our familiar discourses with our families and friends, and 
 we should talk of them <I>as we sit in the house and as we go by the 
 way</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:7">Deut. vi. 7</A>),

 not merely for entertainment, but for the exciting of devotion and the
 encouraging of our own and others' faith and hope in God. Even sacred 
 things may be the matter of common talk, provided it be with due 
 reverence.

 4. <I>Sing psalms</I> to God's honour, as those that rejoice in him,
 and desire to testify that joy for the encouragement of others and to 
 transmit it to posterity, as memorable things anciently were handed 
 down by songs, when writing was scarce. 

 5. <I>Glory in his holy name;</I> let those that are disposed to glory
 not boast of their own accomplishments and achievements, but of their
 acquaintance with God and their relation to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:23,24">Jer. ix. 23, 24</A>.

 <I>Praise you his holy name,</I> so some; but it comes all to one, for 
 in glorying in him we give glory to him. 

 6. <I>Seek him;</I> place your happiness in him, and then pursue that 
 happiness in all the ways that he has appointed. <I>Seek the Lord and
 his strength,</I> that is, the <I>ark of his strength;</I> seek him in 
 the sanctuary, in the way wherein he has appointed us to seek him. 
 <I>Seek his strength,</I> that is, his grace, the strength of his 
 Spirit to work in you that which is good, which we cannot do but by 
 strength derived from him, for which he will be enquired of. <I>Seek 
 the Lord and be strengthened;</I> so divers ancient versions read it. 
 Those that would be <I>strengthened in the inward man</I> must fetch in 
 strength from God by faith and prayer. Seek <I>his strength,</I> and
 then <I>seek his face;</I> for by his strength, we hope to prevail with 
 him for his favour, as Jacob did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:3">Hos. xii. 3</A>.

 "<I>Seek his face evermore;</I> seek to have his favour to eternity,
 and therefore continue seeking it to the end of the time of your 
 probation. Seek it while you live in this world, and you shall have it 
 while you live in the other world, and even there shall be for ever 
 seeking it in an infinite progression, and yet be for ever satisfied in 
 it."

 7. <I>Let the hearts of those rejoice that do seek him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 for they have chosen well, are well fixed, and well employed, and they 
 may be sure that their labour will not be in vain, for he will not only 
 be found, but he will be found the <I>rewarder of those that diligently 
 seek him.</I> If those have reason to rejoice that <I>seek the 
 Lord,</I> much more those that have <I>found him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Some arguments to quicken us to these duties. 

 1. "Consider both what he has said and what he has done to engage us
 for ever to him. You will see yourselves under all possible obligations 
 to give thanks to him, and call upon his name, if you remember the 
 wonders which should make deep and durable impressions upon you,--the 
 wonders of his providence which he has <I>wrought for you</I> and those 
 who are gone before you, the <I>marvellous works that he has done,</I> 
 which will be had in everlasting remembrance with the thoughtful and 
 with the grateful,--the wonders of his law, which he has written to 
 you, and entrusted you with, <I>the judgments of his mouth,</I> as well 
 as the judgments of his hand,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 2. "Consider the relation you stand in to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>You are the seed of Abraham his servant;</I> you are born in his 
 house, and being thereby entitled to the privilege of his servants, 
 protection and provision, you are also bound to do the duty of 
 servants, to attend your Master, consult his honour, obey his commands, 
 and do what you can to advance his interests. You are <I>the children 
 of Jacob his chosen,</I> and are <I>chosen</I> and <I>beloved</I> for 
 the fathers' sake, and therefore ought to tread in the steps of those 
 whose honours you inherit. You are the children of godly parents; do not
 degenerate. You are God's church upon earth, and, if you do not praise 
 him, who should?" 

 3. Consider your interest in him: <I>He is the Lord our God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 We depend upon him, are devoted to him, and from him our expectation
 is. <I>Should not a people seek unto their God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:19">Isa. viii. 19</A>)

 and praise their God? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:4">Dan. v. 4</A>.

 He is <I>Jehovah our God.</I> He that is our God is self-existent and 
 self-sufficient, has an irresistible power and incontestable 
 sovereignty: <I>His judgments are in all the earth;</I> he governs the 
 whole world in wisdom, and gives law to all nations, even to those that 
 know him not. The earth is full of the proofs of his power.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word <I>which</I> he
 commanded to a thousand generations.
 &nbsp; 9  Which <I>covenant</I> he made with Abraham, and his oath unto
 Isaac;
 &nbsp; 10  And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, <I>and</I> to Israel
 <I>for</I> an everlasting covenant:
 &nbsp; 11  Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
 your inheritance:
 &nbsp; 12  When they were <I>but</I> a few men in number; yea, very few, and
 strangers in it.
 &nbsp; 13  When they went from one nation to another, from <I>one</I>
 kingdom to another people;
 &nbsp; 14  He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings
 for their sakes;
 &nbsp; 15  <I>Saying,</I> Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no
 harm.
 &nbsp; 16  Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the
 whole staff of bread.
 &nbsp; 17  He sent a man before them, <I>even</I> Joseph, <I>who</I> was sold for
 a servant:
 &nbsp; 18  Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
 &nbsp; 19  Until the time that his word came: the word of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 tried him.
 &nbsp; 20  The king sent and loosed him; <I>even</I> the ruler of the
 people, and let him go free.
 &nbsp; 21  He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his
 substance:
 &nbsp; 22  To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
 wisdom.
 &nbsp; 23  Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land
 of Ham.
 &nbsp; 24  And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger
 than their enemies.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here taught, in praising God, to look a great way back, and to 
 give him the glory of what he did for his church in former ages, 
 especially when it was in the founding and forming, which those in its 
 latter ages enjoy the benefit of and therefore should give thanks for. 
 Doubtless we may fetch as proper matter for praise from the histories 
 of the gospels, and the acts of the apostles, which relate the birth of 
 the Christian church, as the psalmist here does from the histories of 
 Genesis and Exodus, which relate the birth of the Jewish church; and 
 our histories greatly outshine theirs. Two things are here made the 
 subject of praise:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God's promise to the patriarchs, that great promise that he would 
 give to their seed the land of Canaan for an inheritance, which was a 
 type of the promise of eternal life made in Christ to all believers. In 
 all the marvellous works which God did for Israel <I>he remembered his 
 covenant</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 and he will remember it <I>for ever;</I> it is <I>the word which he 
 commanded to a thousand generations.</I> See here the power of the 
 promise; it is the word which he commanded and which will take effect.
 See the perpetuity of the promise; it is commanded <I>to a thousand 
 generations,</I> and the entail of it shall not be cut off. In the 
 parallel place it is expressed as our duty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:15">1 Chron. xvi. 15</A>),
 
 <I>Be you mindful always of his covenant.</I> God will not forget it
 and therefore we must not. The promise is here called a
 <I>covenant,</I> because there was something required on man's part as
 the condition of the promise. Observe, 

 1. The persons with whom this covenant was made--with Abraham, Isaac,
 and Jacob, grandfather, father, and son, all eminent believers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:8,9">Heb. xi. 8, 9</A>.

 2. The ratifications of the covenant; it was made sure by all that is
 sacred. Is that sure which is sworn to? It is his oath to Isaac and to
 Abraham. See to whom God <I>swore by himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:13,14">Heb. vi. 13, 14</A>.

 Is that sure which has passed <I>into a law?</I> He <I>confirmed the
 same for a law,</I> a law never to be repealed. Is that sure which is 
 reduced to a mutual contract and stipulation? This is confirmed <I>for 
 an everlasting covenant,</I> inviolable. 

 3. The covenant itself: <I>Unto thee will I give the land of
 Canaan,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The patriarchs had a right to it, not by providence, but by promise; 
 and their seed should be put in possession of it, not by the common 
 ways of settling nations, but by miracles; God will give it to them 
 himself, as it were with his own hand; it shall be given to them as 
 their lot which God assigns them and measures out to them, as <I>the 
 lot of their inheritance,</I> a sure title, by virtue of their birth; 
 it shall come to them by descent, not by purchase, by the favour of 
 God, and not any merit of their own. Heaven is the inheritance we have
 obtained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:11">Eph. i. 11</A>.

 And <I>this is the promise which God has promised us</I> (as Canaan was
 the promise he promised them), <I>even eternal life,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:25,Tit+1:2">1 John ii. 25; Tit. i. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His providences concerning the patriarchs while they were waiting 
 for the accomplishment of this promise, which represent to us the care 
 God takes of his people in this world, while they are yet on this side 
 the heavenly Canaan; for these things <I>happened unto them for 
 examples</I> and encouragements to all the heirs of promise, that life 
 by faith as they did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were wonderfully protected and sheltered, and (as the Jewish 
 masters express it) <I>gathered under the wings of the divine 
 Majesty.</I> This is accounted for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:12-15"><I>v.</I> 12-15</A>.
 
 Here we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How they were exposed to injuries from men. To the three renowned 
 patriarchs, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, God's promises were very 
 rich; again and again he told them he would be their God; but his 
 performances in this world were so little proportionable that, if he 
 had not <I>prepared for them a city</I> in the other world, he would 
 have been <I>ashamed to be called their God</I> (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:16">Heb. xi. 16</A>),

 because he was always generous; and yet even in this world he was not 
 wanting to them, but that he might appear, to do uncommon things for 
 them, he exercised them with uncommon trials. 

 [1.] They were few, very few. Abraham was called alone

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:2">Isa. li. 2</A>);

 he had but two sons, and one of them he cast out; Isaac had but two,
 and one of them was forced for many years to flee from his country;
 Jacob had more, but some of them, instead of being a defence to him,
 exposed him, when (as he himself pleads, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+34:30">Gen. xxxiv. 30</A>)

 he was but few in number, and therefore might easily be destroyed by 
 the natives, he and his house. God's chosen are but a little flock, 
 few, very few, and yet upheld. 

 [2.] They were strangers, and therefore were the most likely to be 
 abused and to meet with strange usage, and the less able to help 
 themselves. Their religion made them to be looked upon as strangers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:4">1 Pet. iv. 4</A>)

 and to be hooted at as <I>speckled birds,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:9">Jer. xii. 9</A>.

 Though the whole land was theirs by promise, yet they were so far from
 producing and pleading their grant that they <I>confessed themselves 
 strangers in it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:13">Heb. xi. 13</A>.

 [3.] They were unsettled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>They went from one nation to another,</I> from one part of that land 
 to another (for it was then in the holding and occupation of divers 
 nations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:8,13:3,18">Gen. xii. 8; xiii. 3, 18</A>);
 
 nay, <I>from one kingdom to another people,</I> from Canaan to Egypt,
 from Egypt to the land of the Philistines, which could not but weaken 
 and expose them; yet they were forced to it by famine. Note, Though
 frequent removals are neither desirable nor commendable, yet sometimes 
 there is a just and necessary occasion for them, and they may be the 
 lot of some of the best men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How they were guarded by the special providence of God, the wisdom
 and power of which were the more magnified by their being so many ways 
 exposed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 They were not able to help themselves and yet, 

 [1.] No men were suffered to wrong them, but even those that hated 
 them, and would gladly have done them a mischief, had their hands tied, 
 and could not do what they would. This may refer to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+35:5">Gen. xxxv. 5</A>,

 where we find that <I>the terror of God</I> (an unaccountable
 restraint) <I>was upon the cities that were round about them,</I> so 
 that, though provoked, <I>they did not pursue after the sons of 
 Jacob.</I> 

 [2.] Even crowned heads, that did offer to wrong them, were not only 
 checked and chidden for it, but controlled and baffled: <I>He reproved 
 kings for their sakes</I> in dreams and visions, <I>saying, "Touch not 
 my anointed;</I> it is at your peril if you do, nay, it shall not be in 
 your power to do it; <I>do my prophets no harm.</I>" Pharaoh king of 
 Egypt was plagued

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+12:17">Gen. xii. 17</A>)
 
 and Abimelech king of Gerar was sharply rebuked

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+20:6">Gen. xx. 6</A>)

 for doing wrong to Abraham. Note, <I>First,</I> Even kings themselves
 are liable to God's rebukes if they do wrong. <I>Secondly,</I> God's
 prophets are his anointed, for they have the unction <I>of the 
 Spirit,</I> that <I>oil of gladness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:27">1 John ii. 27</A>.
 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> Those that offer to touch God's prophets, with design
 to harm them, may expect to hear of it one way or other. God is jealous 
 for his prophets; whoso <I>touches them touches the apple of his eye. 
 Fourthly,</I> Even those that <I>touch the prophets,</I> nay that 
 <I>kill the prophets</I> (as many did), cannot <I>do them any harm,</I> 
 any real harm. <I>Lastly,</I> God's anointed prophets are dearer to him 
 than anointed kings themselves. Jeroboam's hand was withered when it 
 was stretched out against a prophet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They were wonderfully provided for and supplied. And here also, 

 (1.) They were reduced to great extremity. Even in Canaan, the land of 
 promise, <I>he called for a famine,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Note, All judgments are at God's call, and no place is exempt from 
 their visitation and jurisdiction when God sends them forth with 
 commission. To try the faith of the patriarchs, God <I>broke the whole 
 staff of bread,</I> even in that good land, that they might plainly see 
 God designed them a better country than that was. 

 (2.) God graciously took care for their relief. It was in obedience to 
 his precept, and in dependence upon his promise, that they were now 
 sojourners in Canaan, and therefore he could not in honour suffer any 
 evil to befal them or any good thing to be wanting to them. As he 
 restrained one Pharaoh from doing them wrong, so he raised up another 
 to do them a kindness, by preferring and entrusting Joseph, of whose 
 story we have here an abstract. He was to be the shepherd and stone of 
 Israel and to save that holy <I>seed alive,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:24,50:20">Gen. xlix. 24; l. 20</A>.

 In order to this, 

 [1.] He was humbled, greatly humbled

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>):
 
 <I>God sent a man before them, even Joseph.</I> Many years before the 
 famine began, he was sent before them, to nourish them in the famine; 
 so vast are the foresights and forecasts of Providence, and so long its 
 reaches. But in what character did <I>he</I> go to Egypt who was to 
 provide for the reception of the church there? He went not in quality 
 of an ambassador, no, nor so much as a factor or commissary; but <I>he 
 was sold</I> thither <I>for a servant,</I> a slave for term of life, 
 without any prospect of being ever set at liberty. This was low enough, 
 and, one would think, set him far enough from any probability of being 
 great. And yet he was brought lower; he was made a prisoner 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 
 <I>His feet they hurt with fetters.</I> Being unjustly charged with a 
 crime no less heinous than a rape upon his mistress, <I>the iron 
 entered into his soul,</I> that is, was very painful to him; and the 
 false accusation which was the cause of his imprisonment did in a 
 special manner grieve him, and went to his heart; yet all this was the 
 way to his preferment. 

 [2.] He was exalted, highly exalted. He continued a prisoner, neither 
 tried nor bailed, <I>until the time</I> appointed of God for his 
 release

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 when <I>his word came,</I> that is, his interpretations of the dreams 
 came to pass, and the report thereof came to Pharaoh's ears by the 
 chief butler. And then <I>the word of the Lord cleared him;</I> that 
 is, the power God gave him to foretel things to come rolled away the 
 reproach his mistress had loaded him with; for it could not be thought 
 that God would give such a power to so bad a man as he was represented 
 to be. <I>God's word tried him,</I> tried his faith and patience, and
 then it came in power to give command for his release. There is a time 
 set when God's word will come for the comfort of all that trust in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:3">Hab. ii. 3</A>.

 <I>At the end it shall speak, and not lie.</I> God gave the word, and
 then <I>the king sent and loosed him;</I> for the king's heart is in 
 the hand of the Lord. Pharaoh, finding him to be a favourite of Heaven, 
 <I>First,</I> Discharged him from his imprisonment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 He <I>let him go free.</I> God has often, by wonderful turns of 
 providence, pleaded the cause of oppressed innocency. <I>Secondly,</I>
 He advanced him to the highest posts of honour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 He made him lord high chamberlain of his household (<I>he made him lord 
 of his house</I>); nay, he put him into the office of lord-treasurer, 
 <I>the ruler of all his substance.</I> He made him prime-minister of 
 state, lord-president of his council, to <I>command his princes at his 
 pleasure</I> and <I>teach them wisdom,</I> and general of his forces.
 <I>According to thy word shall all my people be ruled,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:40,43,44">Gen. xli. 40, 43, 44</A>.

 He made him lord chief justice, to judge even his senators and punish
 those that were disobedient. In all this Joseph was designed to be, 

 1. A father to the church that then was, to save the house of Israel
 from perishing by the famine. He was made great, that he might <I>do 
 good, especially</I> in <I>the household of faith.</I> 

 2. A figure of Christ that was to come, who, because he humbled himself 
 and took upon him the form of a servant, was highly exalted, and has 
 all judgment committed to him. Joseph being thus sent before, and put 
 into a capacity of maintaining all his father's house, <I>Israel also 
 came into Egypt</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 where he and all his were very honourably and comfortably provided for 
 many years. Thus the New-Testament church has a place provided for her 
 even in the wilderness, where <I>she is nourished for a time, times, 
 and half a time,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:14">Rev. xii. 14</A>.

 Verily she shall be fed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They were wonderfully multiplied, according to the promise made to 
 Abraham that his seed should be as the sand of the sea for multitude, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 In Egypt <I>he increased his people greatly;</I> they multiplied like 
 fishes, so that in a little time they became <I>stronger than their 
 enemies</I> and formidable to them. Pharaoh took notice of it.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+1:9">Exod. i. 9</A>,

 <I>The children of Israel are more and mightier than we.</I> When God 
 pleases <I>a little one shall become a thousand;</I> and God's 
 promises, though they work slowly, work surely.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly
 with his servants.
 &nbsp; 26  He sent Moses his servant; <I>and</I> Aaron whom he had chosen.
 &nbsp; 27  They showed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of
 Ham.
 &nbsp; 28  He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not
 against his word.
 &nbsp; 29  He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
 &nbsp; 30  Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers
 of their kings.
 &nbsp; 31  He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, <I>and</I> lice
 in all their coasts.
 &nbsp; 32  He gave them hail for rain, <I>and</I> flaming fire in their
 land.
 &nbsp; 33  He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the
 trees of their coasts.
 &nbsp; 34  He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillars, and that
 without number,
 &nbsp; 35  And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the
 fruit of their ground.
 &nbsp; 36  He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of
 all their strength.
 &nbsp; 37  He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and <I>there
 was</I> not one feeble <I>person</I> among their tribes.
 &nbsp; 38  Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell
 upon them.
 &nbsp; 39  He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in
 the night.
 &nbsp; 40  <I>The people</I> asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied
 them with the bread of heaven.
 &nbsp; 41  He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in
 the dry places <I>like</I> a river.
 &nbsp; 42  For he remembered his holy promise, <I>and</I> Abraham his
 servant.
 &nbsp; 43  And he brought forth his people with joy, <I>and</I> his chosen
 with gladness:
 &nbsp; 44  And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited
 the labour of the people;
 &nbsp; 45  That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After the history of the patriarchs follows here the history of the 
 people of Israel, when they grew into a nation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their affliction in Egypt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>He turned</I> the <I>heart</I> of the Egyptians, who had protected 
 them, <I>to hate</I> them and <I>deal subtilely</I> with them. God's 
 goodness to his people exasperated the Egyptians against them; and, 
 though their old antipathy to the Hebrews (which we read of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+43:32,46:34">Gen. xliii. 32; xlvi. 34</A>)

 was laid asleep for a while, yet now it revived with more violence than
 ever: formerly they hated them because they despised them, now because 
 they feared them. They <I>dealt subtilely</I> with them, set all their
 politics on work to find out ways and means to weaken them, and waste 
 them, and prevent their growth; they made their burdens heavy and their 
 lives bitter, and slew their male children as soon as they were born. 
 Malice is crafty to destroy: Satan has the serpent's subtlety, with his 
 venom. It was God that turned the hearts of the Egyptians against them; 
 for every creature is that to us that he makes it to be, a friend or an 
 enemy. Though God is not the author of the sins of men, yet he serves
 his own purposes by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their deliverance out of Egypt, that work of wonder, which, that it 
 might never be forgotten, is put into the preface to the ten 
 commandments. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The instruments employed in that deliverance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>He sent Moses his servant</I> on this errand and joined Aaron in 
 commission with him. Moses was designed to be their lawgiver and chief 
 magistrate, Aaron to be their chief priest; and therefore, that they 
 might respect them the more and submit to them the more cheerfully, God 
 made use of them as their deliverers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The means of accomplishing that deliverance; these were the plagues 
 of Egypt. Moses and Aaron observed their orders, in summoning them just 
 as God appointed them, and <I>they rebelled not against his word</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>)

 as Jonah did, who, when he was sent to denounce God's judgments against 
 Nineveh, went to Tarshish. Moses and Aaron were not moved, either with 
 a foolish fear of Pharaoh's wrath or a foolish pity of Egypt's misery, 
 to relax or retard any of the plagues which God ordered them to inflict 
 on the Egyptians, but stretched forth their hand to inflict them as God 
 appointed. Those that are instructed to execute judgment will find 
 their remissness construed as a rebellion against God's word. The 
 plagues of Egypt are here called God's <I>signs, and his wonders</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 they were not only proofs of his power, but tokens of his wrath, and to 
 be looked upon with admiration and holy awe. <I>They showed the words 
 of his signs</I> (so it is in the original), for every plague had an 
 exposition going along with it; they were not, as the common works of 
 creation and providence, silent signs, but speaking ones, and they 
 spoke aloud. They are all or most of them here specified, though not in 
 the order in which they were inflicted.
 
 (1.) The plague of darkness, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 This was one of the last, though here mentioned first. God <I>sent 
 darkness,</I> and, coming with commission, it came with efficacy; his 
 command <I>made it dark. And</I> then <I>they</I> (that is, the people 
 of Israel) <I>rebelled not against God's word,</I> namely, a command 
 which some think was given them to circumcise all among them that had 
 not been circumcised, in doing which the three days' darkness would be 
 a protection to them. The old translation follows the LXX., and reads 
 it, <I>They were not obedient to his word,</I> which may be applied to 
 Pharaoh and the Egyptians, who, notwithstanding the terror of this 
 plague, <I>would not let the people go;</I> but there is no ground for 
 it in the Hebrew.

 (2.) The turning of the river Nilus (which they idolized) <I>into
 blood,</I> and all their other waters, which <I>slew their fish</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 and so they were deprived, not only of their drink, but of the 
 daintiest of their meat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:5">Num. xi. 5</A>.

 (3.) The frogs, shoals of which their land brought forth, which poured
 in upon them, not only in such numbers, but with such fury, that they 
 could not keep them out of the <I>chambers of their kings</I> and great 
 men, whose hearts had been full of vermin, more nauseous and more 
 noxious-contempt of, and enmity to, both God and his Israel. 

 (4.) Flies of divers sorts swarmed in their air, and lice in their 
 clothes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+8:17,24">Exod. viii. 17, 24</A>.

 Note, God can make use of the meanest, and weakest, and most despicable
 animals, for the punishing and humbling of proud oppressors, to whom 
 the impotency of the instrument cannot but be a great mortification, as 
 well as an undeniable conviction of the divine omnipotence. 

 (5.) Hail-stones shattered their trees, even the strongest timber-trees 
 in <I>their coasts,</I> and killed their vines, and their other 
 fruit-trees,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>.

 Instead of rain to cherish their trees, he gave them hail to crush 
 them, and with it thunder and lightning, to such a degree that the 
 <I>fire ran along upon the ground,</I> as if it had been a stream of 
 kindled brimstone,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:23">Exod. ix. 23</A>.

 (6.) <I>Locusts and caterpillars</I> destroyed <I>all the</I> herbs
 which were made for the service of man and ate the bread out of their
 mouths, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>.

 See what variety of judgments God has, wherewith to plague proud 
 oppressors, that will not let his people go. God did not bring the same 
 plague twice, but, when there was occasion for another, it was still a 
 new one; for he has many arrows in his quiver. Locusts and caterpillars 
 are God's armies; and, how weak soever they are singly, he can raise 
 such numbers of them as to make them formidable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+1:4,6">Joel i. 4, 6</A>.

 (7.) Having mentioned all the plagues but those of the murrain and 
 boils, he concludes with that which gave the conquering stroke, and 
 that was the death of <I>the first-born,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 In the dead of the night the joys and hopes of their families, <I>the 
 chief of their strength</I> and flower of their land, were all struck 
 dead by the destroying angel. They would not release God's first-born,
 and therefore God seized theirs by way of reprisal, and thereby forced 
 them to dismiss his too, when it was too late to retrieve their own; 
 for <I>when God judges he will overcome,</I> and those will certainly 
 sit down losers at last that contend with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The mercies that accompanied this deliverance. In their bondage, 
 
 (1.) They had been impoverished, and yet they came out rich and 
 wealthy. God not only brought them forth, but he <I>brought them forth 
 with silver and gold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 God empowered them to ask and collect the contributions of their 
 neighbours (which were indeed but part of payment for the service they 
 had done them) and inclined the Egyptians to furnish them with what 
 they asked. Their wealth was his, and therefore he might, their hearts 
 were in his hand, and therefore he could, give it to the Israelites. 
 
 (2.) Their lives had been made bitter to them, and their bodies and 
 spirits broken by their bondage; and yet, when God brought them forth, 
 <I>there was not one feeble person,</I> none sick, none so much as 
 sickly, <I>among their tribes.</I> They went out that very night that 
 the plague swept away all the first-born of Egypt, and yet they went 
 out all in good health, and brought not with them any of the diseases 
 of Egypt. Surely never was the like, that among so many thousands there 
 was not one sick! So false was the representation which the enemies of 
 the Jews, in after-ages, gave of this matter, that they were all sick 
 of a leprosy, or some loathsome disease, and that therefore the 
 Egyptians thrust them out of their land. 

 (3.) They had been trampled upon and insulted over; and yet they were 
 brought out with honour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>):

 <I>Egypt was glad when they departed;</I> for God had so wonderfully 
 owned them, and pleaded their cause, that <I>the fear of Israel fell 
 upon them,</I> and they owned themselves baffled and overcome. God can 
 and will make his church <I>a burdensome stone</I> to all that <I>heave 
 at it</I> and seek to displace it, so that those shall think themselves 
 happy that get out of its way,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:3">Zech. xii. 3</A>.

 <I>When God judges, he will overcome.</I> 

 (4.) They had spent their days in sorrow and in sighing, by reason of 
 their bondage; but now he brought them forth <I>with joy and 
 gladness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 When Egypt's cry for grief was loud, their first-born being all slain, 
 Israel's shouts for joy were as loud, both when they looked back upon 
 the land of slavery out of which they were rescued and when they looked 
 forward to the pleasant land to which they were hastening. God now put 
 a new song into their mouth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The special care God took of them in the wilderness. 

 (1.) For their shelter. Besides the canopy of heaven, he provided them 
 another heavenly canopy: He <I>spread a cloud for a covering</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>),

 which was to them not only a screen and umbrella, but a cloth of state. 
 A cloud was often God's pavilion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:11">Ps. xviii. 11</A>)

 and now it was Israel's; for they also were his hidden ones. 

 (2.) For their guidance and refreshment in the dark. He appointed a 
 pillar of <I>fire to give light in the night,</I> that they might never 
 be at a loss. Note, God graciously provides against all the grievances 
 of his people, and furnishes them with convenient succours for every 
 condition, for day and night, till they come to heaven, where it will 
 be all day to eternity. 

 (3.) He fed them both with necessaries and dainties. Sometimes he 
 furnished their tables with wild fowl

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):
 
 <I>The people asked, and he brought quails;</I> and, when they were not 
 thus feasted, yet they were abundantly satisfied <I>with the bread of 
 heaven.</I> Those are curious and covetous indeed who will not be so 
 satisfied. Man did eat angels' food, and that constantly and on 
 free-cost. And, as every bit they ate had miracle in it, so had every 
 drop they drank: <I>He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>.

 Common providence fetches waters from heaven, and bread out of the 
 earth; but for Israel the divine power brings bread from the clouds and 
 water from the rocks: so far is the God of nature from being tied to 
 the laws and courses of nature. The water did not only gush out once,
 but it ran <I>like a river,</I> plentifully and constantly, and 
 attended their camp in all their removes; hence they are said to have 
 the <I>rock follow them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:4">1 Cor. x. 4</A>),

 and, which increased the miracle, this <I>river of God</I> (so it might
 be truly called) <I>ran in dry places,</I> and yet was not drunk in and
 lost, as one would have expected it to be, by the sands of the desert
 of Arabia. To this that promise alludes, <I>I will give rivers in the
 desert, to give drink to my chosen,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:19,20">Isa. xliii. 19, 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Their entrance, at length, into Canaan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>):

 <I>He gave them the lands of the heathen,</I> put them in possession of 
 that which they had long been put in hopes of; and what the Canaanites 
 had taken pains for God's Israel had the enjoyment of: <I>They 
 inherited the labour of the people;</I> and the wealth of the sinner is 
 laid up for the just. The Egyptians had long inherited their labours, 
 and now they inherited the labours of the Canaanites. Thus sometimes 
 one enemy of the church is made to pay another's scores.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. The reasons why God did all this for them. 

 (1.) Because he would himself perform the promises of the word,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>.

 They were unworthy and unthankful, yet he did those great things in 
 their favour <I>because he remembered the word of his holiness</I> 
 (that is, his covenant) <I>with Abraham his servant,</I> and he would 
 not suffer one iota or tittle of that to fall to the ground. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:8">Deut. vii. 8</A>.

 (2.) Because he would have them to perform the precepts of the word, to
 bind them to which was the greatest kindness he could put upon them. He 
 put them in possession of Canaan, not that they might live in plenty 
 and pleasure, in ease and honour, and might make a figure among the 
 nations, but <I>that they might observe his statutes and keep his 
 laws,</I>--that, being formed into a people, they might be under God's 
 immediate government, and revealed religion might be the basis of their 
 national constitution,--that, having a good land given them, they might 
 out of the profits of it bring sacrifices to God's altar,--and that, 
 God having thus done them good, they might the more cheerfully receive 
 his law, concluding that also designed for their good, and might be 
 sensible of their obligations in gratitude to live in obedience to him.
 We are <I>therefore</I> made, maintained, and redeemed, that we may 
 live in obedience to the will of God; and the hallelujah with which the 
 psalm concludes may be taken both as a thankful acknowledgment of God's 
 favours and as a cheerful concurrence with this great intention of 
 them. Has God done so much for us, and yet does he expect so little 
 from us? <I>Praise you the Lord.</I></P>
