 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It appears by the title that this psalm was penned with a particular 
 reference to the malicious imputations that David was unjustly laid 
 under by some of his enemies. Being thus wronged, 

 I. He applies to God for favour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. He appeals to God concerning his innocency as to those things
 whereof he was accused, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 III. He prays to God to plead his cause and judge for him against his
 persecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.

 IV. He expresses his confidence in God that he would do so, and would
 return the mischief upon the head of those that designed it against him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:10-16">ver. 10-16</A>.

 V. He promises to give God the glory of his deliverance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:17">ver. 17</A>.

 In this David was a type of Christ, who was himself, and still is in
 his members, thus injured, but will certainly be righted at last.</P>

 <P>Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the Lord, concerning the words
 of Cush the Benjamite.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God, in thee do I
 put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and
 deliver me:
 &nbsp; 2  Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending <I>it</I> in pieces,
 while <I>there is</I> none to deliver.
 &nbsp; 3  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in
 my hands;
 &nbsp; 4  If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;
 (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
 &nbsp; 5  Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take <I>it;</I> yea, let him
 tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the
 dust. Selah.
 &nbsp; 6  Arise, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the
 rage of mine enemies: and awake for me <I>to</I> the judgment <I>that</I>
 thou hast commanded.
 &nbsp; 7  So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about:
 for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
 &nbsp; 8  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall judge the people: judge me, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, according
 to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity <I>that is</I> in
 me.
 &nbsp; 9  Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but
 establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and
 reins.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Shiggaion</I> is a <I>song</I> or <I>psalm</I> (the word is used so 
 only here and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:1">Hab. iii. 1</A>)

 --a <I>wandering</I> song (so some), the matter and composition of the
 several parts being different, but artificially put together--a 
 <I>charming</I> song (so others), very delightful. David not only 
 penned it, but sang it himself in a devout religious manner unto the 
 Lord, <I>concerning the words</I> or affairs <I>of Cush the 
 Benjamite,</I> that is, of Saul himself, whose barbarous usage of David 
 bespoke him rather a Cushite, or Ethiopian, than a true-born Israelite.
 Or, more likely, it was some kinsman of Saul named <I>Cush,</I> who was 
 an inveterate enemy to David, misrepresented him to Saul as a traitor, 
 and (which was very needless) exasperated Saul against him, one of 
 those children of men, children of Belial indeed, whom David complains 
 of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+26:19">1 Sam. xxvi. 19</A>),

 that made mischief between him and Saul. David, thus basely abused, has
 recourse to the Lord. The injuries men do us should drive us to God, 
 for to him we may commit our cause. Nay, he sings to the Lord; his 
 spirit was not ruffled by it, nor cast down, but so composed and 
 cheerful that he was still in tune for sacred songs and it did not 
 occasion one jarring string in his harp. Thus let the injuries we 
 receive from men, instead of provoking our passions, kindle and excite 
 our devotions. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:1-9">these verses</A>,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He puts himself under God's protection and flies to him for succour 
 and shelter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>Lord, save me, and deliver me</I> from the power and malice of 
 <I>all those that persecute me,</I> that they may not have their will 
 against me." He pleads,

 1. His relation to God. "Thou art <I>my God,</I> and therefore whither
 else should I go but to thee? Thou art my God, and therefore my shield 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:1">Gen. xv. 1</A>),

 my God, and therefore I am one of thy servants, who may expect to be
 protected."

 2. His confidence in God: "Lord, save me, for I depend upon thee:
 <I>In thee do I put my trust,</I> and not in any arm of flesh." Men of 
 honour will not fail those that repose a trust in them, especially if 
 they themselves have encouraged them to do so, which is our case. 

 3. The rage and malice of his enemies, and the imminent danger he was
 in of being swallowed up by them: "Lord, save me, or I am gone; he will 
 <I>tear my soul like a lion</I> tearing his prey," with so much pride, 
 and pleasure, and power, so easily, so cruelly. St. Paul compares Nero 
 to a lion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:17">2 Tim. iv. 17</A>),
 
 as David here compares Saul.

 4. The failure of all other helpers: "Lord, be thou pleased to deliver 
 me, for otherwise <I>there is none to deliver,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It is the glory of God to help the helpless.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He makes a solemn protestation of his innocency as to those things 
 whereof he was accused, and by a dreadful imprecation appeals to God, 
 the searcher of hearts, concerning it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>.
 
 Observe, in general,

 1. When we are falsely accused by men it is a great comfort if our own
 consciences acquit us--</P>

 <P> 

 and not only they cannot prove their calumnies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+24:13">Acts xxiv. 13</A>),

 but our hearts can disprove them, to our own satisfaction.

 2. God is the patron of wronged innocency. David had no court on earth 
 to appeal to. His prince, who should have righted him, was his sworn 
 enemy. But he had the court of heaven to fly to, and a righteous Judge 
 there, whom he could call <I>his God.</I> And here see,

 (1.) What the indictment is which he pleads not guilty to. He was 
 charged with a traitorous design against Saul's crown and life, that he 
 compassed and imagined to depose and murder him, and, in order to that, 
 levied war against him. This he utterly denies. He never did this; 
 there was no iniquity of this kind in his hand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 he abhorred the thought of it. He never <I>rewarded evil</I> to Saul 
 when he was <I>at peace with him,</I> nor to any other,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Nay, as some think it should be rendered, he never rendered evil for 
 evil, never did those mischief that had injured him.

 (2.) What evidence he produces of his innocency. It is hard to prove a 
 negative, and yet this was a negative which David could produce very 
 good proof of: <I>I have delivered him that without cause is my 
 enemy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 By <I>this</I> it appeared, beyond contradiction, that David had no 
 design against Saul's life--that, once and again, Providence so ordered 
 it that Saul lay at his mercy, and there were those about him that 
 would soon have dispatched him, but David generously and 
 conscientiously prevented it, when he cut off his skirt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:4">1 Sam. xxiv. 4</A>)

 and afterwards when he took away his spear

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+26:12">1 Sam. xxvi. 12</A>),

 to attest for him what he could have done. Saul himself owned both
 these to be undeniable proofs of David's integrity and good affection 
 to him. If we render good for evil, and deny ourselves the 
 gratifications of our passion, our so doing may turn to us for a 
 testimony, more than we think of, another day. 

 (3.) What doom he would submit to if he were guilty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Let the enemy persecute my soul</I> to the death, and my good name 
 when I am gone: let him <I>lay my honour in the dust.</I> This 
 intimates,

 [1.] That, if he had been indeed injurious to others, he had reason to 
 expect that they would repay him in the same coin. He that has his hand 
 against every man must reckon upon it that every man's hand will be 
 against him.

 [2.] That, in that case, he could not with any confidence go to God and 
 beg of him to deliver him or plead his cause. It is a presumptuous 
 dangerous thing for any that are guilty, and suffer justly, to appeal 
 to God, as if they were innocent and suffered wrongfully; such must 
 humble themselves and accept the punishment of their iniquity, and not 
 expect that the righteous God will patronise their unrighteousness.

 [3.] That he was abundantly satisfied in himself concerning his 
 innocency. It is natural to us to wish well to ourselves; and therefore 
 a curse to ourselves, if we swear falsely, has been thought as awful a 
 form of swearing as any. With such an oath, or imprecation, David here
 ratifies the protestation of his innocency, which yet will not justify 
 us in doing the like for every light and trivial cause; for the 
 occasion here was important.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Having this testimony of his conscience concerning his innocency, 
 he humbly prays to God to appear for him against his persecutors, and 
 backs every petition with a proper plea, as one that knew how to order 
 his cause before God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He prays that God would manifest his wrath against his enemies, and 
 pleads their wrath against him: "Lord, they are unjustly angry at me, 
 be thou justly angry with them and let them know that thou art so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 <I>In thy anger lift up thyself</I> to the seat of judgment, and make 
 thy power and justice conspicuous, <I>because of the rage,</I> the 
 furies, the outrages (the word is plural) <I>of my enemies.</I>" Those 
 need not fear men's wrath against them who have God's wrath for them.
 <I>Who knows the power of his anger?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He prays that God would plead his cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He prays, <I>Awake for me to judgment</I> (that is, let my cause 
 have a hearing), to <I>the judgment which thou hast commanded;</I> this 
 speaks, 

 [1.] The divine power; as he blesses effectually, and is therefore said 
 to <I>command the blessing,</I> so he judges effectually, and is 
 therefore said to <I>command the judgment,</I> which is such as none 
 can countermand; for it certainly carries execution along with it.

 [2.] The divine purpose and promise: "It is the judgment which thou 
 hast determined to pass upon all the enemies of thy people. Thou hast 
 commanded the princes and judges of the earth to give redress to the 
 injured and vindicate the oppressed; Lord, awaken thyself to that 
 judgment." He that loves righteousness, and requires it in others, will 
 no doubt execute it himself. Though he seem to connive at wrong, as one 
 asleep, he will awake in due time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:65">Ps. lxxviii. 65</A>)

 and will make it to appear that the delays were no neglects.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He prays 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 "<I>Return thou on high,</I> maintain thy own authority, resume thy 
 royal throne of which they have despised the sovereignty, and the 
 judgment-seat of which they have despised the sentence. Return on high, 
 that is, visibly and in the sight of all, that it may be universally 
 acknowledged that heaven itself owns and pleads David's cause." Some 
 make this to point at the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ, 
 who, when he returned to heaven (returned on high in his exalted 
 state), had all judgment committed to him. Or it may refer to his 
 second coming, when he shall return on high to this world, to execute 
 judgment upon all. This return his injured people wait for, and pray 
 for, and to it they appeal from the unjust censures of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He prays again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 "<I>Judge me,</I> judge for me, give sentence on my side." To enforce 
 this suit,

 [1.] He pleads that his cause was now brought into the proper court: 
 <I>The Lord shall judge the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He is the Judge of all the earth, and therefore no doubt he will do 
 right and all will be obliged to acquiesce in his judgment.

 [2.] He insists upon his integrity as to all the matters in variance 
 between him and Saul, and desires only to be judged, in this matter, 
 according to his righteousness, and the sincerity of his heart in all 
 the steps he had taken towards his preferment.

 [3.] He foretels that it would be much for the glory of God and the 
 edification and comfort of his people if God would appear for him: 
 "<I>So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about;</I> 
 therefore do it for their sakes, that they may attend thee with their 
 raises and services in the courts of thy house." <I>First,</I> They 
 will do it of their own accord. God's appearing on David's behalf, and 
 fulfilling his promise to him, would be such an instance of his 
 righteousness, goodness, and faithfulness, as would greatly enlarge the 
 hearts of all his faithful worshippers and fill their mouths with 
 praise. David was the darling of his country, especially of all the 
 good people in it; and therefore, when they saw him in a fair way to 
 the throne, they would greatly rejoice and give thanks to God; crowds 
 of them would attend his footstool with their praises for such a 
 blessing to their land. <I>Secondly,</I> If David come into power, as
 God has promised him, he will take care to bring people to church by 
 his influence upon them, and the ark shall not be neglected, as it was 
 <I>in the days of Saul,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:3">1 Chron. xiii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He prays, in general, for the conversion of sinners and the 
 establishment of saints 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>O let the wickedness,</I> not only of my wicked enemies, but <I>of 
 all the wicked, come to an end! but establish the just.</I>" Here are 
 two things which everyone of us must desire and may hope for:--

 (1.) The destruction of sin, that it may be brought to an end in 
 ourselves and others. When corruption is mortified, when every wicked 
 way and thought are forsaken, and the stream which ran violently 
 towards the world and the flesh is driven back and runs towards God and 
 heaven, then the wickedness of the wicked comes to an end. When there 
 is a general reformation of manners, when atheists and profane are 
 convinced and converted, when a stop is put to the spreading of the 
 infection of sin, so that evil men proceed no further, their folly 
 being made manifest, when the wicked designs of the church's enemies 
 are baffled, and their power is broken, and the man of sin is 
 destroyed, then the <I>wickedness of the wicked comes to an end.</I> 
 And this is that which all that love God, and for his sake hate evil, 
 desire and pray for. 

 (2.) The perpetuity of righteousness: <I>But establish the just.</I> As 
 we pray that the bad maybe made good, so we pray that the good may be 
 made better, that they may not be seduced by the wiles of the wicked 
 nor shocked by their malice, that they may be confirmed in their choice 
 of the ways of God and in their resolution to persevere therein, may be 
 firm to the interests of God and religion and zealous in their 
 endeavours to bring <I>the wickedness of the wicked to an end.</I> His 
 plea to enforce this petition is, <I>For the righteous God trieth the 
 hearts and the reins;</I> and therefore he knows the secret wickedness 
 of the wicked and knows how to bring it to an end, and the secret 
 sincerity of the just he is witness to and has secret ways of 
 establishing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As far as we have the testimony of an unbiased conscience for us that 
 in any instance we are wronged and injuriously reflected on, we may, in 
 singing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:1-9">these verses</A>,

 lodge our appeal with the righteous God, and be assured that he will
 own our righteous cause, and will one day, in the last day at furthest, 
 bring forth our integrity as the light.</P>

 ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
 &nbsp; 14  Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived
 mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David having lodged his appeal with God by prayer and a solemn 
 profession of his integrity, in the former part of the psalm, in this 
 latter part does, as it were, take out judgment upon the appeal, by 
 faith in the word of God, and the assurance it gives of the happiness 
 and safety of the righteous and the certain destruction of wicked 
 people that continue impenitent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David is confident that he shall find God his powerful protector and 
 Saviour, and the patron of his oppressed innocency 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>My defence is of God.</I> Not only, God is my defender, and I shall 
 find him so; but I look for defence and safety in no other; my hope for 
 shelter in a time of danger is placed in God alone; if I have defence, 
 it must be of God." <I>My shield is upon God</I> (so some read it); 
 there is that in God which gives an assurance of protection to all that 
 are his. His name is a strong tower, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:10">Prov. xviii. 10</A>.

 Two things David builds this confidence upon:--

 1. The particular favour God has for all that are sincere: <I>He saves 
 the upright in heart,</I> saves them with an everlasting salvation, and 
 therefore will <I>preserve them to his heavenly kingdom;</I> he saves 
 them out of their present troubles, as far as is good for them; their 
 integrity and uprightness will preserve them. The upright in heart are 
 safe, and ought to think themselves so, under the divine protection.

 2. The general respect he has for justice and equity: <I>God judgeth 
 the righteous;</I> he owns every righteous cause, and will maintain it 
 in every righteous man, and will protect him. <I>God is a righteous 
 Judge</I> (so some read it), who not only doeth righteousness himself, 
 but will take care that righteousness be done by the children of men 
 and will avenge and punish all unrighteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is no less confident of the destruction of all his persecutors, 
 even as many of them as would not <I>repent, to give glory to God.</I> 
 He reads their doom here, for their good, if possible, that they might 
 cease from their enmity, or, however, for his own comfort, that he 
 might not be afraid of them nor aggrieved at their prosperity and 
 success for a time. He goes into the sanctuary of God, and there 
 understands,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they are children of wrath. They are not to be envied, for God 
 is angry with them, is <I>angry with the wicked every day.</I> They are 
 every day doing that which is provoking to him, and he resents it, and 
 treasures it up <I>against the day of wrath.</I> As his mercies are new 
 every morning towards his people, so his anger is new every morning 
 against the wicked, upon the fresh occasions given for it by their 
 renewed transgressions. God is angry with the wicked even in the 
 merriest and most prosperous of their days, even in the days of their 
 devotion; for, if they be suffered to prosper, it is in wrath; if they 
 pray, their very prayers are an abomination. The wrath of God abides 
 upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:36">John iii. 36</A>)
 
 and continual additions are made to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they are children of death, as all the children of wrath are, 
 sons of perdition, marked out for ruin. See their destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God will destroy them. The destruction they are reserved for is 
 <I>destruction from the Almighty,</I> which ought to be a terror to 
 every one of us, for it comes from the <I>wrath of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.
 
 It is here intimated, 

 [1.] That the destruction of sinners may be prevented by their 
 conversion, for it is threatened with that proviso: <I>If he turn 
 not</I> from his evil way, if he do not let fall his enmity against the 
 people of God, then let him expect it will be his ruin; but, if he 
 turn, it is implied that his sin shall be pardoned and all shall be 
 well. Thus even the threatenings of wrath are introduced with a 
 gracious implication of mercy, enough to justify God for ever in the 
 destruction of those that perish; they might have turned and lived, but 
 they chose rather to go on and die and their blood is therefore upon 
 their own heads.

 [2.] That, if it be not thus prevented by the conversion of the sinner, 
 it will be prepared for him by the justice of God. In general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 <I>He has prepared for him the instruments of death,</I> of all that 
 death which is the wages of sin. If God will slay, he will not want 
 instruments of death for any creature; even the least and weakest may 
 be made so when he pleases. <I>First,</I> Here is variety of 
 instruments, all which breathe threatenings and slaughter. Here is a
 sword, which wounds and kills at hand, a bow and arrows, which wound 
 and kill at a distance those who think to get out of the reach of God's 
 vindictive justice. If the sinner <I>flees from the iron weapon,</I> 
 yet the <I>bow of steel shall strike him through,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:24">Job xx. 24</A>.
 
 <I>Secondly,</I> These instruments of death are all said to be made
 ready. God has them not to seek, but always at hand. <I>Judgments are 
 prepared for scorners. Tophet is prepared of old. Thirdly,</I> While 
 God is preparing his instruments of death, he gives the sinners timely 
 warning of their danger, and space to repent and prevent it. He is slow 
 to punish, and <I>long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any 
 should perish. Fourthly,</I> The longer the destruction is delayed, to 
 give time for repentance, the sorer will it be and the heavier will it 
 fall and lie for ever if that time be not so improved; while God is 
 waiting the sword is in the whetting and the bow in the drawing.
 <I>Fifthly,</I> The destruction of impenitent sinners, though it come 
 slowly, yet comes surely; for it is <I>ordained,</I> they are of old 
 ordained to it. <I>Sixthly,</I> Of all sinners persecutors are set up 
 as the fairest marks of divine wrath; against them, more than any 
 other, God has ordained his arrows. They set God at defiance, but 
 cannot set themselves out of the reach of his judgments.</P>

 (2.) They will destroy themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:14-16"><I>v.</I> 14-16</A>.

 The sinner is here described as taking a great deal of pains to ruin 
 himself, more pains to damn his soul than, if directed aright, would 
 save it. His conduct is described,

 [1.] By the pains of a labouring woman that brings forth a false 
 conception, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 The sinner's head with its politics <I>conceives mischief,</I> 
 contrives it with a great deal of art, lays the plot deep, and keeps it 
 close; the sinner's heart with its passions <I>travails with 
 iniquity,</I> and is in pain to be delivered of the malicious projects 
 it is hatching against the people of God. But what does it come to when 
 it comes to the birth? It is falsehood; it is a cheat upon himself; it 
 is a lie in his right hand. He cannot compass what he intended, nor, if 
 he gain his point, will he gain the satisfaction he promised himself.
 He brings forth <I>wind</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:18">Isa. xxvi. 18</A>),
 
 <I>stubble</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:11">Isa. xxxiii. 11</A>),

 <I>death</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:5">James i. 15</A>),
 
 that is, <I>falsehood.</I>

 [2.] By the pains of a labouring man that works hard to dig a pit, and 
 then falls into it and perishes in it. <I>First,</I> This is true, in
 a sense of all sinners. They prepare destruction for themselves by 
 preparing themselves for destruction, loading themselves with guilt and 
 submitting themselves to their corruptions. <I>Secondly,</I> It is 
 often remarkably true of those who contrive mischief against the people 
 of God or against their neighbours; by the righteous hand of God it is 
 made to <I>return upon their own heads.</I> What they designed for the 
 shame and destruction of others proves to be their own confusion.</P>

 In singing this psalm we must do as David here does 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>praise the Lord according to his righteousness,</I> that is, give 
 him the glory of that gracious protection under which he takes his 
 afflicted people and of that just vengeance with which he will pursue 
 those that afflict them. Thus we must sing to the praise of the Lord 
 most high, who, when his enemies deal proudly, shows that he is above 
 them.</P>
