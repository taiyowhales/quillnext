 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Better <I>is</I> the poor that walketh in his integrity, than <I>he
 that is</I> perverse in his lips, and is a fool.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here see, 

 1. What will be the credit and comfort of a poor man, and make him more 
 excellent than his neighbour, though his poverty may expose him to 
 contempt and may dispirit him. Let him be honest and <I>walk in 
 integrity,</I> let him keep a good conscience and make it appear that 
 he does so, let him always speak and act with sincerity when he is 
 under the greatest temptations to dissemble and break his word, and 
 then let him value himself upon that, for all wise and good men will 
 value him. He is better, has a better character, is in a better 
 condition, is better beloved, and lives to better purpose, than many a 
 one that looks great and makes a figure. 

 2. What will be the shame of a rich man, notwithstanding all his pomp. 
 If he have a shallow head and an evil tongue, if he is <I>perverse in 
 his lips and is a fool,</I> if he is a wicked man and gets what he has 
 by fraud and oppression, he <I>is a fool,</I> and an honest poor man is 
 to be preferred far before him.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr19_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  Also, <I>that</I> the soul <I>be</I> without knowledge, <I>it is</I> not
 good; and he that hasteth with <I>his</I> feet sinneth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things are here declared to be of bad consequence:--

 1. Ignorance: <I>To be without the knowledge of the soul is not 
 good,</I> so some read it. Know we not our own selves, our own hearts? 
 <I>A soul without knowledge is not good;</I> it is a great privilege 
 that we have souls, but, if these souls have not knowledge, what the 
 better are we? If man <I>has not understanding, he is as the 
 beasts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:20">Ps. xlix. 20</A>.

 An ignorant soul cannot be a good soul. That the soul be without 
 knowledge is not safe, nor pleasant; what good can the soul do, of what 
 is it good for, if it be without knowledge?

 2. Rashness. <I>He that hastes with his feet</I> (that does things
 inconsiderately and with precipitation, and will not take time to 
 ponder the path of his feet) <I>sins;</I> he cannot but often miss the 
 mark and take many a false step, which those prevent that consider 
 their ways. As good not know as not consider.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr19_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart
 fretteth against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here two instances of men's folly:--

 1. That they bring themselves into straits and troubles, and run 
 themselves a-ground, and embarrass themselves: <I>The foolishness of 
 man perverts his way.</I> Men meet with crosses and disappointments in 
 their affairs, and things do not succeed as they expected and wished, 
 and it is owing to themselves and their own folly; it is their own 
 iniquity that corrects them. 

 2. That when they have done so they lay the blame upon God, and their 
 hearts fret against him, as if he had done them wrong, whereas really 
 they wrong themselves. In fretting, we are enemies to our own peace, 
 and become self-tormentors; in <I>fretting against the Lord</I> we 
 affront him, his justice, goodness, and sovereignty; and it is very 
 absurd to take occasion from the trouble which we pull upon our own 
 heads by our wilfulness, or neglect, to quarrel with him, when we ought 
 to blame ourselves, for it is our own doing. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:1">Isa. l. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from
 his neighbour.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. We may see how strong men's love of money is, that they will love 
 any man, how undeserving soever he be otherwise, if he has but a deal 
 of money and is free with it, so that they may hope to be the better 
 for it. Wealth enables a man to send many presents, make many 
 entertainments, and do many good offices, and so gains him many 
 friends, who pretend to love him, for they flatter him and make their 
 court to him, but really love what he has, or rather love themselves, 
 hoping to get by him. 

 2. We may see how weak men's love of one another is. He who, while he
 prospered, was beloved and respected, if he fall into poverty is 
 <I>separated from his neighbour,</I> is not owned nor looked upon, not 
 visited nor regarded, is bidden to keep his distance and told he is 
 troublesome. Even one that has been his neighbour and acquaintance will 
 turn his face from him and pass by on the other side. Because men's
 consciences tell them they ought to relieve and succour such, they are 
 willing to have this excuse, that they did not see them.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr19_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  A false witness shall not be unpunished, and <I>he that</I>
 speaketh lies shall not escape.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 1. The sins threatened--bearing <I>false witness</I> in judgment and 
 <I>speaking lies</I> in common conversation. Men could not arrive at 
 such a pitch of impiety as to bear false witness (where to the guilt of 
 a lie is added that of perjury and injury) if they had not advanced to 
 it by allowing themselves to speak untruths in jest and banter, or 
 under pretence of doing good. Thus men <I>teach their tongues to speak 
 lies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:5">Jer. ix. 5</A>.

 Those that will take a liberty to tell lies in discourse are in a fair 
 way to be guilty of the greater wickedness of false-witness-bearing, 
 whenever they are tempted to it, though they seemed to detest it. Those 
 that can swallow a false word debauch their consciences, so that a 
 false oath will not choke them.

 2. The threatening itself: They <I>shall not go unpunished;</I> they 
 <I>shall not escape.</I> This intimates that that which emboldens them 
 in the sin is the hope of impunity, it being a sin which commonly 
 escapes punishment from men, though the law is strict, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:18,19">Deut. xix. 18, 19</A>.
 
 But it <I>shall not escape</I> the righteous judgment of God, who is 
 jealous, and will not suffer his name to be profaned; we know where all 
 liars will have their everlasting portion.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man
 <I>is</I> a friend to him that giveth gifts.
 &nbsp; 7  All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do
 his friends go far from him? he pursueth <I>them with</I> words, <I>yet</I>
 they <I>are</I> wanting <I>to him.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These two verses are a comment upon 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>,
 
 and show,

 1. How those that are rich and great are courted and caressed, and have
 suitors and servants in abundance. The prince that has power in his 
 hand, and preferments at his disposal, has his gate and his 
 ante-chamber thronged with petitioners, that are ready to adore him for 
 what they can get. <I>Many will entreat his favour,</I> and think
 themselves happy in it. Even great men are humble suppliants to the
 prince. How earnest then should we be for the favour of God, which is 
 far beyond that of any earthly prince. But, it should seem, liberality 
 will go further than majesty itself to gain respect, for there are many 
 that court the prince, but <I>every man is a friend to him that gives 
 gifts;</I> not only those that have received, or do expect, gifts from 
 him, will, as friends, be ready to serve him, but others also will, as 
 friends, give him their good word. Prodigals, who are foolishly free of 
 what they have, will have many hangers-on who will cry them up as long 
 as it lasts, but will leave them when it is done. Those that are 
 prudently generous make an interest by it which may stand them in good 
 stead; those that are accounted benefactors exercise an authority which 
 may give them an opportunity of doing good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:25">Luke xxii. 25</A>.

 2. How those that are poor and low are slighted and despised. Men may, 
 if they please, court the prince, and the princely, but they may not 
 trample upon the poor and look at them with disdain. Yet so it often 
 is: <I>All the brethren of the poor do hate him;</I> even his own 
 relations are shy of him, because he is needy and craving, and expects 
 something from them, and because they look upon him as a blemish to 
 their family; and then no marvel if others of his friends, that were 
 nothing akin to him, <I>go far from him,</I> to get out of his way. 
 <I>He pursues them with words,</I> hoping to prevail with them by his 
 importunity to be kind to him, but all in vain; they have nothing for 
 him. <I>They pursue him with words</I> (so some understand it), to 
 excuse themselves from giving him any thing; they tell him that he is 
 idle and impertinent, that he has brought himself into poverty, and 
 therefore ought not to be relieved; as Nabal said to David's 
 messengers: "<I>There are many servants now a days that run away from 
 their masters;</I> and how do I know but that David may be one of 
 them?" Let poor people therefore make God their friend, pursue him with 
 their prayers, and he will not be wanting to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Those are here encouraged, 

 1. That take pains to <I>get wisdom,</I> to get knowledge, and grace, 
 and acquaintance with God; those that do so show that they <I>love 
 their own souls,</I> and will be found to have done themselves the 
 greatest kindness imaginable. No man ever <I>hated his own flesh,</I> 
 but loves that, yet many are wanting in love to their own souls, for 
 only those love their souls, and consequently love themselves, aright, 
 that <I>get wisdom,</I> true wisdom. 

 2. That take care to keep it when they have got it; it is health, and 
 wealth, and honour, and all, to the soul, and therefore he that 
 <I>keeps understanding,</I> as he shows that he <I>loves his own 
 soul,</I> so he shall certainly <I>find good,</I> all good. He that 
 retains the good lessons he has learnt, and orders his conversation

 Here is, 

 1. A repetition of what was said before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 for we have need to be again and again warned of the danger of the sin 
 of lying and false-witness-bearing, since nothing is of more fatal 
 consequence.

 2. An addition to it in one word; there it was said, <I>He that speaks
 lies shall not escape,</I> and intimated that he shall be punished.
 Here it is said, His punishment shall be such as will be his 
 destruction: he <I>shall perish;</I> the lies he forged against others 
 will be his own ruin. It is a damning destroying sin.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to
 have rule over princes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Pleasure and liberty ill become a fool: <I>Delight is not seemly 
 for</I> such a one. A man that has not wisdom and grace has no right 
 nor title to true joy, and therefore it is unseemly. It ill becomes 
 those that do not delight in God to delight in any thing, nor how to 
 manage themselves, and therefore they do but expose themselves. It
 becomes ungracious fools to be afflicted, and mourn, and weep, not to 
 laugh and be merry; rebukes are more proper for them than delights.
 Delight is seemly for a man of business, to refresh him when he is 
 fatigued, but not <I>for a fool,</I> that lives an idle life and abuses 
 his recreations. <I>The prosperity of fools</I> discovers their folly 
 and <I>destroys them.</I> 

 2. Power and honour ill become a man of a servile spirit. Nothing is 
 more unseemly than <I>for a servant to have rule over princes;</I> it 
 is absurd in itself, and very preposterous, for none are so insolent 
 and intolerable as a beggar on horseback, <I>a servant when he 
 reigns,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:22"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 22</A>.

 It is very unseemly for one that is a servant to sin and his lusts to
 rule over and oppress those that are God's freemen and made kings and 
 priests to him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and <I>it is</I> his
 glory to pass over a transgression.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A wise man will observe these two rules about his anger: 

 1. Not to be over-hasty in his resentments: <I>Discretion</I> teaches 
 us to <I>defer our anger,</I> to defer the admission of it till we have 
 thoroughly considered all the merits of the provocation, seen them in a 
 true light and weighed them in a just balance; and then to defer the 
 prosecution of it till there be no danger of running into any 
 indecencies. Plato said to his servant, "I would beat thee, but that I 
 am angry." Give it time, and it will cool. 

 2. Not to be over-critical in his resentments. Whereas it is commonly
 looked upon as a piece of ingenuity to apprehend an affront quickly, it 
 is here made a man's <I>glory to pass over a transgression,</I> to 
 appear as if he did not see it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:13">Ps. xxxviii. 13</A>),

 or, if he sees fit to take notice of it, yet to forgive it and meditate 
 no revenge.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr19_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  The king's wrath <I>is</I> as the roaring of a lion; but his
 favour <I>is</I> as dew upon the grass.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is to the same purport with what we had 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:14,15"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 14, 15</A>,

 and the design of it is, 

 1. To make kings wise and considerate in dispensing their frowns and 
 smiles. They are not like those of common persons; their frowns are 
 very terrible and their smiles very comfortable, and therefore it 
 concerns them to be very careful that they never frighten a good man 
 from doing well with their frowns, nor ever give countenance to a 
 wicked man in doing ill with their smiles, for then they abuse their 
 influence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:3">Rom. xiii. 3</A>.

 2. To make subjects faithful and dutiful to their princes. Let them be 
 restrained from all disloyalty by the consideration of the dreadful 
 consequence of having the government against them; and let them be 
 encouraged in all good services to the public by the hopes of the 
 favour of their prince. Christ is a King whose wrath against his
 enemies will be <I>as the roaring of a lion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:3">Rev. x. 3</A>)

 and his favour to his own people as the refreshing dew,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  A foolish son <I>is</I> the calamity of his father: and the
 contentions of a wife <I>are</I> a continual dropping.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is an instance of the vanity of the world that we are liable to the 
 greatest grief in those things wherein we promise ourselves the 
 greatest comfort. It is as it proves. What greater temporal comfort can 
 a man have than a good wife and good children? Yet, 

 1. <I>A foolish son is</I> a great affliction, and may make a man wish 
 a thousand times he had been written childless. A son that will apply 
 himself to no study or business, that will take no advice, that lives a 
 lewd, loose, rakish life, and spends what he has extravagantly, games 
 it away and wastes it in the excess of riot, or that is proud, foppish, 
 and conceited, such a one is the grief <I>of his father,</I> because he 
 is the disgrace, and is likely to be the ruin, of his family. He hates 
 all his labour, when he sees to whom he must leave the fruit of it. 

 2. A cross peevish wife is as great an affliction: Her <I>contentions
 are continual;</I> every day, and every hour in the day, she finds some 
 occasion to make herself and those about her uneasy. Those that are 
 accustomed to chide never want something or other to chide at; but it 
 is <I>a continual dropping,</I> that is, a continual vexation, as it is 
 to have a house so much out of repair that it rains in and a man cannot 
 lie dry in it. That man has an uncomfortable life, and has need of a
 great deal of wisdom and grace to enable him to bear his affliction and 
 do his duty, who has a sot for his son and a scold for his wife.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr19_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  House and riches <I>are</I> the inheritance of fathers: and a
 prudent wife <I>is</I> from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. A discreet and virtuous wife is a choice gift of God's providence to 
 a man--a wife that is <I>prudent,</I> in opposition to one that is 
 contentious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 For, though a wife that is continually finding fault may think it is
 her wit and wisdom to be so, it is really her folly; <I>a prudent 
 wife</I> is meek and quiet, and makes the best of every thing. If a man 
 has such a wife, let him not ascribe it to the wisdom of his own choice 
 or his own management (for the wisest have been deceived both in and by 
 a woman), but let him ascribe it to the goodness of God, who made him a 
 help meet for him, and perhaps by some hits and turns of providence 
 that seemed casual brought her to him. Every creature is what he makes
 it. Happy marriages, we are sure, are made in heaven; Abraham's servant 
 prayed in the belief of this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+24:12">Gen. xxiv. 12</A>.

 2. It is a more valuable gift than <I>house and riches,</I> contributes 
 more to the comfort and credit of a man's life and the welfare of his 
 family, is a greater token of God's favour, and about which the divine 
 providence is in a more especial manner conversant. A good estate may 
 be <I>the inheritance of fathers,</I> which, by the common direction of 
 Providence, comes in course to a man; but no man has a good wife by 
 descent or entail. Parents that are worldly, in disposing of their 
 children, look no further than to match them to <I>house and 
 riches,</I> but, if withal it be to <I>a prudent wife,</I> let God have 
 the glory.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here the evil of a sluggish slothful disposition. 

 1. It stupefies men, and makes them senseless, and mindless of their 
 own affairs, as they were <I>cast into a deep sleep,</I> dreaming much, 
 but doing nothing. Slothful people doze away their time, bury their 
 talents, live a useless life, and are the unprofitable burdens of the 
 earth; for any service they do when they are awake they might as well 
 be always asleep. Even their souls are idle and lulled asleep, their 
 rational powers chilled and frozen.

 2. It impoverishes men and brings them to want. Those that will not 
 labour cannot expect to eat, but must <I>suffer hunger: An idle 
 soul,</I> one that is idle in the affairs of his soul, that takes no 
 care or pains to work out his salvation, shall perish for want of that

 Here is, 

 1. The happiness of those that walk circumspectly. Those that make 
 conscience of <I>keeping the commandment</I> in every thing, that live

 they secure their present peace and future bliss, and provide every way 
 well for themselves. If we keep God's word, God's word will keep us 
 from every thing really hurtful. 

 2. The misery of those that live at large and never mind what they do: 
 Those <I>that despair their ways shall die,</I> shall perish eternally; 
 they are in the high road to ruin. With respect to those that are 
 careless about the end of their ways, and never consider whither they 
 are going, and about the rule of their ways, that will walk in the way 
 of their hearts and after the course of the world

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 
 
 I. The duty of charity described. It includes two things:--

 1. Compassion, which is the inward principle of charity in the heart;
 it is to <I>have pity on the poor.</I> Those that have not a penny for 
 the poor, yet may have pity for them, a charitable concern and 
 sympathy; and, if a man <I>give all his goods to feed the poor</I> and 
 have not this charity in his heart, <I>it is nothing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:3">1 Cor. xiii. 3</A>.
 
 We must <I>draw out our souls to the hungry,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:10">Isa. lviii. 10</A>.

 2. Bounty and liberality. We must not only pity the poor, but give, 
 according to their necessity and our ability, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:15,16">Jam. ii. 15, 16</A>.

 <I>That which he has given.</I> Margin, <I>His deed.</I> It is charity 
 to do for the poor, as well as to give; and thus, if they have their 
 limbs and senses, they may be charitable to one another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The encouragement of charity. 

 1. A very kind construction shall be put upon it. What is given to the 
 poor, or done for them, God will place it to account as lent to him, 
 <I>lent upon interest</I> (so the word signifies); he takes it kindly, 
 as if it were done to himself, and he would have us take the comfort of 
 it and to be as well pleased as ever any usurer was when he had let out 
 a sum of money into good hands.

 2. A very rich recompence shall be made for it: <I>He will pay him 
 again,</I> in temporal, spiritual, and eternal blessings. Almsgiving is 
 the surest and safest way of thriving.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul
 spare for his crying.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Parents are here cautioned against a foolish indulgence of their 
 children that are untoward and viciously inclined, and that discover 
 such an ill temper of mind as is not likely to be cured but by 
 severity. 

 1. Do not say that it is all in good time to correct them; no, as soon 
 as ever there appears a corrupt disposition in them check it 
 immediately, before it gets head, and takes root, and is hardened into 
 a habit: <I>Chasten thy son while there is hope,</I> for perhaps, if he 
 be let alone awhile, he will be past hope, and a much greater 
 chastening will not do that which now a less would effect. It is 
 easiest plucking up weeds as soon as they spring up, and the bullock 
 that is designed for the yoke should be betimes accustomed to it. 

 2. Do not say that it is a pity to correct them, and that, because they 
 cry and beg to be forgiven, you cannot find in your heart to do it. If 
 the point can be gained without correction, well and good; but if you 
 find, as it often proves, that your forgiving them once, upon a 
 dissembled repentance and promise of amendment, does but embolden them 
 to offend again, especially if it be a thing that is in itself sinful 
 (as lying, swearing, ribaldry, stealing, or the like), in such a case 
 put on resolution, <I>and let not thy soul spare for his crying.</I> It 
 is better that he should cry under thy rod than under the sword of the 
 magistrate, or, which is more fearful, that of divine vengeance.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr19_19"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou
 deliver <I>him,</I> yet thou must do it again.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As we read this, it intimates, in short, that angry men never want 
 woe. Those that are of strong, or rather headstrong, passions, commonly 
 bring themselves and their families into trouble by vexatious suits and 
 quarrels and the provocations they give; they are still smarting, in 
 one instance or other, for their ungoverned heats; and, if their 
 friends deliver them out of one trouble, they will quickly involve 
 themselves in another, and they <I>must do it again,</I> all which 
 troubles to themselves and others would be prevented if they would 
 mortify their passions and get the rule of their own spirits. 

 2. It may as well be read, <I>He that is of great wrath</I> (meaning 
 the child that is to be corrected and is impatient of rebuke, cries and 
 makes a noise, even that wrath of his against the rod of correction) 
 <I>deserves to be punished; for, if thou deliver him</I> for the sake 
 of that, thou wilt be forced to punish him so much the more next time.
 A stomachful high-spirited child must be subdued betimes, or it will be 
 the worse for it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is well with those that are <I>wise in their latter end,</I> wise 
 for their latter end, for their future state, wise for another world, 
 that are found wise when their latter end comes, wise virgins, wise 
 builders, wise stewards, that are wise at length, and <I>understand the 
 things that belong to their peace, before they be hidden from their 
 eyes.</I> A carnal worldling <I>at his end shall be a fool</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:11">Jer. xvii. 11</A>),
 
 but godliness will prove wisdom at last.

 2. Those that would <I>be wise in their latter end</I> must <I>hear
 counsel</I> and <I>receive instruction,</I> in their beginnings must be 
 willing to be taught and ruled, willing to be advised and reproved, 
 when they are young. Those that would be stored in winter must gather 
 in summer.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  <I>There are</I> many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the
 counsel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, that shall stand.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 1. Men projecting. They keep their designs to themselves, but they 
 cannot hide them from God; he knows the <I>many devices that are in 
 men's hearts,</I>--devices against his counsels (as those, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1-3,Mic+4:11">Ps. ii. 1-3; Micah iv. 11</A>),--

 devices without his counsel (no regard had to his providence, as those 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:13">Jam. iv. 13</A>,

 this and the other they will do, and not take God along with 
 them),--devices unlike God's counsels; men are wavering in their 
 devices, and often absurd and unjust, but God's counsels are wise and 
 holy, steady and uniform.

 2. God overruling. Various men have various designs, according as
 their inclination or interest leads them, but <I>the counsel of the 
 Lord, that shall stand,</I> whatever becomes of the devices of men. His 
 counsel often breaks men's measures and baffles their devices; but 
 their devices cannot in the least alter his counsel, not disturb the 
 proceedings of it, nor put him upon new counsels, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:24,46:11">Isa. xiv. 24; xlvi. 11</A>.
 
 What a check does this give to politic designing men, who think they 
 can outwit all mankind, that there is a God in heaven that laughs at 
 them! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:4">Ps. ii. 4</A>.

 What comfort does this speak to all God's people, that all God's 
 purposes, which we are sure are right and good, shall be accomplished 
 in due time!</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  The desire of a man <I>is</I> his kindness: and a poor man <I>is</I>
 better than a liar.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. The honour of doing good is what we may laudably be ambitious of. It 
 cannot but be <I>the desire of man,</I> if he have any spark of virtue 
 in him, to be kind; one would not covet an estate for any thing so much 
 as thereby to be put into a capacity of relieving the poor and obliging 
 our friends. 

 2. It is far better to have a heart to do good and want ability for it
 than have ability for it and want a heart to it: <I>The desire of a 
 man</I> to be kind, and charitable, and generous, <I>is his 
 kindness,</I> and shall be so construed; both God and man will accept 
 his good-will, <I>according to what he has,</I> and will not expect 
 more. <I>A poor man,</I> who wishes you well, but can promise you 
 nothing, because he has nothing to be kind with, <I>is better than a 
 liar,</I> than a rich man who makes you believe he will do mighty 
 things, but, when it comes to the setting to, will do nothing. The
 character of the men of low degree, that they <I>are vanity,</I> from 
 whom nothing is expected, is better than that of men of high degree, 
 that they <I>are a lie,</I> they deceive those whose expectations they 
 raised.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  The fear of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>tendeth</I> to life: and <I>he that hath
 it</I> shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See what those that get by it that live in the fear of God, and always 
 make conscience of their duty to him. 

 1. Safety: They <I>shall not be visited with evil;</I> they may be 
 visited with sickness or other afflictions, but there shall be no evil 
 in them, nothing to hurt them, because nothing to separate them <I>from 
 the love of God,</I> or hurt to the soul. 

 2. Satisfaction: They <I>shall abide satisfied;</I> they shall have 
 those comforts which are satisfying, and shall have a constant 
 contentment and complacency in them. It is a satisfaction which will 
 abide, whereas all the satisfactions of sense are transient and soon 
 gone. <I>Satur pernoctabit, non cubabit incoenatus</I>--<I>He shall not 
 go supperless to bed;</I> he shall have that which will make him easy 
 and be an entertainment to him in his silent and solitary hours, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:6,7">Ps. xvi. 6, 7</A>.

 3. True and complete happiness. Serious godliness has a direct
 tendency <I>to life;</I> to all good, to eternal life; it is the sure 
 and ready way to it; there is something in the nature of it fitting men 
 for heaven and so leading them to it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  A slothful <I>man</I> hideth his hand in <I>his</I> bosom, and will
 not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A sluggard is here exposed as a fool, for, 

 1. All his care is to save himself from labour and cold. See his 
 posture: He <I>hides his hand in his bosom,</I> pretends he is lame and 
 cannot work; his hands are cold, and he must warm them in his bosom; 
 and, when they are warm there, he must keep them so. He hugs himself in 
 his own ease and is resolved against labour and hardship. Let those 
 work that love it; for his part he thinks there is no such fine life as 
 sitting still and doing nothing. 

 2. He will not be at the pains to feed himself, an elegant hyperbole; 
 as we say, A man is so lazy that he would not shake fire off him, so 
 here, He cannot find in his heart to take his hand out of his bosom, 
 no, not to put meat into his own mouth. If the law be so that those
 that will not labour must not eat, he will rather starve than stir. 
 Thus his sin is his punishment, and therefore is egregious folly.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one
 that hath understanding, <I>and</I> he will understand knowledge.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. The punishment of scorners will be a means of good to others. When
 men are so hardened in wickedness that they will not themselves be 
 wrought upon by the severe methods that are used to reclaim and reform 
 them, yet such methods must be used for the sake of others, that 
 <I>they may hear and fear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+19:20">Deut. xix. 20</A>.

 If the <I>scorner</I> will not be recovered from his sin, the disease 
 being inveterate, yet <I>the simple will beware</I> of venturing upon 
 the sin which exposes men thus. If it cure not the infected, it may 
 prevent the spreading of the infection.

 2. The reproof of wise men will be a means of good to themselves. They 
 need not be smitten; a word to the wise is enough. Do but <I>reprove 
 one that has understanding and he will</I> so far understand himself 
 and his own interest that he will <I>understand knowledge</I> by it, 
 and not miss it again through ignorance and inadvertency when once he 
 has been told of it; so kindly does he take reproof and so wisely 
 improve it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The sin of a prodigal son. Besides the wrong he does to himself, he 
 is injurious to his good parents, and basely ungrateful to those that 
 were instruments of his being and have taken so much care and pains 
 about him, which is a great aggravation of his sin and renders it 
 exceedingly sinful in the eyes of God and man: <I>He wastes his
 father,</I> wastes his estate which he should have to support him in
 his old age, wastes his spirits, and breaks his heart, and brings his 
 gray head <I>with sorrow to the grave.</I> He <I>chases away his 
 mother,</I> alienates her affections from him, which cannot be done 
 without a great deal of regret and uneasiness to her; he makes her 
 weary of the house, with his rudeness and insolence, and glad to retire 
 for a little quietness; and, when he has spent all, he turns her out of 
 doors. 

 2. The shame of a prodigal son. It is a shame to himself that he should 
 be so brutish and unnatural. He makes himself odious to all mankind. It 
 is a shame to his parents and family, who are reflected upon, though, 
 perhaps, without just cause, for teaching him no better, or being in 
 some way wanting to him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  Cease, my son, to hear the instruction <I>that causeth</I> to err
 from the words of knowledge.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a good caution to those that have had a good education to take 
 heed of hearkening to those who, under pretence of instructing them, 
 draw them off from those good principles under the influence of which 
 they were trained up. Observe, 

 1. There is that which seems designed for instruction, but really tends 
 to the destruction of young men. The factors for vice will undertake to 
 teach them free thoughts and a fashionable conversation, how to 
 palliate the sins they have a mind to and stop the mouth of their own 
 consciences, how to get clear of the restraints of their education and 
 to set up for wits and beaux. This is <I>the instruction</I> which 
 <I>causes to err from the</I> forms of sound words, which should be 
 held fast in faith and love. 

 2. It is the wisdom of young men to turn a deaf ear to such 
 instructions, as the adder does to the charms that are designed to 
 ensnare her. "Dread hearing such talk as tends to instil loose
 principles into the mind; and, if thou art linked in with such, break 
 off from them; thou hast heard enough, or too much, and therefore hear 
 no more of the evil communication which corrupts good manners."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the
 wicked devoureth iniquity.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a description of the worst of sinners, whose <I>hearts are 
 fully set in them to do evil.</I> 

 1. They set that at defiance which would deter and detain them from 
 sin: <I>An ungodly witness</I> is one that bears false witness against 
 his neighbour, and will forswear himself to do another a mischief, in 
 which there is not only great injustice, but great impiety; this is one 
 of the worst of men. Or <I>an ungodly witness</I> is one that profanely 
 and atheistically witnesses against religion and godliness, whose 
 instructions seduce <I>from the words of knowledge</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 such a one <I>scorns judgment,</I> laughs at the terrors of the Lord, 
 mocks at that fear, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:26">Job xv. 26</A>.

 Tell him of law and equity, that the scriptures and an oath are sacred 
 things, and not to be jested with, that there will come a reckoning 
 day; he laughs at it all, and scorns to heed it.

 2. They are greedy, and glad of that which gives them an opportunity to 
 sin: <I>The mouth of the wicked</I> eagerly <I>devours iniquity, drinks 
 it in like water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:16">Job xv. 16</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr19_29"> </A>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>29  Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the
 back of fools.

 Note, 

 1. Scorners are fools. Those that ridicule things sacred and serious do 
 but make themselves ridiculous. <I>Their folly shall be manifest unto 
 all men.</I> 

 2. Those that scorn judgments cannot escape them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 The unbelief of man shall not make God's threatenings of no effect;
 those that <I>devour iniquity</I> swallow the hook with the bait. The 
 civil magistrate has <I>judgments prepared for scorners,</I> for 
 otherwise he would <I>bear the sword in vain;</I> but if he be remiss, 
 and connive at sin, yet God's judgments slumber not; they are prepared,
