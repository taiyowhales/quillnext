 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is a groundless opinion of some of the Jewish writers (who are 
 usually free of their conjectures) that this psalm was penned and sung 
 by Adam in innocency, on the first sabbath. It is inconsistent with the 
 psalm itself, which speaks of the workers of iniquity, when as yet sin 
 had not entered. It is probable that it was penned by David, and, being 
 calculated for the sabbath day, 

 I. Praise, the business of the sabbath, is here recommended, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.
 
 II. God's works, which gave occasion for the sabbath, are here
 celebrated as great and unsearchable in general, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:4-6">ver. 4-6</A>.

 In particular, with reference to the works both of providence and
 redemption, the psalmist sings unto God both of mercy and judgment, the
 ruin of sinners and the joy of saints, three times counterchanged.

 1. The wicked shall perish
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:7">ver. 7</A>),

 but God is eternal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:8">ver. 8</A>.

 2. God's enemies shall be cut off, but David shall be exalted, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 3. David's enemies shall be confounded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:11">ver. 11</A>),

 but all the righteous shall be fruitful and flourishing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 In singing this psalm we must take pleasure in giving to God the glory
 due to his name, and triumph in his works.</P>

 <P>A psalm <I>or</I> song for the sabbath day.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  <I>It is a</I> good <I>thing</I> to give thanks unto the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:
 &nbsp; 2  To show forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy
 faithfulness every night,
 &nbsp; 3  Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery;
 upon the harp with a solemn sound.
 &nbsp; 4  For thou, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, hast made me glad through thy work: I will
 triumph in the works of thy hands.
 &nbsp; 5  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, how great are thy works! <I>and</I> thy thoughts are very
 deep.
 &nbsp; 6  A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand
 this.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm was appointed to be sung, at least it usually was sung, in 
 the house of the sanctuary on the sabbath day, that day of rest, which 
 was an instituted memorial of the work of creation, of God's rest from 
 that work, and the continuance of it in his providence; for <I>the 
 Father worketh hitherto.</I> Note, 

 1. The sabbath day must be a day, not only of holy rest, but of holy
 work, and the rest is in order to the work. 

 2. The proper work of the sabbath is praising God; every sabbath day 
 must be a thanksgiving-day; and the other services of the day must be 
 in order to this, and therefore must by no means thrust this into a 
 corner. One of the Jewish writers refers it to the kingdom of the 
 Messiah, and calls it, <I>A psalm or song for the age to come,</I> 
 which shall be all sabbath. Believers, through Christ, enjoy that
 <I>sabbatism which remains for the people of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:9">Heb. iv. 9</A>),

 the beginning of the everlasting sabbath. In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are called upon and encouraged to praise God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:1-3"><I>v.</I> 1-3</A>):

 <I>It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord.</I> Praising God is
 good work: it is good in itself and good for us. It is our duty, the 
 rent, the tribute, we are to pay to our great Lord; we are unjust if we 
 withhold it. It is our privilege that we are admitted to praise God, 
 and have hope to be accepted in it. It is good, for it is pleasant and 
 profitable, work that is its own wages; it is the work of angels, the 
 work of heaven. It is good to give thanks for the mercies we have 
 received, for that is the way of fetching in further mercy: it is fit 
 to sing to his name who is Most High, exalted above all blessing and 
 praise. Now observe here,

 1. How we must praise God. We must do it by <I>showing forth his
 lovingkindness and his faithfulness.</I> Being convinced of his 
 glorious attributes and perfections, we must show them forth, as those 
 that are greatly affected with them ourselves and desire to affect 
 others with them likewise. We must show forth, not only his greatness 
 and majesty, his holiness and justice, which magnify him and strike an 
 awe upon us, but his lovingkindness and his faithfulness; for his 
 goodness is his glory

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:18,19">Exod. xxxiii. 18, 19</A>),

 and by these he proclaims his name. His mercy and truth are the great
 supports of our faith and hope, and the great encouragements of our 
 love and obedience; these therefore we must show forth as our pleas in 
 prayer and the matter of our joy. This was then done, not only by 
 singing, but by music joined with it, <I>upon an instrument of ten 
 strings</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 but then it was to be <I>with a solemn sound,</I> not that which was
 gay, and apt to dissipate the spirits, but that which was grave, and 
 apt to fix them.

 2. When we must praise God--<I>in the morning and every night,</I> not 
 only on sabbath days, but every day; it is that which the duty of every 
 day requires. We must praise God, not only in public assemblies, but in 
 secret, and in our families, showing forth, to ourselves and those 
 about us, his lovingkindness and faithfulness. We must begin and end
 every day with praising God, must give him thanks every morning, when 
 we are fresh and before the business of the day comes in upon us, and 
 every night, when we are again composed and retired, and are 
 recollecting ourselves; we must give him thanks every morning for the 
 mercies of the night and every night for the mercies of the day; going 
 out and coming in we must bless God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We have an example set before us in the psalmist himself, both to 
 move us to and to direct us in this work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work.</I> Note,

 1. Those can best recommend to others the duty of praise who have
 themselves experienced the pleasantness of it. "God's works are to be 
 praised, for they have many a time rejoiced my heart; and therefore, 
 whatever others may think of them, I must think well and speak well of 
 them." 

 2. If God has given us the joy of his works, there is all the reason in 
 the world why we should give him the honour of them. Has he made our 
 hearts glad? Let us then make his praises glorious. Has God made us 
 glad through the works of his providence for us, and of his grace in 
 us, and both through the great work of redemption?

 (1.) Let us thence fetch encouragement for our faith and hope; so the 
 psalmist does: <I>I will triumph in the works of thy hands.</I> From a 
 joyful remembrance of what God has done for us we may raise a joyful 
 prospect of what he will do, and triumph in the assurance of it, 
 triumph over all opposition,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:13,14">2 Thess. ii. 13, 14</A>.
 
 (2.) Let us thence fetch matter for holy adorings and admirings of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>O Lord! how great are thy works</I>--great beyond conception, beyond
 expression, the products of great power and wisdom, of great 
 consequence and importance! men's works are nothing to them. We cannot 
 comprehend the greatness of God's works, and therefore must reverently 
 and awfully wonder at them, and even stand amazed at the magnificence 
 of them. "Men's works are little and trifling, for their thoughts are 
 shallow; but, Lord, <I>thy works are great</I> and such as cannot be 
 measured; for <I>thy thoughts are very deep</I> and such as cannot be 
 fathomed." God's counsels as much exceed the contrivances of our wisdom 
 as his works do the efforts of our power. <I>His thoughts are above our 
 thoughts,</I> as his <I>ways</I> are <I>above our ways,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:9">Isa. lv. 9</A>.
 
 <I>O the depth</I> of God's designs! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:33">Rom. xi. 33</A>.

 The greatness of God's works should lead us to consider the depth of 
 his thoughts, that counsel of his own will according to which he does 
 all things--what a compass his thoughts fetch and to what a length they 
 reach!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We are admonished not to neglect the works of God, by the 
 character of those who do so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Those are fools, they are brutish, who do not know, who do not
 understand, how great God's works are, who will not acquaint themselves 
 with them, nor give him the glory of them; they <I>regard not the work 
 of the Lord</I> nor <I>consider the operation of his hands</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:5">Ps. xxviii. 5</A>);

 particularly, they understand not the meaning of their own prosperity
 (which is spoken of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 they take it as a pledge of their happiness, whereas it is a
 preparative for their ruin. If there are so many who know not the 
 designs of Providence, nor care to know them, those who through grace 
 are acquainted with them, and love to be so, have the more reason to be 
 thankful.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers
 of iniquity do flourish; <I>it is</I> that they shall be destroyed for
 ever:
 &nbsp; 8  But thou, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>art most</I> high for evermore.
 &nbsp; 9  For, lo, thine enemies, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, for, lo, thine enemies shall

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 that from the works of God he would take occasion to triumph; and here
 he does so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He triumphs over God's enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:7,9,11"><I>v.</I> 7, 9, 11</A>),

 triumphs in the foresight of their destruction, not as it would be the
 misery of his fellow-creatures, but as it would redound to the honour 
 of God's justice and holiness. He is confident of the ruin of sinners,

 1. Though they are flourishing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>When the wicked spring as the grass</I> in spring (so numerous, so
 thickly sown, so green, and growing so fast), <I>and all the workers of 
 iniquity do flourish</I> in pomp, and power, and all the instances of 
 outward prosperity, are easy and many, and succeed in their 
 enterprises, one would think that all this was in order to their being 
 happy, that it was a certain evidence of God's favour and an earnest of 
 something as good or better in reserve: but it is quite otherwise; it 
 is <I>that they shall be destroyed for ever.</I> The very <I>prosperity 
 of fools shall slay them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:32">Prov. i. 32</A>.

 The sheep that are designed for the slaughter are put into the fattest 
 pasture.

 2. Though they are daring, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 They are thy enemies, and impudently avow themselves to be so. They are
 contrary to God, and they fight against God. They are in rebellion 
 against his crown and dignity, and therefore it is easy to foresee that 
 they shall perish; for <I>who ever hardened his heart against God and 
 prospered?</I> Note, All the impenitent workers of iniquity shall be 
 deemed and taken as God's enemies, and as such they shall perish and be 
 scattered. Christ reckons those his enemies that will not have him to 
 reign over them; and they shall be brought forth and slain before him.
 The workers of iniquity are now associated, and closely linked 
 together, in a combination against God and religion; but they shall be 
 scattered, and disabled to help one another against the just judgment 
 of God. <I>In the world to come they shall be separated from the 
 congregation of the righteous;</I> so the Chaldee,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:5">Ps. i. 5</A>.

 3. Though they had a particular malice against the psalmist, and, upon
 that account, he might be tempted to fear them, yet he triumphs over 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>My eye shall see my desire on my enemies that rise up against
 me;</I> I shall see them not only disabled from doing me any further 
 mischief, but reckoned with for the mischief they have done me, and 
 brought either to repentance or ruin:" and this was his desire 
 concerning them. In the Hebrew it is no more than thus, <I>My eye shall 
 look on my enemies, and my ear shall hear of the wicked.</I> He does 
 not say what he shall see or what he shall hear, but he shall see and 
 hear that in which God will be glorified and in which he will therefore 
 be satisfied. This perhaps has reference to Christ, to his victory over 
 Satan, death, and hell, the destruction of those that persecuted and 
 crucified him, and opposed his gospel, and to the final ruin of the 
 impenitent at the last day. Those that rise up against Christ will
 fall before him and be made his footstool.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He triumphs in God, and his glory and grace. 

 1. In the glory of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>But thou, O Lord! art most high for evermore.</I> The workers of
 iniquity who fight against us may be high for a time, and think to 
 carry all before them with a high hand, but <I>thou art high, most 
 high, for evermore.</I> Their height will be humbled and brought down, 
 but thine is everlasting." Let us not therefore fear the pride and 
 power of evil men, nor be discouraged by their impotent menaces, for 
 the moth shall eat them up as a garment, but <I>God's righteousness 
 shall be for ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:7,8">Isa. li. 7, 8</A>.

 2. In the grace of God, his favour and the fruits of it, 

 (1.) To himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "Thou, O Lord! that art thyself most high, <I>shalt exalt my horn.</I>"
 The great God is the fountain of honour, and he, being <I>high for 
 evermore,</I> himself will exalt his people for ever, for <I>he is the 
 praise of all his saints,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:14">Ps. cxlviii. 14</A>.

 The wicked are forbidden to <I>lift up the horn</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:4,5">Ps. lxxv. 4, 5</A>),

 but those that serve God and the interest of his kingdom with their
 honour or power, and commit it to him to keep it, to raise it, to use 
 it, and to dispose of it, as he pleases, may hope that he will <I>exalt 
 their horn as the horn of a unicorn,</I> to the greatest height, either 
 in this world or the other: <I>My horn shalt thou exalt,</I> when 
 <I>thy enemies perish;</I> for <I>then shall the righteous shine forth 
 as the sun,</I> when the wicked shall be doomed to <I>shame and 
 everlasting contempt.</I> He adds, <I>I shall be anointed with fresh 
 oil,</I> which denotes a fresh confirmation in his office to which he 
 had been anointed, or abundance of plenty, so that he should have fresh 
 oil as often as he pleased, or renewed comforts to revive him when his 
 spirits drooped. Grace is the anointing of the Spirit; when this is
 given to help in the time of need, and is received, as there is 
 occasion, from the fulness that is in Christ Jesus, we are then 
 anointed with fresh oil. Some read it, <I>When I grow old thou shalt 
 anoint me with fresh oil. My old age shalt thou exalt with rich 
 mercy;</I> so the LXX. Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>,

 <I>They shall bring forth fruit in old age.</I> The comforts of God's
 Spirit, and the joys of his salvation, shall be a refreshing oil to the 
 <I>hoary heads that are found in the way of righteousness.</I>

 (2.) To all the saints. They are here represented as <I>trees of 
 righteousness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:3,Ps+1:3">Isa. lxi. 3; Ps. i. 3</A>.

 Observe, 

 [1.] The good place they are fixed in; they are <I>planted in the house 
 of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The trees of righteousness do not grow of themselves; they are
 <I>planted,</I> not in common soil, but in paradise, <I>in the house of 
 the Lord.</I> Trees are not usually planted in a house; but God's trees 
 are said to be planted in his house because it is from his grace, by 
 his word and Spirit, that they receive all the sap and virtue that keep 
 them alive and make them fruitful. They fix themselves to holy
 ordinances, take root in them, abide by them, put themselves under the 
 divine protection, and bring forth all their fruits to God's honour and 
 glory.

 [2.] The good plight they shall be kept in. It is here promised, 
 <I>First,</I> That they shall grow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Where God gives true grace he will give more grace. God's trees shall
 grow higher, like the cedars, the tall cedars in Lebanon; they shall 
 grow nearer heaven, and with a holy ambition shall aspire towards the 
 upper world; they shall grow stronger, like the cedars, and fitter for 
 use. <I>He that has clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
 Secondly,</I> That they shall flourish, both in the credit of their 
 profession and in the comfort and joy of their own souls. They shall be 
 cheerful themselves and respected by all about them. <I>They shall 
 flourish like the palm-tree,</I> which has a stately body 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:7">Cant. vii. 7</A>),
 
 and large boughs,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+23:40,Jdg+4:5">Lev. xxiii. 40; Judg. iv. 5</A>.

 Dates, the fruit of it, are very pleasant, but it is especially alluded
 to here as being ever green. The wicked flourish as the grass 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 which is soon withered, but the righteous as the palm-tree, which is
 long-lived and which the winter does not change. It has been said of 
 the palm-tree, <I>Sub pondere crescit--The more it is pressed down the 
 more it grows;</I> so the righteous flourish under their burdens; the 
 more they are afflicted the more they multiply. Being planted in
 <I>the house of the Lord</I> (there their root is), <I>they flourish in 
 the courts of our God</I>--there their branches spread. <I>Their life 
 is hid with Christ in God.</I> But their light also shines before men. 
 It is desirable that those who have a place should have a name in God's 
 house, and within his walls,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:5">Isa. lvi. 5</A>.

 Let good Christians aim to excel, that they may be eminent and may 
 flourish, and so may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour, as 
 flourishing trees adorn the courts of a house. And let those who 
 flourish in God's courts give him the glory of it; it is by virtue of 
 this promise, <I>They shall be fat and flourishing.</I> Their 
 flourishing without is from a fatness within, from the <I>root and 
 fatness of the good olive,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:17">Rom. xi. 17</A>.

 Without a living principle of grace in the heart the profession will
 not be long flourishing; but where that is <I>the leaf also shall not 
 wither,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:3">Ps. i. 3</A>.

 <I>The trees of the Lord are full of sap,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:16">Ps. civ. 16</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:5,6">Hos. xiv. 5, 6</A>.
 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> That they shall be fruitful. Were there nothing but
 leaves upon them, they would not be trees of any value; but <I>they 
 shall still bring forth fruit.</I> The products of sanctification, all 
 the instances of a lively devotion and a useful conversation, good 
 works, by which God is glorified and others are edified, these are the 
 fruits of righteousness, in which it is the privilege, as well as the 
 duty, of the righteous to abound; and their abounding in them is the 
 matter of a promise as well as of a command. It is promised that they 
 shall bring forth fruit in old age. Other trees, when they are old, 
 leave off bearing, but in God's trees the strength of grace does not 
 fail with the strength of nature. The last days of the saints are 
 sometimes their best days, and their last work is their best work. This 
 indeed shows that they are upright; perseverance is the surest evidence 
 of sincerity. But it is here said <I>to show that the Lord is 
 upright</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 that he is true to his promises and faithful to every word that he has
 spoken, and that he is constant to the work which he has begun. As it 
 is by the promises that believers first partake of a divine nature, so 
 it is by the promises that that divine nature is preserved and kept up; 
 and therefore the power it exerts is an evidence that the <I>Lord is 
 upright,</I> and so he will show himself <I>with an upright man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+Ps+18:25">Ps. xviii. 25</A>.

 This the psalmist triumphs in: "<I>He is my rock and there is no
 unrighteousness in him.</I> I have chosen him for my rock on which to 
 build, in the clefts of which to take shelter, on the top of which to 
 set my feet. I have found him a rock, strong and stedfast, and his word 
 as firm as a rock. I have found" (and let every one speak as he finds)
 "that there is no unrighteousness in him." He is as able, and will be 
 as kind, as his word makes him to be. All that ever trusted in God 
 found him faithful and all-sufficient, and none were ever made ashamed 
 of their hope in him.</P>
