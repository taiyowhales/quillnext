 In this chapter we have, 

 I. The inscription, or title of the book, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. The general doctrine of the vanity of the creature laid down
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:2">ver. 2</A>)
 
 and explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:3">ver. 3</A>.

 III. The proof of this doctrine, taken, 

 1. From the shortness of human life and the multitude of births and 
 burials in this life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:4">ver. 4</A>.

 2.  From the inconstant nature, and constant revolutions, of all the 
 creatures, and the perpetual flux and reflux they are in, the sun, 
 wind, and water, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 3. From the abundant toil man has about them and the little 
 satisfaction he has in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:8">ver. 8</A>.

 4. From the return of the same things again, which shows the end of all 
 perfection, and that the stock is exhausted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 5. From the oblivion to which all things are condemned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:11">ver. 11</A>.

 IV.  The first instance of the vanity of man's knowledge, and all the 
 parts of learning, especially natural philosophy and politics. Observe, 
 
 1.  The trial Solomon made of these, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:12,13,16,17">ver. 12, 13, 16, 17</A>.

 2. His judgment of them, that all is vanity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:14">ver. 14</A>.
 
 For, 

 (1.) There is labour in getting knowledge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:13">ver. 13</A>.

 (2.) There is little good to be done with it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:15">ver. 15</A>.

 (3.) There is no satisfaction in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:18">ver. 18</A>.

 And, if this is vanity and vexation, all other things in this world, 
 being much inferior to it in dignity and worth, must needs be so too. A 
 great scholar cannot be happy unless he be a true saint.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in
 Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 2  Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities;
 all <I>is</I> vanity.
 &nbsp; 3  What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh
 under the sun?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. An account of the penman of this book; it was Solomon, for no other 
 son of David was king of Jerusalem; but he conceals his name 
 <I>Solomon, peaceable,</I> because by his sin he had brought trouble 
 upon himself and his kingdom, had broken his peace with God and lost 
 the peace of his conscience, and therefore was no more worthy of that 
 name. Call me not <I>Solomon,</I> call me <I>Marah,</I> for, <I>behold, 
 for peace I had great bitterness.</I> But he calls himself,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>The preacher,</I> which intimates his present character. He is 
 <I>Koheleth,</I> which comes from a word which signifies <I>to 
 gather;</I> but it is of a feminine termination, by which perhaps 
 Solomon intends to upbraid himself with his effeminacy, which 
 contributed more than any thing to his apostasy; for it was to please 
 his wives that he set up idols, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+13:26">Neh. xiii. 26</A>.

 Or the word <I>soul</I> must be understood, and so <I>Koheleth</I>
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A <I>penitent soul,</I> or one <I>gathered,</I> one that had
 rambled and gone astray like a lost sheep, but was now reduced, 
 gathered in from his wanderings, gathered home to his duty, and come at 
 length to himself. The spirit that was dissipated after a thousand 
 vanities is now collected and made to centre in God. Divine grace can 
 make great sinners great converts, and renew even those to repentance 
 who, <I>after they had known the way of righteousness, turned aside 
 from it,</I> and <I>heal their backslidings,</I> though it is a 
 difficult case. It is only the penitent soul that God will accept, the 
 heart that is broken, not the head that is bowed down like a bulrush 
 only for a day, David's repentance, not Ahab's. And it is only the 
 gathered soul that is the penitent soul, that comes back from its 
 by-paths, that no longer <I>scatters its way to the strangers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:13">Jer. iii. 13</A>),

 but is <I>united to fear God's name. Out of the abundance of the heart
 the mouth will speak,</I> and therefore we have here the words of the 
 penitent, and those published. If eminent professors of religion fall 
 into gross sin, they are concerned, for the honour of God and the 
 repairing of the damage they have done to his kingdom, openly to 
 testify their repentance, that the antidote may be administered as 
 extensively as the poison.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) A <I>preaching soul,</I> or one <I>gathering.</I> Being himself 
 <I>gathered</I> to the congregation of saints, out of which he had by 
 his sin thrown himself, and being reconciled to the church, he 
 endeavours to gather others to it that had gone astray like him, and 
 perhaps were led astray by his example. He that has done any thing to 
 seduce his brother ought to do all he can to restore him. Perhaps 
 Solomon called together a congregation of his people, as he had done at 
 the dedication of the temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:2">1 Kings viii. 2</A>),

 so now at the rededicating of himself. In that assembly he presided as
 the people's mouth to God in prayer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 in this as God's mouth to them in preaching. God by his Spirit made him
 a preacher, in token of his being reconciled to him; a commission is a 
 tacit pardon. Christ sufficiently testifies his forgiving Peter by 
 committing his lambs and sheep to his trust.  Observe, Penitents should 
 be preachers; those that have taken warning themselves to turn and live 
 should give warning to others not to go on and die. <I>When thou art 
 converted strengthen thy brethren.</I> Preachers must be preaching 
 <I>souls,</I> for that only is likely to reach to the heart that comes 
 from the heart. Paul served God <I>with his spirit in the gospel of his 
 Son,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:9">Rom. i. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>The son of David.</I> His taking this title intimates, 

 (1.) That he looked upon it as a great honour to be the son of so good
 a man, and valued himself very much upon it.

 (2.) That he also looked upon it as a great aggravation of his sin that
 he had such a father, who had given him a good education and put up 
 many a good prayer for him; it cuts him to the heart to think that he 
 should be a blemish and disgrace to the name and family of such a one 
 as David. It aggravated the sin of Jehoiakim that he was the son of 
 Josiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:15-17">Jer. xxii. 15-17</A>.

 (3.) That his being the son of David encouraged him to repent and hope
 for mercy, for David had fallen into sin, by which he should have been 
 warned not to sin, but was not; but David repented, and therein he took 
 example from him and found mercy as he did. Yet this was not all; he 
 was that son of David concerning whom God had said that though he would 
 <I>chasten his transgression with the rod,</I> yet he would not 
 <I>break his covenant</I> with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:34">Ps. lxxxix. 34</A>.

 Christ, the great preacher, was the <I>Son of David.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>King of Jerusalem.</I> This he mentions, 

 (1.) As that which was a very great aggravation of his sin. He was a
 king. God had done much for him, in raising him to the throne, and yet 
 he had so ill requited him; his dignity made the bad example and 
 influence of his sin the more dangerous, and many would follow his 
 pernicious ways; especially as he was king of Jerusalem, the holy city, 
 where God's temple was, and of his own building too, where the priests, 
 the Lord's ministers, were, and his prophets who had taught him better 
 things.

 (2.) As that which might give some advantage to what he wrote, for
 <I>where the word of a king is there is power.</I> He thought it no 
 disparagement to him, as a king, to be a preacher; but the people would 
 regard him the more as a preacher because he was a king. If men of 
 honour would lay out themselves to do good, what a great deal of good 
 might they do! Solomon looked as great in the pulpit, preaching the 
 vanity of the world, as in his throne of ivory, judging.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Chaldee-paraphrase (which, in this book, makes very large additions 
 to the text, or comments upon it, all along) gives this account of 
 Solomon's writing this book, That by the spirit of prophecy he foresaw 
 the revolt of the ten tribes from his son, and, in process of time, the 
 destruction of Jerusalem and the house of the sanctuary, and the 
 captivity of the people, in the foresight of which he said, <I>Vanity 
 of vanities, all is vanity;</I> and to that he applies many passages in 
 this book.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The general scope and design of the book. What is it that this 
 royal preacher has to say? That which he aims at is, for the making of 
 us truly religious, to take down our esteem of and expectation from the 
 things of this world. In order to this, he shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That they are <I>all vanity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 This is the proposition he lays down and undertakes to prove: <I>Vanity
 of vanities, all is vanity.</I> It was no new text; his father David 
 had more than once spoken to the same purport. The truth itself here 
 asserted is, that <I>all is vanity,</I> all besides God and considered 
 as abstract from him, the <I>all</I> of this world, all worldly 
 employments and enjoyments, the <I>all</I> that <I>is in the world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:16">1 John ii. 16</A>),
 
 all that which is agreeable to our senses and to our fancies in this
 present state, which gains pleasure to ourselves or reputation with 
 others. It is <I>all vanity,</I> not only in the abuse of it, when it 
 is perverted by the sin of man, but even in the use of it. Man, 
 considered with reference to these things, is vanity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:5,6">Ps. xxxix. 5, 6</A>),
 
 and, if there were not another life after this, were made in vain
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:47">Ps. lxxxix. 47</A>);

 and those things, considered in reference to man (whatever they are in
 themselves), are <I>vanity.</I> They are impertinent to the soul, 
 foreign, and add nothing to it; they do not answer the end, nor yield 
 any true satisfaction; they are uncertain in their continuance, are 
 fading, and perishing, and passing away, and will certainly deceive and 
 disappoint those that put a confidence in them. Let us not therefore 
 <I>love vanity</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:2">Ps. iv. 2</A>),

 nor <I>lift up our souls</I> to it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:4">Ps. xxiv. 4</A>),

 for we shall but weary ourselves for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:13">Heb. ii. 13</A>.

 It is expressed here very emphatically; not only, <I>All is vain,</I>
 but in the abstract, <I>All is vanity;</I> as if vanity were the 
 <I>proprium quarto modo--property in the fourth mode,</I> of the things 
 of this world, that which enters into the nature of them. They are not
 only <I>vanity,</I> but <I>vanity of vanities,</I> the vainest vanity, 
 vanity in the highest degree, nothing but vanity, such a vanity as is 
 the cause of a great deal of vanity. And this is redoubled, because the 
 thing is certain and past dispute, it is <I>vanity of vanities.</I> 
 This intimates that the wise man had his own heart fully convinced of 
 and much affected with this truth, and that he was very desirous that 
 others should be convinced of it and affected with it, as he was, but 
 that he found the generality of men very loth to believe it and 
 consider it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:14">Job xxxiii. 14</A>);

 it intimates likewise that we cannot comprehend and express the vanity
 of this world. But who is it that speaks thus slightly of the world? Is 
 it one that will stand to what he says? Yes, he puts his name to 
 it--<I>saith the preacher.</I> Is it one that was a competent judge? 
 Yes, as much as ever any man was. Many speak contemptuously of the 
 world because they are hermits, and know it not, or beggars, and have 
 it not; but Solomon knew it. He had dived into nature's depths

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:33">1 Kings iv. 33</A>),

 and he had it, more of it perhaps than ever any man had, his head
 filled with its notions and <I>his belly</I> with its <I>hidden 
 treasures</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>),

 and he passes this judgment on it. But did he speak as one having
 authority? Yes, not only that of a king, but that of a prophet, a 
 preacher; he spoke in God's name, and was divinely inspired to say it. 
 But did he not say it in his haste, or in a passion, upon occasion of 
 some particular disappointment? No; he said it deliberately, said it 
 and proved it, laid it down as a fundamental principle, on which he 
 grounded the necessity of being religious. And, as some think, one main 
 thing he designed was to show that the everlasting throne and kingdom 
 which God had by Nathan promised to David and his seed must be of 
 another world; for all things in this world are subject to vanity, and 
 therefore have not in them sufficient to answer the extent of that 
 promise. If Solomon find all to be vanity, then the kingdom of the 
 Messiah must come, in which we shall inherit substance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they are insufficient to make us happy. And for this he appeals 
 to men's consciences: <I>What profit has a man of all the pains he 
 takes?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Observe here,

 (1.) The business of this world described. It is <I>labour;</I> the
 word signifies both care and toil.  It is work that wearies men. There 
 is a constant fatigue in worldly business. It is <I>labour under the 
 sun;</I> that is a phrase peculiar to this book, where we meet with it 
 twenty-eight times. There is a world above the sun, a world which needs 
 not the sun, for the glory of God is its light, where there is work 
 without labour and with great profit, the work of angels; but he speaks 
 of the work <I>under the sun,</I> the pains of which are great and the 
 gains little. It is <I>under the sun,</I> under the influence of the 
 sun, by its light and in its heat; as we have the benefit of the light 
 of the day, so we have sometimes the burden and heat of the day

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+20:12">Matt. xx. 12</A>),

 and therefore <I>in the sweat of our face we eat bread.</I> In the dark
 and cold grave the weary are at rest.

 (2.) The benefit of that business enquired into: <I>What profit has a
 man of all that labour?</I> Solomon says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+14:23">Prov. xiv. 23</A>),

 <I>In all labour there is profit;</I> and yet here he denies that there
 is any profit.  As to our present condition in the world, it is true 
 that by labour we get that which we call <I>profit;</I> we <I>eat the 
 labour of our hands;</I> but as the wealth of the world is commonly 
 called <I>substance,</I> and yet it is <I>that which is not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:5">Prov. xxii. 5</A>),

 so it is called <I>profit,</I> but the question is whether it be really
 so or no. And here he determines that it is not, that it is not a real 
 benefit, that it is not a remaining benefit. In short, the wealth and 
 pleasure of this world, if we had ever so much of them, are not 
 sufficient to make us happy, nor will they be a portion for us. 

 [1.] As to the body, and the life that now is, <I>What profit has a man
 of all his labour? A man's life consists not in an abundance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:15">Luke xii. 15</A>.

 As goods are increased care about them is increased, and <I>those are
 increased that eat of them,</I> and a little thing will embitter all 
 the comfort of them; and then <I>what profit has a man</I> of all his 
 labour? Early up, and never the nearer.

 [2.] As to the soul, and the life that is to come, we may much more
 truly say, <I>What profit has a man of all his labour?</I> All he gets 
 by it will not supply the wants of the soul, nor satisfy its desires, 
 will not atone for the sin of the soul, nor cure its diseases, nor 
 contervail the loss of it; what profit will they be of to the soul in 
 death, in judgment, or in the everlasting state? The fruit of our 
 labour in heavenly things is <I>meat that endures to eternal life,</I> 
 but the fruit of our labour for the world is only <I>meat that 
 perishes.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 To prove the vanity of all things under the sun, and their 
 insufficiency to make us happy, Solomon here shows, 

 1. That the time of our enjoyment of these things is very short, and
 only while we <I>accomplish as a hireling his day.</I> We continue in 
 the world but for one generation, which is continually passing away to 
 make room for another, and we are passing with it. Our worldly 
 possessions we very lately had from others, and must very shortly leave 
 to others, and therefore to us they are vanity; they can be no more 
 substantial than that life which is the <I>substratum</I> of them, and 
 that is but a <I>vapour, which appears for a little while and then 
 vanishes away.</I> While the stream of mankind is continually flowing, 
 how little enjoyment has one drop of that stream of the pleasant banks 
 between which it glides! We may give God the glory of that constant 
 succession of generations, in which the world has hitherto had its 
 existence, and will have to the end of time, admitting his patience in 
 continuing that sinful species and his power in continuing that dying 
 species. We may be also quickened to do the work of our generation 
 diligently, and serve it faithfully, because it will be over shortly; 
 and, in concern for mankind in general, we should consult the welfare 
 of succeeding generations; but as to our own happiness, let us not 
 expect it within such narrow limits, but in an eternal rest and 
 consistency. 

 2. That when we leave this world we leave the earth behind us, that
 <I>abides for ever</I> where it is, and therefore the things of the 
 earth can stand us in no stead in the future state. It is well for 
 mankind in general that the earth endures to the end of time, when it 
 and all the works in it shall be burnt up; but what is that to 
 particular persons, when they remove to the world of spirits? 

 3. That the condition of man is, in this respect, worse than that even
 of the inferior creatures: <I>The earth abides for ever,</I> but man 
 abides upon the earth but a little while. The sun sets indeed every 
 night, yet it rises again in the morning, as bright and fresh as ever; 
 the winds, though they shift their point, yet in some point or other 
 still they are; the waters that go to the sea above ground come from it 
 again under ground. <I>But man lies down and rises not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:7,12">Job xiv. 7, 12</A>.

 4.  That all things in this world are movable and mutable, and subject
 to a continual toil and agitation, constant in nothing but inconstancy, 
 still going, never resting; it was but once that the sun stood still; 
 when it is risen it is hastening to set, and, when it is set, hastening 
 to rise again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);
 
 the winds are ever and anon shifting
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and the waters in a continual circulation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 it would be of as bad consequence for them to stagnate as for the blood
 in the body to do so. And can we expect rest in a world where all 
 things are thus full of labour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 on a sea that is always ebbing and flowing, and her waves continually
 working and rolling? 

 5. That though all things are still in motion, yet they are still where
 they were; The sun <I>parts</I> (as it is in the margin), but it is to 
 the same place; the wind turns till it comes to the same place, and so 
 the waters return to the place whence they came.  Thus man, after all 
 the pains he takes to find satisfaction and happiness in the creature, 
 is but where he was, still as far to seek as ever. Man's mind is as 
 restless in its pursuits as the sun, and wind, and rivers, but never 
 satisfied, never contented; the more it has of the world the more it 
 would have; and it would be no sooner filled with the streams of 
 outward prosperity, the brooks of <I>honey and butter</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:17">Job xx. 17</A>),

 than the sea is with <I>all the rivers that run into it;</I> it is
 still as it was, <I>a troubled sea that cannot rest.</I> 

 6. That <I>all things continue as they were from the beginning of the
 creation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:4">2 Pet. iii. 4</A>.

 The earth is where it was; the sun, and winds, and rivers, keep the
 same course that ever they did; and therefore, if they have never yet 
 been sufficient to make a happiness for man, they are never likely to 
 be so, for they can but yield the same comfort that they have yielded. 
 We must therefore look above the sun for satisfaction, and for a new 
 world. 

 7. That this world is, at the best, a weary land: <I>All is vanity,</I>
 for all is <I>full of labour.</I> The whole creation is made subject to 
 this vanity ever since man was sentenced to <I>eat bread in the sweat 
 of his brows.</I> If we survey the whole creation, we shall see all 
 busy; all have enough to do to mind their own business; none will be a 
 portion or happiness for man; all labour to serve him, but none prove a 
 <I>help-meet</I> for him. Man cannot express how full of labour all 
 things are, can neither number the laborious nor measure the labours. 
 
 8. That our senses are unsatisfied, and the objects of them
 unsatisfying. He specifies those senses that perform their office with 
 least toil, and are most capable of being pleased: <I>The eye is not 
 satisfied with seeing,</I> but is weary of seeing always the same 
 sight, and covets novelty and variety.  <I>The ear</I> is fond, at 
 first, of a pleasant song or tune, but soon nauseates it, and must have 
 another; both are surfeited, but neither satiated, and what was most 
 grateful becomes ungrateful. Curiosity is still inquisitive, because 
 still unsatisfied, and the more it is humoured the more nice and 
 peevish it grows, crying, <I>Give, give.</I></P>

 Two things we are apt to take a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction 
 in, and value ourselves upon, with reference to our business and 
 enjoyments in the world, as if they helped to save them from vanity. 
 Solomon shows us our mistake in both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The novelty of the invention, that it is such as was never known 
 before. How grateful is it to think that none ever made such advances 
 in knowledge, and such discoveries by it, as we, that none ever made 
 such improvements of an estate or trade, and had the art of enjoying 
 the gains of it, as we have. Their contrivances and compositions are 
 all despised and run down, and we boast of new fashions, new 
 hypotheses, new methods, new expressions, which jostle out the old, and 
 put them down. But this is all a mistake: <I>The thing that</I> is, and 
 <I>shall be, is</I> the same with <I>that which has been, and that 
 which shall be done</I> will be but the same with <I>that which is 
 done,</I> for <I>there is no new thing under the sun,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 It is repeated

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 by way of question, <I>is there any thing</I> of which <I>it may be
 said,</I> with wonder, <I>See, this is new;</I> there never was the 
 like? It is an appeal to observing men, and a challenge to those that 
 cry up modern learning above that of the ancients. Let them name any 
 thing which they take to be new, and though perhaps we cannot make it 
 to appear, for want of the records of former times, yet we have reason 
 to conclude <I>that it has been already of old time, which was before 
 us.</I> What is there in the kingdom of nature of which we may say, 
 <I>This is new? The works were finished from the foundation of the 
 world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:3">Heb. iv. 3</A>);

 things which appear new to us, as they do to children, are not so in
 themselves. The heavens were <I>of old;</I> the earth abides for ever; 
 the powers of nature and the links of natural causes are still the same 
 that ever they were. In the kingdom of Providence, though the course 
 and method of it have not such known and certain rules as that of 
 nature, nor does it go always in the same track, yet, in the general, 
 it is still the same thing over and over again. Men's hearts, and the 
 corruptions of them, are still the same; their desires, and pursuits, 
 and complaints, are still the same; and what God does in his dealings 
 with men is according to the scripture, according to the manner, so 
 that it is all repetition. What is surprising to us needs not be so, 
 for there has been the like, the like strange advancements and 
 disappointments, the like strange revolutions and sudden turns, sudden 
 turns of affairs; the miseries of human life have always been much the 
 same, and mankind tread a perpetual round, and, as the sun and wind, 
 are but where they were. Now the design of this is,

 (1.) To show the folly of the children of men in affecting things that
 are new, in imagining that they have discovered such things, and in 
 pleasing and priding themselves in them. We are apt to nauseate old 
 things, and to grow weary of what we have been long used to, as Israel 
 of the manna, and covet, with the Athenians, still to tell and hear of 
 some new thing, and admire this and the other as new, whereas it is all 
 what has been. Tatianus the Assyrian, showing the Grecians how all the 
 arts which they valued themselves upon owed their original to those 
 nations which they counted barbarous, thus reasons with them: "For 
 shame, do not call those things 
 <B><I>eureseis</I></B>--<I>inventions,</I> which are but 
 <B><I>mimeseis</I></B>--<I>imitations.</I>"

 (2.) To take us off from expecting happiness or satisfaction in the
 creature. Why should we look for it there, where never any yet have 
 found it? What reason have we to think that the world should be any 
 kinder to us than it has been to those that have gone before us, since 
 there is nothing in it that is new, and our predecessors have made as 
 much of it as could be made?  <I>Your fathers did eat manna, and</I> 
 yet they <I>are dead.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:8,9,Joh+6:49">John viii. 8, 9; vi. 49</A>.

 (3.) To quicken us to secure spiritual and eternal blessings. If we
 would be entertained with new things, we must acquaint ourselves with 
 the things of God, get a new nature; then <I>old things pass away, and 
 all things become new,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:17">2 Cor. v. 17</A>.

 The gospel puts <I>a new song into our mouths.</I> In heaven <I>all is
 new</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:5">Rev. xxi. 5</A>),

 all new at first, wholly unlike the present state of things, a new
 world indeed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:35">Luke xx. 35</A>),

 and all new to eternity, always fresh, always flourishing. This
 consideration should make us willing to die, That in this world there 
 is nothing but the same over and over again, and we can expect nothing 
 from it more or better than we have had.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The memorableness of the achievement, that it is such as will be 
 known and talked of hereafter. Many think they have found satisfaction 
 enough in this, that their names shall be perpetuated, that posterity 
 will celebrate the actions they have performed, the honours they have 
 won, and the estates they have raised, that <I>their houses shall 
 continue for ever</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:11">Ps. xlix. 11</A>);

 but herein they deceive themselves.  How many <I>former things</I> and
 persons were there, which in their day looked very great and made a 
 mighty figure, and yet <I>there is no remembrance</I> of them; they are 
 buried in oblivion. Here and there one person or action that was 
 remarkable met with a kind historian, and had the good hap to be 
 recorded, when at the same time there were others, no less remarkable, 
 that were dropped: and therefore we may conclude that <I>neither shall 
 there be any remembrance of things to come,</I> but that which we hope 
 to be remembered by will be either lost or slighted.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
 &nbsp; 13  And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom
 concerning all <I>things</I> that are done under heaven: this sore
 travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised
 therewith.
 &nbsp; 14  I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,

 &nbsp; 15  <I>That which is</I> crooked cannot be made straight: and that
 which is wanting cannot be numbered.

 great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all <I>they</I> that
 have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great
 experience of wisdom and knowledge.
 &nbsp; 17  And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and
 folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

 knowledge increaseth sorrow.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon, having asserted in general that <I>all is vanity,</I> and 
 having given some general proofs of it, now takes the most effectual 
 method to evince the truth of it, 

 1. By his own experience; he tried them all, and found them vanity. 

 2.  By an induction of particulars; and here he begins with that which
 bids fairest of all to be the happiness of a reasonable creature, and 
 that is knowledge and learning; if this be vanity, every thing else 
 must needs be so. Now as to this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Solomon tells us here what trial he had made of it, and that with 
 such advantages that, if true satisfaction could have been found in it, 
 he would have found it. 

 1. His high station gave him an opportunity of improving himself in all
 parts of learning, and particularly in politics and the conduct of 
 human affairs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He that is <I>the preacher</I> of this doctrine <I>was king over
 Israel,</I> whom all their neighbours admired as <I>a wise and 
 understanding people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:6">Deut. iv. 6</A>.

 He had his royal seat <I>in Jerusalem,</I> which then deserved, better
 than Athens ever did, to be called <I>the eye of the world.</I> The 
 heart of a king is unsearchable; he has reaches of his own, and <I>a 
 divine sentence is often in his lips.</I> It is his honour, it is his 
 business, to search out every matter. Solomon's great wealth and honour 
 put him into a capacity of making his court the centre of learning and 
 the rendezvous of learned men, of furnishing himself with the best of 
 books, and either conversing or corresponding with all the wise and 
 knowing part of mankind then in being, who made application to him to 
 learn of him, by which he could not but improve himself; for it is in 
 knowledge as it is in trade, all the profit is by barter and exchange; 
 if we have that to say which will instruct others, they will have that 
 to say which will instruct us. Some observe how slightly Solomon speaks 
 of his dignity and honour. He does not say, <I>I the preacher am</I> 
 king, but I <I>was king,</I> no matter what I am. He speaks of it as a 
 thing past, because worldly honours are transitory.

 2. He applied himself to the improvement of these advantages, and the
 opportunities he had of getting wisdom, which, though ever so great, 
 will not make a man wise unless he give his mind to it. Solomon <I>gave 
 his heart to seek and search out</I> all things to be known <I>by 
 wisdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He made it his business to acquaint himself with <I>all the things that
 are done under the sun,</I> that are done by the providence of God or 
 by the art and prudence of man. He set himself to get all the insight 
 he could into philosophy and mathematics, into husbandry and trade, 
 merchandise and mechanics, into the history of former ages and the 
 present state of other kingdoms, their laws, customs, and policies, 
 into men's different tempers, capacities, and projects, and the methods 
 of managing them; he set himself not only to seek, but to search, to 
 pry into, that which is most intricate, and which requires the closest
 application of mind and the most vigorous and constant prosecution.  
 Though he was a prince, he made himself a drudge to learning, was not 
 discouraged by its knots, nor took up short of its depths. And this he 
 did, not merely to gratify his own genius, but to qualify himself for 
 the service of God, and his generation, and to make an experiment how 
 far the enlargement of the knowledge would go towards the settlement 
 and repose of the mind.

 3. He made a very great progress in his studies, wonderfully improved
 all the parts of learning, and carried his discoveries much further 
 than any that had been before him.  He did not condemn learning, as 
 many do, because they cannot conquer it and will not be at the pains to 
 make themselves masters of it; no, what he aimed at he compassed; he 
 <I>saw all the works that were done under the sun</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 works of nature in the upper and lower world, all within this vortex
 (to use the modern gibberish) which has the sun for its centre, works 
 of art, the product of men's wit, in a personal or social capacity. He
 had as much satisfaction in the success of his searches as ever any man 
 had; he <I>communed with his own heart</I> concerning his attainments 
 in knowledge, with as much pleasure as ever any rich merchant had in 
 taking account of his stock. He could say, "<I>Lo, I</I> have magnified 
 and increased <I>wisdom,</I> have not only gotten more of it myself, 
 but have done more to propagate it and bring it into reputation, than 
 any, <I>than all that have been before me in Jerusalem.</I>" Note, It 
 becomes great men to be studious, and delight themselves most in 
 intellectual pleasures. Where God gives great advantages of getting 
 knowledge he expects improvements accordingly. It is happy with a 
 people when their princes and noblemen study to excel others as much in 
 wisdom and useful knowledge as they do in honour and estate; and they 
 may do that service to the commonwealth of learning by applying 
 themselves to the studies that are proper for them which meaner persons 
 cannot do. Solomon must be acknowledged as competent judge of this 
 matter, for he had not only got his head full of notions, but his 
 <I>heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge,</I> of the power 
 and benefit of knowledge, as well as the amusement and entertainment of 
 it; what he knew he had digested, and knew how to make use of.  
 <I>Wisdom entered into his heart,</I> and so became <I>pleasant to his 
 soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:10,11,22:18">Prov. ii. 10, 11; xxii. 18</A>.

 4. He applied his studies especially to that part of learning which is
 most serviceable to the conduct of human life, and consequently is the 
 most valuable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>I gave my heart to know</I> the rules and dictates of
 <I>wisdom,</I> and how I might obtain it; <I>and to know madness and 
 folly,</I> how I might prevent and cure it, to know the snares and 
 insinuations of it, that I might avoid them, and guard against them, 
 and discover its fallacies." So industrious was Solomon to improve 
 himself in knowledge that he gained instruction both by the wisdom of 
 prudent men and by the madness of foolish men, by <I>the field of the 
 slothful,</I> as well as of <I>the diligent.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He tells us what was the result of this trial, to confirm what he 
 had said, that <I>all is vanity.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He found that his searches after knowledge were very toilsome, and a 
 weariness not only to the flesh, but to the mind 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>This sore travail,</I> this difficulty that there is in searching
 after truth and finding it, <I>God has given to the sons of men to 
 be</I> afflicted <I>therewith,</I> as a punishment for our first 
 parents' coveting forbidden knowledge. As bread for the body, so that 
 for the soul, must be got and eaten <I>in the sweat of our face,</I> 
 whereas both would have been had with out labour if Adam had not 
 sinned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He found that the more he saw of <I>the works done under the sun</I> 
 the more he saw of their vanity; nay, and the sight often occasioned 
 him <I>vexation of spirit</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>I have seen all the works</I> of a world full of business, have
 observed what the children of men are doing; <I>and behold,</I> 
 whatever men think of their own works, I see <I>all is vanity and 
 vexation of spirit.</I>" He had before pronounced all <I>vanity</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 needless and unprofitable, and that which does us no good; here he
 adds, It is all <I>vexation of spirit,</I> troublesome and prejudicial, 
 and that which does us hurt.  It is <I>feeding upon wind;</I> so some 
 read it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:1">Hos. xii. 1</A>.

 (1.) The works themselves which we see done are <I>vanity and
 vexation</I> to those that are employed in them. There is so much care 
 in the contrivance of our worldly business, so much toil in the 
 prosecution of it, and so much trouble in the disappointments we meet 
 with in it, that we may well say, It is <I>vexation of spirit.</I>

 (2.) The sight of them is <I>vanity and vexation of spirit</I> to the
 wise observer of them. The more we see of the world the more we see to 
 make us uneasy, and, with Heraclitus, to look upon all with weeping 
 eyes. Solomon especially perceived that the knowledge of <I>wisdom and 
 folly</I> was <I>vexation of spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 It vexed him to see many that had wisdom not use it, and many that had
 folly not strive against it. It vexed him when he knew wisdom to see 
 how far off it stood from the children of men, and, when he saw folly, 
 to see how fast it was bound in their hearts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He found that when he had got some knowledge he could neither gain 
 that satisfaction to himself nor do that good to others with it which 
 he expected, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 It would not avail,

 (1.) To redress the many grievances of human life: "After all, I find
 that <I>that which is crooked</I> will be crooked still and <I>cannot 
 be made straight.</I>" Our knowledge is itself intricate and perplexed; 
 we must go far about and fetch a great compass to come at it. Solomon 
 thought to find out a nearer way to it, but he could not. The paths of 
 learning are as much a labyrinth as ever they were. The minds and 
 manners of men are crooked and perverse. Solomon thought, with his 
 wisdom and power together, thoroughly to reform his kingdom, and make 
 that straight which he found crooked; but he was disappointed. All the 
 philosophy and politics in the world will not restore the corrupt 
 nature of man to its primitive rectitude; we find the insufficiency of 
 them both in others and in ourselves. Learning will not alter men's 
 natural tempers, nor cure them of their sinful distempers; nor will it 
 change the constitution of things in this world; a vale of tears it is 
 and so it will be when all is done.

 (2.) To make up the many deficiencies in the comfort of human life:
 <I>That which is wanting</I> there <I>cannot be numbered,</I> or 
 counted out to us from the treasures of human learning, but what <I>is 
 wanting</I> will still be so. All our enjoyments here, when we have 
 done our utmost to bring them to perfection, are still lame and 
 defective, and it cannot be helped; as they are, so they are likely to 
 be. <I>That which is wanting</I> in our knowledge is so much that it 
 <I>cannot be numbered.</I> The more we know the more we see of our own 
 ignorance. <I>Who can understand his errors,</I> his defects?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Upon the whole, therefore, he concluded that great scholars do but 
 make themselves great mourners; <I>for in much wisdom is much 
 grief,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 There must be a great deal of pains taken to get it, and a great deal
 of care not to forget it; the more we know the more we see there is to 
 be known, and consequently we perceive with greater clearness that our 
 work is without end, and the more we see of our former mistakes and 
 blunders, which occasions <I>much grief.</I> The more we see of men's 
 different sentiments and opinions (and it is that which a great deal of 
 our learning is conversant about) the more at a loss we are, it may be, 
 which is in the right. Those <I>that increase knowledge</I> have so 
 much the more quick and sensible perception of the calamities of this 
 world, and for one discovery they make that is pleasing, perhaps, they 
 make ten that are displeasing, and so they <I>increase sorrow.</I> Let 
 us not therefore be driven off from the pursuit of any useful 
 knowledge, but put on patience to break through the sorrow of it; but 
 let us despair of finding true happiness in this knowledge, and expect 
 it only in the knowledge of God and the careful discharge of our duty 
 to him. <I>He that increases</I> in heavenly wisdom, and in an 
 experimental acquaintance with the principles, powers, and pleasures of 
 the spiritual and divine life, <I>increases</I> joy, such as will 
 shortly be consummated in everlasting joy.</P>
