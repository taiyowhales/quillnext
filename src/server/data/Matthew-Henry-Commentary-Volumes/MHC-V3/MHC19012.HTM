 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is supposed that David penned this psalm in Saul's reign, when there
 was a general decay of honesty and piety both in court and country,
 which he here complains of to God, and very feelingly, for he himself
 suffered by the treachery of his false friends and the insolence of his
 sworn enemies.

 I. He begs help of God, because there were none among men whom he durst
 trust,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. He foretels the destruction of his proud and threatening enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III. He assures himself and others that, how ill soever things went now

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:8">ver. 8</A>),
 
 God would preserve and secure to himself his own people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:5,7">ver. 5, 7</A>),

 and would certainly make good his promises to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:6">
 ver. 6</A>.

 Whether this psalm was penned in Saul's reign or no, it is certainly
 calculated for a bad reign; and perhaps David, in spirit foresaw that
 some of his successors would bring things to as bad a pass as is here
 described, and treasured up this psalm for the use of the church then.

 <P>To the chief musician upon Sheminith. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Help, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from
 among the children of men.
 &nbsp; 2  They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: <I>with</I>
 flattering lips <I>and</I> with a double heart do they speak.
 &nbsp; 3  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall cut off all flattering lips, <I>and</I> the tongue
 that speaketh proud things:
 &nbsp; 4  Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips
 <I>are</I> our own: who <I>is</I> lord over us?
 &nbsp; 5  For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy,
 now will I arise, saith the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; I will set <I>him</I> in safety
 <I>from him that</I> puffeth at him.
 &nbsp; 6  The words of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>are</I> pure words: <I>as</I> silver tried in
 a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
 &nbsp; 7  Thou shalt keep them, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thou shalt preserve them from
 this generation for ever.
 &nbsp; 8  The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are
 exalted.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm furnishes us with good thoughts for bad times, in which, 
 though the prudent will keep silent 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:13">Amos v. 13</A>)

 because a man may then be made an offender for a word, yet we may
 comfort ourselves with such suitable meditations and prayers as are 
 here got ready to our hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let us see here what it is that makes the times bad, and when they 
 may be said to be so. Ask the children of this world what it is in 
 their account that makes the times bad, and they will tell you, 
 Scarcity of money, decay of trade, and the desolations of war, make the 
 times bad. But the scripture lays the badness of the times upon causes 
 of another nature. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:1">2 Tim. iii. 1</A>,

 <I>Perilous times shall come,</I> for iniquity shall abound; and that
 is the thing David here complains of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When there is a general decay of piety and honesty among men the 
 times are then truly bad 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>When the godly man ceases and the faithful fail.</I> Observe how 
 these two characters are here put together, the godly and the faithful. 
 As there is no true policy, so there is no true piety, without honesty. 
 Godly men are faithful men, <I>fast</I> men, so they have sometimes 
 been called; their word is as confirming as their oath, as binding as 
 their bond; they make conscience of being true both to God and man. 
 They are here said to cease and fail, either by death or by desertion, 
 or by both. Those that were godly and faithful were taken away, and 
 those that were left had sadly degenerated and were not what they had 
 been; so that there were few or no good people that were Israelites 
 indeed to be met with. Perhaps he meant that there were no godly
 faithful men among Saul's courtiers; if he meant there were few or none 
 in Israel, we hope he was under the same mistake that Elijah was, who 
 thought he only was left alone, when God had 7000 who kept their 
 integrity 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:3">Rom. xi. 3</A>);

 or he meant that there were few in comparison; there was a general
 decay of religion and virtue (and the times are bad, very bad, when it 
 is so), not a man to be found that executes judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:1">Jer. v. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When dissimulation and flattery have corrupted and debauched all 
 conversation, then the times are very bad 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 when men are generally so profligate that they make no conscience of a 
 lie, are so spiteful as to design against their neighbours the worst of 
 mischiefs, and yet so base as to cover the design with the most 
 specious and plausible pretences and professions of friendship. Thus 
 <I>they speak vanity</I> (that is, falsehood and a lie) <I>every one to 
 his neighbour, with flattering lips and a double heart.</I> They will 
 kiss and kill (as Joab did Abner and Amasa in David's own time), will 
 smile in your face and cut your throat. This is the devil's image 
 complete, a complication of malice and falsehood. The times are bad 
 indeed when there is no such thing as sincerity to be met with, when an 
 honest man knows not whom to believe nor whom to trust, nor dares put 
 confidence in a friend, in a guide, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:5,6,Jer+9:4,5">Mic. vii. 5, 6; Jer. ix. 4, 5</A>.

 Woe to those who help to make the times thus perilous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. When the enemies of God, and religion, and religious people, are 
 impudent and daring, and threaten to run down all that is just and 
 sacred, then the times are very bad, when proud sinners have arrived at 
 such a pitch of impiety as to say, "<I>With our tongue will we 
 prevail</I> against the cause of virtue; <I>our lips are our own</I> 
 and we may say what we will; <I>who is lord over us,</I> either to 
 restrain us or to call us to an account?" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 This bespeaks,

 (1.) A proud conceit of themselves and confidence in themselves, as if 
 the point were indeed gained by eating forbidden fruit, and they were 
 as gods, independent and self-sufficient, infallible in their knowledge 
 of good and evil and therefore fit to be oracles, irresistible in their 
 power and therefore fit to be lawgivers, that could prevail with their 
 tongues, and, like God himself, speak and it is done. 

 (2.) An insolent contempt of God's dominion as if he had no propriety 
 in them--<I>Our lips are our own</I> (an unjust pretension, for who 
 made man's mouth, in whose hand is his breath, and whose is the air he 
 breathes in?) and as if he had no authority either to command them or 
 to judge them: <I>Who is Lord over us?</I> Like Pharaoh,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+5:1">Exod. v. 1</A>.

 This is as absurd and unreasonable as the former; for he in whom we
 live, and move, and have our being, must needs be, by an indisputable 
 title, Lord over us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. When the poor and needy are oppressed, and abused, and puffed at, 
 then the times are very bad. This is implied 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 where God himself takes notice of <I>the oppression of the poor</I> and 
 <I>the sighing of the needy;</I> they are oppressed because they are 
 poor, have all manner of wrong done them merely because they are not in 
 a capacity to right themselves. Being thus oppressed, they dare not 
 speak for themselves, lest their defence should be made their offence; 
 but they sigh, secretly bemoaning their calamities, and pouring out 
 their souls in sighs before God. If their oppressors be spoken to on 
 their behalf, they puff at them, make light of their own sin and the 
 misery of the poor, and lay neither to heart; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:5">Ps. x. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. When wickedness abounds, and goes barefaced, under the protection 
 and countenance of those in authority, then the times are very bad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 <I>When the vilest men are exalted</I> to places of trust and power
 (who, instead of putting the laws in execution against vice and 
 injustice and punishing the wicked according to their merits, patronise 
 and protect them, give them countenance, and support their reputation 
 by their own example), then <I>the wicked walk on every side;</I> they 
 swarm in all places, and go up and down seeking to deceive, debauch, 
 and destroy others; they are neither afraid nor ashamed to discover 
 themselves; they declare their sin as Sodom and there is none to check 
 or control them. Bad men are base men, the vilest of men, and they are 
 so though they are ever so highly exalted in this world. Antiochus the 
 illustrious the scripture calls <I>a vile person,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:21">Dan. xi. 21</A>.

 But it is bad with a kingdom when such are preferred; no marvel if
 wickedness then grows impudent and insolent. <I>When the wicked bear
 rule the people mourn.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us now see what good thoughts we are here furnished with for 
 such bad times; and what times we may yet be reserved for we cannot 
 tell. When times are thus bad it is comfortable to think,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That we have a God to go to, from whom we may ask and expect the 
 redress of all our grievances. This he begins with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>Help, Lord, for the godly man ceaseth.</I> All other helps and 
 helpers fail; even the godly and faithful, who should lend a helping 
 hand to support the dying cause of religion, are gone, and therefore 
 whither shall we seek but to thee?" Note, When godly faithful people 
 cease and fail it is time to cry, <I>Help, Lord!</I> The abounding of 
 iniquity threatens a deluge. "Help, Lord, help the virtuous; few seek
 to hold fast their integrity, and to stand in the gap; help to save thy 
 own interest in the world from sinking. <I>It is time for thee, Lord, 
 to work.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That God will certainly reckon with false and proud men, and will 
 punish and restrain their insolence. They are above the control of men 
 and set them at defiance. Men cannot discover the falsehood of 
 flatterers, nor humble the haughtiness of those that speak proud 
 things; but the righteous God will <I>cut off all flattering lips,</I> 
 that give the traitor's kiss and speak words softer then oil when war 
 is in the heart; he will pluck out <I>the tongue that speaks proud 
 things</I> against God and religion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Some translate it as a prayer, "May God cut off those false and
 spiteful lips." <I>Let lying lips be put to silence.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That God will, in due time, work deliverance for his oppressed 
 people, and shelter them from the malicious designs of their 
 persecutors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Now, will I arise, saith the Lord.</I> This promise of God, which 
 David here delivered by the spirit of prophecy, is an answer to that 
 petition which he put up to God by the spirit of prayer. "Help, Lord," 
 says he; "I will," says God; "here I am, with seasonable and effectual 
 help."

 (1.) It is seasonable, in the fittest time.

 [1.] When the oppressors are in the height of their pride and 
 insolence--when they say, <I>Who is lord over us?</I>--then is God's 
 time to let them know, to their cost, that he is above them. 

 [2.] When the oppressed are in the depth of their distress and 
 despondency, when they are sighing like Israel in Egypt by reason of 
 the cruel bondage, then is God's time to appear for them, as for Israel 
 when they were most dejected and Pharaoh was most elevated. <I>Now will 
 I arise.</I> Note, There is a time fixed for the rescue of oppressed 
 innocency; that time will come, and we may be sure it is the fittest 
 time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:13">Ps. cii. 13</A>.

 (2.) It is effectual: <I>I will set him in safety,</I> or in salvation,
 not only protect him, but restore him to his former prosperity, will 
 <I>bring him out into a wealthy place</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:12">Ps. lxvi. 12</A>),

 so that, upon the whole, he shall lose nothing by his sufferings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That, though men are false, God is faithful; though they are not to 
 be trusted, God is. They speak vanity and flattery, but <I>the words of 
 the Lord are pure words</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 not only all true, but all pure, like silver tried in a furnace of 
 earth or a crucible. It denotes,

 (1.) The sincerity of God's word, every thing is really as it is there 
 represented and not otherwise; it does not jest with us, not impose 
 upon us, nor has it any other design towards us than our own good. 

 (2.) The preciousness of God's word; it is of great and intrinsic 
 value, like silver refined to the highest degree; it has nothing in it 
 to depreciate it. 

 (3.) The many proofs that have been given of its power and truth; it 
 has been often tried, all the saints in all ages have trusted it and so 
 tried it, and it never deceived them nor frustrated their expectation, 
 but they have all set to their seal that God's word is true, with an 
 <I>Experto crede--Trust one that has made trial;</I> they have found it 
 so. Probably this refers especially to these promises of succouring and 
 relieving the poor and oppressed. Their friends put them in hopes that
 they will do something for them, and yet prove a broken reed; but the 
 words of God are what we may rely upon; and the less confidence is to 
 be put in men's words let us with the more assurance trust in God's 
 word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That God will secure his chosen remnant to himself, how bad soever 
 the times are 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.</I> This 
 intimates that, as long as the world stands, there will be a generation 
 of proud and wicked men in it, more or less, who will threaten by their 
 wretched arts to ruin religion, by <I>wearing out the saints of the 
 Most High,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:25">Dan. vii. 25</A>.

 But let God alone to maintain his own interest and to preserve his own
 people. He will keep them from this generation,

 (1.) From being debauched by them and drawn away from God, from 
 mingling with them and learning their works. In times of general 
 apostasy the Lord knows those that are his, and they shall be enabled 
 to keep their integrity. 

 (2.) From being destroyed and rooted out by them. The church is built
 upon a rock, and so well fortified that the gates of hell shall not
 prevail against it. In the worst of times God has his remnant, and in
 every age will reserve to himself a holy seed and preserve that to his
 heavenly kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this psalm, and praying it over, we must bewail the general
 corruption of manners, thank God that things are not worse than they
 are, but pray and hope that they will be better in God's due time.</P>
