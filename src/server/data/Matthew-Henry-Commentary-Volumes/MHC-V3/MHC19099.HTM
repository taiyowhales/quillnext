 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Still we are celebrating the glories of the kingdom of God among men, 
 and are called upon to praise him, as in the foregoing psalms; but 
 those psalms looked forward to the times of the gospel, and prophesied 
 of the graces and comforts of those times; this psalm seems to dwell 
 more upon the Old-Testament dispensation and the manifestation of God's 
 glory and grace in that. The Jews were not, in expectation of the 
 Messiah's kingdom and the evangelical worship, to neglect the divine 
 regimen they were then under, and the ordinances that were then given 
 them, but in them to see God reigning, and to worship before him 
 according to the law of Moses. Prophecies of good things to come must 
 not lessen our esteem of good things present. To Israel indeed
 pertained the promises, which they were bound to believe; but to them 
 pertained also the giving of the law, and the service of God, which 
 they were also bound dutifully and conscientiously to attend to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4">Rom. ix. 4</A>.

 And this they are called to do in this psalm, where yet there is much
 of Christ, for the government of the church was in the hands of the 
 eternal Word before he was incarnate; and, besides, the ceremonial 
 services were types and figures of evangelical worship. The people of 
 Israel are here required to praise and exalt God, and to worship before 
 him, in consideration of these two things:--

 I. The happy constitution of the government they were under, both in
 sacred and civil things,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:1-5">ver.  1-5</A>.

 II. Some instances of the happy administration of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.

 In singing this psalm we must set ourselves to exalt the name of God,
 as it is made known to us in the gospel, which we have much more reason
 to do than those had who lived under the law.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth
 <I>between</I> the cherubims; let the earth be moved.
 &nbsp; 2  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> great in Zion; and he <I>is</I> high above all the

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The foundation of all religion is laid in this truth, That <I>the Lord 
 reigns.</I> God governs the world by his providence, governs the church 
 by his grace, and both by his Son. We are to believe not only that 
 <I>the Lord lives,</I> but that <I>the Lord reigns.</I> This is the 
 triumph of the Christian church, and here it was the triumph of the 
 Jewish church, that Jehovah was their King; and hence it is inferred, 
 <I>Let the people tremble,</I> that is, 

 1. Let even the subjects of this kingdom tremble; for the Old-Testament
 dispensation had much of terror in it. At Mount Sinai Israel, and even 
 Moses himself, did <I>exceedingly fear and quake;</I> and then God was 
 <I>terrible in his holy places.</I> Even when he appeared in his 
 people's behalf, he did terrible things. But we are not now come to 
 <I>that mount that burned with fire,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:18">Heb. xii. 18</A>.

 Now that <I>the Lord reigns let the earth rejoice.</I> Then he ruled
 more by the power of holy fear; now he rules by the power of holy love. 

 2. Much more let the enemies of this kingdom tremble; for he will 
 either bring them into obedience to his golden sceptre or crush them 
 with his iron rod. <I>The Lord reigns, though the people be stirred 
 with indignation</I> at it; though they fret away all their spirits, 
 their rage is all in vain. He will set his King upon his holy hill of 
 Zion in spite of them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1-6">Ps. ii. 1-6</A>);

 first, or last, he will make them <I>tremble,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:15">Rev. vi. 15</A>,

 &c. <I>The Lord reigns, let the
 earth be moved.</I> Those that submit to him shall be established, and 
 not <I>moved</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:10">Ps. xcvi. 10</A>);

 but those that oppose him will be moved.  Heaven and earth shall be
 shaken, and all nations; but the kingdom of Christ is what cannot be
 moved; the <I>things which cannot be shaken shall remain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:27">Heb. xii. 27</A>.
 
 <I>In these is continuance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:5">Isa.  lxiv. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God's kingdom, set up in Israel, is here made the subject of the 
 psalmist's praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Two things the psalmist affirms:--

 1. God presided in the affairs of religion: <I>He sitteth between the
 cherubim</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 as on his throne, to give law by the oracles thence delivered--as on 
 the mercy-seat, to receive petitions. This was the honour of Israel, 
 that they had among them the Shechinah, or special presence of God, 
 attended by the holy angels; the temple was the royal palace, and the 
 Holy of holies was the presence-chamber. <I>The Lord is great in 
 Zion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:2"><I>v.</I>  2</A>);
 
 there he is known and praised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:1,2">Ps. lxxvi. 1, 2</A>);

 there he is served as great, more than any where else. <I>He is
 high</I> there <I>above all people;</I> as that which is high is 
 exposed to view, and looked up to, so in Zion the perfections of the 
 divine nature appear more conspicuous and more illustrious than any 
 where else. Therefore <I>let those</I> that dwell in Zion, and worship 
 there, <I>praise thy great and terrible name,</I> and give thee the 
 glory due unto it, <I>for it is holy.</I> The holiness of God's name 
 makes it truly great to his friends and terrible to his enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 This is that which those above adore--<I>Holy, holy, holy.</I> 

 2. He was all in all in their civil government,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 As in Jerusalem was the testimony of Israel, whither the tribes went
 up, so <I>there were set thrones of judgment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:4,5">Ps. cxxii. 4, 5</A>.

 Their government was a theocracy. God raised up David to rule over them
 (and some think this psalm was penned upon occasion of his quiet and 
 happy settlement in the throne) and he is <I>the king</I> whose 
 <I>strength loves judgment.</I> He is strong; all his strength he has 
 from God; and <I>his strength</I> is not abused for the support of any 
 wrong, as the power of great princes often is, but it <I>loves 
 judgment.</I> He does justice with his power, and does it with delight; 
 and herein he was a type of Christ, to whom God would give <I>the 
 throne of his father David, to do judgment and justice.</I> He has 
 power to crush, but his <I>strength loves judgment;</I> he does not 
 rule with rigour, but with moderation, with wisdom, and with 
 tenderness. The people of Israel had a good king; but they are here 
 taught to look up to God as he by whom their king reigns: <I>Thou dost 
 establish equity</I> (that is, God gave them those excellent laws by 
 which they were governed), and <I>thou executest judgment and 
 righteousness in Jacob;</I> he not only by his immediate providences 
 often executed and enforced his own laws, but took care for the 
 administration of justice among them by civil magistrates, who reigned 
 by him and by him did decree justice. Their judges judged for God, and 
 their judgment was his,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:6">2 Chron.  xix. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Putting these two things together, we see what was the happiness of
 Israel above any other people, as Moses had described it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:7,8">Deut. iv. 7, 8</A>),
 
 that they had <I>God so night unto them,</I> sitting between the
 cherubim, and that they had <I>statutes and judgments so righteous,</I> 
 by which equity was established, and God himself ruled in Jacob, from 
 which he infers this command to that happy people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>Exalt you the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool;</I> give 
 him the glory of the good government you are under, as it is now 
 established, both in church and state." Note, 

 1. The greater the public mercies are which we have a share in the more
 we are obliged to bear a part in the public homage paid to God: the 
 setting up of the kingdom of Christ, especially, ought to be the matter 
 of our praise. 

 2. When we draw nigh to God, to worship him, our hearts must be filled
 with high thoughts of him, and he must be exalted in our souls. 

 3. The more we abase ourselves, and the more prostrate we are before
 God, the more we exalt him. We must <I>worship at his footstool,</I> at 
 his ark, which was as the footstool to the mercy-seat between the 
 cherubim; or we must cast ourselves down upon the pavement of his 
 courts; and good reason we have to be thus reverent, <I>for he is 
 holy,</I> and his holiness should strike an awe upon us, as it does on 
 the angels themselves,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that
 call upon his name; they called upon the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and he answered
 them.
 &nbsp; 7  He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his
 testimonies, and the ordinance <I>that</I> he gave them.
 &nbsp; 8  Thou answeredst them, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> our God: thou wast a God that
 forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their
 inventions.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The happiness of Israel in God's government is here further made out by 
 some particular instances of his administration, especially with 
 reference to those that were, in their day, the prime leaders and most 
 active useful governors of that people--Moses, Aaron, and Samuel, in the
 two former of whom the theocracy or divine government began (for they 
 were employed to form Israel into a people) and in the last of whom 
 that form of government, in a great measure, ended; for when the people 
 rejected Samuel, and urged him to resign, they are said to reject God 
 himself, that he should not be so immediately their king as he had been 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:7">1 Sam. viii. 7</A>),

 for now they would have a king, like all the nations.  Moses, as well
 as Aaron, is said to be <I>among his priests,</I> for he executed the 
 priest's office till Aaron was settled in it and he consecrated Aaron 
 and his sons; therefore the Jews call him the <I>priest of the 
 priests.</I> Now concerning these three chief rulers observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The intimate communion they had with God, and the wonderful favour 
 to which he admitted them. None of all the nations of the earth could
 produce three such men as these, that had such an intercourse with
 Heaven, and whom God <I>knew by name,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:17">Exod.  xxxiii. 17</A>.

 Here is, 

 1. Their gracious observance of God. No kingdom had men that honoured
 God as these three men of the kingdom of Israel did. They honoured him,

 (1.) By their prayers. Samuel, though not among his priests, yet was 
 <I>among those that called on his name;</I> and for <I>this</I> they 
 were all famous, <I>They called upon the Lord;</I> they relied not on 
 their own wisdom or virtue, but in every emergency had recourse to God, 
 towards him was their desire, and on him their dependence. 

 (2.) By their obedience: <I>They kept his testimonies, and the 
 ordinances that he gave them;</I> they made conscience of their duty, 
 and in every thing made God's word and law their rule, as knowing that 
 unless they did so they could not expect their prayers should be 
 answered,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:9">Prov.  xxviii. 9</A>.

 Moses did all according to the pattern shown him; it is often repeated,
 <I>According to all that God commanded Moses, so did he.</I> Aaron and 
 Samuel did likewise. Those were the greatest men and most honourable 
 that were most eminent for keeping God's testimonies and conforming to 
 the rule of his word. 

 2. God's gracious acceptance of them: <I>He answered them,</I> and 
 granted them the things which they called upon him for. They all 
 wonderfully prevailed with God in prayer; miracles were wrought at 
 their special instance and request; nay, he not only condescended to do 
 that for them which they desired, as a prince for a petitioner, but he 
 communed with them as one friend familiarly converses with another

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>He spoke unto them in the cloudy pillar.</I> He often spoke to 
 Samuel; from his childhood the word of the Lord came to him, and, 
 probably, sometimes he spoke to him by a bright cloud overshadowing 
 him: however, to Moses and Aaron he often spoke out of the famous 
 <I>cloudy pillar,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:10,Nu+12:5">Exod. xvi. 10; Num. xii. 5</A>.

 Israel are now reminded of this, for the confirming of their faith,
 that though they had not every day such sensible tokens of God's 
 presence as the cloudy pillar was, yet to those that were their first 
 founders, and to him that was their great reformer, God was pleased 
 thus to manifest himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The good offices they did to Israel. They interceded for the 
 people, and for them also they obtained many an answer of peace. 
 <I>Moses stood in the gap,</I> and <I>Aaron between the living and the 
 dead;</I> and, when Israel was in distress, Samuel cried unto the Lord 
 for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:9">1 Sam. vii. 9</A>.

 This is here referred to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Thou answeredst them, O Lord our God!</I> and, at their prayer, 
 <I>thou wast a God that forgavest</I> the people they prayed for; and, 
 <I>though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions,</I> yet thou 
 didst not cut them off from being a people, as their sin deserved." 
 "<I>Thou wast a God that wast propitious for them</I> (so Dr. Hammond), 
 for their sakes, and sparedst the people at their request, even when 
 thou wast about to <I>take vengeance of their inventions,</I> that is, 
 when thy wrath was so highly provoked against them that it was just 
 ready to break in upon them, to their utter overthrow." These were some 
 of the many remarkable instances of God's dominion in Israel, more than 
 in any other nation, for which the people are again called upon to 
 praise God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Exalt the Lord our God,</I> on account of what he has done for us 
 formerly, as well as of late, <I>and worship at his holy hill</I> of 
 Zion, on which he has now set his temple and will shortly <I>set his 
 King</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6">Ps. ii. 6</A>),

 the former a type of the latter; there, as the centre of unity, let all
 God's Israel meet, with their adorations, <I>for the Lord our God is 
 holy,</I> and appears so, not only in his holy law, but in his holy 
 gospel."</P>
