 Elihu, having largely reproved Job for some of his unadvised speeches, 
 which Job had nothing to say in the vindication of, here comes more 
 generally to set him to rights in his notions of God's dealings with 
 him. His other friends had stood to it that, because he was a wicked 
 man, therefore his afflictions were so great and so long. But Elihu 
 only maintained that the affliction was sent for his trial, and that 
 therefore it was lengthened out because Job was not, as yet, thoroughly 
 humbled under it, nor had duly accommodated himself to it. He urges 
 many reasons, taken from the wisdom and righteousness of God, his care 
 of his people, and especially his greatness and almighty power, with 
 which, in this and the following chapter, he persuades him to submit to 
 the hand of God. Here we have, 

 I. His preface, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>.

 II. The account he gives of the methods of God's providence towards the
 children of men, according as they conduct themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:5-15">ver. 5-15</A>.

 III.  The fair warning and good counsel he gives to Job thereupon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:16-21">ver. 16-21</A>.

 IV. His demonstration of God's sovereignty and omnipotence, which he 
 gives instances of in the operations of common providence, and which is 
 a reason why we should all submit to him in his dealings with us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:22-33">ver. 22-33</A>.

 This he prosecutes and enlarges upon in the following chapter.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Elihu also proceeded, and said,
 &nbsp; 2  Suffer me a little, and I will show thee that <I>I have</I> yet to
 speak on God's behalf.
 &nbsp; 3  I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe
 righteousness to my Maker.
 &nbsp; 4  For truly my words <I>shall</I> not <I>be</I> false: he that is perfect
 in knowledge <I>is</I> with thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Once more Elihu begs the patience of the auditory, and Job's 
 particularly, for he has not said all that he has to say, but he will 
 not detain them long. <I>Stand about me a little</I> (so some read it), 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 "Let me have your attendance, your attention, awhile longer, and I will 
 speak but this once, as plainly and as much to the purpose as I can." 
 To gain this he pleads, 

 1. That he had a good cause, and a noble and very fruitful subject: 
 <I>I have yet to speak on God's behalf.</I> He spoke as an advocate for 
 God, and therefore might justly expect the ear of the court. Some 
 indeed pretend to speak on God's behalf who really speak for 
 themselves; but those who sincerely appear in the cause of God, and 
 speak in behalf of his honour, his truths, his ways, his people, shall 
 be sure neither to want instructions (<I>it shall be given them in that 
 same hour what they shall speak</I>) nor to lose their cause or their 
 fee. Nor need they fear lest they should exhaust their subject. Those 
 that have spoken ever so much may yet find more to be spoken on God's 
 behalf. 

 2. That he had something to offer that was uncommon, and out of the 
 road of vulgar observation: <I>I will fetch my knowledge from afar</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 that is, "we will have recourse to our first principles and the highest 
 notions we can make use of to serve any purpose." It is worth while to 
 go far for this knowledge of God, to dig for it, to travel for it; it 
 will recompense our pains, and, though far-fetched, is not dear-bought. 

 3. That his design was undeniably honest; for all he aimed at was to
 ascribe righteousness to his Maker, to maintain and clear this truth, 
 that God is righteous in all his ways. In speaking of God, and speaking 
 for him, it is good to remember that he is our Maker, to call him so, 
 and therefore to be ready to do him and the interests of his kingdom 
 the best service we can. If he be our Maker, we have our all from him, 
 must use our all for him, and be very jealous for his honour. That his 
 management should be very just and fair 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>My words shall not be false,</I> neither disagreeable to the thing 
 itself nor to my own thoughts and apprehensions. It is truth that I am 
 contending for, and that for truth's sake, with all possible sincerity 
 and plainness." He will make use of plain and solid arguments and not 
 the subtleties and niceties of the schools. "He who is perfect or 
 upright in knowledge is now reasoning with thee; and therefore let him 
 not only have a fair hearing, but let what he says be taken in good 
 part, as meant well." The perfection of our knowledge in this world is 
 to be honest and sincere in searching out truth, in applying it to 
 ourselves, and in making use of what we know for the good of 
 others.</P>

 the poor.
 &nbsp; 7  He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with
 kings <I>are they</I> on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for
 ever, and they are exalted.
 &nbsp; 8  And if <I>they be</I> bound in fetters, <I>and</I> be holden in cords
 of affliction;
 &nbsp; 9  Then he showeth them their work, and their transgressions
 that they have exceeded.
 &nbsp; 10  He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that
 they return from iniquity.
 &nbsp; 11  If they obey and serve <I>him,</I> they shall spend their days in
 prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
 &nbsp; 12  But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and
 they shall die without knowledge.
 &nbsp; 13  But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when
 he bindeth them.
 &nbsp; 14  They die in youth, and their life <I>is</I> among the unclean.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Elihu, being to speak on God's behalf, and particularly to ascribe 
 righteousness to his Maker, here shows that the disposals of divine 
 Providence are all, not only according to the eternal counsels of his 
 will, but according to the eternal rules of equity. God acts as a 
 righteous governor, for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He does not think it below him to take notice of the meanest of his 
 subjects, nor does poverty or obscurity set any at a distance from his 
 favour. If men are mighty, they are apt to look with a haughty disdain 
 upon those that are not of distinction and make no figure; but <I>God 
 is mighty,</I> infinitely so, and yet he <I>despises not any,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 He humbles himself to take cognizance of the affairs of the meanest, to 
 do them justice and to show them kindness. Job thought himself and his 
 cause slighted because God did not immediately appear for him. "No," 
 says Elihu, <I>God despises not any,</I> which is a good reason why we 
 should honour all men. <I>He is mighty in strength and wisdom,</I> and 
 yet does not look with contempt upon those that have but a little 
 strength and wisdom, if they but mean honestly. Nay, for this reason he 
 despises not any, because his wisdom and strength are incontestably 
 infinite and therefore the condescensions of his grace can be no 
 diminution to him. Those that are wise and good will not look upon any 
 with scorn and disdain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives no countenance to the greatest, if they be bad 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 <I>He preserves not the life of the wicked.</I> Though their life may 
 be prolonged, yet not under any special care of the divine Providence, 
 but only its common protection. Job had said that <I>the wicked live, 
 become old, and are mighty in power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:7"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 7</A>.

 "No," says Elihu: "he seldom suffers wicked men to become old. He
 preserves not their life so long as they expected, nor with that 
 comfort and satisfaction which are indeed our life; and their 
 preservation is but a reservation for the day of wrath," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:5">Rom. ii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He is always ready to right those that are any way injured, and to 
 plead their cause 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 He <I>gives right to the poor,</I> avenges their quarrel upon their 
 persecutors and forces them to make restitution of what they have 
 robbed them of. If men will not right the injured poor, God will.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He takes a particular care for the protection of his good subjects, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He not only looks on them, but he never looks off them: <I>He withdraws 
 not his eyes from the righteous.</I> Though they may seem sometimes 
 neglected and forgotten, and that befals them which looks like an 
 oversight of Providence, yet tender careful eye of their heavenly 
 Father never withdraws from them. If our eye be ever towards God in 
 duty, his eye will be ever upon us in mercy, and, when we are at the 
 lowest, will not overlook us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Sometimes he prefers good people to places of trust and honour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>With kings are</I> they <I>on the throne,</I> and every sheaf is 
 made to bow to theirs. When righteous persons are advanced to places of 
 honour and power, it is in mercy to them; for God's grace in them will 
 both arm them against the temptations that attend preferment and enable 
 them to improve the opportunity it gives them of doing good. It is also 
 in mercy to those over whom they are set: <I>When the righteous bear 
 rule the city rejoices.</I> If the righteous be advanced, they are 
 established. Those that in honour keep a good conscience stand upon 
 sure ground, and high places are not such slippery ground to them as 
 they are to others. But, because it is not often that we see good men 
 made great men in this world, this may be supposed to refer to the 
 honour to which the righteous shall rise when their Redeemer shall 
 <I>stand at the latter day upon the earth;</I> for then only they shall 
 be exalted for ever, and established for ever; then shall they all 
 shine forth as the sun, and be made kings and priests to our God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. If at any time he bring them into affliction, it is for the good of 
 their souls, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.

 Some good people are preferred to honour and power, but others are in 
 trouble. Now observe,

 (1.) The distress supposed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>If they be bound in fetters,</I> laid in prison as Joseph was, or 
 <I>holden in the cords of</I> any other <I>affliction,</I> confined by 
 pain and sickness, hampered by poverty, bound in their counsels, and, 
 notwithstanding all their struggles, held long in this distress. This 
 was Job's case; he was caught, and kept fast, <I>in the cords of 
 anguish</I> (as some read it); but observe,

 (2.) The design God has, in bringing his people into such distresses as 
 these; it is for the benefit of their souls, the consideration of which 
 should reconcile us to affliction and make us think well of it. Three 
 things God intends when he afflicts us:--

 [1.] To discover past sins to us, and to bring them to our remembrance. 
 Then he shows them that amiss in them which before they did not see. He 
 discovers to them the fact of sin: <I>He shows them their work.</I> Sin 
 is our own work. If there be any good in us, it is God's work; and we 
 are concerned to see what work we have made by sin. He discovers the 
 fault of sin, shows them <I>their transgressions</I> of the law of God, 
 and withal the sinfulness of sin, <I>that they have exceeded,</I> and 
 have been beyond measure sinful.  True penitents lay a load upon 
 themselves, do not extenuate, but aggravate, their sins, and own that 
 they have exceeded in them.  Affliction sometimes answers to the sin; 
 it serves, however, to awaken the conscience and puts men upon 
 considering. 

 [2.] To dispose our hearts to receive present instructions: Then <I>he 
 opens their ear to discipline,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Whom God chastens <I>he teaches</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:12">Ps. xciv. 12</A>),

 and the affliction makes people willing to learn, softens the wax, that
 it may receive the impression of the seal; yet it does not do this of 
 itself, but the grace of God working with and by it; it is he that 
 opens the ear, that opens the heart, who has the key of David.

 [3.] To deter and draw us off from iniquity for the future. This is the 
 errand on which the affliction is sent; it is a command to <I>return 
 from iniquity,</I> to have no more to do with sin, to turn from it with 
 an aversion to it and a resolution never to return to it any more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:8">Hos. xiv. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. If the affliction do its work, and accomplish that for which it is 
 sent, he will comfort them again, according to the time that he has 
 afflicted them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>If they obey and serve him,</I>--if they comply with his design and 
 serve his purpose in these dispensations,--if, when the affliction is 
 removed, they continue in the same good mind that they were in when 
 they were under the smart of it and perform the vows they made 
 then,--if they live in obedience to God's commands, particularly those 
 which relate to his service and worship, and in all instances make 
 conscience of their duty to him,--then <I>they shall spend their days 
 in prosperity</I> again <I>and their years in</I> true 
 <I>pleasures.</I> Piety is the only sure way to prosperity and 
 pleasure; this is a certain truth, and yet few will believe it. If we 
 faithfully serve God,

 (1.) We have the promise of outward prosperity, the promise of the life 
 that now is, and the comforts of it, as far as is for God's glory and 
 our good; and who would desire them any further? 

 (2.) We have the possession of inward pleasures, the comfort of 
 communion with God and a good conscience, and that great peace which 
 those have that love God's law. If we rejoice not in the Lord always, 
 and in hope of eternal life, it is our own fault; and what better 
 pleasures can we spend our years in?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. If the affliction do not do its work, let them expect the furnace to 
 be heated seven times hotter till they are consumed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>If they obey not,</I> if they are not bettered by their afflictions, 
 are not reclaimed and reformed, they shall perish by the sword of God's 
 wrath.  Those whom his rod does not cure his sword will kill; and the 
 consuming fire will prevail if the refining fire do not; for when God 
 judges he will overcome. If <I>Ahaz, in his distress, trespass yet more 
 against the Lord, this is that king Ahaz</I> that is marked for ruin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+28:22,Jer+6:29,30">2 Chron. xxviii. 22; 
 Jer. vi. 29, 30</A>.

 God would have instructed them by their afflictions, but they received
 not instruction, would not take the hints that were given them; and 
 therefore <I>they shall die without knowledge,</I> ere they are aware, 
 without any further previous notices given them; or <I>they shall die 
 because they were without knowledge</I> notwithstanding the means of 
 knowledge which they were blessed with. Those that <I>die without 
 knowledge</I> die without grace and are undone for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He brings ruin upon hypocrites, the secret enemies of his kingdom 
 (such as Elihu described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 who, though they were numbered among the righteous whom Elihu had 
 spoken of before, yet did not obey God, but, being children of 
 disobedience and darkness, become children of wrath and perdition; 
 these are the <I>hypocrites in heart, who heap up wrath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 See the nature of hypocrisy: it lies in the heart, which is for the 
 world and the flesh when the outside seems to be for God and religion.  
 Many that are saints in show and saints in word are hypocrites in 
 heart.  That spring is corrupt, and there is an evil treasure there. 
 See the mischievousness of hypocrisy: hypocrites <I>heap up wrath.</I> 
 They are doing that every day which is provoking to God, and will be 
 reckoned with for it all together in the great day.  <I>They treasure 
 up wrath against the day of wrath,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:5">Rom. ii. 5</A>.

 Their sins are <I>laid up in store with God among his treasures,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:34,Jam+5:3">Deut. xxxii. 34. Compare Jam. v. 3</A>.

 As what goes up a vapour comes down a shower, so what goes up sin, if
 not repented of, will come down wrath. They think they are heaping up 
 wealth, heaping up merits, but, when the treasures are opened, it will 
 prove they were heaping up wrath.  Observe, 

 1. What they do to heap up wrath. What is it that is so provoking? It 
 is this, <I>They cry not when he binds them,</I> that is, when they are 
 in affliction, bound with the cords of trouble, their hearts are 
 hardened, they are stubborn and unhumbled, and will not cry to God nor 
 make their application to him. They are stupid and senseless as stocks 
 and stones, despising the chastening of the Lord. 

 2. What are the effects of that wrath? <I>They die in youth, and their 
 life is among the unclean,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 This is the portion of hypocrites, whom Christ denounced many woes 
 against. If they continue impenitent,

 (1.) They shall die a sudden death, <I>die in youth,</I> when death is 
 most a surprise, and death (that is, the consequence of it) is always 
 such to hypocrites; as those that die in youth die when they hoped to 
 live, so hypocrites, at death, go to hell, when they hoped to go to 
 heaven.  <I>When a wicked man dies his expectations shall perish.</I> 
 
 (2.) They shall die the second death.  <I>Their life,</I> after death 
 (for so it comes in here), <I>is among the unclean,</I> among the 
 <I>fornicators</I> (so some), among the worst and vilest of sinners, 
 notwithstanding their specious and plausible profession. It is among 
 the <I>Sodomites</I> (so the margin), those filthy wretches, who 
 <I>going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering 
 the vengeance of eternal fire,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:7">Jude 7</A>.

 The souls of the wicked live after death, but they live among the
 unclean, the unclean spirits, the devil and his angels, forever 
 separated from the new Jerusalem, into which <I>no unclean thing shall 
 enter.</I></P>

 ears in oppression.
 &nbsp; 16  Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait <I>into</I>
 a broad place, where <I>there is</I> no straitness; and that which
 should be set on thy table <I>should be</I> full of fatness.
 &nbsp; 17  But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment
 and justice take hold <I>on thee.</I>
 &nbsp; 18  Because <I>there is</I> wrath, <I>beware</I> lest he take thee away
 with <I>his</I> stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
 &nbsp; 19  Will he esteem thy riches? <I>no,</I> not gold, nor all the
 forces of strength.
 &nbsp; 20  Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their
 place.
 &nbsp; 21  Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen
 rather than affliction.

 &nbsp; 23  Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast
 wrought iniquity?

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Elihu here comes more closely to Job; and,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He tells him what God would have done for him before this if he had 
 been duly humbled under his affliction. "We all know how ready God is 
 to <I>deliver the poor in his affliction</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 he always was so.  The poor in spirit, those that are of a broken and 
 contrite heart, he looks upon with tenderness, and, when they are in 
 affliction, is ready to help them. He <I>opens their ears,</I> and 
 makes them to hear joy and gladness, even <I>in</I> their 
 <I>oppressions;</I> while he does not yet deliver them he speaks to 
 them good words and comfortable words, for the encouragement of their 
 faith and patience, the silencing of their fears, and the balancing of 
 their griefs; and <I>even so</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 would he have done to thee if thou hadst submitted to his providence 
 and conducted thyself well; he would have delivered and comforted thee, 
 and we should have had none of these complaints. If thou hadst 
 accommodated thyself to the will of God, thy liberty and plenty would 
 have been restored to thee with advantage." 

 1. "Thou wouldst have been enlarged, and not confined thus by thy 
 sickness and disgrace: <I>He would have removed thee into a broad place 
 where is no straitness,</I> and thou wouldst no longer have been 
 cramped thus and have had all thy measures broken." 

 2. "Thou wouldst have been enriched, and wouldst not have been left in 
 this poor condition; thou wouldst have had thy table richly spread, not 
 only with food convenient, but with the finest of the wheat" (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:14">Deut. xxxii. 14</A>)

 "and the fattest of the flesh." Note, It ought to silence us under our
 afflictions to consider that, if we were better, it would be every way
 better with us: if we had answered the ends of an affliction, the
 affliction would be removed; and deliverance would come if we were
 ready for it. God would have done well for us if we had conducted
 ourselves well;

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He charges him with standing in his own light, and makes him the 
 cause of the continuance of his own trouble 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked,</I>" that is, 
 "Whatever thou art really, in this thing thou hast conducted thyself 
 like a wicked man, hast spoken and done like the wicked, hast gratified 
 them and served their cause; and <I>therefore</I> judgment and justice 
 take hold on thee as a wicked man, because thou goest in company with 
 them, actest as if thou wert in their interest, aiding and abetting. 
 <I>Thou hast maintained the cause of the wicked;</I> and such as a 
 man's cause is such will the judgment of God be upon him;" so bishop 
 Patrick. It is dangerous being on the wrong side: accessaries to 
 treason will be dealt with as principals.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He cautions him not to persist in his frowardness. Several good 
 cautions he gives him to this purport.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let him not make light of divine vengeance, nor be secure, as if he 
 were in no danger of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Because there is wrath</I>" (that is, "because God is a righteous
 governor, who resents all the affronts given to his government, because 
 he has revealed his wrath from heaven against all ungodliness and 
 unrighteousness of men, and because thou hast reason to fear that thou 
 art under God's displeasure) therefore <I>beware lest he take thee 
 away</I> suddenly <I>with his stroke,</I> and be so wise as to make thy 
 peace with him quickly and get his anger turned away from thee." A 
 warning to this purport Job had given his friends

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:29"><I>ch.</I> xix. 29</A>):

 <I>Be you afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishment of the
 sword.</I> Thus contenders are apt, with too much boldness, to bind one 
 another over to the judgment of God and threaten one another with his 
 wrath; but he that keeps a good conscience needs not fear the impotent 
 menaces of proud men. But his was a friendly caution to Job, and 
 necessary.  Even good men have need to be kept to their duty by the 
 fear of God's wrath. "Thou art a wise and good man, but beware lest he 
 take thee away, for the wisest and best have enough in them to deserve 
 his stroke."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let him not promise himself that, if God's wrath should kindle 
 against him, he could find out ways to escape the strokes of it. 

 (1.) There is no escaping by money, no purchasing a pardon with silver, 
 or gold, and such corruptible things: "Even <I>a great ransom cannot 
 deliver thee</I> when God enters into judgment with thee. His justice 
 cannot be bribed, nor any of the ministers of his justice. <I>Will he 
 esteem thy riches,</I> and take from them a commutation of the 
 punishment? <I>No, not gold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 If thou hadst as much wealth as ever thou hadst, that would not ease 
 thee, would not secure thee from the strokes of God's wrath, in the day 
 of the revelation of which <I>riches profit not,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:4">Prov. xi. 4</A>.
 
 See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:7,8">Ps. xlix. 7, 8</A>.

 (2.) There is no escaping by rescue: "If <I>all the forces of 
 strength</I> were at thy command, if thou couldst muster ever so many 
 servants and vassals to appear for thee to force thee out of the hands 
 of divine vengeance, it were all in vain; God would not regard it. 
 There is <I>none that can deliver out of his hand.</I>" 

 (3.) There is no escaping by absconding 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>Desire not the night,</I> which often favours the retreat of a
 conquered army and covers it; think not that thou canst so escape the 
 righteous judgment of God, for the <I>darkness hideth not from 
 him,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:11,12">Ps. cxxxix. 11, 12</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:22"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv. 22</A>.

 "Think not, because in the night people retire to their place, go up to
 their beds, and it is then easy to escape being discovered by them, 
 that God also ascends to his place, and cannot see thee. No; he 
 <I>neither slumbers nor sleeps.</I> His eyes are open upon the children 
 of men, not only in all places, but at all times. No rocks nor 
 mountains can shelter us from his eye." Some understand it of the night 
 of death; that is the night by which men are <I>cut off from their 
 place,</I> and Job had earnestly breathed for that night, as the 
 hireling desires the evening,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:2"><I>ch.</I> vii. 2</A>.

 "But do not do so," says Elihu; "for thou knowest not what the night of
 death is." Those that passionately wish for death, in hopes to make 
 that their shelter from God's wrath, may perhaps be mistaken. There are 
 those whom wrath pursues into that night.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Let him not continue his unjust quarrel with God and his providence, 
 which hitherto he had persisted in when he should have submitted to the 
 affliction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "<I>Take heed,</I> look well to thy own spirit, and <I>regard not
 iniquity,</I> return not to it (so some), for it is at thy peril if 
 thou do." Let us never dare to think a favourable thought of sin, never 
 indulge it, nor allow ourselves in it. Elihu thinks Job had need of 
 this caution, he having <I>chosen iniquity rather than affliction,</I> 
 that is, having chosen rather to gratify his own pride and humour in 
 contending with God than to mortify it by a submission to him and 
 accepting the punishment. We may take it more generally, and observe 
 that those who choose iniquity rather than affliction make a very 
 foolish choice. Those that ease their cares by sinful pleasures, 
 increase their wealth by sinful pursuits, escape their troubles by 
 sinful projects, and evade sufferings for righteousness' sake by sinful 
 compliances against their consciences, make a choice they will repent 
 of; for there is more evil in the least sin than in the greatest 
 affliction. It is an evil, and only evil.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Let him not dare to prescribe to God, nor give him his measures 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>):

 "<I>Behold, God exalteth by his power,</I>" that is, "He does, may, and
 can set up and pull down whom he pleases, and therefore it is not for 
 thee nor me to contend with him." The more we magnify God the more do 
 we humble and abase ourselves. Now consider,

 (1.) That God is an absolute sovereign: <I>He exalts by his</I> own 
 <I>power,</I> and not by strength derived from any other. He exalts 
 whom he pleases, exalts those that were afflicted and cast down, by the 
 strength and power which he gives his people; and therefore <I>who has 
 enjoined him his way?</I> Who presides above him in his way? Is there 
 any superior from whom he has his commission and to whom he is 
 accountable? No; he himself is supreme and independent. <I>Who puts him 
 in mind of his way?</I> so some. Does the eternal Mind need a 
 remembrancer? No; his own way, as well as ours, is ever before him. He 
 has not received orders or instructions from any 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:13,14">Isa. lx. 13, 14</A>),

 nor is he accountable to any. He enjoins to all the creatures their
 way; let not us then enjoin him his, but leave it to him to govern the 
 world, who is fit to do it.

 (2.) That he is an incomparable teacher: <I>Who teaches like him?</I> 
 It is absurd for us to teach him who is himself the fountain of light, 
 truth, knowledge, and instruction. <I>He that teaches man 
 knowledge,</I> and so as none else can, <I>shall not he know?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:9,10">Ps. xciv. 9, 10</A>.

 Shall we light a candle to the sun? Observe, When Elihu would give
 glory to God as a ruler he praises him as a teacher, for rulers must 
 teach. God does so. He binds with the cords of a man. In this, as in 
 other things, he is unequalled. None so fit to direct his own actions 
 as he himself is. He knows what he has to do, and how to do it for the 
 best, and needs no information nor advice.  Solomon himself had a 
 privy-council to advise him, but the King of kings has none. Nor is any 
 so fit to direct our actions as he is. None teaches with such authority 
 and convincing evidence, with such condescension and compassion, nor 
 with such power and efficacy, as God does. He teaches by the Bible, and 
 that is the best book, teaches by his Son, and he is the best Master.

 (3.) That he is unexceptionably just in all his proceedings: <I>Who can 
 say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</I> Not, Who <I>dares</I> say it? 
 (many do iniquity, and those who tell them of it do so at their peril), 
 but Who <I>can</I> say it? Who has any cause to say it? Who can say it 
 and prove it? It is a maxim undoubtedly true, without limitation, that 
 <I>the King of kings can do no wrong.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
 &nbsp; 25  Every man may see it; man may behold <I>it</I> afar off.
 &nbsp; 26  Behold, God <I>is</I> great, and we know <I>him</I> not, neither can
 the number of his years be searched out.
 &nbsp; 27  For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain
 according to the vapour thereof:
 &nbsp; 28  Which the clouds do drop <I>and</I> distil upon man abundantly.
 &nbsp; 29  Also can <I>any</I> understand the spreadings of the clouds, <I>or</I>

 &nbsp; 30  Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the
 bottom of the sea.
 &nbsp; 31  For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in
 abundance.
 &nbsp; 32  With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it <I>not to
 shine</I> by <I>the cloud</I> that cometh betwixt.
 &nbsp; 33  The noise thereof showeth concerning it, the cattle also
 concerning the vapour.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Elihu is here endeavouring to possess Job with great and high thoughts 
 of God, and so to persuade him into a cheerful submission to his 
 providence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He represents the work of God, in general, as illustrious and 
 conspicuous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 His whole work is so. God does nothing mean. This is a good reason why 
 we should acquiesce in all the operations of his providence concerning 
 us in particular. His visible works, those of nature, and which concern 
 the world in general, are such as we admire and commend, and in which 
 we observe the Creator's wisdom, power, and goodness; shall we then 
 find fault with his dispensations concerning us, and the counsels of 
 his will concerning our affairs? We are here called to <I>consider the 
 work of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:13">Eccl. vii. 13</A>.

 1. It is plain before our eyes, nothing more obvious: it is what <I>men
 behold.</I> Every man that has but half an eye may see it, may behold 
 it afar off.  Look which way we will, we see the productions of God's 
 wisdom and power; we see that done, and that doing, concerning which we 
 cannot but say, This is <I>the work of God,</I> the finger of God; it 
 is the Lord's doing. Every man may see, afar off, the heaven and all 
 its lights, the earth and all its fruits, to be the work of 
 Omnipotence; much more when we behold them nigh at hand. Look at the 
 minutest works of nature through a microscope; do they not appear 
 curious? The eternal power and godhead of the Creator are <I>clearly 
 seen and understood</I> by the <I>things that are made,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:20">Rom. i. 20</A>.

 Every man, even those that have not the benefit of divine revelation,
 may see this; for <I>there is no speech or language where the voice</I> 
 of these natural constant preachers <I>is not heard,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:3">Ps. xix. 3</A>.

 2.  It ought to be marvellous in our eyes. The beauty and excellency of
 the work of God, and the agreement of all the parts of it, are what we 
 must remember to magnify and highly to extol, not only justify it as 
 right and good, and what cannot be blamed, but magnify it as wise and 
 glorious, and such as no creature could contrive or produce. Man may 
 see his works, and is capable of discerning his hand in them (which the 
 beasts are not), and therefore ought to praise them and give him the 
 glory of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He represents God, the author of them, as infinite and 
 unsearchable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 The streams of being, power, and perfection should lead us to the 
 fountain. <I>God is great,</I> infinitely so,--great in power, for he 
 is omnipotent and independent,--great in wealth, for he is 
 self-sufficient and all-sufficient,--great in himself,--great in all 
 his works,--great, and therefore greatly to be praised,--great, and 
 therefore <I>we know him not.</I> We know that he is, but not what he 
 is. We know what he is not, but not what he is. We know in part, but 
 not in perfection. This comes in here as a reason why we must not 
 arraign his proceedings, nor find fault with what he does, because it 
 is speaking evil of the things that we understand not and answering a 
 matter before we hear if. We know not the duration of his existence, 
 for it is infinite. <I>The number of his years cannot</I> possibly 
 <I>be searched out,</I> for he is eternal; there is no number of them. 
 He is a Being without beginning, succession, or period, whoever was, 
 and ever will be, and ever the same, the great <I>I AM.</I> This is a 
 good reason why we should not prescribe to him, nor quarrel with him, 
 because, as he is, such are his operations, quite out of our reach.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He gives some instances of God's wisdom, power, and sovereign 
 dominion, in the works of nature and the dispensations of common 
 providence, beginning in this chapter with the clouds and the rain that 
 descends from them. We need not be critical in examining either the 
 phrase or the philosophy of this noble discourse. The general scope of 
 it is to show that God is infinitely great, and the Lord of all, the 
 first cause and supreme director of all the creatures, and <I>has all 
 power in heaven and earth</I> (whom therefore we ought, with all 
 humility and reverence, to adore, to speak well of, and to give honour 
 to), and that it is presumption for us to prescribe to him the rules 
 and methods of his special providence towards the children of men, or 
 to expect from him an account of them, when the operations even of 
 common providences about the meteors are so various and so mysterious 
 and unaccountable. Elihu, to affect Job with God's sublimity and 
 sovereignty, had directed him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:5"><I>ch.</I> xxxv. 5</A>)
 
 to look unto the clouds. In
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:24-33">these verses</A>

 he shows us what we may observe in the clouds we see which
 will lead us to consider the glorious perfections of their Creator. 
 Consider the clouds,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As springs to this lower world, the source and treasure of its 
 moisture, and the great bank through which it circulates--a very
 necessary provision, for its stagnation would be as hurtful to this 
 lower world as that of the blood to the body of man.  It is worth while 
 to observe in this common occurrence, 

 (1.) That the clouds above distil upon the earth below. If the heavens 
 become brass, the earth becomes iron; therefore thus the promise of 
 plenty runs, <I>I will hear the heavens and they shall hear the 
 earth.</I> This intimates to us that every good gift is from above, 
 from him who is both Father of lights and Father of the rain, and it 
 instructs us to direct our prayers to him and to look up. 

 (2.) That they are here said to <I>distil upon man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>);

 for, though indeed God <I>causes it to rain in the wilderness where no
 man is</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:26,Ps+104:11"><I>ch.</I> xxxviii. 26, Ps. civ. 11</A>),

 yet special respect is had to man herein, to whom the inferior
 creatures are all made serviceable and from whom the actual return of 
 the tribute of praise is required. Among men, he <I>causes his rain to 
 fall upon the just and upon the unjust,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:45">Matt. v. 45</A>.

 (3.) They are said to distil the water in <I>small drops,</I> not in
 spouts, as when the <I>windows of heaven were opened,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:11">Gen. vii. 11</A>.

 God waters the earth with that with which he once drowned it, only 
 dispensing it in another manner, to let us know how much we lie at his 
 mercy, and how kind he is, in giving rain by drops, that the benefit of 
 it may be the further and the more equally diffused, as by an 
 artificial water-pot.  

 (4.) Though sometimes the rain comes in very small drops, yet, at other 
 times, it pours down in great rain, and this difference between one 
 shower and another must be resolved into the divine Providence which 
 orders it so. 

 (5.) Though it comes down in drops, yet it distils upon man
 <I>abundantly</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:28"><I>v.</I>  28</A>),

 and therefore is called <I>the river of God which is full of water,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:9">Ps. lxv. 9</A>.

 (6.) The clouds <I>pour down according to the vapour</I> that they draw
 up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:27"><I>v.</I>  27</A>.

 So just the heavens are to the earth, but the earth is not so in the 
 return it makes.

 (7.) The produce of the clouds is sometimes a great terror, and at
 other times a great favour, to the earth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 When he pleases <I>by them he judges the people</I> he is angry with.  
 Storms, and tempests, and excessive rains, destroying the fruits of the 
 earth and causing inundations, come from the clouds; but, on the other 
 hand, from them, usually, he gives meat in abundance; they drop fatness 
 upon the pastures that are clothed with flocks, and the valleys that 
 are <I>covered with corn,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:11-13">Ps. lxv. 11-13</A>.

 (8.) Notice is sometimes given of the approach of rain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:33"><I>v.</I>  33</A>.

 <I>The noise thereof,</I> among other things, <I>shows concerning 
 it.</I> Hence we read

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:41">1 Kings xviii. 41</A>)

 of <I>the sound of abundance of rain,</I> or (as it is in the margin)
 <I>a sound of a noise of rain,</I> before it came; and a welcome 
 harbinger it was then. As the noise, so the face of the sky, shows 
 concerning it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:56">Luke xii. 56</A>.

 The cattle also, by a strange instinct, are apprehensive of a change in
 the weather nigh at hand, and seek for shelter, shaming man, who will 
 not foresee the evil and hide himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As shadows to the upper world 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>Can any understand the spreading of the clouds?</I> They are spread
 over the earth as a curtain or canopy; how they come to be so, how 
 stretched out, and how poised, as they are, we cannot understand, 
 though we daily see they are so. Shall we then pretend to understand 
 the reasons and methods of God's judicial proceedings with the children 
 of men, whose characters and cases are so various, when we cannot 
 account for the spreadings of the clouds, which <I>cover the light?</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.
 
 It is a cloud coming <I>betwixt,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:32,Job+26:9"><I>v.</I> 32; <I>ch.</I> xxvi. 9</A>.

 And this we are sensible of, that, by the interposition of the clouds
 between us and the sun, we are, 

 (1.) Sometimes favoured; for they serve as an umbrella to shelter us 
 from the violent heat of the sun, which otherwise would beat upon us. A 
 <I>cloud of dew in the heat of harvest</I> is spoken of as a very great 
 refreshment. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+18:4">Isa. xviii. 4</A>.

 (2.) Sometimes we are by them frowned upon; for they darken the earth 
 at noon-day and eclipse the light of the sun. Sin is compared to a 
 cloud 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:22">Isa. xliv. 22</A>),

 because it comes between us and the light of God's countenance and
 obstructs the shining of it. But though the clouds darken the sun for a 
 time, and pour down rain, yet (<I>post nubila Phoebus</I>--<I>the sun 
 shines forth after the rain</I>), after he has wearied the cloud, <I>he 
 spreads his light upon it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 There is a <I>clear shining after rain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:4">2 Sam. xxiii. 4</A>.

 The sunbeams are darted forth, and reach to <I>cover</I> even <I>the
 bottom of the sea,</I> thence to exhale a fresh supply of vapours, and 
 so raise recruits for the clouds, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 In all this, we must remember to magnify the work of God.</P>
