 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job had often protested his integrity in general; here he does it in 
 particular instances, not in a way of commendation (for he does not 
 here proclaim his good deeds), but in his own just and necessary 
 vindication, to clear himself from those crimes with which his friends 
 had falsely charged him, which is a debt every man owes to his own 
 reputation. Job's friends had been particular in their articles of 
 impeachment against him, and therefore he is so in his protestation, 
 which seems to refer especially to what Eliphaz had accused him of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:6-9"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 6</A>,

 &c. They had produced no witnesses against him, neither could they
 prove the things whereof they now accused him, and therefore he may 
 well be admitted to purge himself upon oath, which he does very 
 solemnly, and with many awful imprecations of God's wrath if he were 
 guilty of those crimes. This protestation confirms God's character of 
 him, that there was none like him in the earth. Perhaps some of his 
 accusers durst not have joined with him; for he not only acquits 
 himself from those gross sins which lie open to the eye of the world, 
 but from many secret sins which, if he had been guilty of them, nobody 
 could have charged him, with, because he will prove himself no 
 hypocrite. Nor does he only maintain the cleanness of his practices, 
 but shows also that in them he went upon good principles, that the 
 reason of his eschewing evil was because he feared God, and his piety 
 was at the bottom of his justice and charity; and this crowns the proof 
 of his sincerity.

 I. The sins from which he here acquits himself are,

 1. Wantonness and uncleanness of heart, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 2. Fraud and injustice in commerce, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:4-8">ver. 4-8</A>.
 
 3. Adultery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>.

 4. Haughtiness and severity towards his servants,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:13-15">ver. 13-15</A>.

 5. Unmercifulness to the poor, the widows, and the fatherless,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:16-23">ver. 16-23</A>.

 6. Confidence in his worldly wealth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:24,25">ver. 24, 25</A>.

 7. Idolatry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:26-28">ver. 26-28</A>.
 
 8. Revenge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:29-31">ver. 29-31</A>.

 9. Neglect of poor strangers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:32">ver. 32</A>.

 10. Hypocrisy in concealing his own sins and cowardice in conniving at
 the sins of others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:33,34">ver. 33, 34</A>.

 11. Oppression, and the violent invasion of other people's rights,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:38-40">ver. 38-40</A>.

 And towards the close, he appeals to God's judgment concerning his
 integrity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:35-37">ver. 35-37</A>.
 
 Now, 

 II. In all this we may see,

 1. The sense of the patriarchal age concerning good and evil and what
 was so long ago condemned as sinful, that is, both hateful and hurtful. 

 2. A noble pattern of piety and virtue proposed to us for our 
 imitation, which, if our consciences can witness for us that we conform 
 to it, will be our rejoicing, as it was Job's in the day of evil.</P>

 The lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world, are the two fatal 
 rocks on which multitudes split; against these Job protests he was 
 always careful to stand upon his guard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Against the lusts of the flesh. He not only kept himself clear from 
 adultery, from defiling his neighbour's wives 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 but from all lewdness with any women whatsoever. He kept no concubine, 
 no mistress, but was inviolably faithful to the marriage bed, though 
 his wife was none of the wisest, best, or kindest. From the beginning 
 it was so, that a man should have but one wife and cleave to her only; 
 and Job kept closely to that institution and abhorred the thought of 
 transgressing it; for, though his greatness might tempt him to it, his 
 goodness kept him from it. Job was now in pain and sickness of body, 
 and under that affliction it is in a particular manner comfortable if 
 our consciences can witness for us that we have been careful to 
 preserve our bodies in chastity and to possess those vessels in 
 sanctification and honour, pure from the lusts of uncleanness. Now 
 observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What the resolutions were which, in this matter, he kept to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):
 
 <I>I made a covenant with my eyes,</I> that is, "I watched against the 
 occasions of the sin; <I>why then should I think upon a maid?</I>" that 
 is, "by that means, through the grace of God, I kept myself from the 
 very first step towards it." So far was he from wanton dalliances, or 
 any act of lasciviousness, that, 

 (1.) He would not so much as admit a wanton look. <I>He made a covenant 
 with his eyes,</I> made this bargain with them, that he would allow 
 them the pleasure of beholding the light of the sun and the glory of 
 God shining in the visible creation, provided they would never fasten 
 upon any object that might occasion any impure imaginations, much less 
 any impure desires, in his mind; and under this penalty, that, if they 
 did, they must smart for it in penitential tears. Note, Those that 
 would keep their hearts pure must guard their eyes, which are both the 
 outlets and inlets of uncleanness. Hence we read of <I>wanton</I> eyes
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:16">Isa. iii. 16</A>)

 and <I>eyes full of adultery,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:14">2 Pet. ii. 14</A>.

 The first sin began in the eye, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:6">Gen. iii. 6</A>.

 What we must not meddle with we must not lust after; and what we must
 not lust after we must not look at; not the forbidden wealth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:5">Prov. xxiii. 5</A>),
 
 not the forbidden wine
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:31">Prov. xxiii. 31</A>),

 not the forbidden woman,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:28">Matt. v. 28</A>.

 (2.) He would not so much as allow a wanton thought: "<I>Why then
 should I think upon a maid</I> with any unchaste fancy or desire 
 towards her?" Shame and sense of honour might restrain him from 
 soliciting the chastity of a beautiful virgin, but only grace and the 
 fear of God would restrain him from so much as thinking of it. Those 
 are not chaste that are not so in spirit as well as body,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:34">1 Cor. vii. 34</A>.
 
 See how Christ's exposition of the seventh commandment agrees with the
 ancient sense of it, and how much better Job understood it than the 
 Pharisees, though they sat in Moses's chair.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the reasons were which, in this matter, he was governed by. It 
 was not for fear of reproach among men, though that is to be considered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:33">Prov. vi. 33</A>),

 but for fear of the wrath and curse of God. He knew very well,

 (1.) That uncleanness is a sin that forfeits all good, and shuts us out
 from the hope of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>What portion of God is there from above?</I> What blessing can such 
 impure sinners expect from the pure and holy God, or what token of his 
 favour? What inheritance of the Almighty can they look for from on 
 high? There is no portion, no inheritance, no true happiness, for a 
 soul, but what is in God, in the Almighty, and what comes from above, 
 from on high. Those that wallow in uncleanness render themselves 
 utterly unfit for communion with God, either in grace here or in glory 
 hereafter, and become allied to unclean spirits, which are for ever 
 separated from him; and then what portion, what inheritance, can they 
 have with God? No unclean thing shall enter into the New Jerusalem, 
 that holy city.

 (2.) It is a sin that incurs divine vengeance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It will certainly be the sinner's ruin if it be not repented of in 
 time. <I>Is not destruction,</I> a swift and sure destruction, 
 <I>to</I> those <I>wicked</I> people, <I>and a strange punishment to 
 the workers of</I> this <I>iniquity?</I> Fools make a mock at this sin, 
 make a jest of it; it is with them a peccadillo, a trick of youth. But 
 they deceive themselves with vain words, for because of these things, 
 how light soever they make of them, the wrath of God, the unsupportable 
 wrath of the eternal God, <I>comes upon the children of 
 disobedience,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:6">Eph. v. 6</A>.

 There are some sinners whom God sometimes out of the common road of
 Providence to meet with; such are these. The destruction of Sodom is a 
 strange punishment. <I>Is there not alienation</I> (so some read it) 
 <I>to the workers of iniquity?</I> This is the sinfulness of the sin 
 that it alienates the mind from God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:18,19">Eph. iv. 18, 19</A>),

 and this is the punishment of the sinners that they shall be eternally
 set at a distance from him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:15">Rev. xxii. 15</A>.

 (3.) It cannot be hidden from the all-seeing God. A wanton thought 
 cannot be so close, nor a wanton look so quick, as to escape his 
 cognizance, much less any act of uncleanness so secretly done as to be 
 out of his sight. If Job was at any time tempted to this sin, he 
 restrained himself from it, and all approaches to it, with this 
 pertinent thought 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>Doth not he see my ways;</I> as Joseph did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+39:9">Gen. xxxix. 9</A>),

 <I>How can I do it, and sin against God?</I> Two things Job had an eye
 to:--

 [1.] God's omniscience. It is a great truth that God's eyes are <I>upon 
 all the ways of men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:20,21">Prov. v. 20, 21</A>);

 but Job here mentions it with application to himself and his own
 actions: <I>Doth not he see my ways? O God! thou hast searched me and
 known me.</I> God sees what rule we walk by, what company we walk with,
 what end we walk towards, and therefore what ways we walk in.

 [2.] His observance. "He not only sees, but takes notice; he <I>counts 
 all my steps,</I> all my false steps in the way of duty, all my 
 by-steps into the way of sin." He not only sees our ways in general, 
 but takes cognizance of our particular steps in these ways, every 
 action, every motion. He keeps account of all, because he will call us 
 to account, will bring every work into judgment. God takes a more exact 
 notice of us than we do of ourselves; for who ever counted his own 
 steps? yet God counts them. Let us therefore walk circumspectly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He stood upon his guard against the love of the world, and 
 carefully avoided all sinful indirect means of getting wealth. He 
 dreaded all forbidden profit as much as all forbidden pleasure. Let us 
 see,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What his protestation is. In general, he had been honest and just in 
 all his dealings, and never, to his knowledge, did any body any wrong. 
 
 (1.) He never <I>walked with vanity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 that is, he never durst tell a lie to get a good bargain. It was never 
 his way to banter, or equivocate, or make many words in his dealings. 
 Some men's constant walk is a constant cheat. They either make what 
 they have more than it is, that they may be trusted, or less than it 
 is, that nothing may be expected from them. But Job was a different 
 man. His wealth was not acquired by vanity, though now diminished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+13:11">Prov. xiii. 11</A>.

 (2.) He never <I>hasted to deceit.</I> Those that deceive must be quick 
 and sharp, but Job's quickness and sharpness were never turned that 
 way. He never made haste to be rich by deceit, but always acted
 cautiously, lest, through inconsideration, he should do an unjust 
 thing. Note, What we have in the world may be either used with comfort 
 or lost with comfort if it was honestly obtained. 

 (3.) His <I>steps never turned out of the way,</I> the way of justice 
 and fair dealing; from that he never deviated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He not only took care not to walk in a constant course and way of 
 deceit, but he did not so much as take one step out of the way of 
 honesty. In every particular action and affair we must closely tie
 ourselves up to the rules of righteousness.

 (4.) His heart did not <I>walk after his eyes,</I> that is, he did not 
 covet what he saw that was another's, nor wish it his own. Covetousness 
 is called the <I>lust of the eye,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+2:16">1 John ii. 16</A>.

 Achan saw, and then took, the accursed thing. That heart must needs
 wander that walks after the eyes; for then it looks no further than the 
 things that are seen, whereas it ought to be in heaven whither the eyes 
 cannot reach: it should follow the dictates of religion and right 
 reason: if it follow the eye, it will be misled to that for which 
 <I>God will bring men into judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:9">Eccl. xi. 9</A>.

 (5.) That <I>no blot had cleaved to his hands,</I> that is, he was not 
 chargeable with getting any thing dishonestly, or keeping that which 
 was another's, whenever it appeared to be so. Injustice is a blot, a 
 blot to the estate, a blot to the owner; it spoils the beauty of both, 
 and therefore is to be dreaded. Those that deal much in the world may 
 perhaps have a blot come upon their hands, but they must wash it off 
 again by repentance and restitution, and not let it <I>cleave to their 
 hands.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:15">Isa. xxxiii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he ratifies his protestation. So confident is he of his own 
 honesty that, 

 (1.) He is willing to have his goods searched 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Let me be weighed in an even balance,</I> that is, "Let what I have 
 got be enquired into and it will be found to weigh well"--a sign that
 it was not obtained by vanity, for then <I>Tekel</I> would have been 
 written on it--<I>weighed in the balance and found too light.</I> An 
 honest man is so far from dreading a trial that he desires it rather, 
 being well assured that God knows his integrity and will approve it, 
 and that the trial of it will be to his praise and honour.

 (2.) He is willing to forfeit the whole cargo if there be found any 
 prohibited or contraband goods, any thing but what he came honestly by 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Let me sow, and let another eat,</I>" which was already agreed to 
 be the doom of oppressors

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:5"><I>ch.</I> v. 5</A>),

 "and <I>let my offspring,</I> all the trees that I have planted, <I>be
 rooted out.</I>" This intimates that he believed the sin did deserve 
 this punishment, that usually it is thus punished, but that though now 
 his estate was ruined (and at such a time, if ever, his conscience 
 would have brought his sin to his mind), yet he knew himself innocent 
 and would venture all the poor remains of his estate upon the issue of 
 the trial.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or <I>if</I> I have
 laid wait at my neighbour's door;
 &nbsp; 10  <I>Then</I> let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow
 down upon her.
 &nbsp; 11  For this <I>is</I> a heinous crime; yea, it <I>is</I> an iniquity <I>to
 be punished by</I> the judges.
 &nbsp; 12  For it <I>is</I> a fire <I>that</I> consumeth to destruction, and

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two more instances we have here of Job's integrity:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That he had a very great abhorrence of the sin of adultery. As he 
 did not wrong his own marriage bed by keeping a concubine (he did not 
 so much as think upon a maid, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 so he was careful not to offer any injury to his neighbour's marriage 
 bed. Let us see here,
 
 1. How clear he was from this sin,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 (1.) He did not so much as covet his neighbour's wife; for even <I>his 
 heart was not deceived by a woman.</I> The beauty of another man's wife 
 did not kindle in him any unchaste desires, nor was he ever moved by 
 the allurements of an adulterous woman, such as is described,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:6-21">Prov. vii. 6</A>,

 &c. See the original of all the defilements of the life; they come from
 a deceived heart. Every sin is deceitful, and none more so than the
 sin of uncleanness.

 (2.) He never compassed or imagined any unchaste design. He never 
 <I>laid wait at his neighbour's door,</I> to get an opportunity to 
 debauch his wife in his absence, when the good man was not at home,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:19">Prov. vii. 19</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:15"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 15</A>.

 2. What a dread he had of this sin, and what frightful apprehensions he
 had concerning the malignity of it--that it was a <I>heinous crime</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 one of the greatest vilest sins a man can be guilty of, highly 
 provoking to God, and destructive to the prosperity of the soul. With 
 respect to the mischievousness of it, and the punishment it deserved, 
 he owns that, if he were guilty of that heinous crime,

 (1.) His family might justly be made infamous in the highest degree 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Let my wife grind to another.</I> Let her be a <I>slave</I> (so 
 some), a <I>harlot,</I> so others. God often punishes the sins of one 
 with the sin of another, the adultery of the husband with the adultery 
 of the wife, as in David's case

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:11">2 Sam. xii. 11</A>),

 which does not in the least excuse the treachery of the adulterous
 wife; but, how unrighteous soever she is, God is righteous. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:13">Hos. iv. 13</A>,

 <I>Your spouses shall commit adultery.</I> Note, Those who are not just
 and faithful to their relations must not think it strange if their 
 relations be unjust and unfaithful to them.

 (2.) He himself might justly be made a public example: <I>For it is an 
 iniquity to be punished by the judges;</I> yea, though those who are 
 guilty of it are themselves judges, as Job was. Note, Adultery is a 
 crime which the civil magistrate ought to take cognizance of and 
 punish: so it was adjudged even in the patriarchal age, before the law 
 of Moses made it capital. It is an evil work, to which the sword of 
 justice ought to be a terror. 

 (3.) It might justly become the ruin of his estate; nay, he knew it 
 would be so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>It is a fire.</I> Lust is a fire in the soul: those that indulge it 
 are said to burn. It consumes all that is good there (the convictions, 
 the comforts), and lays the conscience waste. It kindles the fire of
 God's wrath, which, if not extinguished by the blood of Christ, will 
 burn to the lowest hell. It will <I>consume</I> even <I>to</I> that 
 eternal <I>destruction.</I> It consumes the body,

 It consumes the substance; it <I>roots out all the increase.</I>

 II. That he had a very great tenderness for his servants and ruled them 
 with a gentle hand. He had a great household and he managed it well. By 
 this he evidenced his sincerity that he had grace to govern his passion 
 as well as his appetite; and he that in these two things has the rule 
 of his own spirit is <I>better than the mighty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:32">Prov. xvi. 32</A>.

 Here observe,

 1. What were Job's condescensions to his servants
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 He did not <I>despise the cause of his man-servant,</I> no, nor of his 
 <I>maid-servant, when they contended with him.</I> If they contradicted 
 him in any thing, he was willing to hear their reasons. If they had 
 offended him, or were accused to him, he would patiently hear what they 
 had to say for themselves, in their own vindication or excuse. Nay, if 
 they complained of any hardship he put upon them, he did not browbeat 
 them, and bid them hold their tongues, but gave them leave to tell 
 their story, and redressed their grievances as far as it appeared they 
 had right on their side. He was tender of them, not only when they 
 served and pleased him, but even when they contended with him. Herein 
 he was a great example to masters, to <I>give to their servants that 
 which is just and equal;</I> nay, to do the same things to them that 
 they expect from them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+4:1,Eph+6:9">Col. iv. 1, Eph. vi. 9</A>),

 and not to rule them with rigour, and carry it with a high hand. Many
 of Job's servants were slain in his service

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:15-17"><I>ch.</I> i. 15-17</A>);

 the rest were unkind and undutiful to him, and despised his cause,
 though he never despised theirs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:15,16"><I>ch.</I> xix. 15, 16</A>);

 but he had this comfort that in his prosperity he had behaved well
 towards them. Note, When relations are either removed from us or 
 embittered to us the testimony of our consciences that we have done our 
 duty to them will be a great support and comfort to us. 

 2. What were the considerations that moved him to treat his servants
 thus kindly. He had, herein, an eye to God, both as his Judge and their 
 Maker.

 (1.) As his Judge. He considered, "If I should be imperious and severe 
 with my servants, <I>what then shall I do when God riseth up?</I>" He 
 considered that he had a Master in heaven, to whom he was accountable, 
 who will rise up and will visit; and <I>we</I> are concerned to 
 consider <I>what we shall do in the day of his visitation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:3">Isa. x. 3</A>),

 and, considering that we should be undone if God should then be strict
 and severe with us, we ought to be very mild and gentle towards all 
 with whom we have to do. Consider what would become of us if God should 
 be extreme to mark what we do amiss, should take all advantages against 
 us and insist upon all his just demands from us--if he should visit 
 every offence, and take every forfeiture--if he should always chide, 
 and keep his anger for ever. And let not us be rigorous with our 
 inferiors. Consider what will become of us if we be cruel and 
 unmerciful to our brethren. The cries of the injured will be heard; the 
 sins of the injurious will be punished. Those that showed no mercy
 shall find none; and what shall we do then?

 (2.) As his and his servants' Creator, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 When he was tempted to be harsh with his servants, to deny them their 
 right and turn a deaf ear to their reasonings, this thought came very 
 seasonably into his mind, "<I>Did not he that made me in the womb make 
 him?</I> I am a creature as well as he, and my being is derived and 
 depending as well as his. He partakes of the same nature that I do and 
 is the work of the same hand: <I>Have we not all one Father?</I>" Note, 
 Whatever difference there is among men in their outward condition, in 
 their capacity of mind, or strength of body, or place in the world, he 
 that made the one made the other also, which is a good reason why we 
 should not mock at men's natural infirmities, nor trample upon those 
 that are in any way our inferiors, but, in every thing, do as we would 
 be done by. It is a rule of justice, <I>Parium par sit ratio--Let 
 equals be equally estimated and treated;</I> and therefore since there 
 is so great a parity among men, they being all made of the same mould, 
 by the same power, for the same end, notwithstanding the disparity of 
 our outward condition, we are bound so far to set ourselves upon the 
 level with those we deal with as to do to them, in all respects, as we 
 would they should do to us.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Eliphaz had particularly charged Job with unmercifulness to the poor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:6-9"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 6</A>,

 &c.): Thou hast <I>withholden bread from the hungry, stripped the naked
 of their clothing,</I> and sent <I>widows away empty.</I> One would 
 think he could not have been so very positive and express in his charge 
 unless there had been some truth in it, some ground, for it; and yet it 
 appears, by Job's protestation, that it was utterly false and 
 groundless; he was never guilty of any such thing. See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The testimony which Job's conscience gave in concerning his constant 
 behaviour towards the poor. He enlarges most upon this head because in 
 this matter he was most particularly accused. He solemnly protests,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he had never been wanting to do good to them, as there was 
 occasion, to the utmost of his ability. He was always compassionate to 
 the poor, and careful of them, especially the widows and fatherless, 
 that were destitute of help. 

 (1.) He was always ready to grant their desires and answer their 
 expectations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 If a poor person begged a kindness of his, he was ready to gratify him; 
 if he could but perceive by the widow's mournful craving look that she 
 expected an alms from him, though she had

 not confidence enough to ask it, he had compassion enough to give it, 
 and <I>never caused the eyes of the widow to fail.</I> 

 (2.) He put a respect upon the poor, and did them honour; for he took 
 the fatherless children to eat with him at his own table: they should 
 fare as he fared, and be familiar with him, and he would show himself 
 pleased with their company as if they had been his own, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 As it is one of the greatest grievances of poverty that it exposes to 
 contempt, so it is none of the least supports to the poor to be 
 respected.

 (3.) He was very tender of them, and had a fatherly concern for them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 He was a father to the fatherless, took care of orphans, brought them 
 up with him under his own eye, and gave them, not only maintenance, but 
 education. He was a guide to the widow, who had lost the guide of her 
 youth; he advised her in her affairs, took cognizance of them, and 
 undertook the management of them. Those that need not our alms may yet 
 have occasion for our counsel, and it may be a real kindness to them.
 This Job says he did <I>from his youth, from his mother's womb.</I> He 
 had something of tenderness and compassion woven in his nature; he 
 began betimes to do good, ever since he could remember; he had always 
 some poor widow or fatherless child under his care. His parents taught 
 him betimes to pity and relieve the poor, and brought up orphans with 
 him.

 (4.) He provided food convenient for them; they ate of the same morsels 
 that he did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 did not eat after him, of the crumbs that fell from his table, but with 
 him, of the best dish upon his table. Those that have abundance must
 not eat their morsels alone, as if they had none but themselves to take 
 care of, nor indulge their appetite with a dainty bit by themselves, 
 but take others to share with them, as David took Mephibosheth.

 (5.) He took particular care to clothe those that were without 
 covering, which would be more expensive to him than feeding them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Poor people may perish for want of clothing as well as for want of 
 food--for want of clothing to lie in by night or to go abroad in by 
 day. If Job knew of any that were in this distress, he was forward to 
 relieve them, and instead of giving rich and gaudy liveries to his 
 servants, while the poor were turned off with rags that were ready to 
 be thrown to the dunghill, he had good warm strong clothes made on 
 purpose for them of <I>the fleece of his sheep</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 so that their <I>loins,</I> whenever they girt those garments about 
 them, <I>blessed him;</I> they commended his charity, blessed God for 
 him, and prayed God to bless him. Job's sheep were burned with fire 
 from heaven, but this was his comfort that, when he had them, he came 
 honestly by them, and used them charitably, fed the poor with their 
 flesh and clothed them with their wool.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he had never been accessory to the wronging of any that were 
 poor. It might be said, perhaps, that he was kind here and there to a 
 poor orphan that was a favourite, but to others he was oppressive. No, 
 he was tender to all and injurious to none. He never so much as 
 <I>lifted up his hand against the fatherless</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 never threatened or frightened them, or offered to strike them; never 
 used his power to crush those that stood in his way or squeeze what he 
 could out of them, though he <I>saw his help in the gate,</I> that is, 
 though he had interest enough, both in the people and in the judges, 
 both to enable him to do it and to bear him out when he had done it. 
 Those that have it in their power to do a wrong thing and go through 
 with it, and a prospect of getting by it, and yet do justly, and love 
 mercy, and are firm to both, may afterwards reflect upon their conduct 
 with much comfort, as Job does here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The imprecation with which he confirms this protestation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):
 
 "If I have been oppressive to the poor, <I>let my arm fall from my 
 shoulder-blade and my arm be broken from the bone,</I>" that is, "let 
 the flesh rot off from the bone and one bone be disjointed and broken 
 off from another." Had he not been perfectly clear in this matter, he 
 durst not thus have challenged the divine vengeance. And he intimates 
 that it is a righteous thing with God to break the arm that is lifted 
 up against the fatherless, as he withered Jeroboam's arm that was 
 stretched out against a prophet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The principles by which Job was restrained from all 
 uncharitableness and unmercifulness. He durst not abuse the poor; for 
 though, with his help in the gate, he could overpower them, yet he 
 could not make his part good against that God who is the patron of 
 oppressed poverty and will not let oppressors go unpunished 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):
 
 "<I>Destruction from God was a terror to me,</I> whenever I was tempted 
 to this sin, and <I>by reason of his highness I could not endure</I> 
 the thought of making him my enemy." He stood in awe, 

 1. Of the majesty of God, as a God above him. He thought of his 
 highness, the infinite distance between him and God, which possessed 
 him with such a reverence of him as made him very circumspect in his 
 whole conversation. Those who oppress the poor, and pervert judgment 
 and justice, forget that <I>he who is higher than the highest 
 regards,</I> and <I>there is a higher than they,</I> who is able to 
 deal with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:8">Eccl. v. 8</A>);

 but Job considered this.

 2. Of the wrath of God, as a God that would certainly be against him if 
 he should wrong the poor. <I>Destruction from God,</I> because it would 
 be a certain and an utter ruin to him if he were guilty of this sin, 
 was a constant terror to him, to restrain him from it. Note, Good men, 
 even the best, have need to restrain themselves from sin with the fear 
 of destruction from God, and all little enough. This should especially 
 restrain us from all acts of injustice and oppression that God himself 
 is the avenger thereof. Even when salvation from God is a comfort to 
 us, yet destruction from God should be a terror to us. Adam, in 
 innocency, was awed with a threatening.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Four articles more of Job's protestation we have in these verses,
 which, as all the rest, not only assure us what he was and did, but 
 teach us what we should be and do:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He protests that he never set his heart upon the wealth of this 
 world, nor took the things of it for his portions and happiness. He had 
 gold; he had fine gold. His <I>wealth was great,</I> and he <I>had 
 gotten much.</I> Our wealth is either advantageous or pernicious to us 
 according as we stand affected to it. If we make it our rest and our 
 ruler, it will be our ruin; if we make it our servant, and an 
 instrument of righteousness, it will be a blessing to us. Job here 
 tells us how he stood affected to his worldly wealth. 

 1. He put no great confidence in it: he did not <I>make gold his 
 hope,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 Those are very unwise that do, and enemies to themselves, who depend 
 upon it as sufficient to make them happy, who think themselves safe and 
 honourable, and sure of comfort, in having abundance of this world's 
 goods. Some make it their hope and confidence for another world, as if 
 it were a certain token of God's favour; and those who have so much 
 sense as not to think so yet promise themselves that it will be a 
 portion for them in this life, whereas the things themselves are 
 uncertain and our satisfaction in them is much more so. It is hard to 
 have riches and not to trust in riches; and it is this which makes it 
 so difficult for <I>a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:23,Mk+10:23">Matt. xix. 23; Mark x. 24</A>.

 2. He took no great complacency in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>If I rejoiced because my wealth was great</I> and boasted that <I>my 
 hand had gotten much.</I> He took no pride in his wealth, as if it 
 added any thing to his real excellency, nor did he think that his might 
 and the power of his hand obtained it for him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:17">Deut. viii. 17</A>.

 He took no pleasure in it in comparison with the spiritual things which
 were the delight of his soul. His joy did not terminate in the gift, 
 but passed through it to the giver. When he was in the midst of his 
 abundance he never said, <I>Soul, take thy ease</I> in these things, 
 <I>eat, drink, and be merry,</I> nor blessed himself in his riches. He 
 did not inordinately rejoice in his wealth, which helped him to bear 
 the loss of it so patiently as he did. The way to <I>weep as though we 
 wept not</I> is to <I>rejoice as though we rejoiced not.</I> The less 
 pleasure the enjoyment is the less pain the disappointment will be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He protests that he never gave the worship and glory to the 
 creature which are due to God only; he was never guilty of idolatry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:26-28"><I>v.</I> 26-28</A>.

 We do not find that Job's friends charged him with this. But there were 
 those, it seems, at that time, who were so sottish as to worship the 
 sun and moon, else Job would not have mentioned it. Idolatry is one of
 the old ways which wicked men have trodden, and the most ancient 
 idolatry was the worshipping of the sun and moon, to which the 
 temptation was most strong, as appears

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:19">Deut. iv. 19</A>,

 where Moses speaks of the danger which the people were in of being
 driven to worship them. But as yet it was practised secretly, and durst 
 not appear in open view, as afterwards the most abominable idolatries 
 did. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How far Job kept from this sin. He not only never bowed the knee to 
 Baal (which, some think, was designed to represent the sun), never fell 
 down and worshipped the sun, but he kept his eye, his heart, and his 
 lips, clean from this sin. 

 (1.) He never so much as beheld the sun or the moon in their pomp and 
 lustre with any other admiration of them than what led him to give all 
 the glory of their brightness and usefulness to their Creator. Against 
 spiritual as well as corporal adultery he made a covenant with his 
 eyes; and this was his covenant, that, whenever he looked at the lights 
 of heaven, he should by faith look through them, and beyond them, to 
 the Father of lights. 

 (2.) He kept his heart with all diligence, that that should not be 
 secretly enticed to think that there is a divine glory in their 
 brightness, or a divine power in their influence, and that therefore 
 divine honours are to be paid to them. Here is the source of idolatry; 
 it begins in the heart. Every man is tempted to that, as to other sins, 
 when he is <I>drawn away by his own lust and enticed.</I> 

 (3.) He did not so much as put a compliment upon these pretended 
 deities, did not perform the least and lowest act of adoration: <I>His 
 mouth did not kiss his hand,</I> which, it is likely, was a ceremony 
 then commonly used even by some that yet would not be thought 
 idolaters. It is an old-fashioned piece of civil respect among 
 ourselves, in making a bow, to kiss the hand, a form which, it seems, 
 was anciently used in giving divine honours to the sun and moon. They 
 could not reach to kiss them, as <I>the men that sacrificed kissed the 
 calves</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+13:2,1Ki+19:18">Hos. xiii. 2, 1 Kings xix. 18</A>);

 but, to show their good will, they kissed their hand, reverencing those
 as their masters which God has made servants to this lower world, to 
 hold the candle for us. Job never did it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How ill Job thought of this sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 (1.) He looked upon it as an affront to the civil magistrate: It 
 <I>were an iniquity to be punished by the judge,</I> as a public 
 nuisance, and hurtful to kings and provinces. Idolatry debauches men's 
 minds, corrupts their manners, takes off the true sense of religion 
 which is the great bond of societies, and provokes God to give men up 
 to a reprobate sense, and to send judgments upon a nation; and 
 therefore the conservators of the public peace are concerned to 
 restrain it by punishing it. 

 (2.) He looked upon it as a much greater affront to the God of heaven, 
 and no less than high treason against his crown and dignity: For <I>I 
 should have denied the God that is above,</I> denied his being as God 
 and his sovereignty as God above. Idolatry is, in effect, atheism;
 hence the Gentiles are said to be <I>without God (atheists) in the 
 world.</I> Note, We should be afraid of every thing that does but 
 tacitly deny the God above, his providence, or any of his 
 perfections.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He protests that he was so far from doing or designing mischief to 
 any that he neither desired nor delighted in the hurt of the worst 
 enemy he had. The forgiving of those that do us evil, it seems, was 
 Old-Testament duty, though the Pharisees made the law concerning it of 
 no effect, by teaching, <I>Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thy 
 enemy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:43">Matt. v. 43</A>.

 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Job was far from revenge. He did not only not return the injuries 
 that were done him, not only not destroy those who hated him; but, 

 (1.) He did not so much as rejoice when any mischief befal them,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.
 
 Many who would not wilfully hurt those who stand in their light, or 
 have done them a diskindness, yet are secretly pleased and laugh in 
 their sleeve (as we say) when hurt is done them. But Job was not of 
 that spirit. Though Job was a very good man, yet, it seems, there were 
 those that hated him; but evil found them. He saw their destruction, 
 and was far from rejoicing in it; for that would justly have brought 
 the destruction upon him, as it is intimated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:17,18">Prov. xxiv. 17, 18</A>.

 (2.) He did not so much as wish in his own mind that evil might befel 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 He never <I>wished a curse to his soul</I> (curses to the soul are the 
 worst of curses), never desired his death; he knew that, if he did, it 
 would turn into sin to him. He was careful <I>not to offend with his 
 tongue</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:1">Ps. xxxix. 1</A>),

 would not <I>suffer his mouth to sin,</I> and therefore durst not
 imprecate any evil, no, not to his worst enemy. If others bear malice 
 to us, that will not justify us in bearing malice to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He was violently urged to revenge, and yet he kept himself thus 
 clear from it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>The men of his tabernacle,</I> his domestics, his servants, and 
 those about him, were so enraged at Job's enemy who hated him, that 
 they could have eaten him, if Job would but have set them on or given 
 them leave. "<I>O that we had of his flesh!</I> Our master is satisfied 
 to forgive him, but <I>we cannot be so satisfied.</I>" See how much 
 beloved Job was by his family, how heartily they espoused his cause, 
 and what enemies they were to his enemies; but see what a strict hand 
 Job kept upon his passions, that he would not avenge himself, though he 
 had those about him that blew the coals of his resentment. Note,

 (1.) A good man commonly does not himself lay to heart the affronts 
 that are done him so much as his friends do for him. 

 (2.) Great men have commonly those about them that stir them up to 
 revenge. David had so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:4,26:8,2Sa+16:9">1 Sam. xxiv. 4; xxvi. 8; 
 2 Sam. xvi. 9</A>.
 
 But if they keep their temper, notwithstanding the spiteful
 insinuations of those about them, afterwards it shall be no grief of 
 heart to them, but shall turn very much to their praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He protests that he had never been unkind or inhospitable to 
 strangers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>The stranger lodged not in the street,</I> as angels might lately 
 have done in the streets of Sodom if Lot alone had not entertained 
 them. Perhaps by that instance Job was taught (as we are, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:2">Heb. xiii. 2</A>)
 
 not to be forgetful to entertain strangers. He that is at home must
 consider those that are from home, and put his soul into their soul's 
 stead, and then do as he would be done by. Hospitality is a Christian 
 duty,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:9">1 Pet. iv. 9</A>.

 Job, in his prosperity, was noted for good house-keeping: <I>He opened
 his door to the road</I> (so it may be read); he kept the street-door 
 open, that he might see who passed by and invite them in, as Abraham,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>33  If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine
 iniquity in my bosom:
 &nbsp; 34  Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of
 families terrify me, that I kept silence, <I>and</I> went not out of
 the door?
 &nbsp; 35  Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire <I>is, that</I> the

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here Job's protestation against three more sins, together with 
 his general appeal to God's bar and his petition for a hearing there, 
 which, it is likely, was intended to conclude his discourse (and 
 therefore we will consider it last), but that another particular sin 
 occurred, from which he thought it requisite to acquit himself. He 
 clears himself from the charge,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Of dissimulation and hypocrisy. The general crime of which his 
 friends accused him was that, under the cloak of a profession of 
 religion, he had kept up secret haunts of sin, and that really he was 
 as bad as other people, but had the art of concealing it. Zophar 
 insinuated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:12"><I>ch.</I> xx. 12</A>)

 that he <I>hid his iniquity under his tongue.</I> "No," says Job, "I
 never did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 <I>I never covered my transgression as Adam,</I> never palliated a sin 
 with frivolous excuses, nor made fig-leaves the shelter of my shame, 
 nor ever <I>hid my iniquity in my bosom,</I> as a fondling, a darling, 
 that I could by no means part with, or as stolen goods which I dreaded 
 the discovery of." It is natural to us to cover our sins; we have it 
 from our first parents. We are loth to confess our faults, willing to 
 extenuate them and make the best of ourselves, to devolve the blame 
 upon others, as Adam on his wife, not without a tacit reflection upon 
 God himself. But <I>he that</I> thus <I>covers his sins shall not 
 prosper,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:13">Prov. xxviii. 13</A>.

 Job, in this protestation, intimates two things, which were certain
 evidences of his integrity:--

 1. That he was not guilty of any great transgression or iniquity,
 inconsistent with sincerity, which he had now industriously concealed.
 In this protestation he had dealt fairly, and, while he denies some 
 sins, was not conscious to himself that he allowed himself in any.

 2. That what transgression and iniquity he had been guilty of (<I>Who
 is there that lives and sins not?</I>) he had always been ready to own 
 it, and, as soon as ever he perceived he had said or done amiss, he was 
 ready to unsay it and undo it, as far as he could, by repentance, 
 confessing it both to God and man, and forsaking it: this is doing 
 honestly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. From the charge of cowardice and base fear. His courage in that 
 which is good he produces as an evidence of his sincerity in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>):

 <I>Did I fear a great multitude, that I kept silence?</I> No, all that 
 knew Job knew him to be a man of undaunted resolution in a good cause, 
 that boldly appeared, spoke, and acted, in defence of religion and 
 justice, and did not fear the face of man nor was ever threatened or 
 brow-beaten out of his duty, but set his face as a flint. Observe, 

 1. What great conscience Job had made of his duty as a magistrate, or
 a man of reputation, in the place where he lived. He did not, he durst 
 not, keep silence when he had a call to speak in an honest cause, or 
 keep within doors when he had a call to go abroad to do good. The case 
 may be such that it may be our sin to be silent and retired, as when we 
 are called to reprove sin and bear our testimony against it, to 
 vindicate the truths and ways of God, to do justice to those who are 
 injured or oppressed, or in any way to serve the public or to do honour 
 to our religion. 

 2. What little account Job made of the discouragements he met with in 
 the way of his duty. He valued not the clamours of the mob, feared not 
 a great multitude, nor did he value the menaces of the mighty: <I>The 
 contempt of families never terrified him.</I> He was not deterred by 
 the number or quality, the scorns or insults, or the injurious from 
 doing justice to the injured; no, he scorned to be swayed and biassed 
 by any such considerations, nor ever suffered a righteous cause to be 
 run down by a high hand. He feared the great God, not the multitude, 
 and his curse, not the contempt of families.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. From the charge of oppression and violence, and doing wrong to his 
 poor neighbours. And here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What his protestation is--that the estate he had he both got and used
 honestly, so that his <I>land</I> could not <I>cry out against him nor 
 the furrows thereof complain</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>),

 as they do against those who get the possession of them by fraud and 
 extortion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:9-11">Hab. ii. 9-11</A>.

 The whole creation is said to groan under the sin of man; but that
 which is unjustly gained and held cries out against a man, and accuses 
 him, condemns him, and demands justice against him for the injury. 
 Rather than his oppression shall go unpunished the very ground and the 
 furrows of it shall witness against him, and be his prosecutors. Two 
 things he could say safely concerning his estate:--

 (1.) That he <I>never ate the fruits of it without money,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.
 
 What he purchased he paid for, as Abraham for the land he bought 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+23:16">Gen. xxiii. 16</A>),

 and David,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:24">2 Sam. xxiv. 24</A>.

 The labourers that he employed had their wages duly paid them, and, if 
 he made use of the fruits of those lands that he let out, he paid his 
 tenants for them, or allowed it in their rent. 

 (2.) That he never caused the owners thereof to lose their life, never 
 got an estate, as Ahab got Naboth's vineyard, by killing the heir and 
 seizing the inheritance, never starved those that held lands of him nor 
 killed them with hard bargains and hard usage. No tenant, no workman, 
 no servant, he had, could complain of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he confirms his protestation. He does it, as often before, with 
 a suitable imprecation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):

 "If I have got my estate unjustly, <I>let thistles grow instead of 
 wheat,</I> the worst of weeds instead of the best of grains." When men 
 get estates unjustly they are justly deprived of the comfort of them, 
 and disappointed in their expectations from them. They sow their land, 
 but they sow not that body that shall be. God will give it a body. It 
 was sown wheat, but shall come up thistles. What men do not come 
 honestly by will never do them any good. Job, towards the close of his
 protestation, appeals to the judgment-seat of God concerning the truth 
 of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:35-37"><I>v.</I> 35-37</A>):

 <I>O that he would hear me,</I> even <I>that the Almighty would answer 
 me!</I> This was what he desired and often complained that he could not 
 obtain; and, now that he had drawn up his own defence so particularly, 
 he leaves it upon record, in expectation of a hearing, files it, as it 
 were, till his cause be called.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) A trial is moved for, and the motion earnestly pressed: "<I>O that 
 one,</I> any one, <I>would hear me;</I> my cause is so good, and my 
 evidence so clear, that I am willing to refer it to any indifferent 
 person whatsoever; but my desire is that the Almighty himself would 
 determine it." An upright heart does not dread a scrutiny. He that 
 means honestly wishes he had a window in his breast, that all men might 
 see the intents of his heart. But an upright heart does particularly 
 desire to be determined in every thing by the judgment of God, which we 
 are sure is according to the truth. It was holy David's prayer, 
 <I>Search me, O God! and know my heart;</I> and it was blessed Paul's 
 comfort, <I>He that judgeth me is the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The prosecutor is called, the plaintiff summoned, and ordered to
 bring in his information, to say what he has to say against the 
 prisoner, for he stands upon his deliverance: "<I>O that my adversary 
 had written a book</I>--that my friends, who charge me with hypocrisy,
 would draw up their charge in writing, that it might be reduced to a 
 certainty, and that we might the better join issue upon it." Job would 
 be very glad to see the libel, to have a copy of his indictment. He 
 would not hide it under his arm, but <I>take it upon his shoulder,</I> 
 to be seen and read of all men, nay, he would <I>bind it as a crown</I> 
 to him, would be pleased with it, and look upon it as his ornament; 
 for, 

 [1.] If it discovered to him any sin he had been guilty of, which he 
 did not yet see, he should be glad to know it, that he might repent of 
 it and get it pardoned. A good man is willing to know the worst of 
 himself and will be thankful to those that will faithfully tell him of 
 his faults. 

 [2.] If it charged him with what was false, he doubted not but to 
 disprove the allegations, that his innocency would be cleared up as the 
 light, and he should come off with so much the more honour. But, 

 [3.] He believed that, when his adversaries came to consider the matter 
 so closely as they must do if they put the charge in writing, the 
 accusations would be trivial and minute, and every one that saw them 
 would say, "If this was all they had to say against him, it was a shame 
 they gave him so much trouble."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The defendant is ready to make his appearance and to give his 
 accusers all the fair play they can desire. He will <I>declare unto 
 them the number of his steps,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>.

 He will let them into the history of his own life, will show them all 
 the stages and scenes of it. He will give them a narrative of his 
 conversation, what would make against him as well as what would make 
 for him, and let them make what use they pleased of it; and so 
 confident he is of his integrity that as a prince to be crowned, rather 
 than a prisoner to be tried, he would <I>go near to him,</I> both to 
 his accuser to hear his charge and to his judge to hear his doom. Thus 
 the testimony of his conscience was his rejoicing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Those that have kept their hands without spot from the world, as Job 
 did, may lift up their faces without spot unto God, and may comfort 
 themselves with the prospect of his judgment when they lie under the 
 unjust censures of men. <I>If our hearts condemn us not, then have we 
 confidence towards God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus <I>the words of Job are ended;</I> that is, he has now said all he 
 would say in answer to his friends: he afterwards said something in a 
 way of self-reproach and condemnation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:4,5,42:2-6"><I>ch.</I> xl. 4, 5, xlii. 2</A>,

 &c.), but here ends what he had to say in a way of self-defence and
 vindication. If this suffice not he will say no more; he knows when he
 has said enough and will submit to the judgment of the bench. Some 
 think the manner of expression intimates that he concluded with an air 
 of assurance and triumph. He now keeps the field and doubts not but to 
 win the field. <I>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? 
 It is God that justifies.</I></P>
