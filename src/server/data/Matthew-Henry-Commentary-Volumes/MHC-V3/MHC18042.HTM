 Solomon says, "Better is the end of a thing than the beginning 
 thereof," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:8">Eccl. vii. 8</A>.

 It was so here in the story of Job; at the evening-time it was light.
 Three things we have met with in this book which, I confess , have 
 troubled me very much; but we find all the three grievances redressed, 
 thoroughly redressed, in this chapter, everything set to-rights.

 I. It has been a great trouble to us to see such a holy man as Job was
 so fretful, and peevish, and uneasy to himself, and especially to hear 
 him quarrel with God and speak indecently to him; but, though he thus 
 fall, he is not utterly cast down, for here he recovers his temper, 
 comes to himself and to his right mind again by repentance, is sorry 
 for what he has said amiss, unsays it, and humbles himself before God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. It has been likewise a great trouble to us to see Job and his
 friends so much at variance, not only differing in their opinions, but 
 giving one another a great many hard words, and passing severe censures 
 one upon another, though they were all very wise and good men; but here 
 we have this grievance redressed likewise, the differences between them 
 happily adjusted, the quarrel taken up, all the peevish reflections 
 they had cast upon one another forgiven and forgotten, and all joining 
 in sacrifices and prayers, mutually accepted of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 III. It has troubled us to see a man of such eminent piety and
 usefulness as Job was so grievously afflicted, so pained, so sick, so 
 poor, so reproached, so slighted, and made the very centre of all the 
 calamities of human life; but here we have this grievance redressed 
 too, Job healed of all his ailments, more honoured and beloved than 
 ever, enriched with an estate double to what he had before, surrounded 
 with all the comforts of life, and as great an instance of prosperity 
 as ever he had been of affliction and patience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:10-17">ver. 10-17</A>.

 All this is written for our learning, that we, under these and the like
 discouragements that we meet with, through patience and comfort of this 
 scripture may have hope.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then Job answered the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and said,
 &nbsp; 2  I know that thou canst do every <I>thing,</I> and <I>that</I> no
 thought can be withholden from thee.
 &nbsp; 3  Who <I>is</I> he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore
 have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for
 me, which I knew not.
 &nbsp; 4  Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of
 thee, and declare thou unto me.
 &nbsp; 5  I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine
 eye seeth thee.
 &nbsp; 6  Wherefore I abhor <I>myself,</I> and repent in dust and ashes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The words of Job justifying himself were ended, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:40"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 40</A>.

 After that he said no more to that purport. The words of Job judging
 and condemning himself began,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:4,5"><I>ch.</I> xl. 4, 5</A>.

 Here he goes on with words to the same purport. Though his patience had
 not its perfect work, his repentance for his impatience had. He is here 
 thoroughly humbled for his folly and unadvised speaking, and it was 
 forgiven him. Good men will see and own their faults at last, though it 
 may be some difficulty to bring them to do this. <I>Then,</I> when God
 had said all that to him concerning his own greatness and power 
 appearing in the creatures, <I>then Job answered the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 not by way of contradiction (he had promised not so to answer again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:5"><I>ch.</I> xl. 5</A>),

 but by way of submission; and thus we must all answer the calls of
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He subscribes to the truth of God's unlimited power, knowledge, and
 dominion, to prove which was the scope of God's discourse out of the 
 whirlwind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Corrupt passions and practices arise either from some corrupt 
 principles or from the neglect and disbelief of the principles of 
 truth; and therefore true repentance begins in <I>the acknowledgement 
 of the truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:25">2 Tim. ii. 25</A>.

 Job here owns his judgment convinced of the greatness, glory, and
 perfection of God, from which would follow the conviction of his 
 conscience concerning his own folly in speaking irreverently to him.

 1. He owns that God can do every thing. What can be too hard for him
 that made behemoth and leviathan, and manages both as he pleases? He 
 knew this before, and had himself discoursed very well upon the 
 subject, but now he knew it with application. <I>God had spoken</I> it 
 once, and then he heard it twice, that <I>power belongs to God;</I> and 
 therefore it is the greatest madness and presumption imaginable to 
 contend with him. <I>"Thou canst do every thing,</I> and therefore
 canst raise me out of this low condition, which I have so often 
 foolishly despaired of as impossible: I now believe thou art able to do 
 this." 
 
 2. That <I>no thought can be withholden from him,</I> that is,

 (1.) There is no thought of ours that he can be hindered from the
 knowledge of. Not a fretful, discontented, unbelieving thought is in 
 our minds at any time but God is a witness to it. It is in vain to 
 contest with him; for we cannot hide our counsels and projects from 
 him, and, if he discover them, he can defeat them.

 (2.) There is no thought of his that he can be hindered from the
 execution of. <I>Whatever the Lord pleased, that did he.</I> Job had
 said this passionately, complaining of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:13"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 13</A>),

 <I>What his soul desireth even that he doeth;</I> now he says, with
 pleasure and satisfaction, that <I>God's counsels shall stand.</I> If 
 God's thoughts concerning us be <I>thoughts of good, to give us an 
 unexpected end,</I> he cannot be withheld from accomplishing his 
 gracious purposes, whatever difficulties may seem to lie in the 
 way.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He owns himself to be guilty of that which God had charged him with 
 in the beginning of his discourse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 "Lord, the first word thou saidst was, <I>Who is this that darkens
 counsel by words without knowledge?</I> There needed no more; that word 
 convinced me. I own <I>I am the man</I> that has been so foolish. That 
 word reached my conscience, and set my sin in order before me. It is 
 too plain to be denied, too bad to be excused. I have hidden <I>counsel 
 without knowledge.</I> I have ignorantly overlooked the counsels and 
 designs of God in afflicting me, and therefore have quarrelled with 
 God, and insisted too much upon my own justification: <I>Therefore I 
 uttered that which I understood not,</I>" that is, "I have passed a 
 judgment upon the dispensations of Providence, though I was utterly a 
 stranger to the reasons of them." Here,

 1. He owns himself ignorant of the divine counsels; and so we are all.
 God's judgments are a great deep, which we cannot fathom, much less 
 find out the springs of. We see what God does, but we neither know why 
 he does it, what he is aiming at, nor what he will bring it to. These 
 are things too wonderful for us, out of our sight to discover, out of 
 our reach to alter, and out of our jurisdiction to judge of. They are 
 things which we know not; it is quite above our capacity to pass a 
 verdict upon them. The reason why we quarrel with Providence is because 
 we do not understand it; and we must be content to be in the dark about 
 it, until the mystery of God shall be finished. 

 2. He owns himself imprudent and presumptuous in undertaking to 
 discourse of that which he did not understand and to arraign that which 
 he could not judge of. <I>He that answereth a matter before he heareth
 it, it is folly and shame to him.</I> We wrong ourselves, as well as 
 the cause which we undertake to determine, while we are no competent 
 judges of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He will not answer, but he will <I>make supplication to his 
 Judge,</I> as he had said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:15"><I>ch.</I> ix. 15</A>.

 "<I>Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 not speak either as plaintiff or defendant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:22"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 22</A>),

 but as a humble petitioner, not as one that will undertake to teach and
 prescribe, but as one that desires to learn and is willing to be 
 prescribed to. Lord, put no more hard questions to me, for I am not 
 able to answer thee one of a thousand of those which thou hast put; but 
 give me leave to ask instruction from thee, and do not deny it me, do 
 not upbraid me with my folly and self-sufficiency," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:5">Jam. i. 5</A>.

 Now he is brought to the prayer Elihu taught him, <I>That which I see
 not teach thou me.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He puts himself into the posture of a penitent, and therein goes 
 upon a right principle. In true repentance there must be not only 
 conviction of sin, but contrition and godly sorrow for it, sorrow 
 <I>according to God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+7:9">2 Cor. vii. 9</A>.

 Such was Job's sorrow for his sins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Job had an eye to God in his repentance, thought highly of him, and 
 went upon that as the principle of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear</I> many a time from 
 my teachers when I was young, from my friends now of late. I have known 
 something of thy greatness, and power, and sovereign dominion; and yet 
 was not brought, by what I heard, to submit myself to thee as I ought. 
 The notions I had of these things served me only to talk of, and had 
 not a due influence upon my mind. <I>But now</I> thou hast by
 immediate revelation discovered thyself to me in thy glorious majesty; 
 <I>now my eyes see thee;</I> now I feel the power of those truths which 
 before I had only the notion of, and therefore now I repent, and unsay 
 what I have foolishly said." Note,

 (1.) It is a great mercy to have a good education, and to know the 
 things of God by the instructions of his word and ministers. <I>Faith 
 comes by hearing,</I> and then it is most likely to come when we hear 
 attentively and with the <I>hearing of the ear.</I> 

 (2.) When the understanding is enlightened by the Spirit of grace our 
 knowledge of divine things as far exceeds what we had before as that by 
 ocular demonstration exceeds that by report and common fame. By the
 teachings of men God reveals his Son to us; but by the teachings of his 
 Spirit he reveals his Son in us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+1:16">Gal. i. 16</A>),

 and so <I>changes us into
 the same image,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:18">2 Cor. iii. 18</A>.

 (3.) God is pleased sometimes to manifest himself most fully to his
 people by the rebukes of his word and providence. "Now that I have been 
 afflicted, now that I have been told of my faults, now my eye sees 
 thee." <I>The rod and reproof give wisdom. Blessed is the man whom thou 
 chastenest and teachest.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Job had an eye to himself in his repentance, thought hardly of 
 himself, and thereby expressed his sorrow for his sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 <I>Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</I> Observe, 
 
 (1.) It concerns us to be deeply humbled for the sins we are convinced 
 of, and not to rest in a slight superficial displeasure against 
 ourselves for them. Even good people, that have no gross enormities to 
 repent of, must be greatly afflicted in soul for the workings and 
 breakings out of pride, passion, peevishness, and discontent, and all 
 their hasty unadvised speeches; for these we must be pricked to the 
 heart and be in bitterness. Till the enemy be effectually humbled, the 
 peace will be insecure. 

 (2.) Outward expressions of godly sorrow well become penitents; Job 
 repented in dust and ashes. These, without an inward change, do but 
 mock God; but, where they come from sincere contrition of soul, the 
 sinner by them gives glory to God, takes shame to himself, and may be 
 instrumental to bring others to repentance. Job's afflictions had
 brought him to the ashes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:8"><I>ch.</I> ii. 8</A>,

 he <I>sat down among the ashes</I>), but now his sins brought him
 thither. True penitents mourn for their sins as heartily as ever they 
 did for any outward afflictions, and are in bitterness as for an only 
 son of a first-born, for they are brought to see more evils in their 
 sins than in their troubles. 

 (3.) Self-loathing is evermore the companion of true repentance.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+6:9">Ezek. vi. 9</A>,

 <I>They shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have
 committed.</I> We must not only angry at ourselves for the wrong and
 damage we have by sin done to our own souls, but must abhor ourselves, 
 as having by sin made ourselves odious to the pure and holy God, who 
 cannot endure to look upon iniquity. If sin be truly an abomination to 
 us, sin in ourselves will especially be so; the nearer it is to us the 
 more loathsome it will be. 

 (4.) The more we see of the glory and majesty of God, and the more we 
 see of the vileness and odiousness of sin and of ourselves because of 
 sin, the more we shall abase and abhor ourselves for it. "Now my eye 
 sees what a God he is whom I have offended, the brightness of that 
 majesty which by wilful sin I have spit in the face of, the tenderness 
 of that mercy which I have spurned at the bowels of; now I see what a 
 just and holy God he is whose wrath I have incurred; wherefore I abhor 
 myself. <I>Woe is me, for I am undone,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:5">Isa. vi. 5</A>.

 God had challenged Job to <I>look upon proud men and abase them.</I> "I
 cannot," says Job, "pretend to do it; I have enough to do to get my own 
 proud heart humbled, to abase that and bring that low." Let us leave it 
 to God to govern the world, and make it our care, in the strength of 
 his grace, to govern ourselves and our own hearts well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job, in his discourses, had complained very much of the censures of his 
 friends and their hard usage of him, and had appealed to God as Judge 
 between him and them, and thought it hard that judgment was not 
 immediately given upon the appeal. While God was catechising Job out of 
 the whirlwind one would have thought that he only was in the wrong, and 
 that the cause would certainly go against him; but here, to our great 
 surprise, we find it quite otherwise, and the definitive sentence given 
 in Job's favour. Wherefore judge nothing before the time. Those who are 
 truly righteous before God may have their righteousness clouded and 
 eclipsed by great and uncommon afflictions, by the severe censures of 
 men, by their own frailties and foolish passions, by the sharp reproofs 
 of the word and conscience, and the deep humiliation of their own 
 spirits under the sense of God's terrors; and yet, in due time, these 
 clouds shall all blow over, and God will <I>bring forth their 
 righteousness as the light and their judgment as the noon-day,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:6">Ps. xxxvii. 6</A>.

 He cleared Job's righteousness here, because he, like an honest man,
 held it fast and would not let it go. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Judgment given against Job's three friends, upon the controversy 
 between them and Job. Elihu is not censured here, for he distinguished 
 himself from the rest in the management of the dispute, and acted, not 
 as a party, but as a moderator; and moderation will have its praise 
 with God, whether it have with men or no. In the judgment here given 
 Job is magnified and his three friends are mortified. While we were 
 examining the discourses on both sides we could not discern, and 
 therefore durst not determine, who was in the right; something of truth 
 we thought they both had on their side, but we could not cleave the 
 hair between them; nor would we, for all the world, have had to give 
 the decisive sentence upon the case, lest we should have determined 
 wrong. But it is well that the judgment is the Lord's, and we are sure 
 that his judgment is according to truth; to it we will refer ourselves, 
 and by it we will abide. Now, in the judgment here given,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Job is greatly magnified and comes off with honour. He was but one 
 against three, a beggar now against three princes, and yet, having God 
 on his side, he needed not fear the result, though thousands set 
 themselves against him. Observe here, 

 (1.) When God appeared for him: <I>After the Lord had spoken these 
 words unto Job,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 After he had convinced and humbled him, and brought him to repentance 
 for what he had said amiss, then he owned him in what he had said well, 
 comforted him, and put honour upon him; not till then: for we are not 
 ready for God's approbation till we judge and condemn ourselves; but 
 then he thus pleaded his cause, for he that <I>has torn will heal</I> 
 us, he that <I>has smitten will bind us.</I> The Comforter shall 
 convince,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=John+16:8">John xvi. 8</A>.

 See in what method we are to expect divine acceptance; we must first be
 humbled under divine rebukes. After God, by speaking these words, had 
 caused grief, he returned and had compassion, according to the 
 multitude of his mercies; for he will not contend for ever, but will 
 debate in measure, and stay his rough wind in the day of his east wind. 
 Now that Job had humbled himself God exalted him. True penitents shall 
 find favour with God, and what they have said and done amiss shall no 
 more be mentioned against them. Then God is well pleased with us when 
 we are brought to abhor ourselves.

 (2.) How he appeared for him. It is taken for granted that all his 
 offences are forgiven; for if he be dignified, as we find he is here, 
 no doubt he is justified. Job had sometimes intimated, with great
 assurance, that God would clear him at last, and he was not made 
 ashamed of the hope.

 [1.] God calls him again and again <I>his servant Job,</I> four times 
 in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:7,8">two verses</A>,

 and he seems to take a pleasure in calling him so, as before his
 troubles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:8"><I>ch.</I> i. 8</A>),

 "<I>Hast thou considered my servant Job?</I> Though he is poor and
 despised, he is my servant notwithstanding, and as dear to me as when 
 he was in prosperity. Though he has his faults, and has appeared to be 
 a man subject to like passions as others, though he has contended with 
 me, has gone about to disannul my judgment, and has darkened counsel by 
 words without knowledge, yet he sees his error and retracts it, and 
 therefore he is my servant Job still." If we still hold fast the 
 integrity and fidelity of servants to God, as Job did, though we may 
 for a time be deprived of the credit and comfort of the relation, we 
 shall be restored to it at last, as he was. The devil had undertaken to 
 prove Job a hypocrite, and his three friends had condemned him as a 
 wicked man; but God will acknowledge those whom he accepts, and will 
 not suffer them to be run down by the malice of hell or earth. If God 
 says, <I>Well done, good and faithful servant,</I> it is of little 
 consequence who says otherwise. 

 [2.] He owns that he had <I>spoken of him the thing that was right,</I> 
 beyond what his antagonists had done. He had given a much better and
 truer account of the divine Providence than they had done. They had 
 wronged God by making prosperity a mark of the true church and 
 affliction a certain indication of God's wrath; but Job had done him 
 right by maintaining that God's love and hatred are to be judged of by 
 what is in men, not by what is before them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:1">Eccl. ix. 1</A>.

 Observe, <I>First,</I> Those do the most justice to God and his
 providence who have an eye to the rewards and punishments of another 
 world more than to those of this, and with the prospect of those solve 
 the difficulties of the present administration. Job had referred things 
 to the future judgment, and the future state, more than his friends had 
 done, and therefore he spoke of God that which was right, better than 
 his friends had done. <I>Secondly,</I> Though Job had spoken some
 things amiss, even concerning God, whom he made too bold with, yet he 
 is commended for what he spoke that was right. We must not only not 
 reject that which is true and good, but must not deny it its due 
 praise, though there appear in it a mixture of human frailty and 
 infirmity. <I>Thirdly,</I> Job was in the right, and his friends were
 in the wrong, and yet he was in pain and they were at ease--a plain 
 evidence that we cannot judge of men and their sentiments by looking in 
 their faces or purses. He only can do it infallibly who sees men's 
 hearts.

 [3.] He will pass his word for Job that, notwithstanding all the wrong
 his friends had done him, he is so good a man, and of such a humble, 
 tender, forgiving spirit, that he will very readily pray for them, and 
 use his interest in heaven on their behalf: "<I>My servant Job will 
 pray for you.</I> I know he will. I have pardoned him, and he has the
 comfort of pardon, and therefore he will pardon you." 

 [4.] He appoints him to be the priest of this congregation, and 
 promises to accept him and his mediation for his friends. "Take your 
 sacrifices to my servant Job, <I>for him will I accept.</I>" Those whom 
 God washes from their sins he makes to himself kings and priests. True 
 penitents shall not only find favour as petitioners for themselves, but 
 be accepted as intercessors for others also. It was a great honour that 
 God hereby put upon Job, in appointing him to offer sacrifice for his 
 friends, as formerly he used to do for his own children,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 5</A>.

 And a happy presage it was of his restoration to his prosperity again,
 and indeed a good step towards it, that he was thus restored to the
 priesthood. Thus he became a type of Christ, through whom alone we and
 our spiritual sacrifices are <I>acceptable to God;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:5">1 Pet. ii. 5</A>.

 "<I>Go to my servant Job,</I> to my servant Jesus" (from whom for a 
 time he hid his face), "put your sacrifices into his hand, make use of 
 him as your Advocate, for him will I accept, but, out of him, you must 
 expect to be dealt with according to your folly." And, as Job prayed 
 and offered sacrifice for those that had grieved and wounded his 
 spirit, so Christ prayed and died for his persecutors, and ever lives 
 <I>making intercession for the transgressors.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Job's friends are greatly mortified, and come off with disgrace. 
 They were good men and belonged to God, and therefore he would not let 
 them lie still in their mistake any more than Job, but, having humbled 
 him by a discourse out of the whirlwind, he takes another course to 
 humble them. Job, who was dearest to him, was first chidden, but the 
 rest in their turn. When they heard Job talked to, it is probable, they 
 flattered themselves with a conceit that they were in the right and Job 
 was in all the fault, but God soon took them to task, and made them 
 know the contrary. In most disputes and controversies there is 
 something amiss on both sides, either in the merits of the cause or in 
 the management, if not in both; and it is fit that both sides should be 
 told of it, and made to see their errors. God addresses this to 
 Eliphaz, not only as the senior, but as the ringleader in the attack 
 made upon Job. Now, 

 (1.) God tells them plainly that they had <I>not spoken of him the 
 thing that was right, like Job,</I> that is, they had censured and 
 condemned Job upon a false hypothesis, had represented God fighting 
 against Job as an enemy when really he was only trying him as a friend, 
 and this was not right. Those do not say well of God who represent his 
 fatherly chastisements of his own children as judicial punishments and 
 who cut them off from his favour upon the account of them. Note, It is 
 a dangerous thing to judge uncharitably of the spiritual and eternal 
 state of others, for in so doing we may perhaps condemn those whom God 
 has accepted, which is a great provocation to him; it is offending his 
 little ones, and he takes himself to be wronged in all the wrongs that 
 are done to them. 

 (2.) He assures them he was angry with them: <I>My wrath is kindled 
 against thee and thy two friends.</I> God is very angry with those who 
 despise and reproach their brethren, who triumph over them, and judge 
 hardly of them, either for their calamities or for their infirmities. 
 Though they were wise and good men, yet, when they spoke amiss, God was 
 angry with them and let them know that he was.

 (3.) He requires from them a sacrifice, to make atonement for what they 
 had said amiss. They must bring each of them <I>seven bullocks, and</I> 
 each of them <I>seven rams,</I> to be offered up to God for a 
 <I>burnt-offering;</I> for it should seem that, before the law of 
 Moses, all sacrifices, even those of atonement, were wholly burnt, and 
 therefore were so called. They thought they had spoken wonderfully
 well, and that God was beholden to them for pleading his cause and owed 
 them a good reward for it; but they are told that, on the contrary, he 
 is displeased with them, requires from them a sacrifice, and threatens 
 that, otherwise, he will deal with them after their folly. God is often 
 angry at that in us which we are ourselves proud of and sees much amiss 
 in that which we think was done well. 

 (4.) He orders them to go to Job, and beg of him to offer their 
 sacrifices, and pray for them, otherwise they should not be accepted. 
 By this God designed,

 [1.] To humble them and lay them low. They thought that they only were 
 the favourites of Heaven, and that Job had no interest there; but God 
 gives them to understand that he had a better interest there than they 
 had, and stood fairer for God's acceptance than they did. The day may 
 come when those who despise and censure God's people will court their 
 favour, and be <I>made to know that God has loved them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9">Rev. iii. 9</A>.
 
 The foolish virgins will beg oil of the wise. 

 [2.] To oblige them to make their peace with Job, as the condition of 
 their making their peace with God. <I>If thy brother has aught against 
 thee</I> (as Job had a great deal against them), <I>first be reconciled 
 to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift.</I> Satisfaction must 
 first be made for wrong done, according as the nature of the thing 
 requires, before we can hope to obtain from God the forgiveness of sin. 
 See how thoroughly God espoused the cause of his servant Job and 
 engaged in it. God will not be reconciled to those that have offended
 Job till they have first begged his pardon and he be reconciled to 
 them. Job and his friends had differed in their opinion about many 
 things, and had been too keen in their reflections one upon another, 
 but now they were to be made friends; in order to that, they are not to 
 argue the matter over again and try to give it a new turn (that might 
 be endless), but they must agree in a sacrifice and a prayer, and that 
 must reconcile them: they must unite in affection and devotion when 
 they could not concur in the same sentiments. Those who differ in 
 judgments about minor things are yet one in Christ the great sacrifice, 
 and meet at the same throne of grace, and therefore ought to love and 
 bear with one another. Once more, observe, When God was angry with 
 Job's friends, he did himself put them in a way to make their peace 
 with him. Our quarrels with God always begin on our part, but the 
 reconciliation begins on his.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The acquiescence of Job's friends in this judgment given, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 They were good men, and, as soon as they understood what the mind of
 the Lord was, they did as he commanded them, and that speedily and 
 without gainsaying, though it was against the grain to flesh and blood 
 to court him thus whom they had condemned. Note, Those who would be 
 reconciled to God must carefully use the prescribed means and methods 
 of reconciliation. Peace with God is to be had only in his own way and 
 upon his own terms, and they will never seem hard to those who know how 
 to value the privilege, but they will be glad of it upon any terms, 
 though ever so humbling. Job's friends had all joined in accusing Job, 
 and now they join in begging his pardon. Those that have sinned 
 together should repent together. Those that appeal to God, as both Job 
 and his friends had often done, must resolve to stand by his award, 
 whether pleasing or unpleasing to their own mind. And those that 
 conscientiously observe God's commands need not doubt of his favour: 
 <I>The Lord also accepted Job,</I> and his friends in answer to his 
 prayer. It is not said, He accepted <I>them</I> (though that is 
 implied), but, He accepted <I>Job</I> for them; so he has <I>made us 
 accepted in the beloved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:6,Mt+3:17">Eph. i. 6; Matt. iii. 17</A>.

 Job did not insult over his friends upon the testimony God had given
 concerning him, and the submission they were obliged to make to him; 
 but, God being graciously reconciled to him, he was easily reconciled 
 to them, and then God accepted him. This is that which we should aim
 at in all our prayers and services, to be accepted of the Lord; this 
 must be the summit of our ambition, not to have praise of men, but to 
 please God.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for
 his friends: also the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> gave Job twice as much as he had
 before.
 &nbsp; 11  Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his

 and comforted him over all the evil that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> had brought
 upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one

 &nbsp; 12  So the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> blessed the latter end of Job more than his

 &nbsp; 15  And in all the land were no women found <I>so</I> fair as the
 daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among
 their brethren.
 &nbsp; 16  After this lived Job a hundred and forty years, and saw his
 sons, and his sons' sons, <I>even</I> four generations.
 &nbsp; 17  So Job died, <I>being</I> old and full of days.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>You have heard of the patience of Job</I> (says the apostle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:11">Jam. v. 11</A>)

 <I>and have seen the end of the Lord,</I> that is, what end the Lord,
 at length, put to his troubles. In the beginning of this book we had 
 Job's patience under his troubles, for an example; here, in the close, 
 for our encouragement to follow that example, we have the happy issue 
 of his troubles and the prosperous condition to which he was restored 
 after them, which confirms us in counting those happy which endure. 
 Perhaps, too, the extraordinary prosperity which Job was crowned with 
 after his afflictions was intended to be to us Christians a type and 
 figure of the glory and happiness of heaven, which the afflictions of 
 this present time are working for us, and in which they will issue at 
 last; this will be more than double to all the delights and 
 satisfactions we now enjoy, as Job's after-prosperity was to his 
 former, though then he was the greatest of all the men of the east. He 
 that rightly endures temptation, when he is tried, shall receive a 
 <I>crown of life</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:12">Jam. i. 12</A>),

 as Job, when he was tried, received all the wealth, and honour, and
 comfort, which here we have an account of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God returned in ways of mercy to him; and his thoughts concerning 
 him <I>were thoughts of good and not of evil, to give the expected</I> 
 (nay, the <I>unexpected</I>) <I>end,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:11">Jer. xxix. 11</A>.

 His troubles began in Satan's malice, which God restrained; his
 restoration began in God's mercy, which Satan could not oppose. Job's 
 sorest complaint, and indeed the sorrowful accent of all his 
 complaints, on which he laid the greatest emphasis, was that God 
 appeared against him. But now God plainly appeared for him, and 
 <I>watched over him to build and to plant, like as he had</I> (at least 
 in his apprehension) <I>watched over him to pluck up and to throw 
 down,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:28">Jer. xxxi. 28</A>.

 This put a new face upon his affairs immediately, and every thing now
 looked as pleasing and promising as before it had looked gloomy and 
 frightful.

 1. God <I>turned his captivity,</I> that is, he redressed his
 grievances and took away all the causes of his complaints; he loosed 
 him from the bond with which Satan had now, for a great while, bound 
 him, and delivered him out of those cruel hands into which he had 
 delivered him. We may suppose that now all his bodily pains and
 distempers were healed so suddenly and so thoroughly that the cure was 
 next to miraculous: <I>His flesh became fresher than a child's, and he 
 returned to the days of his youth;</I> and, what was more, he felt a 
 very great alteration in his mind; it was calm and easy, and the tumult 
 was all over, his disquieting thoughts had all vanished, his fears were 
 silenced, and the consolations of God were now as much the delight of 
 his soul as his terrors had been its burden. The tide thus turned, his 
 troubles began to ebb as fast as they had flowed, just then <I>when he 
 was praying for his friends,</I> praying over his sacrifice which he 
 offered for them. Mercy did not return when he was disputing with his
 friends, no, not though he had right on his side, but when he was 
 praying for them; for God is better served and pleased with our warm 
 devotions than with our warm disputations. When Job completed his 
 repentance by this instance of his <I>forgiving men their 
 trespasses,</I> then God completed his remission by turning his 
 captivity. Note, We are really doing our business when we are praying 
 for our friends, if we pray in a right manner, for in those prayers 
 there is not only faith, but love. Christ has taught us to pray with 
 and for others in teaching us to say, <I>Our Father;</I> and, in 
 seeking mercy for others, we may find mercy ourselves. Our Lord Jesus 
 has his exaltation and dominion there, where he <I>ever lives making 
 intercession.</I> Some, by the turning of Job's captivity, understand 
 the restitution which the Sabeans and Chaldeans made of the cattle 
 which they had taken from him, God wonderfully inclining them to do it; 
 and with these he began the world again. Probably it was so; those
 spoilers had <I>swallowed down his riches,</I> but they were forced to 
 <I>vomit them up again,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:15"><I>ch.</I> xx. 15</A>.

 But I rather understand this more generally of the turn now given.

 2. God doubled his possessions: <I>Also the Lord gave Job twice as much
 as he had before.</I> It is probable that he did at first, in some way 
 or other, intimate to him that it was his gracious purpose, by degrees, 
 in due time to bring him to such a height of prosperity that he should 
 have twice as much as ever he had, for the encouraging of his hope and 
 the quickening of his industry, and that it might appear that this 
 wonderful increase was a special token of God's favour. And it may be 
 considered as intended, 

 (1.) To balance his losses. He suffered for the glory of God, and 
 therefore God made it up to him with advantage, and allowed him more 
 than interest upon interest. God will take care that none shall lose by 
 him. 

 (2.) To recompense his patience and his confidence in God, which 
 (notwithstanding the workings of corruption) he did not cast away, but 
 still held fast, and that is it which has <I>a great recompence of 
 reward,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:35">Heb. x. 35</A>.

 Job's friends had often put their severe censure of Job upon this
 issue, <I>If thou wert pure and upright, surely now he would awake for 
 thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:6"><I>ch.</I> viii. 6</A>.

 But he does not awake for thee; therefore thou art not upright. "Well,"
 says God, "though your argument be not conclusive, I will even by that 
 demonstrate the integrity of my servant Job; his latter end shall 
 greatly increase, and by that it shall appear, since you will have it 
 so, that it was not for any injustice in his hands that he suffered the 
 loss of all things." Now it appeared that Job had reason to bless God 
 for taking away (as he did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:21"><I>ch.</I> i. 21</A>),

 since it made so good a return.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His old acquaintance, neighbours, and relations, were very kind to 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They had been estranged from him, and this was not the least of the 
 grievances of his afflicted state; he bitterly complained of their 
 unkindness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:13-22"><I>ch.</I> xix. 13</A>,

 &c. But now they visited him with all possible expressions of affection
 and respect. 

 1. They put honour upon him, in coming to dine with him as formerly,
 but (we may suppose) privately bringing their entertainment along with 
 them, so that he had the reputation of feasting them without the 
 expense. 

 2. They sympathized with him, and showed a tender concern for him, such 
 as becomes brethren. They bemoaned him when they talked over all the 
 calamities of his afflicted state, and comforted him when they took 
 notice of God's gracious returns to him. They wept for his griefs, and 
 rejoiced in his joys, and proved not such miserable comforters as his 
 three friends, that, at first, were so forward and officious to attend 
 him. These were not such great men nor such learned and eloquent men as 
 those, but they proved much more skilful and kind in comforting Job.
 God sometimes chooses the foolish and weak things of the world, as for 
 conviction, so for comfort. 

 3. They made a collection among them for the repair of his losses and
 the setting of him up again. They did not think it enough to say, <I>Be
 warmed, Be filled,</I> but gave him such things as would be of use to
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:16">Jam. ii. 16</A>.

 <I>Every one gave him a piece of money</I> (some more, it is likely,
 and some less, according to their ability) <I>and every one an ear-ring 
 of gold</I> (an ornament much used by the children of the east), which 
 would be as good as money to him: this was a superfluity which they 
 could well spare, and the rule is, That our abundance must be a supply 
 to our brethren's necessity. But why did Job's relations now, at 
 length, show this kindness to him?

 (1.) God put it in their hearts to do so; and every creature is that to 
 us which he makes it to be. Job had acknowledged God in their 
 estrangement from him, for which he now rewarded him in turning them to 
 him again. 

 (2.) Perhaps some of them withdrew from him because they thought him a 
 hypocrite, but, now that his integrity was made manifest, they returned 
 to him and to communion with him again. When God was friendly to him
 they were all willing to be friendly too, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:74,79">Ps. cxix. 74, 79</A>.

 Others of them, it may be, withdrew because he was poor, and sore, and
 a rueful spectacle, but now that he began to recover they were willing 
 to renew their acquaintance with him. Swallow-friends, that are gone
 in winter, will return in the spring, though their friendship is of 
 little value.

 (3.) Perhaps the rebuke which God had given to Eliphaz and the other 
 two for their unkindness to Job awakened the rest of his friends to 
 return to their duty. Reproofs to others we should thus take as
 admonitions and instructions to us. 

 4. Job <I>prayed for his friends,</I> and then they flocked about him, 
 overcome by his kindness, and every one desiring an interest in his 
 prayers. The more we pray for our friends and relations the more 
 comfort we may expect in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His estate strangely increased, by the blessing of God upon the 
 little that his friends gave him. He thankfully received their 
 courtesy, and did not think it below him to have his estate repaired by 
 contributions. He did not, on the one hand, urge his friends to raise 
 money for him; he acquits himself from that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:22"><I>ch.</I> vi. 22</A>),

 <I>Did I say, Bring unto me or give me a reward of your substance?</I>
 Yet what they brought he thankfully accepted, and did not upbraid them 
 with their former unkindnesses, nor ask them why they did not do this 
 sooner. He was neither so covetous and griping as to ask their charity, 
 nor so proud and ill-natured as to refuse it when they offered it; and, 
 being in so good a temper, God gave him that which was far better than 
 their money and ear-rings, and that was his blessing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The Lord comforted him now according to the days wherein he had 
 afflicted him, and <I>blessed his latter end more than his 
 beginning.</I> Observe,

 1. <I>The blessing of the Lord makes rich;</I> it is he that gives us
 power to get wealth and gives success in honest endeavours. Those 
 therefore that would thrive must have an eye to God's blessing, and 
 never to out of it, no, not into the warm sun; and those that have 
 thriven must not sacrifice to their own net, but acknowledge their 
 obligations to God for his blessing. 

 2. That blessing can make very rich and sometimes makes good people so. 
 Those that become rich by getting think they can easily make themselves 
 very rich by saving; but, as those that have little must depend upon 
 God to make it much, so those that have much must depend upon God to 
 make it more and to double it; else <I>you have sown much and bring in 
 little,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:6">Hag. i. 6</A>.

 3. The last days of a good man sometimes prove his best days, his last
 works his best works, his last comforts his best comforts; for his 
 path, like that of the morning-light, shines more and more to the 
 perfect day. Of a wicked man it is said, <I>His last state is worse 
 than his first</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:26">Luke xi. 26</A>),

 but of the upright man, <I>His end is peace;</I> and sometimes the
 nearer it is the clearer are the views of it. In respect of outward 
 prosperity God is pleased sometimes to make the latter end of a good 
 man's life more comfortable than the former part of it has been, and 
 strangely to outdo the expectations of his afflicted people, who 
 thought they should never live to see better days, that we may not 
 despair even in the depths of adversity. We know not what good times we 
 may yet be reserved for in our latter end. <I>Non, si male nunc, et
 olim sic erit--It may yet be well with us, though now it is 
 otherwise.</I> Job, in his affliction, had wished to be <I>as in months 
 past,</I> as rich as he had been before, and quite despaired of that; 
 but God is often better to us than our own fears, nay, than our own 
 wishes, for Job's possessions were doubled to him; the number of his 
 cattle, his sheep and camels, his oxen and she-asses, is just double 
 here to what it was,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:3"><I>ch.</I> i. 3</A>.

 This is a remarkable instance of the extent of the divine providence to
 things that seem minute, as this of the exact number of a man's cattle, 
 as also of the harmony of providence, and the reference of one event to 
 another; for <I>known unto God are all his works, from the beginning to 
 the end.</I> Job's other possessions, no doubt, were increased in 
 proportion to his cattle, lands, money, servants, &c. So that if, 
 before, he was the greatest of all the men of the east, what was he 
 now?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His family was built up again, and he had great comfort in his 
 children, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:13-15"><I>v.</I> 13-15</A>.
 
 The last of his afflictions that are recorded
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:13-19"><I>ch.</I> i.</A>),

 and the most grievous, was the death of all his children at once. His
 friends upbraided him with it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:4"><I>ch.</I> viii. 4</A>),

 but God repaired even that breach in process of time, either by the
 same wife, or, she being dead, by another. 

 1. The number of his children was the same as before, <I>seven sons and
 three daughters.</I> Some give this reason why they were not doubled as 
 his cattle were, because his children that were dead were not lost, but 
 gone before to a better world; and therefore, if he have but the same 
 number of them, they may be reckoned doubled, for he has two fleeces of 
 children (as I may say) <I>mahanaim--two hosts,</I> one in heaven, the 
 other on earth, and in both he is rich.

 2. The names of his daughters are here registered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 because, in the significations of them, they seemed designed to 
 perpetuate the remembrance of God's great goodness to him in the 
 surprising change of his condition. He called the first <I>Jemima--The 
 day</I> (whence perhaps <I>Diana</I> had her name), because of the 
 shining forth of his prosperity after a dark night of affliction. The 
 next <I>Kezia,</I> a spice of a very fragrant smell, because (says 
 bishop Patrick) God had healed his ulcers, the smell of which was 
 offensive. The third <I>Keren-happuch</I> (that is <I>Plenty 
 restored,</I> or <I>A horn of paint</I>), because (says he) God had
 wiped away the tears which fouled his face,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:16"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 16</A>.

 Concerning these daughters we are here told, 

 (1.) That God adorned them with great beauty, <I>no women so fair as 
 the daughters of Job,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 In the Old Testament we often find women praised for their beauty, as 
 Sarah, Rebekah, and many others; but we never find any women in the New 
 Testament whose beauty is in the least taken notice of, no, not the 
 virgin Mary herself, because the beauty of holiness is that which is 
 brought to a much clearer light by the gospel.

 (2.) That their father (God enabling him to do it) supplied them with
 great fortunes: <I>He gave them inheritance among their brethren,</I> 
 and did not turn them off with small portions, as most did. It is 
 probable that they had some extraordinary personal merit, which Job had 
 an eye to in the extraordinary favour he showed them. Perhaps they
 excelled their brethren in wisdom and piety; and therefore, that they 
 might continue in his family, to be a stay and blessing to it, he made 
 them co-heirs with their brethren.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. His life was long. What age he was when his troubles came we are 
 nowhere told, but here we are told he lived 140 years, whence some 
 conjecture that he was 70 when he was in his troubles, and that so his 
 age was doubled, as his other possessions. 

 1. He lived to have much of the comfort of this life, for he saw his
 posterity to the fourth generation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Though his children were not doubled to him, yet in his children's 
 children (and those are the crown of old men) they were more than 
 doubled. As God appointed to Adam another seed instead of that which 
 was slain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:25">Gen. iv. 25</A>),

 so he did to Job with advantage. God has ways to repair the losses and
 balance the griefs of those who are written childless, as Job was when 
 he had buried all his children.

 2. He lived till he was satisfied, for he died full of days, satisfied
 with living in this world, and willing to leave it; not peevishly so, 
 as in the days of his affliction, but piously so, and thus, as Eliphaz 
 had encouraged him to hope, he <I>came to his grave like a shock of 
 corn in his season.</I></P>
