 Solomon, having foretold the destruction of those who are obstinate in 
 their impiety, in this chapter applies himself to those who are willing 
 to be taught; and, 

 I. He shows them that, if they would diligently use the means of
 knowledge and grace, they should obtain of God the knowledge and grace 
 which they seek, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. He shows them of what unspeakable advantage it would be to them.

 1. It would preserve them from the snares of evil men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:10-15">ver. 10-15</A>)

 and of evil women, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:16-19">ver. 16-19</A>.

 2. It would direct them into, and keep them in, the way of good men,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:20-22">ver. 20-22</A>.

 So that in this chapter we are taught both how to get wisdom and how to 
 use it when we have it, that we may neither seek it, nor receive it in 
 vain.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my
 commandments with thee;
 &nbsp; 2  So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, <I>and</I> apply thine
 heart to understanding;
 &nbsp; 3  Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, <I>and</I> liftest up thy
 voice for understanding;
 &nbsp; 4  If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as <I>for</I>
 hid treasures;
 &nbsp; 5  Then shalt thou understand the fear of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and find the
 knowledge of God.
 &nbsp; 6  For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> giveth wisdom: out of his mouth <I>cometh</I>
 knowledge and understanding.
 &nbsp; 7  He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: <I>he is</I> a
 buckler to them that walk uprightly.
 &nbsp; 8  He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of
 his saints.
 &nbsp; 9  Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and
 equity; <I>yea,</I> every good path.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job had asked, long before this, <I>Where shall wisdom be found? Whence 
 cometh wisdom?</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:12,20">Job xxviii. 12, 20</A>)

 and he had given this general answer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 <I>God knoweth the place</I> of it; but Solomon here goes further, and 
 tells us both where we may find it and how we may get it. We are here
 told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What means we must use that we may obtain wisdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We must closely attend to the word of God, for that is the word of 
 wisdom, <I>which is able to make us wise unto salvation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 
 (1.) We must be convinced that the words of God are the fountain and 
 standard of wisdom and understanding, and that we need not desire to be 
 wiser than they will make us. We must <I>incline our ear</I> and 
 <I>apply our hearts</I> to them, as to <I>wisdom</I> or 
 <I>understanding</I> itself. Many wise things may be found in human 
 compositions, but divine revelation, and true religion built upon it, 
 are all wisdom. 

 (2.) We must, accordingly, receive the word of God with all readiness 
 of mind, and bid it welcome, even the commandments as well as the 
 promises, without murmuring or disputing. <I>Speak, Lord, for thy 
 servant hears.</I> 

 (3.) We must hide them with us, as we do our treasures, which we are 
 afraid of being robbed of. We must not only receive, but retain, the 
 word of God, and lodge it in our hearts, that it may be always ready to 
 us. 

 (4.) We must incline our ear to them; we must lay hold on all 
 opportunities of hearing the word of God, and listen to it with 
 attention and seriousness, as those that are afraid of letting it slip.
 
 (5.) We must apply our hearts to them, else inclining the ear to them
 will stand us in no stead.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We must be much in prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 We must <I>cry after knowledge,</I> as one that is ready to perish for
 hunger begs hard for bread. Faint desires will not prevail; we must be 
 importunate, as those that know the worth of knowledge and our own want 
 of it. We must cry, as new-born babes, after <I>the sincere milk of the 
 word.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:2">1 Pet. ii. 2</A>.

 We must <I>lift our voice for understanding</I> lift it up to heaven; 
 thence these good and perfect gifts must be expected, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:17,Job+38:34">Jam. i. 17; Job xxxviii. 34</A>.

 We must <I>give our voice to understanding</I> (so the word is), speak 
 for it, vote for it, submit the tongue to the command of wisdom. We
 must consecrate our voice to it; having applied our heart to it, we 
 must employ our voice in seeking for it. Solomon could write 
 <I>probatum est--a tried remedy,</I> upon this method; he prayed for 
 wisdom and so obtained it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We must be willing to take pains 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 we must <I>seek it as silver,</I> preferring it far before all the 
 wealth of this world, and labouring in search of it as those who dig in 
 the mines, who undergo great toil and run great hazards, with 
 indefatigable industry and invincible constancy and resolution, in 
 pursuit of the ore; or as those who will be rich rise up early, and sit 
 up late, and turn every stone to get money and fill their treasures. 
 Thus diligent must we be in the use of the means of knowledge, 
 following on to know the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What success we may hope for in the use of these means. Our labour 
 shall not be in vain; for, 

 1. We shall know how to maintain our acquaintance and communion with
 God: "<I>Thou shalt understand the fear of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 that is, thou shalt know how to worship him aright, shalt be led into 
 the meaning and mystery of every ordinance, and be enabled to answer 
 the end of its institution." <I>Thou shalt find the knowledge of 
 God,</I> which is necessary to our fearing him aright. It concerns us 
 to understand how much it is our interest to know God, and to evidence 
 it by agreeable affections towards him and adorations of him. 

 2. We shall know how to conduct ourselves aright towards all men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou shalt understand,</I> by the word of God, <I>righteousness, 
 and judgment, and equity,</I> shalt learn those principles of justice, 
 and charity, and fair dealing, which shall guide and govern thee in the 
 whole course of thy conversation, shall make thee fit for every 
 relation, every business, and faithful to every trust. It shall give 
 thee not only a right notion of justice, but a disposition to practise 
 it, and to render to all their due; for those that do not do justly do 
 not rightly understand it." This will lead them in <I>every good 
 path,</I> for the scripture will <I>make the man of God perfect.</I> 
 Note, Those have the best knowledge who know their duty, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:10">Ps. cxi. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What ground we have to hope for this success in our pursuits of 
 wisdom; we must take our encouragement herein from God only, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God has wisdom to bestow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 <I>The Lord</I> not only is wise himself, but he <I>gives wisdom,</I> 
 and that is more than the wisest men in the world can do, for it is 
 God's prerogative to open the understanding. All the wisdom that is in 
 any creature is his gift, his free gift, and he gives it liberally 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:5">Jam. i. 5</A>),

 has given it to many, and is still giving it; to him therefore let us 
 apply for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He has blessed the world with a revelation of his will. <I>Out of 
 his mouth,</I> by the law and the prophets, by the written word and by 
 his ministers, both which are his mouth to the children of men, <I>come 
 knowledge and understanding,</I> such a discovery of truth and good as, 
 if we admit and receive the impressions of it, will make us truly 
 knowing and intelligent. It is both an engagement and encouragement to 
 search after wisdom that we have the scriptures to search, in which we 
 may find it if we seek it diligently.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He has particularly provided that good men, who are sincerely 
 disposed to do his will, shall have that <I>knowledge and</I> that 
 <I>understanding</I> which are necessary for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>.

 Let them seek wisdom, and they shall find it; let them ask, and it 
 shall be given them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.
 
 Observe here,

 (1.) Who those are that are thus favoured. They are <I>the 
 righteous,</I> on whom the image of God is renewed, which consists in 
 righteousness, and those who <I>walk uprightly,</I> who are honest in 
 their dealings both with God and man and make conscience of doing their 
 duty as far as they know it. They are <I>his saints,</I> devoted to his 
 honour, and set apart for his service. 

 (2.) What it is that is provided for them.

 [1.] Instruction. The means of wisdom are given to all, but wisdom
 itself, <I>sound wisdom,</I> is laid <I>up for the righteous,</I> laid 
 up in Christ their head, in whom <I>are hidden all the treasures of 
 wisdom and knowledge,</I> and who <I>is made of God to us wisdom.</I> 
 The same that is the Spirit of revelation in the word is a Spirit of 
 wisdom in the souls of those that are sanctified, that wisdom of the 
 prudent which is to understand his way; and it is sound wisdom, its 
 foundations firm, its principles solid, and its products of lasting 
 advantage. 

 [2.] Satisfaction. Some read it, He <I>lays up substance for the 
 righteous,</I> not only substantial knowledge, but substantial 
 happiness and comfort, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:21">Prov. viii. 21</A>.

 Riches are things that are not, and those that have them only fancy 
 themselves happy; but what is laid up in the promises and in heaven for 
 the righteous will make them truly, thoroughly, and eternally happy.

 [3.] Protection. Even those who <I>walk uprightly</I> may be brought 
 into danger for the trial of their faith, but God is, and will be, <I>a 
 buckler to them,</I> so that nothing that happens to them shall do them 
 any real hurt, or possess them with any terrific apprehensions; they 
 are safe, and they shall think themselves so. <I>Fear not, Abraham; I 
 am thy shield.</I> It is their way, the paths of judgment in which they 
 walk, that the Lord knows, and owns, and takes care of. 

 [4.] Grace to persevere to the end. If we depend upon God, and seek to
 him for wisdom, he will uphold us in our integrity, will enable us to 
 <I>keep the paths of judgment,</I> however we may be tempted to turn 
 aside out of them; for he <I>preserves the way of his saints,</I> that 
 it be not perverted, and so preserves them in it safe and blameless to 
 his heavenly kingdom. The assurances God has given us of his grace, if 
 duly improved, will excite and quicken our endeavours in doing our 
 duty. <I>Work out your salvation,</I> for <I>God works in you.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is
 pleasant unto thy soul;
 &nbsp; 11  Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep
 thee:
 &nbsp; 12  To deliver thee from the way of the evil <I>man,</I> from the man
 that speaketh froward things;
 &nbsp; 13  Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of
 darkness;
 &nbsp; 14  Who rejoice to do evil, <I>and</I> delight in the frowardness of
 the wicked;
 &nbsp; 15  Whose ways <I>are</I> crooked, and <I>they</I> froward in their paths:
 &nbsp; 16  To deliver thee from the strange woman, <I>even</I> from the
 stranger <I>which</I> flattereth with her words;
 &nbsp; 17  Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the
 covenant of her God.
 &nbsp; 18  For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the
 dead.
 &nbsp; 19  None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold
 of the paths of life.
 &nbsp; 20  That thou mayest walk in the way of good <I>men,</I> and keep the
 paths of the righteous.
 &nbsp; 21  For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect
 shall remain in it.
 &nbsp; 22  But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the
 transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of these verses is to show, 

 1. What great advantage true wisdom will be of to us; it will keep us
 from the paths of sin, which lead to ruin, and will therein do us a 
 greater kindness than if it enriched us with all the wealth of the 
 world.

 2. What good use we should make of the wisdom God gives us; we must
 use it for our own guidance in the paths of virtue, and for the arming 
 of us against temptations of every kind. 

 3. By what rules we may try ourselves whether we have this wisdom or
 no. This tree will be known by its fruits; if we be truly wise, it
 will appear by our care to avoid all evil company and evil 
 practices.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This wisdom will be of use to us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. For our preservation from evil, from the evil of sin, and, 
 consequently, from the evil of trouble that attends it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>),

 "When wisdom has entire possession of thee, it will <I>keep thee.</I>" 
 And when has it an entire possession of us?

 (1.) When it has dominion over us. When it not only fills the head with 
 notions, but <I>enters into the heart</I> and has a commanding power 
 and influence upon that,--when it is upon the throne there, and gives
 law to the affections and passions,--when it <I>enters into the
 heart</I> as the leaven into the dough, to diffuse its relish there, 
 and to change it into its own image--then it is likely to do us good.
 
 (2.) When we have delight in it, when knowledge becomes <I>pleasant to 
 the soul:</I> "When thou beginnest to relish it as the most agreeable 
 entertainment, and art subject to its rules, of choice, and with 
 satisfaction,--when thou callest the practice of virtue, not a slavery
 and a task, but <I>liberty</I> and <I>pleasure,</I> and a life of 
 serious godliness the most comfortable life a man can live in this 
 world,--then thou wilt find the benefit of it." Though its restraints
 should be in some respects unpleasant to the body, yet even those must 
 be pleasant to the soul. When it has come to this, with us, 
 <I>discretion shall preserve</I> us and keep us. God keeps <I>the way 
 of his saints</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 by giving them discretion to keep out of harm's way, to keep themselves 
 that the wicked one touch them not. Note, A principle of grace
 reigning in the heart will be a powerful preservative both against 
 corruptions within and temptations without, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:16,18">Eccl. ix. 16, 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. More particularly, wisdom will preserve us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) From men of corrupt principles, atheistical profane men, who make 
 it their business to debauch young men's judgments, and instil into 
 their minds prejudices against religion and arguments for vice: "It 
 will <I>deliver thee from the way of the evil man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and a blessed deliverance it will be, as from the very jaws of death, 
 <I>from the way</I> in which he walks, and in which he would persuade 
 thee to walk." The enemy is spoken of as one 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 an <I>evil man,</I> but afterwards as many 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 there is a club, a gang of them, that are in confederacy against 
 religion, and join hand in hand for the support of the devil's kingdom 
 and the interests of it.

 [1.] They have a spirit of contradiction to that which is good: They 
 <I>speak froward things;</I> they say all they can against religion, 
 both to show their own enmity to it and to dissuade others from it. 
 They are advocates for Satan; they plead for Baal, and <I>pervert the 
 right ways of the Lord.</I> How peevishly will profane wits argue for 
 sin, and with what frowardness will they carp at the word of God! 
 Wisdom will keep us either from conversing with such men or at least 
 from being ensnared by them. 

 [2.] They are themselves apostates from that which is good, and such 
 are commonly the most malicious and dangerous enemies religion has, 
 witness Julian 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>They leave the paths of uprightness,</I> which they were trained up 
 in and had set out in, shake off the influences of their education, and 
 break off the thread of their hopeful beginnings, <I>to walk in the 
 ways of darkness,</I> in those wicked ways which hate the light, in 
 which men are led blindfold by ignorance and error, and which lead men 
 into utter darkness. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, 
 uncomfortable and unsafe; what fools are those that leave the plain, 
 pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in those ways! 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:5,1Jo+2:11">Ps. lxxxii. 5; 1 John ii. 11</A>.

 [3.] They take a pleasure in sin, both in committing it themselves and 
 in seeing others commit it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 They <I>rejoice</I> in an opportunity <I>to do evil,</I> and in the 
 accomplishment and success of any wicked project. It is sport to fools 
 to do mischief; nor is any sight more grateful to them than to see 
 <I>the frowardness of the wicked,</I> to see those that are hopeful 
 drawn into the ways of sin, and then to see them hardened and confirmed 
 in those ways. They are pleased if they can discern that the devil's 
 kingdom gets ground (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:32">Rom. i. 32</A>),

 such a height of impiety have they arrived at.

 [4.] They are resolute in sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 Their <I>ways are crooked,</I> a great many windings and turnings to 
 escape the pursuit of their convictions and break the force of them; 
 some sly excuse, some subtle evasion or other, their deceitful hearts 
 furnish them with, for the strengthening of their hands in their 
 wickedness; and in the crooked mazes of that labyrinth they secure 
 themselves from the arrests of God's word and their own consciences; 
 for they are <I>froward in their paths,</I> that is, they are resolved 
 to go on in them, whatever is said against it. Every wise man will
 shun the company of such as these.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) From women of corrupt practices. The former lead to spiritual 
 wickednesses, the lusts of the unsanctified mind; these lead to 
 <I>fleshly lusts,</I> which defile the body, that living temple, but 
 withal <I>war against the soul.</I> The adulteress is here called 
 <I>the strange woman,</I> because no man that has any wisdom or 
 goodness in him will have any acquaintance with her; she is to be 
 shunned by every Israelite as if she were a heathen, and a stranger to 
 that sacred commonwealth. A strange woman indeed! utterly estranged 
 from all principles of reason, virtue, and honour. It is a great mercy 
 to be delivered from the allurements of the adulteress, considering, 
 
 [1.] How false she is. Who will have any dealings with those that are 
 made up of treachery? She is a strange woman; for, <I>First,</I> She is 
 false to him whom she entices. She speaks fair, tells him how much she 
 admires him above any man, and what a kindness she has for him; but she 
 <I>flatters with her words;</I> she has no true affection for him, nor 
 any desire of his welfare, any more than Delilah had of Samson's. All 
 she designs is to pick his pocket and gratify a base lust of her own. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> She is false to her husband, and violates the sacred 
 obligation she lies under to him. He was <I>the guide of her youth;</I> 
 by marrying him she chose him to be so, and submitted herself to his 
 guidance, with a promise to attend him only, and forsake all others. 
 But she has <I>forsaken</I> him, and therefore it cannot be thought 
 that she should be faithful to any one else; and whoever entertains her 
 is partaker with her in her falsehood. <I>Thirdly,</I> She is false to 
 God himself: She <I>forgets the covenant of her God,</I> the 
 marriage-covenant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 to which God is not only a witness, but a party, for, he having 
 instituted the ordinance, both sides vow to him to be true to each 
 other. It is not her husband only that she sins against, but her God, 
 who <I>will judge whoremongers and adulterers</I> because they despise 
 the oath and break the covenant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+17:18,Mal+2:14">Ezek. xvii. 18; Mal. ii. 14</A>.

 [2.] How fatal it will prove to those that fall in league with her, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Take heed of the sin of 
 whoredom; for, <I>First,</I> The ruin of those who are guilty of it is 
 certain and unavoidable, if they do not repent. It is a sin that has a 
 direct tendency to the killing of the soul, the extinguishing of all 
 good affections and dispositions in it, and the exposing of it to the 
 wrath and curse of God and the sword of his justice. Those that live in 
 forbidden pleasures are dead while they live. Let discretion preserve 
 every man, not only from the evil woman, but from the evil house, for 
 the <I>house inclines to death;</I> it is in the road that leads 
 directly to eternal death; <I>and her paths unto Rephaim,</I> to the 
 <I>giants</I> (so some read it), the sinners of the old world, who, 
 living in luxury and excess of riot, were cut down out of time, and 
 their foundation was overthrown with a flood. Our Lord Jesus deters us 
 from sinful pleasures with the consideration of everlasting torments 
 which follow them. <I>Where the worm dies not, nor is the fire 
 quenched.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:28,29">Matt. v. 28, 29</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> Their repentance and recovery are extremely hazardous:
 <I>None,</I> or next to none, <I>that go unto her, return again.</I> It 
 is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil recover 
 themselves, so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the 
 deceitfulness of this sin. Having once lost their <I>hold of the paths
 of life,</I> they know not how to take hold of them again, but are 
 perfectly besotted and bewitched with those base lusts. Many learned 
 interpreters think that this caution against the <I>strange woman,</I> 
 besides the literal sense, is to be understood figuratively, as a 
 caution,

 1. Against idolatry, which is spiritual whoredom. Wisdom will keep
 thee from all familiarity with the worshippers of images, and all 
 inclination to join with them, which had for many ages been of such 
 pernicious consequence to Israel and proved so to Solomon himself. 

 2. Against the debauching of the intellectual powers and faculties of
 the soul by the lusts and appetites of the body. Wisdom will keep thee 
 from being captivated by the carnal mind, and from subjecting the 
 spirit to the dominion of the flesh, that notorious adulteress which 
 <I>forsakes its guide,</I> violates the <I>covenant of our God,</I> 
 which <I>inclines to death,</I> and which, when it has got an 
 undisturbed dominion, makes the case of the soul desperate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. This wisdom will be of use to guide and direct us in that which is 
 good 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>That thou mayest walk in the way of good men.</I> We must avoid the 
 way of the <I>evil man,</I> and the <I>strange woman,</I> in order that 
 we may walk in good ways; we must <I>cease to do evil,</I> in order 
 that we may <I>learn to do well.</I> Note, 

 1. There is a way which is peculiarly the way of good men, the way in
 which good men, as such, and as far as they have really been such, have 
 always walked. 

 2. It will be our wisdom to walk in that way, to ask for the good old 
 way and walk therein, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:16,Heb+6:12,12:1">Jer. vi. 16; Heb. vi. 12; xii. 1</A>.

 And we must not only walk in that way awhile, but we must keep it, keep 
 in it, and never turn aside out of it: <I>The paths of the 
 righteous</I> are the paths of life, which all that are wise, having 
 taken hold of, will keep their hold of. "That thou mayest imitate those 
 excellent persons, the patriarchs and prophets (so bishop Patrick 
 paraphrases it), and be preserved in <I>the paths of those 
 righteous</I> men who followed after them." We must not only choose our 
 way in general by the good examples of the saints, but must also take 
 directions from them in the choice of our particular paths; observe the 
 track, and go forth by the footsteps of the flock. Two reasons are
 here given why we should thus choose:--

 (1.) Because men's integrity will be their establishment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 It will be the establishment,

 [1.] Of their persons: <I>The upright shall dwell in the land,</I> 
 peaceably and quietly, as long as they live; and their uprightness will 
 contribute to it, as it settles their minds, guides their counsels, 
 gains them the good-will of their neighbours, and entitles them to 
 God's special favour. 

 [2.] Of their families: <I>The perfect,</I> in their posterity, 
 <I>shall remain in it.</I> They shall dwell and remain for ever in the 
 heavenly Canaan, of which the earthly one was but a type. 

 (2.) Because men's iniquity will be their destruction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 See what becomes of <I>the wicked,</I> who choose the way of <I>the 
 evil man;</I> they <I>shall be cut off,</I> not only from heaven 
 hereafter and all hopes of that, but <I>from the earth</I> now, on 
 which they set their affections, and in which they lay up their 
 treasure. They think to take root in it, but they and their families 
 <I>shall be rooted out of it,</I> in judgment to them, but in mercy to 
 the earth. There is a day coming which <I>shall leave them neither root 
 nor branch,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:1">Mal. iv. 1</A>.

 Let that wisdom then <I>enter into our hearts,</I> and be <I>pleasant 
 to our souls,</I> which will keep us out of a way that will end 
 thus.</P>
