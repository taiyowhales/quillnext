 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As the foregoing psalm was moral, and showed us our duty, so this is 
 evangelical, and shows us our Saviour. Under the type of David's 
 kingdom (which was of divine appointment, met with much opposition, but 
 prevailed at last) the kingdom of the Messiah, the Son of David, is
 prophesied of, which is the primary intention and scope of the psalm; 
 and I think there is less in it of the type, and more of the anti-type, 
 than in any of the gospel psalms, for there is nothing in it but what 
 is applicable to Christ, but some things that are not at all applicable 
 to David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>):

 "Thou art my Son" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:8">ver. 8</A>),

 "I will give thee the uttermost parts of the earth," and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:12">ver. 12</A>),

 "Kiss the Son." It is interpreted of Christ 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Acts+4:24,13:33,Heb+1:5">Acts iv. 24; xiii. 33; 
 Heb. i. 5</A>.
 
 The Holy Ghost here foretels,

 I. The opposition that should be given to the kingdom of the Messiah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. The baffling and chastising of that opposition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 III. The setting up of the kingdom of Christ, notwithstanding that
 opposition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6">ver. 6</A>.
 
 IV. The confirmation and establishment of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:7">ver. 7</A>.
 
 V. A promise of the enlargement and success of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.

 VI. A call and exhortation to kings and princes to yield themselves the 
 willing subjects of this kingdom,, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:10-12">ver. 10-12</A>.
 
 Or thus: We have here,

 I.  Threatenings denounced against the adversaries of Christ's kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1-6">ver.  1-6</A>.

 II. Promises made to Christ himself, the head of this kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 III. Counsel given to all to espouse the interests of this kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:10-12">ver. 10-12</A>.

 This psalm, as the former, is very fitly prefixed to this book of 
 devotions, because, as it is necessary to our acceptance with God that 
 we should be subject to the precepts of his law, so it is likewise that 
 we should be subject to the grace of his gospel, and come to him in the
 name of a Mediator.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
 &nbsp; 2  The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take
 counsel together, against the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and against his anointed,
 <I>saying,</I>
 &nbsp; 3  Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords
 from us.
 &nbsp; 4  He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall
 have them in derision.
 &nbsp; 5  Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in
 his sore displeasure.
 &nbsp; 6  Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a very great struggle about the kingdom of Christ, hell 
 and heaven contesting it; the seat of the war is this earth, where 
 Satan has long had a usurped kingdom and exercised dominion to such a 
 degree that he has been called <I>the prince of the power of the</I> 
 very <I>air</I> we breathe in and <I>the god of the world</I> we live 
 in. He knows very well that, as the Messiah's kingdom rises and gets 
 ground, his falls and loses ground; and therefore, though it will be 
 set up certainly, it shall not be set up tamely. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The mighty opposition that would be given to the Messiah and his 
 kingdom, to his holy religion and all the interests of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1-3"><I>v.</I> 1-3</A>.

 One would have expected that so great a blessing to this world would be
 universally welcomed and embraced, and that every sheaf would 
 immediately bow to that of the Messiah and all the crowns and sceptres 
 on earth would be laid at his feet; but it proves quite contrary. Never 
 were the notions of any sect of philosophers, though ever so absurd, 
 nor the powers of any prince or state, though ever so tyrannical, 
 opposed with so much violence as the doctrine and government of 
 Christ--a sign that it was from heaven, for the opposition was plainly 
 from hell originally.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We are here told who would appear as adversaries to Christ and the
 devil's instruments in this opposition to his kingdom. Princes and 
 people, court and country, have sometimes separate interests, but here 
 they are united against Christ; not the mighty only, but the mob, the 
 <I>heathen,</I> the <I>people,</I> numbers of them, communities of 
 them; though usually fond of liberty, yet they were averse to the 
 liberty Christ came to procure and proclaim. Not the mob only, but the 
 mighty (among whom one might have expected more sense and 
 consideration) appear violent against Christ. Though his kingdom is not 
 of this world, nor in the least calculated to weaken their interests, 
 but very likely, if they pleased, to strengthen them, yet the kings of 
 the earth and rulers are up in arms immediately. See the effects of the 
 old enmity in the seed of the serpent against the seed of the woman, 
 and how general and malignant the corruption of mankind is. See how 
 formidable the enemies of the church are; they are numerous; they are 
 potent. The unbelieving Jews are here called <I>heathen,</I> so 
 wretchedly had they degenerated from the faith and holiness of their 
 ancestors; they stirred up the heathen, the Gentiles, to persecute the 
 Christians. As the Philistines and their lords, Saul and his courtiers, 
 the disaffected party and their ringleaders, opposed David's coming to 
 the crown, so Herod and Pilate, the Gentiles and the Jews, did their 
 utmost against Christ and his interest in men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:27">Acts iv. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Who it is that they quarrel with, and muster up all their forces 
 against; it is <I>against the Lord and against his anointed,</I> that 
 is, against all religion in general and the Christian religion in 
 particular. It is certain that all who are enemies to Christ, whatever 
 they pretend, are enemies to God himself; they <I>have hated both me 
 and my Father,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:24">John xv. 24</A>.

 The great author of our holy religion is here called <I>the Lord's
 anointed,</I> or <I>Messiah,</I> or <I>Christ,</I> in allusion to the 
 anointing of David to be king. He is both authorized and qualified to 
 be the church's head and king, is duly invested in the office and every 
 way fitted for it; yet there are those that are against him; nay, 
 <I>therefore</I> they are against him, because they are impatient of 
 God's authority, envious at Christ's advancement, and have a rooted 
 enmity to the Spirit of holiness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The opposition they give is here described. 

 (1.) It is a most spiteful and malicious opposition. They <I>rage</I> 
 and fret; they gnash their teeth for vexation at the setting up of 
 Christ's kingdom; it creates them the utmost uneasiness, and fills them 
 with indignation, so that they have no enjoyment of themselves; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:14,Joh+11:47,Ac+5:17,33,19:28">Luke xiii. 14; 
 John xi. 47; Acts v. 17, 33; xix. 28</A>.

 Idolaters raged at the discovery of their folly, the chief priests and
 Pharisees at the eclipsing of their glory and the shaking of their 
 usurped dominion. Those that did evil raged at the light. 

 (2.) It is a deliberate and politic opposition. They <I>imagine</I> or 
 meditate, that is, they contrive means to suppress the rising interests 
 of Christ's kingdom and are very confident of the success of their 
 contrivances; they promise themselves that they shall run down religion 
 and carry the day. 

 (3.) It is a resolute and obstinate opposition. They <I>set 
 themselves,</I> set their faces as a flint and their hearts as an 
 adamant, in defiance of reason, and conscience, and all the terrors of 
 the Lord; they are proud and daring, like the Babel-builders, and will 
 persist in their resolution, come what will. 

 (4.) It is a combined and confederate opposition. They <I>take counsel 
 together,</I> to assist and animate one another in this opposition; 
 they carry their resolutions <I>nemine contradicente--unanimously,</I> 
 that they will push on the unholy war against the Messiah with the 
 utmost vigour: and thereupon councils are called, cabals are formed, 
 and all their wits are at work to find out ways and means for the 
 preventing of the establishment of Christ's kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:5">Ps.  lxxxiii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. We are here told what it is they are exasperated at and what they 
 aim at in this opposition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Let us break their bands asunder.</I> They will not be under any
 government; they are children of Belial, that cannot endure the yoke, 
 at least the yoke of the Lord and his anointed. They will be content to 
 entertain such notions of the kingdom of God and the Messiah as will 
 serve them to dispute of and to support their own dominion with: if the 
 Lord and his anointed will make them rich and great in the world, they 
 will bid them welcome; but if they will restrain their corrupt 
 appetites and passions, regulate and reform their hearts and lives, and 
 bring them under the government of a pure and heavenly religion, truly 
 then <I>they will not have this man to reign over them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:14">Luke xix. 14</A>.

 Christ has <I>bands and cords</I>
 for us; those that will be saved by him must be ruled by him; but they 
 are <I>cords of a man,</I> agreeable to right reason, and <I>bands of 
 love,</I> conducive to our true interest: and yet against those the 
 quarrel is. Why do men oppose religion but because they are impatient 
 of its restraints and obligations? They would break asunder the bands 
 of conscience they are under and the cords of God's commandments by 
 which they are called to tie themselves out from all sin and to 
 themselves up to all duty; they will not receive them, but cast them 
 away as far from them as they can.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They are here reasoned with concerning it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Why do they do this? 

 (1.) They can show no good cause for opposing so just, holy, and 
 gracious a government, which will not interfere with the secular 
 powers, nor introduce any dangerous principles hurtful to kings or 
 provinces; but, on the contrary, if universally received, would bring a 
 heaven upon earth. 

 (2.) They can hope for no good success in opposing so powerful a 
 kingdom, with which they are utterly unable to contend.  It is <I>a 
 vain thing;</I> when they have done their worst Christ will have a 
 church in the world and that church shall be glorious and triumphant. 
 It is <I>built upon a rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail 
 against it.</I> The moon walks in brightness, though the dogs bark at 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The mighty conquest gained over all this threatening opposition. If 
 heaven and earth be the combatants, it is easy to foretel which will be 
 the conqueror. Those that make this mighty struggle are the people of 
 the earth, and the kings of the earth, who, being of the earth, are 
 earthy; but he whom they contest with is one that <I>sits in the 
 heavens,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He is in the heaven, a place of such a vast prospect that he can 
 oversee them all and all their projects; and such is his power that he 
 can overcome them all and all their attempts. He sits there, as one 
 easy and at rest, out of the reach of all their impotent menaces and 
 attempts. There he sits as Judge in all the affairs of the children of 
 men, perfectly secure of the full accomplishment of all his own 
 purposes and designs, in spite of all opposition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+29:10">Ps. xxix. 10</A>.

 The perfect repose of the Eternal Mind may be our comfort under all the
 disquietments of our mind. We are tossed on earth, and in the sea, but 
 he sits in the heavens, where he has prepared his throne for judgment; 
 and therefore,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The attempts of Christ's enemies are easily ridiculed. God 
 <I>laughs</I> at them as a company of fools. He <I>has them,</I> and 
 all their attempts, <I>in derision,</I> and therefore <I>the virgin, 
 the daughter of Zion, has despised them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+37:22">Isa.  xxxvii. 22</A>.

 Sinners' follies are the just sport of God's infinite wisdom and power;
 and those attempts of the kingdom of Satan which in our eyes are 
 formidable in his are despicable. Sometimes God is said to 
 <I>awake,</I> and <I>arise,</I> and <I>stir up himself,</I> for the 
 vanquishing of his enemies; here is said to <I>sit still</I> and 
 vanquish them; for the utmost operations of God's omnipotence create no 
 difficulty at all, nor the least disturbance to his eternal rest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are justly punished, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Though God despises them as impotent, yet he does not therefore wink at
 them, but is justly displeased with them as impudent and impious, and 
 will make the most daring sinners to know that he is so and to tremble 
 before him. 

 (1.) Their sin is a provocation to him. He is wroth; he is sorely 
 displeased. We cannot expect that God should be reconciled to us, or 
 well pleased in us, but in and through the anointed; and therefore, if 
 we affront and reject him, we sin against the remedy and forfeit the 
 benefit of his interposition between us and God. 

 (2.) His anger will be a vexation to them; if he but speak to them in
 his wrath, even the breath of his mouth will be their confusion,
 slaughter, and consumption, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:4,2Th+2:8">Isa. xi. 4; 2 Thess. ii. 8</A>.

 He speaks, and it is done; he speaks in wrath, and sinners are undone.
 As a word made us, so a word can unmake us again. <I>Who knows the 
 power of his anger?</I> The enemies rage, but cannot vex God. God sits 
 still, and yet vexes them, puts them in to a consternation (as the word 
 is), and brings them to their wits' end: his setting up this kingdom of 
 his Son, in spite of them, is the greatest vexation to them that can 
 be. They were vexatious to Christ's good subjects; but the day is 
 coming when vexation shall be recompensed to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They are certainly defeated, and all their counsels turned headlong 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</I> David was
 advanced to the throne, and became master of the strong-hold of Zion, 
 notwithstanding the disturbance given him by the malcontents in his 
 kingdom, and particularly the affronts he received from the garrison of 
 Zion, who taunted him with their blind and their lame, their maimed 
 soldiers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:6">2 Sam. v. 6</A>.

 The Lord Jesus is exalted to the right hand of the Father, has all
 power both in heaven and in earth, and is head over all things to the 
 church, notwithstanding the restless endeavours of his enemies to 
 hinder his advancement. 

 (1.) Jesus Christ is a King, and is invested by him who is the fountain 
 of power with the dignity and authority of a sovereign prince in the 
 kingdom both of providence and grace. 

 (2.) God is pleased to call him <I>his</I> King, because he is 
 appointed by him, and entrusted for him with the sole administration of 
 government and judgment. He is his King, for he is dear to the Father, 
 and one in whom he is well pleased.  

 (3.) Christ took not this honour to himself, but was called to it, and 
 he that called him owns him: <I>I have set him;</I> his commandment, 
 his commission, he received from the Father.  

 (4.) Being called to this honour, he was confirmed in it; high places 
 (we say) are slippery places, but Christ, being raised, is fixed: "<I>I 
 have set him,</I> I have settled him." 

 (5.) He is set upon <I>Zion,</I> the hill of God's holiness, a type of 
 the gospel church, for on that the temple was built, for the sake of 
 which the whole mount was called <I>holy.</I> Christ's throne is set up 
 in his church, that is, in the hearts of all believers and in the 
 societies they form. The evangelical law of Christ is said to <I>go 
 forth from Zion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3,Mic+4:2">Isa. ii. 3, Mic. iv. 2</A>),

 and therefore that is spoken of as the head-quarters of this general,
 the royal seat of this prince, in whom the children of men shall be 
 joyful.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are to sing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1-6">these verses</A>

 with a holy exultation, triumphing over all the enemies of Christ's
 kingdom (not doubting but they will all of them be quickly made his 
 footstool), and triumphing in Jesus Christ as the great trustee of 
 power; and we are to pray, in firm belief of the assurance here given, 
 "Father in heaven, <I>Thy kingdom come;</I> let thy Son's kingdom 
 come."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have heard what the kings of the earth have to say against Christ's 
 kingdom, and have heard it gainsaid by him that sits in heaven; let us 
 now hear what the Messiah himself has to say for his kingdom, to make 
 good his claims, and it is what all the powers on earth cannot 
 gainsay.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The kingdom of the Messiah is founded upon a decree, an eternal 
 decree, of God the Father. It was not a sudden resolve, it was not the 
 trial of an experiment, but the result of the counsels of the divine 
 wisdom and the determinations of the divine will, before all worlds, 
 neither of which can be altered--the <I>precept</I> or <I>statute</I>
 (so some read it), the <I>covenant</I> or <I>compact</I> (so others),
 the federal transactions between the Father and the Son concerning 
 man's redemption, represented by the covenant of royalty made with 
 David and his seed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:3">Ps. lxxxix. 3</A>.

 This our Lord Jesus often referred to as that which, all along in his
 undertaking, he governed himself by; <I>This is the will of him that 
 sent me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:40">John vi. 40</A>.

 <I>This commandment have I received of my Father,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:18,14:31">John x. 18; xiv. 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. There is a declaration of that decree as far as is necessary for 
 the satisfaction of all those who are called and commanded to yield 
 themselves subjects to this king, and to leave those inexcusable who 
 will not have him to reign over them. The decree was secret; it was 
 what the Father said to the Son, when he possessed him in the beginning 
 of his way, before his works of old; but it is declared by a faithful 
 witness, who had lain in the bosom of the Father from eternity, and 
 came into the world as the prophet of the church, to declare him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:18">John i. 18</A>.

 The fountain of all being is, without doubt, the fountain of all power;
 and it is by, from, and under him, that the Messiah claims. He has his
 right to rule from what Jehovah said to him, by whose word all things
 were made and are governed. Christ here makes a two-fold title to his
 kingdom:--

 1. A title by inheritance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</I> This scripture
 the apostle quotes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:5">Heb. i. 5</A>)

 to prove that Christ has a more excellent name than the angels, but
 that he <I>obtained it by inheritance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He is the Son of God, not by adoption, but his begotten Son, the only 
 begotten of the Father,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:14">John i. 14</A>.

 And the Father owns him, and will have this declared to the world as
 the reason why he is constituted King upon the holy hill of Zion; he is 
 therefore unquestionably entitled to, and perfectly qualified for, that 
 great trust. He is the Son of God, and therefore of the same nature 
 with the Father, has in him all the fulness of the godhead, infinite 
 wisdom, power, and holiness. The supreme government of the church is 
 too high an honour and too hard an undertaking for any mere creature; 
 none can be fit for it but he who is <I>one with the Father</I> and was 
 <I>from eternity by him as one brought up with him,</I> thoroughly 
 apprized of all his counsels, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30">Prov.  viii. 30</A>.

 He is the Son of God, and therefore dear to him, his beloved Son, in
 whom he is well pleased; and upon this account we are to receive him as 
 a King; for because <I>the Father loveth the Son he hath given all 
 things into his hand,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:35,5:20">John iii. 35; v. 20</A>.

 Being a Son, he is heir of all things, and, the Father having made the
 worlds by him, it is easy to infer thence that by him also he governs 
 them; for he is the eternal Wisdom and the eternal Word. If God hath 
 said unto him, "<I>Thou art my Son,</I>" it becomes each of us to say 
 to him, "Thou art my Lord, my sovereign." Further, to satisfy us that 
 his kingdom is well-grounded upon his sonship, we are here told what 
 his sonship is grounded on: <I>This day have I begotten thee,</I> which 
 refers both to his eternal generation itself, for it is quoted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:5">Heb. i. 5</A>)

 to prove that he is the <I>brightness of his Father's glory and the
 express image of his person</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and to the evidence and demonstration given of it by his resurrection
 from the dead, for to that also it is expressly applied by the apostle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:33">Acts xiii. 33</A>.

 <I>He hath raised up Jesus again, as it is written, Thou art my Son,
 this day have I begotten thee.</I> It was by the resurrection from the 
 dead, that sign of the prophet Jonas, which was to be the most 
 convincing of all, that he was <I>declared to be the Son of God with 
 power,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:4">Rom. i. 4</A>.

 Christ is said to be the <I>first-begotten</I> and <I>first-born from 
 the dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:5,Col+1:18">Rev. i. 5; Col. i. 18</A>.

 Immediately after his resurrection he entered upon the administration
 of his mediatorial kingdom; it was then that he said, <I>All power is 
 given unto me,</I> and to that especially he had an eye when he taught 
 his disciples to pray, <I>Thy kingdom come.</I>

 2. A title by agreement, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 The agreement is, in short, this: the Son must undertake the office of 
 an intercessor, and, upon that condition, he shall have the honour and 
 power of a universal monarch; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:12">Isa. liii. 12</A>,

 <I>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, because he
 made intercession for the transgressors. He shall be a priest upon his 
 throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between them both,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:13">Zech. vi. 13</A>.

 (1.) The Son must ask.  This supposes his putting himself voluntarily
 into a state of inferiority to the Father, by taking upon him the human 
 nature; for, as God, he was equal in power and glory with the Father 
 and had nothing to ask. It supposes the making of a satisfaction by the 
 virtue of which the intercession must be made, and the paying of a 
 price, on which this large demand was to be grounded; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:4,5">John xvii. 4, 5</A>.

 The Son, in asking the heathen for his inheritance, aims, not only at
 his own honour, but at their happiness in him; so that he intercedes 
 for them, ever lives to do so, and is therefore able to save to the 
 uttermost. 

 (2.) The Father will grant more than to the half of the kingdom, even 
 to the kingdom itself. It is here promised him, 

 [1.] That his government shall be universal: he shall have <I>the 
 heathen</I> for his inheritance, not the Jews only, to whose nation the 
 church had been long confined, but the Gentiles also. Those in <I>the 
 uttermost parts of the earth</I> (as this nation of ours) shall be his 
 <I>possession,</I> and he shall have multitudes of willing loyal 
 subjects among them. Baptized Christians are the possession of the Lord 
 Jesus; they are to him for a name and a praise.  God the Father gives 
 them to him when by his Spirit and grave he works upon them to submit 
 their necks to the yoke of the Lord Jesus. This is in part fulfilled; a 
 great part of the Gentile world received the gospel when it was first 
 preached, and Christ's throne was set up there where Satan's seat had 
 long been. But it is to be yet further accomplished when <I>the 
 kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of the Lord and of his 
 Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:15">Rev. xi. 15</A>.
 
 <I>Who shall live when God doeth this?</I>

 [2.] That it shall be victorious: <I>Thou shalt break them</I> (those 
 of them that oppose thy kingdom) <I>with a rod of iron,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 This was in part fulfilled when the nation of the Jews, those that
 persisted in unbelief and enmity to Christ's gospel, were destroyed by 
 the Roman power, which was represented

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+2:40">Dan. ii. 40</A>)

 by feet of iron, as here by a rod of iron. It had a further
 accomplishment in the destruction of the Pagan powers, when the 
 Christian religion came to be established; but it will not be 
 completely fulfilled till all opposing rule, principality, and power, 
 shall be finally put down,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:24,Ps+110:5,6">1 Cor. xv. 24; Ps. cx. 5, 6</A>.

 Observe, How powerful Christ is and how weak the enemies of his kingdom
 are before him; he has a rod of iron wherewith to crush those that will 
 not submit to his golden sceptre; they are but like a potter's vessel 
 before him, suddenly, easily, and irreparably dashed in pieces by him; 
 see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:27">Rev.  ii. 27</A>.

 "Thou shalt do it, that is, thou shalt have <I>leave</I> to do it."
 Nations shall be ruined, rather than the gospel church shall not be 
 built and established. <I>I have loved thee, therefore will I give men 
 for thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:4">Isa. xliii. 4</A>.

 "Thou shalt have power to do it; none shall be able to stand before
 thee; and thou shalt do it effectually." Those that will not bow shall 
 break.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this, and praying it over, we must give glory to Christ as 
 the eternal Son of God and our rightful Lord, and must take comfort 
 from this promise, and plead it with God, that the kingdom of Christ 
 shall be enlarged and established and shall triumph over all 
 opposition.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the practical application of this gospel doctrine 
 concerning the kingdom of the Messiah, by way of exhortation to the 
 kings and judges of the earth. They hear that it is in vain to oppose 
 Christ's government; let them therefore be so wise for themselves as to 
 submit to it. He that has power to destroy them shows that he has no 
 pleasure in their destruction, for he puts them into a way to make 
 themselves happy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Those that would be wise must be instructed; and those are truly wise
 that receive instruction from the word of God.  Kings and judges stand 
 upon a level with common persons before God; and it is as necessary for 
 them to be religious as for any others. Those that give law and 
 judgment to others must receive law from Christ, and it will be their 
 wisdom to do so. What is said to them is said to all, and is required 
 of every one of us, only it is directed to kings and judges because of 
 the influence which their example will have upon their inferiors, and 
 because they were men of rank and power that opposed the setting up of 
 Christ's kingdom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 We are exhorted,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To reverence God and to stand in awe of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 This is the great duty of natural religion. God is great, and
 infinitely above us, just and holy, and provoked against us, and 
 therefore we ought to fear him and tremble before him; yet he is our 
 Lord and Master, and we are bound to serve him, our friend and 
 benefactor, and we have reason to rejoice in him; and these are very 
 well consistent with each other, for,

 1. We must serve God in all ordinances of worship, and all instances of 
 a godly conversation, but with a holy fear, a jealousy over ourselves, 
 and a reverence of him. Even kings themselves, whom others serve and 
 fear, must serve and fear God; there is the same indefinite distance 
 between them and God that there is between the meanest of their 
 subjects and him. 

 2. We must rejoice in God, and, in subordination to him, we may rejoice 
 in other things, but still with a holy trembling, as those that know 
 what a glorious and jealous God he is, whose eye is always upon us. Our 
 salvation must be wrought out <I>with fear and trembling,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:12">Phil. ii. 12</A>.

 We ought to rejoice in the setting up of the kingdom of Christ, but to
 <I>rejoice with trembling,</I> with a holy awe of him, a holy fear for 
 ourselves, lest we come short, and a tender concern for the many 
 precious souls to whom his gospel and kingdom are a savour of death 
 unto death. Whatever we rejoice in, in this world, it must always be 
 with trembling, lest we grow vain in our joy and be puffed up with the 
 things we rejoice in, and because of the uncertainty of them and the 
 damp which by a thousand accidents may soon be cast upon our joy.  To 
 <I>rejoice with trembling is to rejoice as though we rejoiced not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:30">1 Cor.  vii. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To welcome Jesus Christ and to submit to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This is the great duty of the Christian religion; it is that which is
 required of all, even kings and judges, and it is our wisdom and 
 interest to do it.  Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The command given to this purport: <I>Kiss the Son.</I> Christ is 
 called the <I>Son</I> because so he was declared 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>Thou art my Son.</I> He is the Son of God by eternal generation,
 and, upon that account, he is to be adored by us. He is the <I>Son of 
 man</I> (that is, the Mediator,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:27">John v. 27</A>),

 and, upon that account, to be received and submitted to. He is called
 the <I>Son,</I> to include both, as God is often called emphatically 
 the <I>Father,</I> because he is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
 and in him our Father, and we must have an eye to him under both 
 considerations. Our duty to Christ is here expressed figuratively: 
 <I>Kiss the Son,</I> not with a betraying kiss, as Judas kissed him, 
 and as all hypocrites, who pretend to honour him, but really affront 
 him; but with a believing kiss. 

 (1.) With a kiss of agreement and reconciliation. Kiss, and be friends, 
 as Jacob and Esau; let the quarrel between us and God terminate; let 
 the acts of hostility cease, and let us be at peace with God in Christ, 
 who is our peace.  

 (2.) With a kiss of adoration and religious worship.  Those that 
 worshipped idols kissed them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:18,Ho+13:2">1 Kings xix. 18; Hos. xiii. 2</A>.

 Let us study how to do honour to the Lord Jesus, and to give unto him
 the glory due unto his name. <I>He is thy Lord, and worship thou
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:1">Ps. xlv. 11</A>.

 We must <I>worship the Lamb,</I> as well as him that sits on the
 throne, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:9-13">Rev. v. 9-13</A>.

 (3.) With a kiss of affection and sincere love: "<I>Kiss the Son;</I>
 enter into a covenant of friendship with him, and let him be very dear 
 and precious to you; love him above all, love him in sincerity, love 
 him much, as she did to whom much was forgiven, and, in token of it, 
 kissed his feet,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:38">Luke vii. 38</A>.

 (4.) With a kiss of allegiance and loyalty, as Samuel kissed Saul, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+10:1">1 Sam. x. 1</A>.

 Swear fealty and homage to him, submit to his government, take his yoke
 upon you, and give up yourselves to be governed by his laws, disposed 
 of by his providence, and entirely devoted to his interest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The reasons to enforce this command; and they are taken from our own 
 interest, which God, in his gospel, shows a concern for.  Consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The certain ruin we run upon if we refuse and reject Christ: 
 "<I>Kiss the Son;</I> for it is at your peril if you do not." 

 [1.] "It will be a great provocation to him. Do it, <I>lest he be 
 angry.</I>" The Father is angry already; the Son is the Mediator that 
 undertakes to make peace; if we slight him, the <I>Father's wrath 
 abides upon us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:36">John iii. 36</A>),

 and not only so, but there is an addition of the Son's wrath too, to
 whom nothing is more displeasing than to have the offers of his grace 
 slighted and the designs of it frustrated. The Son can be angry, though 
 a Lamb; he is the lion of the tribe of Judah, and the wrath of this 
 king, this King of kings, will be as the roaring of a lion, and will 
 drive even mighty men and chief captains to seek in vain for shelter in 
 rocks and mountains, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:16">Rev. vi. 16</A>.

 If the Son be angry, who shall intercede for us? There remains no more
 sacrifice, no other name by which we can be saved. Unbelief is a sin 
 against the remedy.

 [2.] It will be utter destruction to yourselves: <I>Lest you perish 
 from the way,</I> or <I>in</I> the way so some, <I>in</I> the way of 
 your sins, and <I>from</I> the way of your vain hopes; <I>lest your way 
 perish</I> (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:6">Ps. i. 6</A>),

 lest you prove to have missed the way to happiness.  Christ is the way;
 take heed lest you be cut off from him as your way to God. It intimates 
 that they were, or at least thought themselves, in the way; but, by 
 neglecting Christ, they perished from it, which aggravates their ruin, 
 that they go to hell from the way to heaven, are not far from the 
 kingdom of God and yet never arrive there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The happiness we are sure of if we yield ourselves to Christ. When 
 his wrath is kindled, though <I>but a little,</I> the least spark of 
 that fire is enough to make the proudest sinner miserable if it fasten 
 upon his conscience; for it will burn to the lowest hell: one would 
 think it should therefore follow, "When his wrath is kindled, woe be to 
 those that despise him;" but the Psalmist startles at the thought,
 deprecates that dreadful doom and pronounces those blessed that escape 
 it. Those that trust in him, and so kiss him, are truly happy; but they 
 will especially appear to be so when the wrath of Christ is kindled 
 against others. Blessed will those be in the day of wrath, who, by 
 trusting in Christ, have made him their refuge and patron; when the 
 hearts of others fail them for fear they shall lift up their heads with 
 joy; and then those who now despise Christ and his followers will be 
 forced to say, to their own greater confusion, "Now we see that 
 <I>blessed are all those,</I> and those only, <I>that trust in 
 him.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this, and praying it over, we should have our hearts filled 
 with a holy awe of God, but at the same time borne up with a cheerful 
 confidence in Christ, in whose mediation we may comfort and encourage
 ourselves and one another. <I>We are the circumcision, that rejoice in 
 Christ Jesus.</I></P>
