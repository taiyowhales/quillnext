 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a psalm of thanksgiving for the great deliverances which God 
 had wrought for David, penned upon occasion of the dedicating of his 
 house of cedar, and sung in that pious solemnity, though there is not 
 any thing in it that has particular reference to that occasion. Some 
 collect from divers passages in the psalm itself that it was penned 
 upon his recovery from a dangerous fit of sickness, which might happen 
 to be about the time of the dedication of his house. 

 I. He here praises God for the deliverances he had wrought for him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:1-3">ver.  1-3</A>.

 II. He calls upon others to praise him too, and encourages them to
 trust in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:4,5">ver.  4, 5</A>.

 III. He blames himself for his former security, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 IV. He recollects the prayers and complaints he had made in his
 distress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:8-10">ver.  8-10</A>.

 With them he stirs up himself to be very thankful to God for the 
 present comfortable change, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 In singing this psalm we ought to remember with thankfulness any like 
 deliverances wrought for us, for which we must stir up our selves to 
 praise him and by which we must be engaged to depend upon him.</P>

 <P>A psalm <I>and</I> song <I>at</I> the dedication of the house of
 David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I will extol thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for thou hast lifted me up,
 and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
 &nbsp; 2  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
 &nbsp; 3  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou
 hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
 &nbsp; 4  Sing unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at
 the remembrance of his holiness.
 &nbsp; 5  For his anger <I>endureth but</I> a moment; in his favour <I>is</I>
 life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy <I>cometh</I> in the
 morning.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It was the laudable practice of the pious Jews, and, though not 
 expressly appointed, yet allowed and accepted, when they had built a 
 new house, to <I>dedicate it to God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+20:5">Deut. xx. 5</A>.

 David did so when his house was built, and he took possession of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:11">2 Sam. v. 11</A>);

 for royal palaces do as much need God's protection, and are as much 
 bound to be at his service, as ordinary houses. Note, The houses we 
 dwell in should, at our first entrance upon them, be dedicated to God, 
 as little sanctuaries. We must solemnly commit ourselves, our families, 
 and all our family affairs, to God's guidance and care, must pray for 
 his presence and blessing, must devote ourselves and all ours to his 
 glory, and must resolve both that we put away iniquity far from our 
 tabernacles and that we and our houses will serve the Lord both in the 
 duties of family worship and in all instances of gospel obedience. Some 
 conjecture that this psalm was sung at the re-dedication of David's 
 house, after he had been driven out of it by Absalom, who had defiled 
 it with his incest, and that it is a thanksgiving for the crushing of 
 that dangerous rebellion. In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David does himself give God thanks for the great deliverances he had 
 wrought for him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>I will extol thee, O Lord!</I> I will exalt thy name, will praise
 thee as one high and lifted up, I will do what I can to advance the 
 interest of thy kingdom among men. I will extol thee, for thou hast 
 lifted me up, not only up out of the pit in which I was sinking, but up 
 to the throne of Israel." He <I>raiseth up the poor out of the 
 dust.</I> In consideration of the great things God has done to exalt 
 us, both by his providence and by his grace, we are bound, in 
 gratitude, to do all we can to extol his name, though the most we can 
 do is but little. Three things magnify David's deliverance:--

 1. That it was the defeat of his enemies. They were not suffered to
 triumph over him, as they would have done (though it is a barbarous 
 thing) if he had died of this sickness or perished in this distress: 
 see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:11">Ps. xli. 11</A>.

 2.  That it was an answer to his prayers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I cried unto thee.</I> All the expressions of the sense we have of
 our troubles should be directed to God, and every cry be a cry to him; 
 and giving way, in this manner, to our grief, will ease a burdened 
 spirit. "<I>I cried to thee, and thou hast</I> not only heard me, but 
 <I>healed me,</I> healed the distempered body, healed the disturbed and 
 disquieted mind, healed the disordered distracted affairs of the 
 kingdom." This is what God glories in, <I>I am the Lord that healeth 
 thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:26">Exod. xv. 26</A>),

 and we must give him the glory of it. 

 3. That it was the saving of his life; for he was brought to the last 
 extremity, dropping into the grave, and ready <I>to go down into the 
 pit,</I> and yet rescued and kept alive, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The more imminent our dangers have been, the more eminent our
 deliverances have been, the more comfortable are they to ourselves and 
 the more illustrious proofs of the power and goodness of God. A life 
 from the dead ought to be spent in extolling the God of our life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He calls upon others to join with him in praise, not only for the 
 particular favours God has bestowed upon him, but for the general 
 tokens of his good-will to all his saints 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Sing unto the Lord, O you saints of his!</I> All that are truly
 saints he owns for his. There is a remnant of such in this world, and 
 from them it is expected that they sing unto him; for they are created 
 and sanctified, made and made saints, that they may be to him for a 
 name and a praise.  His saints in heaven sing to him; why should not 
 those on earth be doing the same work, as well as they can, in concert 
 with them?

 1. They believe him to be a God of unspotted purity; and therefore let
 them sing to him; "Let them <I>give thanks at the remembrance of his 
 holiness;</I> let them praise his holy name, for holiness is his 
 memorial throughout all generations." God is a holy God; his holiness 
 is his glory; that is the attribute which the holy angels, in their 
 praises, fasten most upon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:3,Re+4:8">Isa. vi. 3; Rev. iv. 8</A>.

 We ought to be much in the mention and remembrance of God's holiness.
 It is a matter of joy to the saints that God is a holy God; for then 
 they hope he will make them holy, more holy. None of all God's 
 perfections carries in it more terror to the wicked, nor more comfort 
 to the godly, than his holiness.  It is a good sign that we are in some 
 measure partakers of his holiness if we can heartily rejoice and give 
 thanks at the remembrance of it. 

 2.  They have experienced him to be a God gracious and merciful; and 
 therefore let them sing to him.

 (1.) We have found his frowns very short. Though we have deserved that 
 they should be everlasting, and that he should be angry with us till he 
 had consumed us, and should never be reconciled, yet <I>his anger 
 endureth but for a moment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:5"><I>v.</I>  5</A>.

 When we offend him he is angry; but, as he is slow to anger and not 
 soon provoked, so when he is angry, upon our repentance and humiliation 
 his anger is soon turned away and he is willing to be at peace with us.  
 If he hide his face from his own children, and suspend the wonted 
 tokens of his favour, it is but <I>in a little wrath,</I> and <I>for a 
 small moment;</I> but he will <I>gather them with everlasting 
 kindness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:7,8">Isa. liv. 7, 8</A>.

 If <I>weeping endureth for a night,</I> and it be a wearisome night,
 yet as sure as the light of the morning returns after the darkness of 
 the night, so sure will joy and comfort return in a short time, in due 
 time, to the people of God; for the covenant of grace is as firm as the 
 covenant of the day. This word has often been fulfilled to us in the 
 letter. Weeping has endured for a night, but the grief has been soon 
 over and the grievance gone.  Observe, As long as God's anger continues 
 so long the saints' weeping continues; but, if that be but for a 
 moment, the affliction is but for a moment, and when the light of God's 
 countenance is restored the affliction is easily pronounced light and 
 momentary. 

 (2.) We have found his smiles very sweet; <I>In his favour is life,</I> 
 that is, all good.  The return of his favour to an afflicted soul is as 
 life from the dead; nothing can be more reviving.  Our happiness is 
 bound up in God's favour; if we have that, we have enough, whatever 
 else we want. It is the life of the soul, it is spiritual life, the 
 earnest of life eternal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have, in these verses, an account of three several states that David 
 was in successively, and of the workings of his heart towards God in 
 each of those states--what he said and did, and how his heart stood
 affected; in the first of these we may see what we are too apt to be, 
 and in the other two what we should be.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He had long enjoyed prosperity, and then he grew secure and 
 over-confident of the continuance of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>):

 "<I>In my prosperity,</I> when I was in health of body and God had
 <I>given me rest from all my enemies, I said I shall never be 
 moved;</I> I never thought either of having my body distempered or my 
 government disturbed, not had any apprehensions of danger upon any 
 account." Such complete victories had he obtained over those that 
 opposed him, and such a confirmed interest had he in the hearts of his 
 people, such a firmness of mind and such a strong constitution of body, 
 that he thought his prosperity fixed like a mountain; yet this he 
 ascribes, not to his own wisdom or fortitude, but to the divine 
 goodness. <I>Thou, through thy favour, hast made my mountain to stand 
 strong,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He does not look upon it as his <I>heaven</I> (as worldly people do, 
 who make their prosperity their felicity), only his <I>mountain;</I> it 
 is earth still, only raised a little higher than the common level.  
 This he thought, by the favour of God, would be perpetuated to him, 
 imagining perhaps that, having had so many troubles in the beginning of 
 his days, he had had his whole share and should have none in his latter 
 end, or that God, who had given him such tokens of his favour, would 
 never frown upon him. Note,

 1. We are very apt to dream, when things are well with us, that they
 will always be so, and never otherwise.  <I>To-morrow shall be as this 
 day.</I> As if we should think, when the weather is once fair, that it 
 will be even fair; whereas nothing is more certain than that it will 
 change. 

 2. When we see ourselves deceived in our expectations, it becomes us to 
 reflect, with shame, upon our security, as our folly, as David does 
 here, that we may be wiser another time and may rejoice in our 
 prosperity as though we rejoiced not, because the fashion of it passes 
 away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. On a sudden he fell into trouble, and then he prayed to God, and 
 pleaded earnestly for relief and succour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His mountain was shaken and he with it; it proved, when he grew 
 secure, that he was least safe: "<I>Thou didst hide thy face and I was 
 troubled,</I> in mind, body, or estate." In every change of his 
 condition he still kept his eye upon God, and, as he ascribed his 
 prosperity to God's favour, so in his adversity he observed the hiding 
 of God's face, to be the cause of it. If God hide his face, a good man 
 is certainly troubled, though no other calamity befal him; when the sun 
 sets night certainly follows, and the moon and all the stars cannot 
 make day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When his mountain was shaken he lifted up his eyes above the hills. 
 Prayer is a salve for every sore; he made use of it accordingly. <I>Is 
 any afflicted?</I> Is any troubled? <I>Let him pray.</I> Though God hid 
 his face from him, yet he prayed. If God, in wisdom and justice, turn 
 from us, yet it will be in us the greatest folly and injustice 
 imaginable if we turn from him. No; let us learn to pray in the dark 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>I cried to thee, O Lord!</I> It seems God's withdrawings made his
 prayers the more vehement. We are here told, for it seems he kept 
 account of it,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What he pleaded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 [1.] That God would be no gainer by his death: <I>What profit is there 
 in my blood?</I> implying that he would willingly die if he could 
 thereby do any real service to God or his country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:17">Phil. ii. 17</A>),

 but he saw not what good could be done by his dying in the bed of
 sickness, as might be if he had died in the bed of honour. "Lord," says 
 he, "wilt thou sell one of thy own <I>people for nought and not 
 increase thy wealth by the price?</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44"12">Ps. xliv. 12</A>.
 
 Nay
 
 [2.] That, in his honour, God would seem to be a loser by his death:
 <I>Shall the dust praise thee?</I> The sanctified spirit, which returns 
 to God, shall praise him, shall be still praising him; but the dust, 
 which returns to the earth, shall not praise him, nor declare his 
 truth. The services of God's house cannot be performed by the dust; it 
 cannot praise him; there is none of that device or working in the 
 grave, for it is the land of silence. The promises of God's covenant 
 cannot be performed to the dust. "Lord," says David, "if I die now, 
 what will become of the promise made to me? Who shall declare the truth 
 of that?" The best pleas in prayer are those that are taken from God's 
 honour; and then we ask aright for life when we have that in view, that 
 we may live and praise him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What he prayed for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He prayed for mercy to pardon (<I>Have mercy upon me</I>), and for 
 grace to help in time of need--<I>Lord, be thou my helper.</I> On these 
 two errands we also may come boldly to the throne of grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:16">Heb. iv. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In due time God delivered him out of his troubles and restored him 
 to his former prosperity. His prayers were answered and his <I>mourning 
 was turned into dancing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 God's anger now endured but for a moment, and David's weeping but for a 
 night. The sackcloth with which, in a humble compliance with the divine 
 Providence, he had clad himself, was loosed; his griefs were balanced; 
 his fears were silenced; his comforts returned; and he was girded with 
 gladness: joy was made his ornament, was made his strength, and seemed 
 to cleave to him, as the girdle cleaves to the loins of a man. As 
 David's plunge into trouble from the height of prosperity, and then 
 when he least expected it, teaches us to rejoice as though we rejoiced 
 not, because we know not how near trouble may be, so his sudden return 
 to a prosperous condition teaches us to weep as though we wept not, 
 because we know not how soon the storm may become a calm and the 
 formidable blast may become a favourable gale. But what temper of mind 
 was he in upon this happy change of the face of his affairs? What does 
 he say now? He tells us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 1. His complaints were turned into praises. He looked upon it that God
 girded him with gladness to the end that he might be the <I>sweet 
 psalmist of Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:1">2 Sam. xxiii. 1</A>),

 that his <I>glory might sing praise to God,</I> that is, his tongue
 (for our tongue is our glory, and never more so than when it is 
 employed in praising God) or his soul, for that is our glory above the 
 beasts, that must be employed in blessing the Lord, and with that we 
 must make melody to him in singing psalms. Those that are kept from 
 being silent in the pit must not be silent in the land of the living, 
 but fervent, and constant, and public, in praising God. 

 2. These praises were likely to be everlasting: <I>I will give thanks
 unto thee for ever.</I> This bespeaks a gracious resolution that he 
 would persevere to the end in praising God and a gracious hope that he 
 should never want fresh matter for praise and that he should shortly be 
 where this would be the everlasting work. <I>Blessed are those that 
 dwell in God's house; they will be still praising him.</I> Thus must we 
 learn to accommodate ourselves to the various providences of God that 
 concern us, to want and to abound, to sing of mercy and judgment, and 
 to sing unto God for both.</P>
