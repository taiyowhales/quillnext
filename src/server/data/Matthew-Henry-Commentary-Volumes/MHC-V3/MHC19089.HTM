 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Many psalms that begin with complaint and prayer end with joy and 
 praise, but this begins with joy and praise and ends with sad 
 complaints and petitions; for the psalmist first recounts God's former 
 favours, and then with the consideration of them aggravates the present 
 grievances. It is uncertain when it was penned; only, in general, that 
 it was at a time when the house of David was woefully eclipsed; some 
 think it was at the time of the captivity of Babylon, when king 
 Zedekiah was insulted over, and abused, by Nebuchadnezzar, and then 
 they make the title to signify no more than that the psalm was set to 
 the tune of a song of Ethan the son of Zerah, called Maschil; others 
 suppose it to be penned by Ethan, who is mentioned in the story of 
 Solomon, who, outliving that glorious prince, thus lamented the great 
 disgrace done to the house of David in the next reign by the revolt of 
 the ten tribes. 

 I. The psalmist, in the joyful pleasant part of the psalm, gives glory 
 to God, and takes comfort to himself and his friends. This he does more 
 briefly, mentioning God's mercy and truth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:1">ver. 1</A>)

 and his covenant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:2-4">ver.  2-4</A>),

 but more largely in the following verses, wherein,

 1. He adores the glory and perfection of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:5-14">ver.  5-14</A>.

 2. He pleases himself in the happiness of those that are admitted into
 communion with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:15-18">ver.  15-18</A>.

 3. He builds all his hope upon God's covenant with David, as a type of
 Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:19-37">ver. 19-37</A>.

 II. In the melancholy part of the psalm he laments the present
 calamitous state of the prince and royal family 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:38-45">ver.  38-45</A>),

 expostulates with God upon it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:46-49">ver. 46-49</A>),

 and then concludes with prayer for redress,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:50,51">ver. 50, 51</A>.

 In singing this psalm we must have high thoughts of God, a lively faith
 in his covenant with the Redeemer, and a sympathy with the afflicted 
 parts of the church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist has a very sad complaint to make of the deplorable 
 condition of the family of David at this time, and yet he begins the 
 psalm with songs of praise; for we must, in every thing, in every 
 state, give thanks; thus we must glorify the Lord in the fire. We 
 think, when we are in trouble, that we get ease by complaining; but we 
 do more--we get joy, by praising. Let our complaints therefore be turned
 into thanksgivings; and in these verses we find that which will be
 matter of praise and thanksgiving for us in the worst of times, whether 
 upon a personal or a public account, 

 1. However it be, the everlasting God is good and true,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Though we may find it hard to reconcile present dark providences with 
 the goodness and truth of God, yet we must abide by this principle, 
 That God's mercies are inexhaustible and his truth is inviolable; and 
 these must be the matter of our joy and praise: "<I>I will sing of the 
 mercies of the Lord for ever,</I> sing a praising song to God's honour, 
 a pleasant song for my own solace, and <I>Maschil,</I> an instructive 
 song, for the edification of others." We may be for ever singing God's 
 mercies, and yet the subject will not be drawn dry. We must sing of 
 God's mercies as long as we live, train up others to sing of them when 
 we are gone, and hope to be singing them in heaven world without end; 
 and this is <I>singing of the mercies of the Lord for ever. With my 
 mouth,</I> and with my pen (for by that also do we speak), <I>will I 
 make known thy faithfulness to all generations,</I> assuring posterity, 
 from my own observation and experience, that God is true to every word 
 that he has spoken, that they may learn to <I>put their trust in 
 God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:6">Ps. lxxviii. 6</A>.

 2. However it be, the everlasting covenant is firm and sure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>.
 
 Here we have, 

 (1.) The psalmist's faith and hope: "Things now look black, and 
 threaten the utter extirpation of the house of David; but <I>I have 
 said,</I> and I have warrant from the word of God to say it, that 
 <I>mercy shall be built up for ever.</I>" As the goodness of God's 
 nature is to be the matter of our song

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 so much more the mercy that is built for us in the covenant; it is 
 still increasing, like a house in the building up, and shall still 
 continue our rest for ever, like a house built up.  It shall be built 
 up for ever; for the everlasting habitations we hope for in the new 
 Jerusalem are of this building. If mercy shall be built for ever, then 
 the <I>tabernacle of David, which has fallen down,</I> shall <I>be 
 raised out of its ruins,</I> and <I>built up as in the days of old,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:11">Amos ix. 11</A>.

 <I>Therefore</I> mercy shall be built up for ever, because <I>thy
 faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.</I> Though our 
 expectations are in some particular instances disappointed, yet God's 
 promises are not disannulled; they are <I>established in the very 
 heavens</I> (that is, in his eternal counsels); they are above the 
 changes of this lower region and out of the reach of the opposition of 
 hell and earth. The stability of the material heavens is an emblem of 
 the truth of God's word; the heavens may be clouded by vapours arising 
 out of the earth, but they cannot be touched, they cannot be changed.

 (2.) An abstract of the covenant upon which this faith and hope are 
 built: <I>I have said it,</I> says the psalmist, for <I>God hath sworn 
 it,</I> that the heirs of promise might be entirely satisfied of the 
 immutability of his counsel. He brings in God speaking 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 owning, to the comfort of his people, "<I>I have made a covenant,</I> 
 and therefore will make it good." The covenant is made with David; the 
 covenant of royalty is made with him, as the father of his family, and 
 with his seed through him and for his sake, representing the covenant 
 of grace made with Christ as head of the church and with all believers 
 as his spiritual seed. David is here called <I>God's chosen</I> and 
 <I>his servant;</I> and, as God is not changeable to recede from his 
 own choice, so he is not unrighteous to cast off one that served him.  
 Two things encourage the psalmist to build his faith on this 
 covenant:--

 [1.] The ratification of it; it was confirmed with an oath: <I>The Lord 
 has sworn, and he will not repent.</I> 

 [2.] The perpetuity of it; the blessings of the covenant were not only 
 secured to David himself, but were entailed on his family; it was 
 promised that his family should continue--<I>Thy seed will I establish 
 for ever,</I> so that <I>David shall not want a son to reign</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:20,21">Jer. xxxiii. 20, 21</A>);

 and that it should continue a royal family--<I>I will build up thy
 throne to all generations,</I> to all the generations of time.  This 
 has its accomplishment only in Christ, of the seed of David, who lives 
 for ever, to whom God has given the throne of his father David, and of 
 the increase of whose government and peace there shall be no end. Of 
 this covenant the psalmist will return to speak more largely,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses are full of the praises of God.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Where, and by whom, God is to be praised. 

 1. God is praised by the angels above: <I>The heavens shall praise thy 
 wonders, O Lord!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:5"><I>v.</I>  5</A>;

 that is, "the glorious inhabitants of the upper world continually 
 celebrate thy praises." <I>Bless the Lord, you his angels,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:20">Ps. ciii. 20</A>.

 The works of God are wonders even to those that are best acquainted and
 most intimately conversant with them; the more God's works are known 
 the more they are admired and praised. This should make us love heaven, 
 and long to be there, that there we shall have nothing else to do but 
 to praise God and his wonders. 

 2. God is praised by the assemblies of his saints on earth (<I>praise 
 waits for him in Zion</I>); and, though their praises fall so far short 
 of the praises of angels, yet God is pleased to take notice of them, 
 and accept of them, and reckon himself honoured by them. "Thy 
 faithfulness and the truth of thy promise, that rock on which the 
 church is built, shall be praised in the congregation of the saints, 
 who owe their all to that faithfulness, and whose constant comfort it 
 is that there is a promise, and that he is faithful who has promised." 
 It is expected from God's saints on earth that they praise him; who 
 should, if they do not? Let every saint praise him, but especially the 
 congregation of saints; when they come together, let them join in 
 praising God. The more the better; it is the more like heaven. Of the 
 honour done to God by the assembly of the saints he speaks again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints.</I> 
 Saints should assemble for religious worship, that they may publicly 
 own their relation to God and may stir up one another to give honour to 
 him, and, in keeping up communion with God, may likewise maintain the 
 communion of saints. In religious assemblies God has promised the 
 presence of his grace, but we must also, in them, have an eye to his 
 glorious presence, that the familiarity we are admitted to may not 
 breed the least contempt; for he is terrible in his holy places, and 
 therefore greatly to be feared. A holy awe of God must fall upon us, 
 and fill us, in all our approaches to God, even in secret, to which 
 something may very well be added by the solemnity of public assemblies. 
 God must be had <I>in reverence of all that are about him,</I> that 
 attend him continually as his servants or approach him upon any 
 particular errand. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:3">Lev. x. 3</A>.

 Those only serve God acceptably who serve him with <I>reverence and
 godly fear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:28">Heb.  xii. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What it is to praise God; it is to acknowledge him to be a being of 
 unparalleled perfection, such a one that there is none like him, nor 
 any to be compared with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 If there be any beings that can pretend to vie with God, surely they 
 must be found among the angels; but they are all infinitely short of 
 him: <I>Who in the heaven can be compared with the Lord,</I> so as to 
 challenge any share of the reverence and adoration which are due to him 
 only, or to set up in rivalship with him for the homage of the children 
 of men? They are sons of the mighty, but which of them can be likened 
 unto the Lord? Nobles are princes' peers; some parity there is between 
 them. But there is none between God and the angels; they are not his 
 peers. <I>To whom will you liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the 
 Holy One,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:25">Isa.  xl. 25</A>.

 This is insisted on again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Who is a strong Lord like unto thee?</I> No angel, no earthly 
 potentate, whatsoever, is comparable to God, or <I>has an arm like 
 him,</I> or can <I>thunder with a voice like him.</I> Thy 
 <I>faithfulness is round about thee;</I> that is, "thy angels who are 
 round about thee, attending thee with their praises and ready to go on 
 thy errands, are all faithful." Or, rather, "In every thing thou doest, 
 on all sides, thou approvest thyself faithful to thy word, above 
 whatever prince or potentate was." Among men it is too often found that 
 those who are most able to break their word are least careful to keep 
 it; but God is both strong and faithful; he can do every thing, and yet 
 will never do an unjust thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What we ought, in our praises, to give God the glory of. Several 
 things are here mentioned. 

 1. The command God has of the most ungovernable creatures

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Thou rulest the raging of the sea,</I> than which nothing is more 
 frightful or threatening, nor more out of the power of man to give 
 check to; it can swell no higher, roll no further, beat no harder, 
 continue no longer, nor do any more hurt, than God suffers it. "<I>When 
 the waves thereof arise</I> thou canst immediately hush them asleep, 
 still them, and make them quiet, and turn the storm into a calm." This 
 coming in here as an act of omnipotence, what manner of man then was 
 the Lord Jesus, whom the <I>winds and seas obeyed?</I> 

 2. The victories God has obtained over the enemies of his church. His 
 ruling the raging of the sea and quelling its billows was an emblem of 
 this

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 <I>Thou hast broken Rahab,</I> many a <I>proud enemy</I> (so it 
 signifies), Egypt in particular, which is sometimes called 
 <I>Rahab,</I> broken it in pieces, as one that is slain and utterly 
 unable to make head again. "The head being broken, thou hast scattered 
 the remainder with the arm of thy strength." God has more ways than one 
 to deal with his and his church's enemies. We think he should slay them 
 immediately, but sometimes he scatters them, that he may send them 
 abroad to be monuments of his justice,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:11">Ps. lix. 11</A>.

 The remembrance of the breaking of Egypt in pieces is a comfort to the 
 church, in reference to the present power of Babylon; for God is still 
 the same. 

 3. The incontestable property he has in all the creatures of the upper
 and lower world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>):

 "Men are honoured for their large possessions; but <I>the heavens are 
 thine, O Lord! the earth also is thine;</I> therefore we praise thee, 
 therefore we trust in thee, therefore we will not fear what man can do 
 against us. <I>The world and the fulness thereof,</I> all the riches 
 contained in it, all the inhabitants of it, both the tenements and the 
 tenants, are all thine; for <I>thou hast founded them,</I>" and the 
 founder may justly claim to be the owner. He specifies, 

 (1.) The remotest parts of the world, the north and south, the 
 countries that lie under the two poles, which are uninhabited and 
 little known: "<I>Thou hast created them,</I> and therefore knowest 
 them, takest care of them, and hast tributes of praise from them." The 
 north is said to be <I>hung over the empty place;</I> yet what fulness 
 there is there God is the owner of it. 

 (2.) The highest parts of the world. He mentions the two highest hills 
 in Canaan--"<I>Tabor and Hermon</I>" (one lying to the west, the other 
 to the east); "these shall rejoice in thy name, for they are under the 
 care of thy providence, and they produce offerings for thy altar." The 
 little hills are said to rejoice in their own fruitfulness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:12">Ps. lxv. 12</A>.
 
 Tabor is commonly supposed to be that high mountain in Galilee on the
 top of which Christ was transfigured; and then indeed it might be said 
 to rejoice in that voice which was there heard, <I>This is my beloved 
 Son.</I> 

 4. The power and justice, the mercy and truth, with which he governs 
 the world and rules in the affairs of the children of men,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:13,14"><I>v.</I>  13, 14</A>.

 (1.) God is able to do every thing; for his is the Lord God Almighty. 
 His arm, his hand, is mighty and strong, both to save his people and to 
 destroy his and their enemies; none can either resist the force or bear 
 the weight of his mighty hand. <I>High is his right hand,</I> to reach 
 the highest, even those that <I>set their nests among the stars</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:2,3,Ob+1:4">Amos ix. 2, 3; Obad. 4</A>);

 his <I>right hand is exalted</I> in what he has done, for in thousands
 of instances he has signalized his power, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:16">Ps. cxviii. 16</A>.

 (2.) He never did, nor ever will do, any thing that is either unjust or
 unwise; for <I>righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his 
 throne.</I> None of all his dictates or decrees ever varied from the 
 rules of equity and wisdom, nor could ever any charge God with 
 unrighteousness or folly. Justice and judgment are the <I>preparing</I> 
 of his throne (so some), the <I>establishment</I> of it, so others. The 
 preparations for his government in his counsels from eternity, and the 
 establishment of it in its consequences to eternity, are all justice 
 and judgment.  

 (3.) He always does that which is kind to his people and consonant to 
 the word which he has spoken: "<I>Mercy and truth shall go before thy 
 face,</I> to prepare thy way, as harbingers to make room for 
 thee--mercy in promising, truth in performing--truth in being as good 
 as thy word, mercy in being better." How praiseworthy are these in 
 great men, much more in the great God, in whom they are in 
 perfection!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist, having largely shown the blessedness of the God of 
 Israel, here shows the blessedness of the Israel of God. As <I>there is
 none like unto the God of Jeshurun, so, happy art thou, O Israel! there 
 is none like unto thee, O people!</I> especially as a type of the 
 gospel-Israel, consisting of all true believers, whose happiness is
 here described.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Glorious discoveries are made to them, and glad tidings of good 
 brought to them; they hear, <I>they know, the joyful sound,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 This may allude, 

 1. To the shout of a victorious army, the shout of a king,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:21">Num. xxiii. 21</A>.

 Israel have the tokens of God's presence with them in their wars; the 
 sound of the <I>going in the top of the mulberry-trees</I> was indeed a 
 <I>joyful sound</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:24">2 Sam. v. 24</A>);

 and they often returned making the earth ring with their songs of
 triumph; these were joyful sounds. Or, 

 2. To the sound that was made over the sacrifices and on the solemn 
 feast-day,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:1-3">Ps. lxxxi. 1-3</A>.

 This was the happiness of Israel, that they had among them the free and
 open profession of God's holy religion, and abundance of joy in their 
 sacrifices. Or, 

 3. To the sound of the jubilee-trumpet; a joyful sound it was to
 servants and debtors, to whom it proclaimed release. The gospel is 
 indeed a joyful sound, a sound of victory, of liberty, of communion 
 with God, and the <I>sound of abundance of rain;</I> blessed are the 
 people that hear it, and know it, and bid it welcome.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Special tokens of God's favour are granted them: "<I>They shall 
 walk, O Lord! in the light of thy countenance;</I> they shall govern 
 themselves by thy directions, shall be guided by the eye; and they 
 shall delight themselves in thy consolations.  They shall have the 
 favour of God; they shall know that they have it, and it shall be 
 continual matter of joy and rejoicing to them. They shall go through 
 all the exercises of a holy life under the powerful influences of God's 
 lovingkindness, which shall make their duty pleasant to them and make 
 them sincere in it, aiming at this, as their end, to be accepted of the 
 Lord." We then walk in the light of the Lord when we fetch all our 
 comforts from God's favour and are very careful to keep ourselves in 
 his love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They never want matter for joy: Blessed are God's people, for in 
 his name, in all that whereby he has made himself known, if it be not 
 their own fault, <I>they shall rejoice all the day.</I> Those that 
 rejoice in Christ Jesus, and make God their exceeding joy, have enough 
 to counterbalance their grievances and silence their griefs; and 
 therefore their joy is full 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:4">1 John i. 4</A>)

 and constant; it is their duty to rejoice evermore.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Their relation to God is their honour and dignity. They are happy, 
 for they are high. <I>Surely in the Lord,</I> in the Lord Christ, 
 <I>they have righteousness and strength,</I> and so are recommended by 
 him to the divine acceptance; and therefore <I>in him shall all the 
 seed of Israel glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:24,25">Isa. xlv. 24, 25</A>.
 
 So it is here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 1.  "In <I>thy righteousness shall they be exalted,</I> and not in any 
 righteousness of their own." We are exalted out of danger, and into 
 honour, purely by the righteousness of Christ, which is a clothing both 
 for dignity and for defence. 

 2. "Thou art the <I>glory of their strength,</I>" that is, "thou art 
 their strength, and it is their glory that thou art so, and what they 
 glory in." <I>Thanks be to God who always causes us to triumph.</I> 

 3.  "In thy favour, which through Christ we hope for, <I>our horn shall
 be exalted.</I>" The horn denotes beauty, plenty, and power; these 
 those have who are made accepted in the beloved. What greater 
 preferment are men capable of in this world than to be God's 
 favourites?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Their relation to God is their protection and safety 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 
 "<I>For our shield is of the Lord</I>" (so the margin) "and <I>our king 
 is from the Holy One of Israel.</I> If God be our ruler, he will be our 
 defender; and who is he then that can harm us?" It was the happiness of
 Israel that God himself had the erecting of their bulwarks and the
 nominating of their king (so some take it); or, rather, that he was 
 himself a <I>wall of fire round about them,</I> and, as a Holy One, the 
 author and centre of their holy religion; he was their King, and so 
 their glory in the midst of them. Christ is the Holy One of Israel, 
 that holy thing; and in nothing was that peculiar people more blessed 
 than in this, that <I>he</I> was born King of the Jews. Now this 
 account of the blessedness of God's Israel comes in here as that to 
 which it was hard to reconcile their present calamitous state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I
 have laid help upon <I>one that is</I> mighty; I have exalted <I>one</I>
 chosen out of the people.
 &nbsp; 20  I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I
 anointed him:
 &nbsp; 21  With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall
 strengthen him.
 &nbsp; 22  The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of
 wickedness afflict him.
 &nbsp; 23  And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague
 them that hate him.
 &nbsp; 24  But my faithfulness and my mercy <I>shall be</I> with him: and in
 my name shall his horn be exalted.
 &nbsp; 25  I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in
 the rivers.
 &nbsp; 26  He shall cry unto me, Thou <I>art</I> my father, my God, and the
 rock of my salvation.
 &nbsp; 27  Also I will make him <I>my</I> firstborn, higher than the kings
 of the earth.
 &nbsp; 28  My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant
 shall stand fast with him.
 &nbsp; 29  His seed also will I make <I>to endure</I> for ever, and his
 throne as the days of heaven.
 &nbsp; 30  If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my
 judgments;
 &nbsp; 31  If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
 &nbsp; 32  Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and
 their iniquity with stripes.
 &nbsp; 33  Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from
 him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
 &nbsp; 34  My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is
 gone out of my lips.
 &nbsp; 35  Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto
 David.
 &nbsp; 36  His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun
 before me.
 &nbsp; 37  It shall be established for ever as the moon, and <I>as</I> a
 faithful witness in heaven. Selah.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The covenant God made with David and his seed was mentioned before 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:3,4"><I>v.</I>  3, 4</A>);

 but in these verses it is enlarged upon, and pleaded with God, for 
 favour to the royal family, now almost sunk and ruined; yet certainly 
 it looks at Christ, and has its accomplishment in him much more than in 
 David; nay, some passages here are scarcely applicable at all to David, 
 but must be understood of Christ only (who is therefore called <I>David 
 our king,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:5">Hos. iii. 5</A>),

 and very great and precious promises they are which are here made to
 the Redeemer, which are strong foundations for the faith and hope of 
 the redeemed to build upon. The comforts of our redemption flow from 
 the covenant of redemption; all our springs are in that,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:3">Isa. lv. 3</A>.

 <I>I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies
 of David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:34">Acts xiii. 34</A>.

 Now here we have an account of those sure mercies.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What assurance we have of the truth of the promise, which may 
 encourage us to build upon it. We are here told, 
 
 1. How it was spoken
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Thou didst speak in vision to thy Holy One.</I> God's promise to 
 David, which is especially referred to here, was spoken in vision to 
 Nathan the prophet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:12-17">2 Sam. vii. 12-17</A>.

 <I>Then,</I> when the <I>Holy One of Israel was their king</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 he appointed David to be his viceroy. But to all the prophets, those 
 holy ones, he <I>spoke in vision</I> concerning Christ, and to him 
 himself especially, who had lain in his bosom from eternity, and was 
 made perfectly acquainted with the whole design of redemption,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:27">Matt. xi. 27</A>.

 2. How it was sworn to and ratified 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>Once have I sworn by my holiness,</I> that darling attribute. In 
 swearing by his holiness, he swore by himself; for he will as soon 
 cease to be as be otherwise than holy. His swearing once is enough; he 
 needs not swear again, as David did

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+20:17">1 Sam. xx. 17</A>);

 for his word and oath are two immutable things.  As Christ was made a 
 priest, so he was made a king, <I>by an oath</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:21">Heb. vii. 21</A>);
 
 for his kingdom and priesthood are both unchangeable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The choice made of the person to whom the promise is given, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 David was a king of God's own choosing, so is Christ, and therefore 
 both are called <I>God's kings,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6">Ps. ii. 6</A>.

 David was mighty, a man of courage and fit for business; he was chosen
 out of the people, not out of the princes, but the shepherds. God found
 him out, exalted him, laid help upon him, and ordered Samuel to anoint
 him. But this is especially to be applied to Christ. 

 1. He is one that is mighty, every way qualified for the great work he 
 was to undertake, <I>able to save to the uttermost</I>--mighty in 
 strength, for he is the Son of God--mighty in love, for he is able 
 experimentally to compassionate those that are tempted. He is <I>the 
 mighty God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+9:6">Isa.  ix. 6</A>.

 2. He is <I>chosen out of the people,</I> one of us, bone of our bone,
 that takes part with us of flesh and blood. Being ordained for men, he 
 is taken from among men, that his terror might not make us afraid. 

 3.  God has found him. He is a Saviour of God's own providing; for the
 salvation, from first to last, is purely the Lord's doing.  <I>He has
 found the ransom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:24">Job xxxiii. 24</A>.

 We could never have found a person fit to undertake this great work,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:3,4">Rev. v. 3, 4</A>.

 4. God has <I>laid help upon him,</I> not only helped him, but 
 treasured up help in him for us, laid it as a charge upon him to help 
 fallen man up again, to help the chosen remnant to heaven. <I>In me is 
 thy help,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+13:9">Hos. xiii. 9</A>.

 5. He has exalted him, by constituting him the prophet, priest, and
 king of his church, clothing him with power, raising him from the dead,
 and setting him at his own right hand. Whom God chooses and uses he
 will exalt. 

 6. He has anointed him, has qualified him for his office, and so
 confirmed him in it, by giving him the Spirit, not by measure, but
 without measure, infinitely above his fellows. He is called
 <I>Messiah,</I> or <I>Christ,</I> the <I>Anointed.</I> 

 7. In all this he designed him to be his own servant, for the
 accomplishing of his eternal purpose and the advancement of the 
 interests of his kingdom among men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The promises made to this chosen one, to David in the type and the 
 Son of David in the antitype, in which not only gracious, but glorious 
 things are spoken of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. With reference to himself, as king and God's servant: and what makes 
 for him makes for all his loving subjects. It is here promised, 

 (1.) That God would stand by him and strengthen him in his undertaking

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:21"><I>v.</I>  21</A>):

 <I>With him my hand</I> not only shall be, but <I>shall be 
 established,</I> by promise, shall be so established that he shall by 
 it be established and confirmed in all his offices, so that none of 
 them shall be undermined and overthrown, though by the man of sin they 
 shall all be usurped and fought against. Christ had a great deal of 
 hard work to do and hard usage to go through; but he that gave him 
 commission gave him forces sufficient for the execution of his 
 commission: "<I>My arm also shall strengthen him</I> to break through 
 and bear up under all his difficulties." No good work can miscarry in 
 the hand of those whom God himself undertakes to strengthen. 

 (2.) That he should be victorious over his enemies, that they should 
 not encroach upon him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>The son of wickedness shall not exact upon him,</I> nor afflict him. 
 He that at first broke the peace would set himself against him that 
 undertook to make peace, and do what he could to blast his design: but 
 he could only reach to bruise his heel; further he could not exact upon 
 him nor afflict him. Christ became a surety for our debt, and thereby 
 Satan and death thought to gain advantage against him; but he satisfied 
 the demands of God's justice, and then they could not exact upon him. 
 <I>The prince of this world cometh, but he has nothing in me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:30">John xiv. 30</A>.

 Nay, they not only shall not prevail against him, but they shall fall
 before him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>I will bend down his foes before his face;</I> the prince of this 
 world shall be cast out, principalities and powers spoiled, and he 
 shall be the death of death itself, and the destruction of the grave, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+13:14">Hos. xiii. 14</A>.

 Some apply this to the ruin which God brought upon the Jewish nation,
 that persecuted Christ and put him to death.  But all Christ's enemies, 
 who hate him and will not have him to reign over them, shall be brought 
 forth and slain before him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:27">Luke xix. 27</A>.

 (3.) That he should be the great trustee of the covenant between God
 and men, that God would be gracious and true to us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him.</I> They were with 
 David; God continued merciful to him, and so approved himself faithful. 
 They were with Christ; God made good all his promises to him. But that 
 is not all; God's mercy to us, and his faithfulness to us, are with 
 Christ; he is not only pleased with him, but with us in him; and it is 
 in him that all the promises of God are yea and amen. So that if any 
 poor sinners hope for benefit by the faithfulness and mercy of God, let 
 them know it is with Christ; it is lodged in his hand, and to him they 
 must apply for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>My mercy will I keep for him,</I> to be disposed of by him, <I>for 
 evermore;</I> in the channel of Christ's mediation all the streams of 
 divine goodness will for ever run.  Therefore it is <I>the mercy of our 
 Lord Jesus Christ</I> which we <I>look for unto eternal life,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:21,Joh+17:2">Jude 21; John xvii. 2</A>.

 And, as the mercy of God flows to us through him, so the promise of God
 is, through him, firm to us: <I>My covenant shall stand fast with
 him,</I> both the covenant of redemption made with him and the covenant
 of grace made with us in him.  The new covenant is <I>therefore</I>
 always new, and firmly established, because it is lodged in the hands
 of a Mediator, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:6">Heb. viii. 6</A>.

 The covenant stands fast, because it stands upon this basis.  And this
 redounds to the everlasting honour of the Lord Jesus, that to him the
 great cause between God and man is entirely referred and the Father has
 committed all judgment to him, that <I>all men might honour him</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:22,23">John v. 22, 23</A>);

 therefore it is here said, <I>In my name shall his horn be exalted;</I> 
 this shall be his glory, that God's <I>name is in him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:21">Exod. xxiii. 21</A>),

 and that he acts in God's name. <I>As the Father gave me commandment,
 so I do.</I> 

 (4.) That his kingdom should be greatly enlarged

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):
 
 <I>I will set his hand in the sea</I> (he shall have the dominion of 
 the seas, and the isles of the sea), and <I>his right hand in the 
 rivers,</I> the inland countries that are watered with rivers. David's 
 kingdom extended itself to the Great Sea, and the Red Sea, to the river 
 of Egypt and the river Euphrates. But it is in the kingdom of the 
 Messiah that this has its full accomplishment, and shall have more and 
 more, when <I>the kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of 
 the Lord and of his Christ</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:15">Rev. xi. 15</A>),

 and <I>the isles shall wait for his law.</I>

 (5.) That he should own God as his Father, and God would own him as his 
 Son, his firstborn,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>.

 This is a comment upon these words in Nathan's message concerning 
 Solomon (for he also was a type of Christ as well as David), <I>I will 
 be his Father and he shall be my Son</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:14">2 Sam. vii. 14</A>),

 and the relation shall be owned on both sides. 

 [1.] <I>He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father.</I> It is probable 
 that Solomon did so; but we are sure Christ did so, in the days of his 
 flesh, when he offered up strong cries to God, and called him <I>holy 
 Father, righteous Father,</I> and taught us to address ourselves to him 
 as <I>our Father in heaven.</I> Christ, in his agony, cried unto God, 
 <I>Thou art my Father</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:39,42">Matt. xxvi. 39, 42</A>,

 <I>O my Father</I>), and, upon the cross, <I>Father, forgive them; 
 Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.</I> He looked upon him 
 likewise as his God, and therefore he perfectly obeyed him, and 
 submitted to his will in his whole undertaking (he is<I>my God and your 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:17">John xx. 17</A>),

 and as the rock of his salvation, who would bear him up and bear him
 out in his undertaking, and make him more than a conqueror, even a 
 complete Saviour; and therefore with an undaunted resolution he 
 <I>endured the cross, despising the shame,</I> for he knew he should be 
 both justified and glorified. 

 [2.] <I>I will make him my firstborn.</I> I see not how this can be 
 applied to David; it is Christ's prerogative to be <I>the firstborn of 
 every creature,</I> and, as such, the <I>heir of all things,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:15,Heb+1:2,6">Col. i. 15; Heb. i. 2, 6</A>.

 When <I>all power was given to Christ both in heaven and in earth, and 
 all things were delivered unto him by the Father,</I> then god made him 
 his firstborn, and far higher, more great and honourable, than the 
 kings of the earth; for he is the King of kings, <I>angels, 
 authorities, and powers, being made subject to him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:22">1 Pet.  iii. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. With reference to his seed. God's covenants always took in the seed 
 of the covenanters; this does so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:29,36"><I>v.</I> 29, 36</A>):

 <I>His seed shall endure for ever,</I> and with it his throne. Now this 
 will be differently understood according as we apply it to Christ or 
 David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) If we apply it to David, by his seed we are to understand his 
 successors, Solomon and the following kings of Judah, who descended 
 from the loins of David. It is supposed that they might degenerate, and 
 not walk in the spirit and steps of their father David; in such a case 
 they must expect to come under divine rebukes, such as the house of 
 David was at this time under, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 But let this encourage them, that, though they were corrected, they 
 should not be abandoned or disinherited. This refers to that part of 
 Nathan's message

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:14,15">2 Sam. vii. 14, 15</A>),

 <I>If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him,</I> but <I>my mercy shall
 not depart from him.</I> Thus far David's seed and throne did endure 
 for ever, that, notwithstanding the wickedness of many of his 
 posterity, who were the scandals of his house, yet his family 
 continued, and continued in the imperial dignity, a very long 
 time,--that, as long as Judah continued a kingdom, David's posterity 
 were kings of it, and the royalty of that kingdom was never in any 
 other family, as that of the ten tribes was, in Jeroboam's first, then 
 in Baasha's, &c.,--and that the family of David continued a family of 
 distinction till that Son of David came whose throne should endure for 
 ever; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:27,32,2:4,11">Luke i. 27, 32; ii. 4, 11</A>.

 If David's posterity, in after-times, should forsake God and their duty
 and revolt to the ways of sin, God would bring desolating judgments
 upon them and ruin the family; and yet he would not take away his
 lovingkindness from David, nor break his covenant with him; for, in the
 Messiah, who should come out of his loins, all these promises shall
 have their accomplishment to the full.  Thus, when the Jews were
 rejected, the apostle shows that God's covenant with Abraham was not
 broken, because it was fulfilled in his spiritual seed, the heirs of
 the righteousness of faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:7">Rom.  xi. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) If we apply it to Christ, by his seed we are to understand his 
 subjects, all believers, his spiritual seed, the children which God has 
 given him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:13">Heb. ii. 13</A>.

 This is that seed which shall be made to endure for ever, and his
 throne in the midst of them, in the church in the heart, <I>as the days 
 of heaven.</I> To the end Christ shall have a people in the world to 
 serve and honour him. <I>He shall see his seed; he shall prolong his 
 days.</I> This holy seed shall endure for ever in a glorified state, 
 when time and days shall be no more; and thus Christ's throne and 
 kingdom shall be perpetuated: the kingdom of his grace shall continue 
 through all the ages of time and the kingdom of his glory to the 
 endless ages of eternity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The continuance of Christ's kingdom is here made doubtful by the 
 sins and afflictions of his subjects; their iniquities and calamities 
 threaten the ruin of it. This case is here put, that we may not be 
 offended when it comes to be a case in fact, but that we may reconcile 
 it with the stability of the covenant and be assured of that 
 notwithstanding. <I>First,</I> It is here supposed that there will be 
 much amiss in the subjects of Christ's kingdom. His children may 
 <I>forsake God's law</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>)

 by omissions, and <I>break his statutes</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>)

 by commissions.  There are spots which are the spots of God's children,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:5">Deut. xxxii. 5</A>.

 Many corruptions there are in the bowels of the church, as well as in
 the hearts of those who are the members of it, and these corruptions
 break out. <I>Secondly,</I> They are here told that they must smart for
 it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>I will visit their transgression with a rod,</I> their transgression 
 sooner than that of others. <I>You only have I known, and therefore I 
 will punish you,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:2">Amos iii. 2</A>.

 Their being related to Christ shall not excuse them from being called
 to an account. But observe what affliction is to God's people. 

 1. It is but a rod, not an axe, not a sword; it is for correction, not 
 for destruction. This denotes gentleness in the affliction; it is the 
 rod of men, such a rod as men use in correcting their children; and it 
 denotes a design of good in and by the affliction, such a rod as yields 
 the peaceable fruit of righteousness.  

 2. It is a rod on the hand of God <I>(I will visit them</I>), he who is 
 wise, and knows what he does, gracious, and will do what is best. 

 3. It is a rod which they shall never feel the smart of but when there
 is great need: <I>If they break my law, then I will visit their 
 transgression with the rod,</I> but not else. Then it is requisite that 
 God's honour be vindicated, and that they be humbled and reduced.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] The continuance of Christ's kingdom is made certain by the 
 inviolable promise and oath of God, notwithstanding all this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):
 
 <I>Nevertheless, my kindness will I not</I> totally and finally <I>take 
 from him. First,</I> "Notwithstanding their provocations, yet my 
 covenant shall not be broken." Note, Afflictions are not only 
 consistent with covenant-love, but to the people of God they flow from 
 it. Though David's seed be chastened, it does not follow that they are 
 disinherited; they may be cast down, but they are not cast off. God's 
 favour is continued to his people, 

 1. For Christ's sake; in him the mercy is laid up for us, and God says, 
 <I>I will not take it from him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 <I>I will not lie unto David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 We are unworthy, but he is worthy.

 2. For the covenant's sake: <I>My faithfulness shall not fail,
 my covenant will I not break.</I> It was supposed that they had broken 
 God's statutes, <I>profaned and polluted</I> them (so the word 
 signifies); "But," says God, "I will not break, I will not profane and 
 pollute, my covenant;" it is the same word. That which is said and 
 sworn is that God will have a church in the world as long as sun and 
 moon endure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>.

 The sun and moon are faithful witnesses in heaven of the wisdom, power, 
 and goodness of the Creator, and shall continue while time lasts, which 
 they are the measurers of; but the <I>seed of Christ shall be 
 established for ever,</I> as <I>lights of the world</I> while the world 
 stands, to shine in it, and, when it is at an end, they shall be 
 established lights shining in the firmament of the Father.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>38  But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth
 with thine anointed.
 &nbsp; 39  Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast
 profaned his crown <I>by casting it</I> to the ground.
 &nbsp; 40  Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his
 strong holds to ruin.
 &nbsp; 41  All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his
 neighbours.
 &nbsp; 42  Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou
 hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
 &nbsp; 43  Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not
 made him to stand in the battle.
 &nbsp; 44  Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down

 &nbsp; 45  The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered

 swarest unto David in thy truth?
 &nbsp; 50  Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; <I>how</I> I do
 bear in my bosom <I>the reproach of</I> all the mighty people;

 they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A very melancholy complaint of the present deplorable state of 
 David's family, which the psalmist thinks hard to be reconciled to the 
 covenant God made with David. "Thou saidst thou wouldst not <I>take 
 away thy lovingkindness, but thou hast cast off.</I>" Sometimes, it is 
 no easy thing to reconcile God's providences with his promises, and yet 
 we are sure they are reconcilable; for God's works fulfil his word and 
 never contradict it. 

 1. David's house seemed to have lost its interest in God, which was the 
 greatest strength and beauty of it. God had been pleased with his 
 anointed, but now he was <I>wroth with him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:38"><I>v.</I>  38</A>),

 had entered into covenant with the family, but now, for aught he could 
 perceive, he had made void the covenant, not broken some of the 
 articles of it, but cancelled it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 We misconstrue the rebukes of Providence if we think they make void the 
 covenant. When the great anointed one, Christ himself, was upon the 
 cross, God seemed to have cast him off, and was wroth with him, and yet 
 did not make void his covenant with him, for that was established for 
 ever. 

 2. The honour of the house of David was lost and laid in the dust: 
 <I>Thou hast profaned his crown</I> (which was always looked upon as 
 sacred) by <I>casting it to the ground,</I> to be trampled on,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:39"><I>v.</I>  39</A>.

 <I>Thou hast made his glory to cease</I> (so uncertain is all earthly 
 glory, and so soon does it wither) and <I>thou hast cast his throne 
 down to the ground,</I> not only dethroned the king, but put a period 
 to the kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 If it was penned in Rehoboam's time, it was true as to the greatest 
 part of the kingdom, five parts of six; if in Zedekiah's time, it was 
 more remarkably true of the poor remainder.  Note, Thrones and crowns 
 are tottering things, and are often laid in the dust; but there is a 
 crown of glory reserved for Christ's spiritual seed which fadeth not 
 away. 

 3.  It was exposed and made a prey to all the neighbours, who insulted
 over that ancient and honourable family

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>):

 <I>Thou hast broken down all his hedges</I> (all those things that were 
 a defence to them, and particularly that hedge of protection which they 
 thought God's covenant and promise had made about them) and thou 
 <I>hast made even his strong-holds a ruin,</I> so that they were rather 
 a reproach to them than any shelter; and then, <I>All that pass by the 
 way spoil him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>)
 
 and make an easy prey of him; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:12,13">Ps. lxxx. 12, 13</A>.

 The enemies talk insolently: <I>He is a reproach to his neighbours,</I>
 who triumph in his fall from so great a degree of honour. Nay, every 
 one helps forward the calamity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries,</I> not only 
 given them power, but inclined them to turn their power this way." If 
 the enemies of the church lift up their hand against it, we must see 
 God setting up their hand; for they could have <I>no power unless it 
 were given them from above.</I> But, when God does permit them to do 
 mischief to his church, it pleases them: "<I>Thou hast made all his 
 enemies to rejoice;</I> and this is for thy glory, that those who hate 
 thee should have the pleasure to see the tears and troubles of those 
 that love thee." 
 
 4. It was disabled to help itself
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast turned the edge of his sword,</I> and made it blunt, that 
 it cannot do execution as it has done; and (which is worse) thou hast 
 turned the edge of his spirit, and taken off his courage, <I>and hast 
 not made him to stand</I> as he used to do <I>in the battle.</I>" The 
 spirit of men is what the Father and former of spirits makes them; nor 
 can we stand with any strength or resolution further than God is 
 pleased to uphold us. If men's hearts fail them, it is God that 
 dispirits them; but it is sad with the church when those cannot stand 
 who should stand up for it. 

 5. It was upon the brink of an inglorious exit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>):

 <I>The days of his youth hast thou shortened;</I> it is ready to be cut 
 off, like a young man in the flower of his age. This seems to intimate 
 that the psalm was penned in Rehoboam's time, when the house of David 
 was but in the days of its youth, and yet waxed old and began to decay 
 already. Thus it was covered with shame, and it was turned very much to 
 its reproach that a family which, in the first and second reign, looked 
 so great, and made such a figure, should, in the third, dwindle and 
 look so little as the house of David did in Rehoboam's time. But it may 
 be applied to the captivity in Babylon, which, in comparison with what 
 was expected, was but the day of the youth of that kingdom. However, 
 the kings then had remarkably the <I>days of their youth shortened,</I> 
 for it was in the days of their youth, when they were about thirty 
 years old, that Jehoiachin and Zedekiah were carried captives to 
 Babylon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 From all this complaint let us learn, 

 1. What work sin makes with families, noble royal families, with 
 families in which religion has been uppermost; when posterity 
 degenerates, it falls into disgrace, and iniquity stains their glory. 

 2. How apt we are to place the promised honour and happiness of the 
 church in something external, and to think the promise fails, and the 
 covenant is made void, if we be disappointed of that, a mistake which 
 we now are inexcusable if we fall into, since our Master has so 
 expressly told us that his kingdom is not of this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A very pathetic expostulation with God upon this. Four things they 
 plead with God for mercy:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The long continuance of the trouble 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>):

 <I>How long, O Lord!  wilt thou hide thyself? For ever?</I> That which 
 grieved them most was that God himself, as one displeased, did not 
 appear to them by his prophets to comfort them, did not appear for them 
 by his providences to deliver them, and that he had kept them long in 
 the dark; it seemed an eternal night, when God had withdrawn: <I>Thou 
 hidest thyself for ever.</I> Nay, God not only hid himself from them, 
 but seemed to set himself against them: "<I>Shall thy wrath burn like 
 fire?</I> How long shall it burn? Shall it never be put out? What is 
 hell, but the wrath of God, burning for ever? And is that the lot of 
 thy anointed?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The shortness of life, and the certainty of death: "Lord, let thy 
 anger cease, and return thou, in mercy to us, remembering how short my 
 time is and how sure the period of my time. Lord, since my life is so 
 transitory, and will, ere long, be at an end, let it not be always so 
 miserable that I should rather choose no being at all than such a 
 being." Job pleads thus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:20,21"><I>ch.</I> x. 20, 21</A>.

 And probably the psalmist here urges it in the name of the house of
 David, and the present prince of that house, the <I>days of whose 
 youth</I> were <I>shortened,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:45"><I>v.</I>  45</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He pleads the shortness and vanity of life 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>):

 <I>Remember how short my time is, how transitory I am</I> (say some), 
 therefore unable to bear the power of thy wrath, and therefore a proper 
 object of thy pity. <I>Wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?</I> 
 or, <I>Unto what vanity hast thou created all the sons of Adam!</I> 
 Now, this may be understood either, 

 [1.] As declaring a great truth. If the ancient lovingkindnesses spoken 
 of

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>)

 be forgotten (those relating to another life), man is indeed made in 
 vain. Considering man as mortal, if there were not a future state on 
 the other side of death, we might be ready to think that man was made 
 in vain, and was in vain endued with the noble powers and faculties of 
 reason and filled with such vast designs and desires; but God would not 
 make man in vain; therefore, Lord, <I>remember those 
 lovingkindnesses.</I> Or, 

 [2.] As implying a strong temptation that the psalmist was in. It is 
 certain <I>God has not made all men,</I> nor any man, <I>in vain,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:18">Isa. xlv. 18</A>.

 For, <I>First,</I> If we think that God has made men in vain because so 
 many have short lives, and long afflictions, in this world, it is true 
 that God has made them so, but it is not true that <I>therefore</I> 
 they are made in vain.  For those whose days are few and full of 
 trouble may yet glorify God and do some good, may keep their communion 
 with God and get to heaven, and then they are not made in vain. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> If we think that God has made men in vain because the 
 most of men neither serve him nor enjoy him, it is true that, as to 
 themselves, they were made in vain, better for them had they not been 
 born than not to be born again; but it was not owing to God that they 
 were made in vain; it was owing to themselves; nor are they made in 
 vain as to him, for he has <I>made all things for himself, even the 
 wicked for the day of evil,</I> and those whom he is not glorified by 
 he will be glorified upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He pleads the universality and unavoidableness of death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>):
 
 "<I>What man</I>" (what <I>strong man,</I> so the word is) "<I>is he 
 that liveth and shall not see death?</I> The king himself, of the house 
 of David, is not exempted from the sentence, from the stroke. Lord, 
 since he is under a fatal necessity of dying, let not his whole life be 
 made thus miserable. <I>Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the 
 grave?</I> No, he shall not when his time has come. Let him not 
 therefore be delivered into the hand of the grave by the miseries of a 
 dying life, till his time shall come." We must learn here that death is 
 the end of all men; our eyes must shortly be closed to see death; there 
 is no discharge from that war, nor will any bail be taken to save us 
 from the prison of the grave. It concerns us therefore to make sure a 
 happiness on the other side of death and the grave, that, <I>when we 
 fail, we may be received into everlasting habitations.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The next plea is taken from the kindness God had for and the
 covenant he made with his servant David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:49"><I>v.</I> 49</A>):

 "<I>Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses,</I> which thou 
 showedst, nay, <I>which thou swaredst, to David in thy truth?</I> Wilt 
 thou fail of doing what thou hast promised? Wilt thou undo what thou 
 hast done? Art not thou still the same? Why then may not we have the 
 benefit of the former sure mercies of David?" God's unchangeableness 
 and faithfulness assure us that God will not cast off those whom he has 
 chosen and covenanted with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The last plea is taken from the insolence of the enemies and the 
 indignity done to God's anointed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:50,51"><I>v.</I> 50, 51</A>):

 "<I>Remember, Lord, the reproach,</I> and let it be rolled away from us 
 and returned upon our enemies." 

 (1.) They were God's servants that were reproached, and the abuses done 
 to them reflected upon their master, especially since it was for 
 serving him that they were reproached. 

 (2.) The reproach cast upon God's servants was a very grievous burden 
 to all that were concerned for the honour of God: "<I>I bear in my 
 bosom the reproach of all the mighty people,</I> and am even 
 overwhelmed with it; it is what I lay much to heart and can scarcely 
 keep up my spirits under the weight of." 

 (3.) "They are thy enemies who do thus reproach us; and wilt thou not 
 appear against them as such?" 

 (4.) <I>They have reproached the footsteps of thy anointed.</I> They 
 reflected upon all the steps which the king had taken in the course of 
 his administration, tracked him in all his motions, that they might 
 make invidious remarks upon every thing he had said and done. Or, if we 
 may apply it to Christ, the Lord's Messiah, they reproached the Jews 
 with his footsteps, the slowness of his coming. They have reproached 
 the delays of the Messiah; so Dr. Hammond. They called him, <I>He that 
 should come;</I> but, because he had not yet come, because he did not 
 now come to deliver them out of the hands of their enemies, when they 
 had none to deliver them, they told them he would never come, they must 
 give over looking for him. The scoffers of the latter days do, in like 
 manner, reproach the footsteps of the Messiah when they ask, <I>Where 
 is the promise of his coming?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:3,4">2 Pet. iii. 3, 4</A>.

 The reproaching of the footsteps of the anointed some refer to the
 serpent's <I>bruising the heel of the seed of the woman,</I> or to the 
 sufferings of Christ's followers, who tread in his footsteps, and are 
 reproached for his name's sake.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The psalm concludes with praise, even after this sad complaint 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:52"><I>v.</I>  52</A>):

 <I>Blessed be the Lord for evermore, Amen, and amen.</I> Thus he 
 confronts the reproaches of his enemies. The more others blaspheme God 
 the more we should bless him. Thus he corrects his own complaints, 
 chiding himself for quarrelling with God's providences and questioning 
 his promises; let both these sinful passions be silenced with the 
 praises of God. However it be, yet God is good, and we will never think 
 hardly of him; God is true, and we will never distrust him. Though the 
 glory of David's house be stained and sullied, this shall be our 
 comfort, that God is blessed for ever, and his glory cannot be 
 eclipsed. If we would have the comfort of the stability of God's 
 promise, we must give him the praise of it; in blessing God, we 
 encourage ourselves. Here is a double <I>Amen,</I> according to the 
 double signification. <I>Amen--so it is,</I> God is blessed for ever.  
 <I>Amen--be it so,</I> let God be blessed for ever. He began the psalm 
 with thanksgiving, before he made his complaint 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 and now he concludes it with a doxology. Those who give God thanks for 
 what he has done may give him thanks also for what he will do; God will 
 follow those with his mercies who, in a right manner, follow him with 
 their praises.</P>
