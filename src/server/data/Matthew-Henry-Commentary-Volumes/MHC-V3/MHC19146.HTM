 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This and all the rest of the psalms that follow begin and end with 
 Hallelujah, a word which puts much of God's praise into a little 
 compass; for in it we praise him by his name Jah, the contraction of 
 Jehovah. In this excellent psalm of praise, 

 I. The psalmist engages himself to praise God,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. He engages others to trust in him, which is one necessary and
 acceptable way of praising him. 

 1. He shows why we should not trust in men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 2. Why we should trust in God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:5">ver. 5</A>),

 because of his power in the kingdom of nature 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:6">ver. 6</A>),

 his dominion in the kingdom of providence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:7">ver. 7</A>),

 and his grace in the kingdom of the Messiah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>),

 that everlasting kingdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:10">ver. 10</A>),

 to which many of the Jewish writers refer this psalm, and to which 
 therefore we should have an eye, in the singing of it.</P>

 David is supposed to have penned this psalm; and he was himself a 
 prince, a mighty prince; as such, it might be thought, 

 1. That he should be exempted from the service of praising God, that it
 was enough for him to see that his priests and people did it, but that 
 he needed not to do it himself in his own person. Michal thought it a 
 disparagement to him to <I>dance before the ark;</I> but he was so far 
 from being of this mind that he would himself be first and foremost in 
 the work,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 He considered his dignity as so far from excusing him from it that it 
 rather obliged him to lead in it, and he thought it so far from 
 lessening him that it really magnified him; therefore he stirred up 
 himself to it and to make a business of it: <I>Praise the Lord, O my 
 soul!</I> and he resolved to abide by it: "I will praise him with my 
 heart, <I>I will sing praises</I> to him with my mouth. Herein I will 
 have an eye to him as <I>the Lord,</I> infinitely blessed and glorious 
 in himself, and as <I>my God,</I> in covenant with me." Praise is most 
 pleasant when, in praising God, we have an eye to him as ours, whom we 
 have an interest in and stand in relation to. "This I will do 
 constantly while I live, every day of my life, and to my life's end; 
 nay, I will do it <I>while I have any being,</I> for when I have no 
 being on earth I hope to have a being in heaven, a better being, to be 
 doing it better." That which is the great end of our being ought to be 
 our great employment and delight while we have any being. "In thee must 
 our time and powers be spent." 

 2. It might be thought that he himself, having been so great a blessing
 to his country, should be adored, according to the usage of the heathen 
 nations, who deified their heroes, that they should all come and 
 <I>trust in his shadow</I> and make him their <I>stay</I> and 
 <I>strong-hold.</I> "No," says David, "<I>Put not your trust in 
 princes</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 not in me, not in any other; do not repose your confidence in them; do 
 not raise your expectations from them. Be not too sure of their 
 sincerity; some have thought they knew better how to reign by knowing 
 how to dissemble. Be not too sure of their constancy and fidelity; it 
 is possible they may both change their minds and break their words." 
 But, though we suppose them very wise and as good as David himself, yet 
 we must not be too sure of their ability and continuance, for they are 
 sons of Adam, weak and mortal. There is indeed a Son of man in whom 
 there is help, in whom there is salvation, and who will not fail those 
 that trust in him. But all other sons of men are like the man they are 
 sprung of, who, being in honour, did not abide.

 (1.) We cannot be sure of their ability. Even the power of kings may be 
 so straitened, cramped, and weakened, that they may not be in a 
 capacity to do that for us which we expect. David himself owned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:39">2 Sam. iii. 39</A>),

 <I>I am this day weak, though anointed king.</I> So that <I>in the son 
 of man there is</I> often <I>no help,</I> no salvation; he is at a 
 loss, at his wits' end, as <I>a man astonished,</I> and then, though 
 <I>a mighty man,</I> he <I>cannot save,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:9">Jer. xiv. 9</A>.

 (2.) We cannot be sure of their continuance. Suppose he has it in his
 power to help us while he lives, yet he may be suddenly taken off when 
 we expect most from him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>His breath goes forth,</I> so it does every moment, and comes back 
 again, but that is an intimation that it will shortly go for good and 
 all, and then <I>he returns to his earth.</I> The earth is his, in 
 respect of his original as a man, the earth out of which he was taken, 
 and to which therefore he must return, according to the sentence, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:19">Gen. iii. 19</A>.

 It is his, if he be a worldly man, in respect of choice, his earth 
 which he has chosen for his portion, and on the things of which he has 
 set his affections. He shall go to his own place. Or, rather, it is his 
 earth because of the property he has in it; and though he has had large 
 possessions on earth a grave is all that will remain to him. <I>The
 earth God has given to the children of men,</I> and great striving 
 there is about it, and, as a mark of their authority, men <I>call their 
 lands by their own names.</I> But, after a while, no part of the earth 
 will be their own but that in which the dead body shall make its bed, 
 and that shall be theirs <I>while the earth remains.</I> But, when he 
 returns to his earth, <I>in that very day his thoughts perish;</I> all 
 the projects and designs he had of kindness to us vanish and are gone, 
 and he cannot take one step further in them; all his purposes are cut 
 off and buried with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+17:11">Job xvii. 11</A>.

 And then what becomes of our expectations from him? Princes are mortal, 
 as well as other men, and therefore we cannot have that assurance of 
 help from them which we may have from that Potentate who hath 
 immortality. <I>Cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils</I>
 and will not be there long.</P>

 whose hope <I>is</I> in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his God:

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist, having cautioned us not to trust in princes (because, if 
 we do, we shall be miserably disappointed), here encourages us to put 
 our confidence in God, because, if we do so, we shall be happily 
 secured: <I>Happy is he that has the God of Jacob for his help,</I>
 that has an interest in his attributes and promises, and has them 
 engaged for him, and <I>whose hope is in the Lord his God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let us take a view of the character here given of those whom God 
 will uphold. Those shall have God for their help, 

 1. Who take him for their God, and serve and worship him accordingly.
 
 2. Who have their hope in him, and live a life of dependence upon him,
 who have good thoughts of him, and encourage themselves in him, when 
 all other supports fail. Every believer may look upon him as the God of 
 Jacob, of the church in general, and therefore may expect relief from 
 him, in reference to public distresses, and as his God in particular, 
 and therefore may depend upon him in all personal wants and straits. We 
 must hope,

 (1.) In the providence of God for all the good things we need, which 
 relate to the life that now is. 

 (2.) In the grace of Christ for all the good things which relate to the 
 life that is to come. To this especially the learned Dr. Hammond refers 
 this and the following verses, looking upon the latter part of this 
 psalm to have a most visible remarkable aspect towards the eternal Son 
 of God in his incarnation. He quotes one of the rabbies, who says of 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>

 that it belongs to the days of the Messiah. And that it does so he 
 thinks will appear by comparing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>,

 with the characters Christ gives of the Messiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:5,6">Matt. xi. 5, 6</A>),

 <I>The blind receive their sight, the lame walk;</I> and the closing 
 words there, <I>Blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in 
 me,</I> he thinks may very well be supposed to refer to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 <I>Happy is the man that hopes in the Lord his God,</I> and who is not 
 offended in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us take a view of the great encouragements here given us to 
 hope in <I>the Lord our God.</I> 

 1. He is the <I>Maker of the world,</I> and therefore has all power in
 himself, and the command of the powers of all the creatures, which, 
 being derived from him, depend upon him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>He made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is,</I> and 
 therefore his arm is not shortened, that it cannot save. It is very 
 applicable to Christ, by whom God made the world, and <I>without whom 
 was not any thing made that was made.</I> It is a great support to 
 faith that the Redeemer of the world is the same that was the Creator 
 of it, and therefore has a good-will to it, a perfect knowledge of its 
 case, and power to help it. 

 2. He is a God of inviolable fidelity. We may venture to take God's
 word, for he <I>keepeth truth for ever,</I> and therefore no word of 
 his shall fall to the ground; it is true <I>from the beginning,</I> and 
 therefore true <I>to the end.</I> Our Lord Jesus is the Amen, <I>the 
 faithful witness,</I> as well as <I>the beginning,</I> the author and 
 principle, <I>of the creation of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:14">Rev. iii. 14</A>.

 The keeping of God's truth for ever is committed to him, for <I>all the 
 promises</I> are in him <I>yea and amen.</I> 

 3. He is the patron of injured innocency: <I>He pleads the cause of the
 oppressed,</I> and (as we read it) he <I>executes judgment</I> for 
 them. He often does it in his providence, giving redress to those that 
 suffer wrong and clearing up their integrity. He will do it in the 
 judgment of the great day. The Messiah came to rescue the children of 
 men out of the hands of Satan the great oppressor, and, all judgment 
 being committed to him, the executing of judgment upon persecutors is 
 so among the rest,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:15">Jude 15</A>.

 4. He is a bountiful benefactor to the necessitous: <I>He gives food to
 the hungry;</I> so God does in an ordinary way for the answering of the 
 cravings of nature; so he has done sometimes in an extraordinary way, 
 as when ravens fed Elijah; so Christ did more than once when he fed 
 thousands miraculously with that which was intended but for one meal or 
 two for his own family. This encourages us to hope in him as the 
 nourisher of our souls with the bread of life. 

 5. He is the author of liberty to those that were bound: <I>The Lord
 looseth the prisoners.</I> He brought Israel out of the house of 
 bondage in Egypt and afterwards in Babylon. The miracles Christ 
 wrought, in making the dumb to speak and the deaf to hear with that one 
 word, <I>Ephphatha--Be opened,</I> his cleansing lepers, and so 
 discharging them from their confinements, and his raising the dead out 
 of their graves, may all be included in this one of <I>loosing the 
 prisoners;</I> and we may take encouragement from those to hope in him 
 for that spiritual liberty which he came to proclaim,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:1,2">Isa. lxi. 1, 2</A>.

 6. He gives sight to those that have been long deprived of it; <I>The
 Lord can open the eyes of the blind,</I> and has often given to his 
 afflicted people to see that comfort which before they were not aware 
 of; witness 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+21:19">Gen. xxi. 19</A>,
 
 and the prophet's servant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:17">2 Kings vi. 17</A>.

 But this has special reference to Christ; for <I>since the world began 
 was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born 
 blind</I> till Christ did it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:32">John ix. 32</A>)

 and thereby encouraged us to hope in him for spiritual illumination. 

 7. He sets that straight which was crooked, and makes those easy that
 were pained and ready to sink: He <I>raises those that are bowed 
 down,</I> by comforting and supporting them under their burdens, and, 
 in due time, removing their burdens. This was literally performed by 
 Christ when he made a poor woman straight that had been <I>bowed 
 together, and could in no wise lift up herself</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:12">Luke xiii. 12</A>);

 and he still does it by his grace, giving rest to those that were weary 
 and heavily laden, and raising up with his comforts those that were 
 humbled and cast down by convictions. 

 8. He has a constant kindness for all good people: <I>The Lord loveth
 the righteous,</I> and they may with the more confidence depend upon 
 his power when they are sure of his good-will. Our Lord Jesus showed 
 his love to the righteous <I>by fulfilling all righteousness.</I> 

 9. He has a tender concern for those that stand in special need of his
 care: <I>The Lord preserves the strangers.</I> It ought not to pass 
 without remark that the name of <I>Jehovah</I> is repeated here five 
 times in five lines, to intimate that it is an almighty power (that of 
 Jehovah) that is engaged and exerted for the relief of the oppressed, 
 and that it is as much the glory of God to succour those that are in 
 misery as it is to <I>ride on the heavens by his name Jah,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:4">Ps. lxviii. 4</A>.

 (1.) Strangers are exposed, and are commonly destitute of friends, but 
 <I>the Lord preserves them,</I> that they be not run down and ruined.
 Many a poor stranger has found the benefit of the divine protection and 
 been kept alive by it. 

 (2.) <I>Widows and fatherless children,</I> that have lost the head of 
 the family, who took care of the affairs of it, often fall into the 
 hands of those that make a prey of them, that will not do them justice, 
 nay, that will do them injustice; but <I>the Lord relieveth them,</I> 
 and raiseth up friends for them. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:22,23">Exod. xxii. 22, 23</A>.
 
 Our Lord Jesus came into the world to help the helpless, to receive 
 Gentiles, strangers, into his kingdom, and that with him poor sinners, 
 that are as fatherless, <I>may find mercy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:3">Hos. xiv. 3</A>.

 10. He will appear for the destruction of all those that oppose his 
 kingdom and oppress the faithful subjects of it: <I>The way of the 
 wicked he turns upside down,</I> and therefore let us <I>hope in 
 him,</I> and not be <I>afraid of the fury of the oppressor,</I> as 
 though he were <I>ready to destroy.</I> It is the glory of the Messiah 
 that he will subvert all the counsels of hell and earth that militate 
 against his church, so that, having him for us, we need not fear any 
 thing that can be done against us. 

 11. His kingdom shall continue through all the revolutions of time, to
 the utmost ages of eternity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Let <I>this</I> encourage us to trust in God at all times that <I>the 
 Lord shall reign for ever,</I> in spite of all the malignity of the 
 powers of darkness, <I>even thy God, O Zion! unto all generations.</I> 
 Christ is set King on the holy hill of Zion, and his kingdom shall 
 continue in an endless glory. It cannot be destroyed by an invader; it 
 shall not be left to a successor, either to a succeeding monarch or a 
 succeeding monarchy, but it shall stand for ever. It is matter of 
 unspeakable comfort that <I>the Lord reigns</I> as Zion's God, as 
 Zion's king, that the Messiah is head over all things to the church, 
 and will be so while the world stands.</P>
