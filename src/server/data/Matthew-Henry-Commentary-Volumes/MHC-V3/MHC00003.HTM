 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HESE</FONT> five books of scripture which are contained 
 in this third volume and which I have here endeavoured, according to 
 the measure of the gift given to me, to explain and improve, for the 
 use of those who desire to read them, not only with understanding, but 
 to their edification--though they have the same divine origin, design, 
 and authority, as those that went before, yet, upon some accounts, are 
 of a very different nature from them, and from the rest of the sacred 
 writings, such variety of methods has Infinite Wisdom seen fit to take 
 in conveying the light of divine revelation to the children of men, 
 that this heavenly food might have (as the Jews say of the manna) 
 something in it agreeable to every palate and suited to every 
 constitution. If every eye be not thus opened, every mouth will be 
 stopped, and such as perish in their ignorance will be left without 
 excuse. <I>We have piped unto you, and you have not danced, we have
 mourned unto you, and you have not lamented,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:17">Matt. xi. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The books of scripture have hitherto been, for the most part, very 
 plain and easy, narratives of matter of fact, which he that runs may 
 read and understand, and which are milk for babes, such as they can 
 receive and digest, and both entertain and nourish themselves with. The 
 waters of the sanctuary have hitherto been but to the ankles or to the 
 knees, such as a lamb might wade in, to drink of and wash in; but here 
 we are advanced to a higher form in God's school, and have books put 
 into our hands wherein are <I>many things dark and hard to be 
 understood,</I> which we do not apprehend the meaning of so suddenly 
 and so certainly as we could wish, the study of which requires a more 
 close application of mind, a greater intenseness of thought, and the 
 accomplishing of a diligent search, which yet the treasure hid in them, 
 when it is found, will abundantly recompense. The waters of the 
 sanctuary are here <I>to the loins,</I> and still as we go forward we 
 shall find the waters still risen in the prophetical books, <I>waters 
 to swim in</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+47:3-5">Ezek. xlvii. 3-5</A>),

 not fordable, nor otherwise to be passed over--depths in which an
 elephant will not find footing, <I>strong meat for strong men.</I> The 
 same method is observable in the New Testament, where we find the plain 
 history of Christ and his gospel placed first in the Evangelists and 
 the Acts of the Apostles; then the mystery of both in the Epistles, 
 which are more difficult to be understood; and, lastly, the prophesies 
 of things to come in the apocalyptic visions.  This method, so exactly 
 observed in both the Testaments, directs us in what order to proceed 
 both in studying the things of God ourselves and in teaching them to 
 others; we must go in the order that the scripture does; and where can 
 we expect to find a better method of divinity and a better method of 
 preaching?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We must begin with those things that are most plain and easy, as, 
 blessed be God, those things are which are most necessary to salvation 
 and of the greatest use. We must lay our foundation firm, in a sound 
 experimental knowledge of the principles of religion, and then the 
 super-structure will be well reared and will stand firmly. It is not 
 safe to launch out into the deep at first, nor to venture into points 
 difficult and controverted until we have first thoroughly digested the 
 elements of the oracles of God and turned them <I>in succum et 
 sanguinem--into juice and blood.</I> Those that begin their Bible at
 the wrong end commonly use their knowledge of it in the wrong way. And, 
 in training up others, we must be sure to ground them well at first in 
 those truths of God which are plain, and in some measure level to their 
 capacity, which we find they comprehend, and relish, and know how to 
 make use of, and not amuse those that are weak with things above them, 
 things of doubtful disputation, which they cannot apprehend any 
 certainty of nor advantage by. Our Lord Jesus spoke the word to the 
 people <I>as they were able to hear it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:33">Mark iv. 33</A>)

 and had many things to say to his disciples which he did not say
 because as yet they <I>could not bear them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:12,13">John xvi. 12, 13</A>.

 And those whom St. Paul <I>could not speak to as unto
 spiritual</I>--though he blamed them for their backwardness, yet he 
 accommodated himself to their weakness, and spoke to them <I>as unto 
 babes in Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:1,2">1 Cor. iii. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Yet we must not rest in these things. We must not be always children 
 that have need of milk, but nourished up with that, and gaining 
 strength, we must <I>go on to perfection</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:1">Heb. vi. 1</A>),

 that having, <I>by reason of use, our spiritual senses exercised</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:14">Heb. v. 14</A>),

 we may come to full age, and put away childish things, and,
 <I>forgetting the things which are behind,</I> that is, so well 
 remembering them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:13">Phil. iii. 13</A>)

 that we need not be still poring over them as those that are ever
 learning the same lesson, we may reach forth to the things which are 
 before. Though we must never think to learn above our Bible, as long as 
 we are here in this world, yet we must still be getting forward in it. 
 <I>You have dwelt long enough in this mountain;</I> now turn and take 
 your journey onward in the wilderness towards Canaan. Our motto must be 
 <I>Plus ultra--Onward.</I> And then shall we know if thus, by regular 
 steps

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:3">Hos. vi. 3</A>),

 we <I>follow on to know the Lord</I> and what the mind of the Lord
 is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The books of scripture have hitherto been mostly historical, but 
 now the matter is of another nature; it is doctrinal and devotional, 
 preaching and praying; and in this way of writing, as well as in the 
 former, a great deal of excellent knowledge is conveyed, which serves 
 very valuable purposes. It will be of good use to know not only what 
 others did that went before us, and how they fared, but what their 
 notions and sentiments were, what their thoughts and affections were, 
 that we may, with the help of them, form our minds aright. Plutarch's 
 Morals are reputed as a useful treasure in the commonwealth of learning 
 as Plutarch's Lives, and the wise disquisitions and discourses of the 
 philosophers as the records of the historians; nor is this divine 
 philosophy (if I may so call it), which we have in these books, less 
 needful, nor less serviceable, to the church, than the sacred history 
 was. Blessed be God for both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The Jews make these books to be given by a divine inspiration 
 somewhat different from that both of Moses and the prophets. They 
 divided the books of the Old Testament into the Law, the Prophets and 
 the <B><I>ktwbym</I></B>--<I>Writings,</I> which Epiphanius
 emphatically translates <B><I>grapheia</I></B>--<I>things written,</I>
 and these books are more commonly called among the Greeks 
 <B><I>Hagiographa</I></B>--<I>Holy writings:</I> the Jews attribute
 them to that distinct kind of inspiration which they call <B><I>rwh 
 hqds</I></B>--<I>The Holy Spirit.</I> Moses they supposed to write by 
 the Spirit in a way above all the other prophets, for <I>with him</I> 
 God spoke <I>mouth to mouth, even apparently</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+12:8">Num. xii. 8</A>)

 <I>knew him,</I> that is, conversed with him <I>face to face,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+34:10">Deut. xxxiv. 10</A>.

 He was made partaker of divine revelation (as Maimonides distinguishes, 
 <I>De Fund. Legis, c.</I> 7) <I>per vigiliam--while 
 awake,</I><SUP><A HREF="#{1}">1</A></SUP> whereas God manifested
 himself to all the other prophets in a dream or vision: and he adds 
 that Moses understood the words of prophecy without any perturbation or 
 astonishment of mind, whereas the other prophets commonly fainted and 
 were troubled. But the writers of the Hagiographa they suppose to be 
 inspired in a degree somewhat below that of the other prophets, and to 
 receive divine revelation, not as they did by dreams, and visions, and 
 voices, but (as Maimonides describes it, <I>More Nevochim--part</I> 2 
 <I>c.</I> 45) they perceived some power to rise within them, and rest 
 upon them, which urged and enabled them to write or speak far above 
 their own natural ability, in psalms or hymns, or in history or in 
 rules of good living, still enjoying the ordinary vigour and use of 
 their senses. Let David himself describe it. <I>The Spirit of the Lord 
 spoke by me, and his word was in my tongue; the God of Israel said, the 
 Rock of Israel spoke to me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:2,3">2 Sam. xxiii. 2, 3</A>.

 This gives such a magnificent account of the inspiration by which David
 wrote that I see not why it should be made inferior to that of the 
 other prophets, for David is expressly called <I>a prophet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:29,30">Acts ii. 29, 30</A>.

 But, since our hand is in with the Jewish masters, let us see what
 books they account Hagiographa.  These five that are now before us 
 come, without dispute, into this rank of sacred writers, and the book 
 of the Lamentations is not unfitly added to them. Indeed the Jews, when 
 they would speak critically, reckon all those songs which we meet with 
 in the Old Testament among the Hagiographa; for though they were penned 
 by prophets, and under the direction of the Holy Ghost, yet, because 
 they were not the proper result of a <I>visum propheticum--prophetic 
 vision,</I> they were not strictly prophecy. As to the historical 
 books, they distinguish (but I think it is a distinction without a 
 difference); some of them they assign to the prophets, calling them the 
 <I>prophet&aelig; priores--the former prophets,</I> namely, Joshua, 
 Judges, and the two books of the Kings; but others they rank among the 
 Hagiographa, as the book of Ruth (which yet is but an appendix to the 
 book of Judges), the two books of Chronicles, with Ezra, Nehemiah, and 
 the book of Esther, which last the rabbin have a great value for, and 
 think it is to be had in equal esteem with the law of Moses itself, 
 that it shall last as long as that lasts, and shall survive the 
 writings of the Prophets. And, <I>lastly,</I> they reckon the book of 
 Daniel among the Hagiographa,<SUP><A HREF="#{2}">2</A></SUP> for which 
 no reason can be given, since he was not inferior to any of the 
 prophets in the gift of prophecy; and therefore the learned Mr. Smith 
 thinks that their placing him among the Hagiographical writers was 
 fortuitous by mistake.<SUP><A HREF="#{3}">3</A></SUP> Mr. Smith, in his 
 Discourse before quoted, though he supposes this kind of divine 
 inspiration to be more "<I>pacate</I> and <I>serene</I> than that which
 was strictly called <I>prophecy,</I> not acting so much upon the 
 imagination, but seating itself in the higher and purer faculties of 
 the soul, yet shows that it manifested itself to be of a divine nature, 
 not only as it always elevated pious souls into strains of devotion, or 
 moved them strangely to dictate matters of true piety and goodness, but 
 as it came in abruptly upon the minds of those holy men, and 
 transported them from the temper of mind they were in before, so that 
 they perceived themselves captivated by the power of some higher light 
 than that which their own understanding commonly poured out upon them; 
 and this, says he, was a kind of vital form to that light of divine and 
 sanctified reason which they were perpetually possessed of and that 
 constant frame of holiness and goodness which dwelt in their hallowed 
 minds." We have reason to <I>glorify the God of Israel who gave such 
 power unto men</I> and has here transmitted to us the blessed products 
 of that power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The style and composition of these books are different from those 
 that go before and those that follow. Our Saviour divides the books of 
 the Old Testament into <I>the Law, the Prophets,</I> and <I>the
 Psalms</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:44">Luke xxiv. 44</A>),

 and thereby teaches us to distinguish those books that are poetical, or 
 metrical, from the Law and the Prophets; and such are all these that 
 are now before us, except Ecclesiastes, which yet, having something 
 restrained in its style, may well enough be reckoned among them.  They 
 are books in verse, according to the ancient rules of versifying, 
 though not according to the Greek and Latin <I>prosodies.</I> Some of 
 the ancients call these five books <I>the second Pentateuch of the Old 
 Testament,</I><SUP><A HREF="#{4}">4</A></SUP> five sacred volumes which 
 are as the satellites to the five books of the law of Moses. <I>Gregory 
 Nazianzen</I><SUP><A HREF="#{5}">5</A></SUP> (<I>carm.</I> 33, 
 <I>p.</I> 98) calls these <B><I>hai sticherai pente</I></B>--<I>the
 five metrical books;</I> first Job (so he reckons them up), then David, 
 then the three of Solomon-Ecclesiastes, the Song, and Proverbs.  
 <I>Amphilochius,</I> bishop at Iconium, in his iambic poem to 
 <I>Seleucus,</I> reckons them up particularly, and calls them 
 <B><I>sticheras pente Biblos</I></B>--<I>the five verse-books.
 Epiphanius</I> (<I>lib. de ponder. et mensur. p.</I> 533)
 <B><I>pente stichereis</I></B>--<I>the five verse-books.</I> And
 <I>Cyril.  Hierosol. Collect.</I> 4, <I>p.</I> 30 (<I>mihi--in my
 copy</I>), calls these five books <B><I>ta stichera</I></B>--<I>books
 in verse.</I> Polychronius, in his prologue to Job, says that as 
 <I>those that are without</I> call their tragedies and comedies 
 <B><I>poietika</I></B>--<I>poetics,</I> so, in sacred writ, those books
 which are composed in Hebrew metre (of which he reckons Job the first) 
 we call <B><I>stichera biblia</I></B>--<I>books in verse,</I> written
 <B><I>kata stichon</I></B>--<I>according to order.</I> What is written
 in metre, or rhythm, is so called from <B><I>metros</I></B>--<I>a
 measure,</I> and <B><I>arithmos</I></B>--<I>a number,</I> because
 regulated by certain measures, or numbers of syllables, which please 
 the ear with their smoothness and cadency, and so insinuate the matter 
 the more movingly and powerfully into the fancy. Sir William 
 Temple,<SUP><A HREF="#{6}">6</A></SUP> in his essay upon poetry, thinks 
 it is generally agreed to have been the first sort of writing that was 
 used in the world, nay, that, in several nations, poetical compositions 
 preceded the very invention or usage of letters. The Spaniards (he 
 says) found in America many strains of poetry, and such as seemed to 
 flow from a true poetic vein, before any letters were known in those 
 regions. The same (says he) is probable of the Scythians and Grecians: 
 the oracles of Apollo were delivered in verse. Homer and Hesiod wrote 
 their poems (the very Alcoran of the pagan d&aelig;monology) many ages
 before the appearing of any of the Greek philosophers or historians; 
 and long before them (if we may give credit to the antiquities of 
 Greece), even before the days of David, Orpheus and Linus were 
 celebrated poets and musicians in Greece; and at the same time 
 Carmenta, the mother of Evander, who was the first that introduced 
 letters among the natives of Greece, was so called <I>&agrave; carmine--from a
 song,</I> because she expressed herself in verse. And in such 
 veneration was this way of writing among the ancients that their poets 
 were called <I>vates--prophets,</I> and their muses were deified.  But, 
 which is more certain and considerable, the most ancient composition 
 that we meet with in scripture was the song of Moses at the Red Sea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:1-27">Exod. xv.</A>),

 which we find before the very first mention of writing, for that occurs
 not until

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+17:14">Exod. xvii. 14</A>,

 when God bade Moses write a memorial of the war with Amalek. The first,
 and indeed the true and general end of writing, is a help of memory; 
 and poetry does in some measure answer that end, and even in the want 
 of writing, much more with writing, helps to preserve the remembrance 
 of ancient things.  The book of <I>the wars of the Lord</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+21:14">Num. xxi. 14</A>),

 and the book of Jasher

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:13,2Sa+1:18">Josh. x. 13; 2 Sam. i. 18</A>),

 seem to have been both written in poetic measures.  Many sacred songs
 we meet with in the Old Testament, scattered both in the historical and 
 prophetical books, penned on particular occasions, which, in the 
 opinion of very competent judges, "have in them as true and noble 
 strains of poetry and picture as are met with in any other language 
 whatsoever, in spite of all disadvantages from translations into such 
 different tongues and common prose,<SUP><A HREF="#{7}">7</A></SUP> nay, 
 are nobler examples of the true sublime style of poetry than any that 
 can be found in the Pagan writers; the images are so strong, the 
 thoughts so great, the expressions so divine, and the figures so 
 admirably bold and moving, that the wonderful manner of these writers 
 is quite inimitable."<SUP><A HREF="#{8}">8</A></SUP> It is fit that 
 what is employed in the service of the sanctuary should be the best in 
 its kind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The books here put together are poetical. Job is an heroic poem, the 
 book of Psalms a collection of divine odes or lyrics, Solomon's Song a 
 pastoral and an epithalamium; they are poetical, and yet sacred and 
 serious, grave and full of majesty. They have a poetic force and flame, 
 with out poetic fury and fiction, and strangely command and move the 
 affections, without corrupting the imagination or putting a cheat upon 
 it; and, while they gratify the ear, they edify the mind and profit the 
 more by pleasing. It is therefore much to be lamented that so powerful 
 an art, which was at first consecrated to the honour of God, and has 
 been so often employed in his service, should be debauched, as it has 
 been, and is at this day, into the service of his enemies--that his 
 corn, and wine, and oil should be prepared for Baal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. As the manner of the composition of these books is excellent, and 
 very proper to engage the attention, move the affections, and fix them 
 in the memory, so the matter is highly useful, and such as will be 
 every way serviceable to us. They have in them the very sum and 
 substance of religion, and what they contain is more fitted to our 
 hand, and made ready for use, than any part of the Old Testament, upon 
 which account, if we may be allowed to compare one star with another in 
 the firmament of the scripture, these will be reckoned stars of the 
 first magnitude. <I>All scripture is profitable</I> (and this part of 
 it in a special manner) <I>for instruction</I> in doctrine, in 
 devotion, and in the right ordering of the conversation. The book of 
 Job directs us what we are to believe concerning God, the book of 
 Psalms how we are to worship him, pay our homage to him, and maintain 
 our communion with him, and then the book of the Proverbs shows very 
 particularly how we are to govern ourselves <B><I>en pase
 anastrophe</I></B>--<I>in every turn of human life;</I> thus shall the
 <I>man of God,</I> by a due attention to these lights, be <I>perfect,
 thoroughly furnished for every good work.</I> And these are placed 
 according to their natural order, as well as according to the order of 
 time; for very fitly are we first led into the knowledge of God, our 
 judgments rightly formed concerning him, and our mistakes rectified, 
 and then instructed how to worship him and to choose the things that 
 please him. We have here much of natural religion, its principles, its 
 precepts--much of God, his infinite perfections, his relations to man, 
 and his government both of the world and of the church; here is much of 
 Christ, who is the spring, and soul, and centre, of revealed religion, 
 and whom both Job and David were eminent types of, and had clear and 
 happy prospects of. We have here that which will be of use to enlighten 
 our understandings, and to acquaint us more and more with the things of 
 God, with the deep things of God--speculations to entertain the most 
 contemplative, and discoveries to satisfy the most inquisitive and 
 increase the knowledge of those that are most knowing. Here is that 
 also which, with a divine light, will bring into the soul the heat and 
 influence of a divine fire, will kindle and inflame pious and devout 
 affections, on which wings we may soar upwards until we enter into the 
 holiest. We may here be in the mount with God, to behold his beauty; 
 and when we come down from that mount, if we retain (as we ought) the 
 impressions of our devotion upon our spirits and make conscience of 
 doing that good which the Lord our God here requires of us, our faces 
 shall shine before all with whom we converse, who shall take occasion
 thence to <I>glorify our Father who is in heaven,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:16">Matt. v. 16</A>.

 Thus great, thus noble, thus truly excellent, is the subject, and thus
 capable of being improved, which gives me the more reason to be ashamed 
 of the meanness of my performance, that the comment breathes so little 
 of the life and spirit of the text. We often wonder at those that are 
 not at all affected with the great things of God, and have no taste nor 
 relish of them, because they know little of them; but perhaps we have 
 more reason to wonder at ourselves, that conversing so frequently, so 
 intimately, with them, we are not more affected with them, so as even 
 to be wholly taken up with them, and in a continual transport of 
 delight in the contemplation of them. We hope to be so shortly; in the 
 mean time, though like the three disciples that were the witnesses of 
 Christ's transfiguration upon the mount we are but dull and sleepy, yet 
 we can say, <I>Master, it is good to be here;</I> here <I>let us make
 tabernacles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:32,33">Luke ix. 32, 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I have nothing here to boast of--nothing at all, but a great deal to be 
 humbled for, that I have not come up to what I have aimed at in respect 
 of fulness and exactness. In the review of the work, I find many 
 defects, and those who are critical, perhaps, will meet with some 
 mistakes in it; but I have done it with what care I could, and desire 
 to be thankful to God who by his grace has carried me on in his work 
 thus far: let that grace have all the glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:13">Phil. ii. 13</A>),

 which <I>works in us both to will and to do</I> whatever we will or do
 that is good or serves any good purpose. What is from God will, I 
 trust, be to him, will be graciously accepted by him, <I>according to 
 what a man has, and not according to what he had not,</I> and will be 
 of some use to his church; and what is from myself (that is, all the 
 defects and errors) will, I trust, be favourably passed by and 
 pardoned. That prayer of <I>St. Austin</I> is mine, <I>Domine Deus,
 qu&aelig;cunque dixi in his libris de tuo, agnoscant et tui; et qu&aelig; de meo,
 et tu ignosce et tui--Lord God, whatever I have maintained in these 
 books correspondent with what is contained in thine grant that thy 
 people may approve as well as thyself; whatever is but the doctrine of 
 my book forgive thou, and grant that thy people may forgive it 
 also.</I> I must beg likewise to own, to the honour of our great 
 Master, that I have found the work to be its own wages, and that the 
 more we converse with the word of God the more it is to us as <I>the
 honey</I> and the <I>honeycomb,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:10">Ps. xix. 10</A>.

 In gathering some gleaning of this harvest for others we may feast
 ourselves; and, when we are enabled by the grace of God to do so, we 
 are best qualified to feed others. I was much pleased with a passage I 
 lately met with of Erasmus, that great scholar and celebrated wit, in 
 an epistle dedicatory before his book <I>De Ratione Concionandi,</I> 
 where, as one weary of the world and the hurry of it, he expresses an 
 earnest desire to spend the rest of his days in secret communion with 
 Jesus Christ, encouraged by his gracious invitation to those who 
 <I>labour and are heavy laden</I> to <I>come unto him for rest</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:28">Matt. xi. 28</A>),

 and this alone is that which he thinks will yield him true
 satisfaction. I think his words worth transcribing, and such as deserve 
 to be inserted among the testimonies of great men to serious godliness.  
 <I>Neque quisquam facil&egrave; credat qu&agrave;m miser&egrave; animus 
 jamdudum affectet ab his laboribus in tranquillam otium secedere, 
 quodque superest vit&aelig; (superest autem vix brevis palmus sive
 pugillus), solum cum eo solo colloqui, qui clamavit olim (nec 
 hodi&egrave; mutat vocem suam), "Venite ad me, omnes qui laboratis et 
 onerati estis, ego reficiam vos;" quandoquidem in tam turbulento, ne 
 dicam furente, s&aelig;culo, in tot molestiis quas vel ipsa tempora
 public&egrave; invehunt, vel privatim adfert oetas ac valetudo, nihil 
 reperio in quo mens mea libentius conquiescat qu&agrave;m in hoc arcano 
 colloquio--No one will easily believe how anxiously, for a long time 
 past, I have wished to retire from these labours into a scene of 
 tranquility, and, during the remainder of life (dwindled, it is true, 
 to the shortest span), to converse only with him who once cried (nor 
 does he now retract), "Come unto me, all you that labour and are heavy 
 laden, and I will refresh you," for in this turbulent, not to say 
 furious, age, the many public sources of disquietude, connected with 
 the infirmities of advancing age, leave no solace to my mind to be 
 compared with this secret communion.</I> In the pleasing contemplation 
 of the divine beauty and benignity we hope to spend a blessed eternity, 
 and therefore in this work it is good t o spend as much as may be of 
 our time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 One volume more, containing the prophetical books, will finish the Old
 Testament, if the Lord continue my life, and leisure, and ability of 
 mind and body for this work. It is begun, and I find it will be larger 
 than any of the other volumes, and longer in the doing; but, as God by 
 his grace shall furnish me for it and assist me in it (without which 
 grace I am nothing, less than nothing, worse than nothing), it shall be 
 carried on with all convenient speed; and <I>sat cit&ograve;, 
 si sat ben&egrave;--if
 with sufficient ability, it will be with sufficient speed.</I> I desire 
 the prayers of my friends that God would <I>minister seed to the
 sower</I> and <I>bread to the eaters</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:10">Isa. lv. 10</A>),

 that he would <I>multiply the seed sown</I> and <I>increase the fruits
 of our righteousness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:10">2 Cor. ix. 10</A>),

 that so he who <I>sows and those who reap may rejoice together</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:36">John iv. 36</A>);

 and the great Lord of the harvest shall have the glory of all.</P>
