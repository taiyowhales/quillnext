 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God speaks once, yea, twice, and it were well if man would even then 
 perceive it; God, in this psalm, speaks twice, for this is the same 
 almost verbatim with the fourteenth psalm. The scope of it is to 
 convince us of our sins, to set us a blushing and trembling because of 
 them; and this is what we are with so much difficulty brought to that 
 there is need of line upon line to this purport. The word, as a 
 convincing word, is compared to a hammer, the strokes whereof must be 
 frequently repeated. God, by the psalmist here, 

 I. Shows us how bad we are, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. Proves it upon us by his own certain knowledge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 III. He speaks terror to persecutors, the worst of sinners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 IV. He speaks encouragement to God's persecuted people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:6">ver. 6</A>.

 Some little variation there is between

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:1-7,53:1-6">Ps. 14 and this</A>,

 but none considerable, only between

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:5,6,53:5">ver. 5, 6</A>,

 there, and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:5,6,53:5">ver. 5</A>

 here; some expressions there used are here left out, concerning the 
 shame which the wicked put upon God's people, and instead of that, is 
 here foretold the shame which God would put upon the wicked, which 
 alteration, with some others, he made by divine direction when he 
 delivered it the second time to the chief musician. In singing it we 
 ought to lament the corruption of the human nature, and the wretched 
 degeneracy of the world we live in, yet rejoicing in hope of the great 
 salvation.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician upon Mahalath, Maschil. <I>A psalm</I> of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The fool hath said in his heart, <I>There is</I> no God.
 Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: <I>there is</I>
 none that doeth good.
 &nbsp; 2  God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see
 if there were <I>any</I> that did understand, that did seek God.
 &nbsp; 3  Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become
 filthy; <I>there is</I> none that doeth good, no, not one.
 &nbsp; 4  Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
 people <I>as</I> they eat bread: they have not called upon God.
 &nbsp; 5  There were they in great fear, <I>where</I> no fear was: for God
 hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth <I>against</I> thee:
 thou hast put <I>them</I> to shame, because God hath despised them.
 &nbsp; 6  Oh that the salvation of Israel <I>were come</I> out of Zion! When
 God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall
 rejoice, <I>and</I> Israel shall be glad.

 This psalm was opened before, and therefore we shall here only observe, 
 in short, some things concerning sin, in order to the increasing of our 
 sorrow for it and hatred of it. 

 1. The fact of sin. Is that proved? Can the charge be made out? Yes,
 God is a witness to it, an unexceptionable witness: from the place of 
 his holiness he looks on the children of men, and sees how little good 
 there is among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 All the sinfulness of their hearts and lives in naked and open before
 him.

 2.  The fault of sin. Is there any harm in it? Yes, it is iniquity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:1,4"><I>v.</I> 1, 4</A>);
 
 it is an unrighteous thing; it is that which there is no good in
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:1,3"><I>v.</I> 1, 3</A>);

 it is an evil thing; it is the worst of evils; it is that which makes
 this world such an evil world as it is; it is going back from God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 3. The fountain of sin. How comes it that men are so bad? Surely it is
 because <I>there is no fear of God before their eyes:</I> they <I>say 
 in their hearts, "There is no God</I> at all to call us to an account, 
 none that we need to stand in awe of." Men's bad practices flow from 
 their bad principles; if they profess to know God, yet in works, 
 because in thoughts, they deny him. 

 4. The folly of sin.  He is a fool (in the account of God, whose
 judgment we are sure is right) that harbours such corrupt thoughts. 
 Atheists, whether in opinion or practice, are the greatest fools in the 
 world. Those that do not seek God do not understand; they are like 
 brute-beasts that have no understanding; for man is distinguished from 
 the brutes, not so much by the powers of reason as by a capacity for 
 religion. <I>The workers of iniquity,</I> whatever they pretend to, 
 <I>have no knowledge;</I> those may truly be said to know nothing that 
 do not know God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 5. The filthiness of sin. Sinners are corrupt

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 their nature is vitiated and spoiled, and the more noble the nature is
 the more vile it is when it is depraved, as that of the angels. 
 <I>Corruptio optimi est pessima--The best things, when corrupted, 
 become the worst.</I> Their iniquity is abominable; it is odious to the 
 holy God, and it renders them so; whereas otherwise he <I>hates nothing 
 that he has made.</I> It makes men filthy, altogether filthy. Wilful 
 sinners are offensive in the nostrils of the God of heaven and of the 
 holy angels.  What decency soever proud sinners pretend to, it is 
 certain that wickedness is the greatest defilement in the world. 

 6. The fruit of sin. See to what a degree of barbarity it brings men at
 last; when men's hearts are hardened through the deceitfulness of sin 
 see their cruelty to their brethren, that are bone of their 
 bone--because they will not <I>run with them to the same excess of 
 riot,</I> they <I>eat them up as they eat bread;</I> as if they had not 
 only become beasts, but beasts of prey.  And see their contempt of God 
 at the same time. <I>They have not called upon</I> him, but scorn to be 
 beholden to him.

 7. The fear and shame that attend sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>There were those in great fear</I> who had made God their enemy;
 their own guilty consciences frightened them, and filled them with 
 horror, though otherwise there was no apparent cause of fear. <I>The 
 wicked flees when none pursues.</I> See the ground of this fear; it is 
 because God has formerly <I>scattered the bones of those that encamped 
 against</I> his people, not only broken their power and dispersed their 
 forces, but slain them, and reduced their bodies to dry bones, like 
 those <I>scattered at the grave's mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:7">Ps. cxli. 7</A>.

 Such will be the fate of those that lay siege to the <I>camp of the
 saints and the beloved city,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:9">Rev. xx. 9</A>.

 The apprehensions of this cannot but put those into frights that eat up
 God's people. This enables the virgin, the daughter of Zion, to put 
 them to shame, and expose them, <I>because God has despised them,</I> 
 to laugh at them, because he that sits in heaven laughs at them. We 
 need not look upon those enemies with fear whom God looks upon with 
 contempt. If he despises them, we may. 

 8. The faith of the saints, and their hope and power touching the cure
 of this great evil,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 There will come a Saviour, a great salvation, a salvation from sin. Oh
 that it might be hastened! for it will bring in glorious and joyful 
 times. There were those in the Old-Testament times that looked and 
 hoped, that prayed and waited, for this redemption.

 (1.) God will, in due time, save his church from the sinful malice of
 its enemies, which will bring joy to Jacob and Israel, that have long 
 been in a mournful melancholy state.  Such salvations were often 
 wrought, and all typical of the everlasting triumphs of the glorious 
 church.

 (2.) He will save all believers from their own iniquities, that they
 may not be led captive by them, which will be everlasting matter of joy 
 to them. From this work the Redeemer had his name--<I>Jesus,</I> for 
 <I>he shall save his people from their sins,</I>
