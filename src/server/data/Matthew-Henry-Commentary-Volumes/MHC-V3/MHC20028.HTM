 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are
 bold as a lion.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. What continual frights those are subject to that go on in wicked 
 ways. Guilt in the conscience makes men a terror to themselves, so that 
 they are ready <I>to flee when none pursues;</I> like one that absconds 
 for debt, who thinks every one he meets a bailiff. Though they pretend 
 to be easy, there are secret fears which haunt them wherever they go, 
 so that they fear where no present or imminent danger is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+53:5">Ps. liii. 5</A>.
 
 Those that have made God their enemy, and know it, cannot but see the
 whole creation at war with them, and therefore can have no true 
 enjoyment of themselves, no confidence, no courage, but a <I>fearful 
 looking for of judgment.</I> Sin makes men cowards.</P>

 2. What a holy security and serenity of mind those enjoy who <I>keep 
 conscience void of offence</I> and so keep themselves in the love of 
 God: <I>The righteous are bold as a lion,</I> as a young lion; in the
 greatest dangers they have a God of almighty power to trust to. 
 <I>Therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed.</I> Whatever 
 difficulties they meet with in the way of their duty, they are not 
 daunted by them. <I>None of those things move me.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  For the transgression of a land many <I>are</I> the princes
 thereof: but by a man of understanding <I>and</I> knowledge the state
 <I>thereof</I> shall be prolonged.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. National sins bring national disorders and the disturbance of the 
 public repose: <I>For the transgression of a land,</I> and a general 
 defection from God and religion to idolatry, profaneness, or 
 immorality, <I>many are the princes thereof,</I> many at the same time 
 pretending to the sovereignty and contending for it, by which the 
 people are crumbled into parties and factions, biting and devouring one 
 another, or many successively, in a little time, one cutting off 
 another, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+16:8">1 Kings xvi. 8</A>,

 &c., or soon cut off by the hand of God or of a foreign enemy, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+24:5">2 Kings xxiv. 5</A>,

 &c. As the people suffer for the sins of the prince,</P>

 <P> 

 so the government sometimes suffers for the sins of the people. 

 2. Wisdom will prevent or redress these grievances: <I>By a man,</I>
 that is, by a people, <I>of understanding,</I> that come again to 
 themselves and their right mind, things are kept in a good order, or, 
 if disturbed, brought back to the old channel again. Or, By a prince of 
 <I>understanding and knowledge,</I> a privy-counsellor, or minister of 
 state, that will restrain or suppress <I>the transgression of the 
 land,</I> and take the right methods of healing the state thereof, the 
 good estate of it will be prolonged. We cannot imagine what a great 
 deal of service one wise man may do to a nation in a critical 
 juncture.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr28_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  A poor man that oppresseth the poor <I>is like</I> a sweeping rain
 which leaveth no food.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. How hard-hearted poor people frequently are to one another, not only 
 not doing such good offices as they might do one to another, but 
 imposing upon and over-reaching one another. Those who know by 
 experience the miseries of poverty should be compassionate to those who 
 suffer the like, but they are inexcusably barbarous if they be 
 injurious to them. 

 2. How imperious and griping those commonly are who, being indigent and 
 necessitous, get into power. If a prince prefer a poor man, he forgets 
 that ever he was poor, and none shall be so oppressive to the poor as 
 he, nor squeeze them so cruelly. The hungry leech and the dry sponge 
 suck most. <I>Set a beggar on horseback, and he will ride</I> without 
 mercy. He <I>is like a sweeping rain,</I> which washes away the corn in 
 the ground, and lays and beats out that which has grown, so that it 
 <I>leaves no food.</I> Princes therefore ought not to put those into 
 places of trust who are poor, and in debt, and behind-hand in the 
 world, nor any who make it their main business to enrich 
 themselves.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep
 the law contend with them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Those that <I>praise the wicked</I> make it to appear that they do 
 themselves <I>forsake the law,</I> and go contrary to it, for that 
 curses and condemns the wicked. Wicked people will speak well of one 
 another, and so strengthen one another's hands in their wicked ways, 
 hoping thereby to silence the clamours of their own consciences and to 
 serve the interests of the devil's kingdom, which is not done by any 
 thing so effectually as by keeping vice in reputation. 

 2. Those that do indeed make conscience of the law of God themselves 
 will, in their places, vigorously oppose sin, and bear their testimony 
 against it, and do what they can to shame and suppress it. They will 
 reprove the works of darkness, and silence the excuses which are made 
 for those works, and do what they can to bring gross offenders to 
 punishment, that others may hear and fear.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr28_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 understand all <I>things.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 I. As the prevalency of men's lusts is owing to the darkness of their 
 understandings, so the darkness of their understandings is very much 
 owing to the dominion of their lusts: <I>Men understand not 
 judgment,</I> discern not between truth and falsehood, right and wrong; 
 they understand not the law of God as the rule either of their duty or 
 of their doom; and, 

 1. <I>Therefore</I> it is that they are <I>evil men;</I> their 
 wickedness is the effect of their ignorance and error, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:18">Eph. iv. 18</A>.

 2. <I>Therefore</I> they <I>understand not judgment,</I> because they
 are <I>evil men;</I> their corruptions blind their eyes, and fill them 
 with prejudices, and because they do evil they <I>hate the light.</I> 
 It is just with God also to <I>give them up to strong 
 delusions.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. As men's <I>seeking the Lord</I> is a good sign that they do 
 understand much, so it is a good means of their understanding more, 
 even of their understanding all things needful for them. Those that set 
 God's glory before them as their end, his favour as their felicity, and 
 his word as their rule, and apply to him upon all occasions by prayer, 
 <I>they seek the Lord,</I> and he will give them the spirit of wisdom. 
 If a man <I>do his will,</I> he shall <I>know his doctrine,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>.

 <I>A good understanding those have,</I> and a better they shall have,
 that <I>do his commandments,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:10,1Co+2:12,15">Ps. cxi. 10; 1 Cor. ii. 12, 15</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr28_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Better <I>is</I> the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than
 <I>he that is</I> perverse <I>in his</I> ways, though he <I>be</I> rich.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. It is supposed that a man may <I>walk in his uprightness</I> and yet 
 be poor in this world, which is a temptation to dishonesty, and yet may 
 resist the temptation and continue to <I>walk in his 
 uprightness</I>--also that a man may be <I>perverse in his ways,</I>
 injurious to God and man, and yet be rich, and prosper in the world, 
 for a while, may be rich, and so lie under great obligations and have 
 great opportunities to do good, and yet be <I>perverse in his ways</I> 
 and do a great deal of hurt. 

 2. It is maintained as a paradox to a blind world that an honest, 
 godly, poor man, is better than a wicked, ungodly, rich man, has a 
 better character, is in a better condition, has more comfort in 
 himself, is a greater blessing to the world, and is worthy of much more 
 honour and respect. It is not only certain that his case will be better 
 at death, but it is better in life. When Aristides was by a rich man 
 upbraided with his poverty he answered, <I>Thy riches do thee more hurt 
 than my poverty does me.</I></P>

 <A NAME="Pr28_7"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Whoso keepeth the law <I>is</I> a wise son: but he that is a
 companion of riotous <I>men</I> shameth his father.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Religion is true wisdom, and it makes men wise in every relation. He 
 that conscientiously <I>keeps the law</I> is wise, and he will be 
 particularly <I>a wise son,</I> that is, will act discreetly towards 
 his parents, for the law of God teaches him to do so. 

 2. Bad company is a great hindrance to religion. Those that are 
 <I>companions of riotous men,</I> that choose such for their companions 
 and delight in their conversation, will certainly be drawn from 
 <I>keeping the law of God</I> and drawn to transgress it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:115">Ps. cxix. 115</A>.
 
 3. Wickedness is not only a reproach to the sinner himself, but to all
 that are akin to him. He that keeps rakish company, and spends his
 time and money with them, not only grieves his parents, but shames 
 them; it turns to their disrepute, as if they had not done their duty 
 to him. They are ashamed that a child of theirs should be scandalous 
 and abusive to their neighbours.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr28_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he
 shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. That which is ill-got, though it may increase much, will not last 
 long. A man may perhaps raise a great estate, in a little time, by 
 usury and extortion, fraud, and oppression of the poor, but it will not 
 continue; he gathers it for himself, but it shall prove to have been 
 gathered for somebody else that he has no kindness for. His estate 
 shall go to decay, and another man's shall be raised out of the ruins 
 of it. 

 2. Sometimes God in his providence so orders it that that which one got 
 unjustly another uses charitably; it is strangely turned into the hands 
 of one <I>that will pity the poor</I> and do good with it, and so cut 
 off the entail of the curse which he brought upon it who got it by 
 deceit and violence. Thus the same Providence that punishes the cruel, 
 and disables them to do any more hurt, rewards the merciful, and 
 enables them to do so much the more good. <I>To him that has the ten 
 pounds give the pound</I> which the wicked servant <I>hid in the 
 napkin;</I> for <I>to him that has,</I> and uses it well, more <I>shall 
 be given,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:24">Luke xix. 24</A>.

 Thus the poor are repaid, the charitable are encouraged, and God is
 glorified.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr28_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his
 prayer <I>shall be</I> abomination.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is by the word and prayer that our communion with God is kept up. 
 God speaks to us by his law, and expects we should hear him and heed 
 him; <I>we</I> speak to him by prayer, to which we wait for an answer 
 of peace. How reverent and serious should we be, whenever we are 
 hearing from and speaking to the Lord of glory! 

 2. If God's word be not regarded by us, our prayers shall not only not 
 be accepted of God, but they shall be an abomination to him, not only 
 our sacrifices, which were ceremonial appointments, but even our 
 prayers, which are moral duties, and which, when they are put up by the 
 upright, are so much his delight. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11,15">Isa. i. 11, 15</A>.

 The sinner whose prayers God is thus angry at is one who wilfully and
 obstinately refuses to obey God's commandments, who will not so much as 
 give them the hearing, but causes his <I>ear to decline the law,</I> 
 and refuses when God calls; God will therefore justly refuse him when 
 he calls. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:24,28">Prov. i. 24, 28</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr28_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he
 shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have
 good <I>things</I> in possession.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The doom of seducers, who attempt to draw good people, or those who 
 profess to be such, into sin and mischief, who take pride in <I>causing 
 the righteous to go astray in an evil way,</I> in drawing them into a 
 snare, that they may insult over them. They shall not gain their point; 
 it is impossible to deceive the elect. But they shall <I>fall 
 themselves into their own pit;</I> and having been not only sinners, 
 but tempters, not only unrighteous, but enemies to the righteous, their 
 condemnation will be so much the greater, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:14,15">Matt. xxiii. 14, 15</A>.

 2. The happiness of the sincere. They shall not only be preserved from 
 the evil way which the wicked would decoy them into, but they shall 
 <I>have good things,</I> the best things, <I>in possession,</I> the 
 graces and comforts of God's Spirit, besides what they have in 
 reversion.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr28_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  The rich man <I>is</I> wise in his own conceit; but the poor that
 hath understanding searcheth him out.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Those that are rich are apt to think themselves wise, because, 
 whatever else they are ignorant of, they know how to get and save; and 
 those that are purse-proud expect that all they say should be regarded 
 as an oracle and a law, and that none should dare to contradict them, 
 but every sheaf bow to theirs; this humour is fed by flatterers, who, 
 because (like Jezebel's prophets) they are fed at their table, cry up 
 their wisdom. 

 2. Those that are poor often prove themselves wiser than they: A 
 <I>poor man,</I> who has taken pains to get wisdom, having no other way 
 (as the rich man has) to get a reputation, <I>searches him out,</I> and 
 makes it to appear that he is not such a scholar, nor such a 
 politician, as he is taken to be. See how variously God dispenses his 
 gifts; to some he gives wealth, to others wisdom, and it is easy to say 
 which of these is the better gift, which we should <I>covet more 
 earnestly.</I></P>

 <A NAME="Pr28_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  When righteous <I>men</I> do rejoice, <I>there is</I> great glory: but
 when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. The comfort of the people of God is the honour of the nation in 
 which they live. There is a <I>great glory</I> dwelling in the land 
 when <I>the righteous do rejoice,</I> when they have their liberty, the 
 free exercise of their religion, and are not persecuted, when the 
 government countenances them and speaks comfortably to them, when they 
 prosper and grow rich, and, much more, when they are preferred and 
 employed and have power put into their hands. 

 2. The advancement of the wicked is the eclipsing of the beauty of a 
 nation: <I>When the wicked rise</I> and get head they make head against 
 all that is sacred, and then <I>a man is hidden,</I> a good man is 
 thrust into obscurity, is necessitated to abscond for his own safety; 
 corruptions prevail so generally that, as in Elijah's time, there seem 
 to be no good men left, the <I>wicked walk</I> so thickly <I>on every 
 side.</I></P>

 <A NAME="Pr28_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso
 confesseth and forsaketh <I>them</I> shall have mercy.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The folly of indulging sin, of palliating and excusing it, denying 
 or extenuating it, diminishing it, dissembling it, or throwing the 
 blame of it upon others: <I>He that</I> thus <I>covers his sins shall 
 not prosper,</I> let him never expect it. He shall not succeed in his 
 endeavour to cover his sin, for it will be discovered, sooner or later. 
 <I>There is nothing hid which shall not be revealed.</I> A <I>bird of 
 the air shall carry the voice.</I> Murder will out, and so will other 
 sins. He <I>shall not prosper,</I> that is, he shall not obtain the 
 pardon of his sin, nor can he have any true peace of conscience. David 
 owns himself to have been in a constant agitation while he <I>covered 
 his sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:3,4">Ps. xxxii. 3, 4</A>.

 While the patient conceals his distemper he cannot expect a cure.

 2. The benefit of parting with it, both by a penitent confession and a 
 universal reformation: <I>He that confesses</I> his guilt to God, and 
 is careful not to return to sin again, shall <I>find mercy</I> with 
 God, and shall have the comfort of it in his own bosom. His conscience 
 shall be eased and his ruin prevented. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:9,Jer+3:12,13">1 John i. 9; Jer. iii. 12, 13</A>.
 
 When we set sin before our face (as David, <I>My sin is ever before
 me</I>) God casts it behind his back.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr28_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Happy <I>is</I> the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth
 his heart shall fall into mischief.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The benefit of a holy caution. It sounds strangely, but it is very 
 true: <I>Happy is the man that feareth always.</I> Most people think 
 that those are happy who never fear; but there is a fear which is so 
 far from having torment in it that it has in it the greatest 
 satisfaction. Happy is the man who always keeps up in his mind a holy 
 awe and reverence of God, his glory, goodness, and government, who is 
 always afraid of offending God and incurring his displeasure, who keeps 
 conscience tender and has a dread of the appearance of evil, who is 
 always jealous of himself, distrustful of his own sufficiency, and 
 lives in expectation of troubles and changes, so that, whenever they 
 come, they are no surprise to him. He who keeps up such a fear as this 
 will live a life of faith and watchfulness, and therefore happy is he, 
 blessed and holy. 

 2. The danger of a sinful presumption: <I>He that hardens his 
 heart,</I> that mocks at fear, and sets God and his judgments at 
 defiance, and receives not the impressions of his word or rod, <I>shall 
 fall into mischief;</I> his presumption will be his ruin, and whatever 
 sin (which is the greatest mischief) he falls into it is owing to the 
 hardness of his heart.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr28_15"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  <I>As</I> a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; <I>so is</I> a wicked
 ruler over the poor people.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is written indeed, <I>Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy 
 people;</I> but if he be a wicked ruler, that oppresses the people, 
 especially the poor people, robbing them of the little they have and 
 making a prey of them, whatever we may call him, this scripture calls 
 him <I>a roaring lion and a ranging bear.</I> 

 1. In respect of his character. He is brutish, barbarous, and 
 blood-thirsty; he is rather to be put among the beasts of prey, the 
 wildest and most savage, than to be reckoned of that noble rank of 
 beings whose glory is reason and humanity. 

 2. In respect of the mischief he does to his subjects. He is dreadful 
 as the <I>roaring lion,</I> who makes the forest tremble; he is 
 devouring as a hungry <I>bear,</I> and the more necessitous he is the 
 more mischief he does and the more greedy of gain he is.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr28_16"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  The prince that wanteth understanding <I>is</I> also a great
 oppressor: <I>but</I> he that hateth covetousness shall prolong <I>his</I>
 days.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things are here intimated to be the causes of the 
 mal-administration of princes:--

 1. The love of money, that <I>root of all evil;</I> for <I>hating 
 covetousness</I> here stands opposed to <I>oppression,</I> according to 
 Moses's character of good magistrates, <I>men fearing God and hating 
 covetousness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:21">Exod. xviii. 21</A>),

 not only not being covetous, but hating it, and shaking the hands from
 the holding of bribes. A ruler that is covetous will neither do justly 
 nor love mercy, but the people under him shall be bought and sold.

 2. Want of consideration: <I>He that hates covetousness shall 
 prolong</I> his government and peace, shall be happy in the affections 
 of his people and the blessing of his God. It is as much the interest 
 as the duty of princes to reign in righteousness. Oppressors therefore 
 and tyrants are the greatest fools in the world; they <I>want 
 understanding;</I> they do not consult their own honour, ease, and 
 safety, but sacrifice all to their ambition of an absolute and 
 arbitrary power. They might be much happier in the hearts of their
 subjects than in their necks or estates.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr28_17"> </A>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  A man that doeth violence to the blood of <I>any</I> person shall

 This agrees with that ancient law, <I>Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by 
 man shall his blood be shed</I>

 and proclaims,

 1. The doom of the shedder of blood. He that has committed murder, 
 though he flees for his life, shall be continually haunted with 
 terrors, shall himself <I>flee to the pit,</I> betray himself, and 
 torment himself, like Cain, who, when he had killed his brother, became 
 a fugitive and a vagabond, and trembled continually. 

 2. The duty of the avenger of blood, whether the magistrate or the next 
 of kin, or whoever are concerned in making inquisition for blood, let 
 them be close and vigorous in the prosecution, and let it not be bought 
 off. Those that acquit the murderer, or do any thing to help him off, 
 come in sharers in the guilt of blood; nor can the land be purged from 
 blood but by the blood of him that shed it,

 Note, 

 1. Those that are honest are always safe. He that acts with sincerity, 
 that speaks as he thinks, has a single eye, in every thing, to the 
 glory of God and the good of his brethren, that would not, for a world, 
 do an unjust thing if he knew it, that in all manner of conversation 
 <I>walks uprightly,</I> he <I>shall be saved</I> hereafter. We find a 
 glorious company of those <I>in whose mouth was found no guile,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:5">Rev. xiv. 5</A>.

 They shall be safe now. Integrity and uprightness will preserve men,
 will give them a holy security in the worst of times; for it will 
 preserve their comfort, their reputation, and all their interests. They 
 may be injured, but they cannot be hurt.

 2. Those that are false and dishonest are never safe: <I>He that is 
 perverse in his ways,</I> that thinks to secure himself by fraudulent 
 practices, by dissimulation and treachery, or by an estate ill-got, he 
 <I>shall fall,</I> nay, he <I>shall fall at once,</I> not gradually, 
 and with warning given, but suddenly, without previous notice, for he 
 is least safe when he is most secure. He <I>falls at once,</I> and so 
 has neither time to guard against his ruin nor to provide for it; and, 
 being a surprise upon him, it will be so much the greater terror to 
 him.</P>

 Note,

 with which he may be charitable to the poor; he shall <I>eat the labour

 2. Those that are idle, and careless, and company-keepers, though they 
 indulge themselves in living (as they think) easily and pleasantly, 
 they take the way to live miserably. He that has land and values 
 himself upon that, but does not till it, but <I>follows after vain 
 persons,</I> drinks with them, joins with them in their frolics and 
 vain sports, and idles away his time with him, he shall have <I>poverty

 maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. We are directed in the true way to be happy, and that is to be holy 
 and honest. He that is <I>faithful</I> to God and man shall be blessed 
 of the Lord, and he <I>shall abound with blessings</I> of the upper and 
 nether springs. Men shall praise him, and pray for him, and be ready to 
 do him any kindness. He shall abound in doing good, and shall himself 
 be a blessing to the place where he lives. Usefulness shall be the 
 reward of faithfulness, and it is a good reward. 

 2. We are cautioned against a false and deceitful way to happiness, and 
 that is, right or wrong, raising an estate suddenly. Say not, This is 
 the way to <I>abound with blessings,</I> for <I>he that makes haste to 
 be rich,</I> more haste than good speed, <I>shall not be innocent;</I> 
 and, if he be not, he shall not be blessed of God, but rather bring a 
 curse upon what he has; nor, if he be not innocent, can he long be easy 
 to himself; he shall not be accounted innocent by his neighbours, but 
 shall have their ill will and ill word. He does not say that he 
 <I>cannot be innocent,</I> but there is all the probability in the 
 world that he will not prove so: <I>He that hasteth with his feet 
 sinneth,</I> stumbleth, falleth. <I>Sed qu&aelig; reverentia legum, 
 quis metus, aut pudor, est unquam properantis avari?</I>--<I>What 
 reverence for law, what fear, what shame, was ever indicated by an 
 avaricious man hasting to be rich?</I></P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is a fundamental error in the administration of justice, and that 
 which cannot but lead men to abundance of transgression, to consider 
 the parties concerned more than the merits of the cause, so as to 
 favour one because he is a gentleman, a scholar, my countryman, my old 
 acquaintance, has formerly done me a kindness, or may do me one, or is 
 of my party and persuasion, and to bear hard on the other party because 
 he is a stranger, a poor man, has done me an ill turn, is or has been 
 my rival, or is not of my mind, or has voted against me. Judgment is 
 perverted when any consideration of this kind is admitted into the 
 scale, any thing but pure right. 

 2. Those that are partial will be paltry. Those that have once broken 
 through the bonds of equity, though, at first, it must be some great 
 bribe, some noble present, that would bias them, yet, when they have 
 debauched their consciences, they will, at length, be so sordid that 
 <I>for a piece of bread</I> they will give judgment against their 
 consciences; they will rather play at small game than sit out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here again Solomon shows the sin and folly of those that will <I>be 
 rich;</I> they are resolved that they will be so, <I>per fas, per 
 nefas</I>--<I>right or wrong;</I> they will be so with all speed; they
 are getting hastily an estate. 

 1. They have no comfort in it: They <I>have an evil eye,</I> that is,
 they are always grieving at those that have more than they, and always 
 grudging their necessary expenses, because they think the former keep 
 them from seeming rich, the latter from being so, and between both they 
 must needs be perpetually uneasy.

 2. They have no assurance of the continuance of it, and yet take no 
 thought to provide against the loss of it: <I>Poverty shall come 
 upon</I> them, and the riches which they made wings for, that they 
 might fly to them, will make themselves wings to fly from them; but 
 they are secure and improvident, and do <I>not consider</I> this, that 
 while they are making <I>haste to be rich</I> they are really making 
 haste to be poor, else they would not <I>trust to uncertain 
 riches.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour
 than he that flattereth with the tongue.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Flatterers may please those for a time who, upon second thoughts, 
 will detest and despise them. If ever they come to be convinced of the 
 evil of those sinful courses they were flattered in, and to be ashamed 
 of the pride and vanity which were humoured and gratified by those 
 flatteries, they will hate the fawning flatterers as having had an ill 
 design upon them, and the fulsome flatteries as having had an ill 
 effect upon them and become nauseous. 

 2. Reprovers may displease those at first who yet afterwards, when the 
 passion is over and the bitter physic begins to work well, will love 
 and respect them. He that deals faithfully with his friend, in telling 
 him of his faults, though he may put him into some heat for the 
 present, and perhaps have hard words, instead of thanks, for his pains, 
 yet afterwards he will not only have the comfort in his own bosom of 
 having done his duty, but he also whom he reproved will acknowledge 
 that it was a kindness, will entertain a high opinion of his wisdom and 
 faithfulness, and look upon him as fit to be a friend. He that cries 
 out against his surgeon for hurting him when he is searching his wound 
 will yet pay him well, and thank him too, when he has cured it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, <I>It is</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As Christ shows the absurdity and wickedness of those children who 
 think it is no duty, in some cases, to maintain their parents 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:5">Matt. xv. 5</A>),

 so Solomon here shows the absurdity and wickedness of those who think
 it is no sin to rob their parents, either by force or secretly, by 
 wheedling them or threatening them, or by wasting what they have, and 
 (which is no better than robbing them) running into debt and leaving 
 them to pay it. Now,

 1. This is commonly made light of by untoward children; they say,
 "<I>It is no transgression,</I> for it will be our own shortly, our 
 parents can well enough spare it, we have occasion for it, we cannot 
 live as gentlemen upon the allowance our parents give us, it is too 
 strait for us." With such excuses as these they endeavour to shift off 
 the conviction. But, 

 2. How lightly soever an ungoverned youth makes of it, it is really a 
 very great sin; he that does it <I>is the companion of a destroyer,</I> 
 no better than a robber on the highway. What wickedness will he scruple 
 to commit who will rob his own parents?</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that
 putteth his trust in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall be made fat.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Those make themselves lean, and continually unquiet, that are 
 haughty and quarrelsome, for they are opposed to those that <I>shall be 
 made fat: He that is of a proud heart,</I> that is conceited of himself 
 and looks with a contempt upon all about him, that cannot bear either 
 competition or contradiction, he <I>stirs up strife,</I> makes 
 mischief, and creates disturbance to himself and every body else. 

 2. Those make themselves fat, and always easy, that live in a
 continual dependence upon God and his grace: <I>He who puts his trust 
 in the Lord,</I> who, instead of struggling for himself, commits his 
 cause to God, <I>shall be made fat.</I> He saves the money which others 
 spend upon their pride and contentiousness; he enjoys himself, and has 
 abundant satisfaction in his God; and thus his soul dwells at ease, and 
 he is most likely to have plenty of outward good things. None live so 
 easily, so pleasantly, as those who live by faith.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>26  He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso
 walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The character of a fool: <I>He trusts to his own heart,</I> to his 
 own wisdom and counsels, his own strength and sufficiency, his own 
 merit and righteousness, and the good opinion he has of himself; he 
 that does so <I>is a fool,</I> for he trusts to that, not only which 
 <I>is deceitful above all things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:9">Jer. xvii. 9</A>),

 but which has often deceived him. This implies that it is the character
 of a wise man (as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>)

 to <I>put his trust in the Lord,</I> and in his power and promise, and
 to follow his guidance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:5,6">Prov. iii. 5, 6</A>.

 2. The comfort of a wise man: He that <I>walks wisely,</I> that trusts 
 not to his own heart, but is humble and self-diffident, and goes on in 
 the strength of the Lord God, <I>he shall be delivered;</I> when the 
 fool, <I>that trusts in his own heart,</I> shall be destroyed.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A promise to the charitable: <I>He that gives to the poor</I> shall 
 himself be never the poorer for so doing; he <I>shall not lack.</I> If 
 he have but little, and so be in danger of lacking, let him give out of 
 his little, and that will prevent it from coming to nothing; as the 
 bounty of the widow of Sarepta to Elijah (for whom she made a little 
 cake first) saved what she had, when it was reduced to a handful of 
 meal. If he have much, let him give much out of it, and that will 
 prevent its growing less; he and his shall not want what is given in 
 pious charity. What we gave we have. 

 2. A threatening to the uncharitable: <I>He that hides his eyes,</I> 
 that he may not see the miseries of the poor nor read their petitions, 
 lest his eye should affect his heart and extort some relief from him, 
 he <I>shall have many a curse,</I> both from God and man, and neither 
 causeless, and therefore they shall come. Woeful is the condition of 
 that man who has the word of God and the prayers of the poor against 
 him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they
 perish, the righteous increase.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is to the same purport with what we had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 1. When bad men are preferred, that which is good is clouded and run
 down. When power is put into the hands of <I>the wicked, men hide 
 themselves;</I> wise men retire into privacy, and decline public 
 business, not caring to be employed under them; rich men get out of the 
 way, for fear of being squeezed for what they have; and, which is worst 
 of all, good men abscond, despairing to do good and fearing to be 
 persecuted and ill-treated. 

 2. When bad men are disgraced, degraded, and their power taken from 
 them, then that which is good revives again, then <I>the righteous 
 increase;</I> for, <I>when they perish,</I> good men will be put in 
 their room, who will, by their example and interest, countenance 
 religion and righteousness. It is well with a land when the number of 
 good people increases in it; and it is therefore the policy of all 
 princes, states, and potentates, to encourage them and to take special 
 care of the good education of youth.</P>
