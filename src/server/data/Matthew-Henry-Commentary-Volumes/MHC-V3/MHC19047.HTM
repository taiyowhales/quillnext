 <BR><FONT SIZE=+2>PSALM XLVII.</FONT>
 <HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=50>
 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of this psalm is to stir us up to praise God, to stir up all 
 people to do so; and, 

 I. We are directed in what manner to do it, publicly, cheerfully, and
 intelligently, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:1,6,7">ver. 1, 6, 7</A>.

 II. We are furnished with matter for praise. 
 
 1. God's majesty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:2">ver. 2</A>.

 2. His sovereign and universal dominion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:2,7-9">ver. 2, 7-9</A>.

 3. The great things he had done, and will do, for his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 Many suppose that this psalm was penned upon occasion of the bringing
 up of the ark to Mount Zion which

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:5">ver. 5</A>

 seems to refer to ("God has gone up with a shout");--but it looks
 further, to the ascension of Christ into the heavenly Zion, after he 
 had finished his undertaking on earth, and to the setting up of his 
 kingdom in the world, to which the heathen should become willing 
 subjects. In singing this psalm we are to give honour to the exalted 
 Redeemer, to rejoice in his exaltation, and to celebrate his praises, 
 confessing that he is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. A psalm for the sons of Korah.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of
 triumph.
 &nbsp; 2  For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> most high <I>is</I> terrible; <I>he is</I> a great King
 over all the earth.
 &nbsp; 3  He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under
 our feet.
 &nbsp; 4  He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of
 Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist, having his own heart filled with great and good thoughts 
 of God, endeavours to engage all about him in the blessed work of 
 praise, as one convinced that God is worthy of all blessing and praise, 
 and as one grieved at his own and others' backwardness to and 
 barrenness in this work. Observe, in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who are called upon to praise God: "<I>All you people,</I> all you 
 people of Israel;" those were his own subjects, and under his charge, 
 and therefore he will engage them to praise God, for on them he has an 
 influence. Whatever others do, he and his house, he and his people, 
 shall praise the Lord. Or, "All you people and nations of the earth;" 
 and so it may be taken as a prophecy of the conversion of the Gentiles 
 and the bringing of them into the church; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:11">Rom.  xv. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What they are called upon to do: "<I>O clap your hands,</I> in 
 token of your own joy and satisfaction in what God has done for you, of 
 your approbation, nay, your admiration, of what God has done in 
 general, and of your indignation against all the enemies of God's 
 glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:23">Job xxvii. 23</A>.

 <I>Clap your hands,</I> as men transported with pleasure, that cannot
 contain themselves; <I>shout unto God,</I> not to make him hear (his 
 ear is not heavy), but to make all about you hear, and take notice how 
 much you are affected and filled with the works of God. Shout <I>with 
 the voice of triumph</I> in him, and in his power and goodness, that 
 others may join with you in the triumph." Note, Such expressions of 
 pious and devout affections as to some may seem indecent and imprudent 
 ought not to be hastily censured and condemned, much less ridiculed, 
 because, if they come from an upright heart, God will accept the 
 strength of the affection and excuse the weakness of the expressions of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What is suggested to us as matter for our praise. 

 1. That the God with whom we have to do is a God of awful majesty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>The Lord most high is terrible.</I> He is infinitely above the
 noblest creatures, higher than the highest; there are those perfections 
 in him that are to be reverenced by all, and particularly that power, 
 holiness, and justice, that are to be dreaded by all those that contend 
 with him.

 2. That he is a God of sovereign and universal dominion. He is a King 
 that reigns alone, and with an absolute power, <I>a King over all the 
 earth;</I> all the creatures, being made by him, are subject to him, 
 and therefore he is <I>a great King,</I> the King of kings. 

 3.  That he takes a particular care of his people and their concerns,
 has done so and ever will;

 (1.) In giving them victory and success 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 subduing the people and nations under them, both those that stood in
 their way

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:2">Ps. xliv. 2</A>)

 and those that made attempts upon them. This God had done for them,
 witness the planting of them in Canaan, and their continuance there 
 unto this day. This they doubted not but he would still do for them by 
 his servant David, who prospered which way soever he turned his 
 victorious arms. But this looks forward to the kingdom of the Messiah, 
 which was to be set over all the earth, and not confined to the Jewish 
 nation. Jesus Christ shall subdue the Gentiles; he shall bring <I>them 
 in as sheep into the fold</I> (so the word signifies), not for 
 slaughter, but for preservation. He shall subdue their affections, and 
 make them a <I>willing people in the day of his power,</I> shall bring 
 their thoughts into obedience to him, and reduce those who had gone 
 astray, under the guidance of the <I>great shepherd and bishop of 
 souls,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:25">1 Pet. ii. 25</A>.

 (2.) In giving them rest and settlement 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>He shall choose our inheritance for us.</I> He had chosen the land
 of Canaan to be an inheritance for Israel; it was the land which the 
 Lord their God spied out for them; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:8">Deut. xxxii. 8</A>.

 This justified their possession of that land, and gave them a good
 title; and this sweetened their enjoyment of it, and made it 
 comfortable; they had reason to think it a happy lot, and to be 
 satisfied in it, when it was that which Infinite Wisdom chose for them.  
 And the setting up of God's sanctuary in it made it <I>the 
 excellency,</I> the honour, <I>of Jacob</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+6:8">Amos vi. 8</A>);

 and he chose so good an inheritance for Jacob because he loved him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+7:8">Deut. vii. 8</A>.

 Apply this spiritually, and it bespeaks, 

 [1.] The happiness of the saints, that God himself has chosen their 
 inheritance for them, and it is a goodly heritage: <I>he</I> has chosen 
 it who knows the soul, and what will serve to make it happy; and he has 
 chosen so well that he himself has undertaken to be the <I>inheritance 
 of his people</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:5">Ps. xvi. 5</A>),

 and he has laid up for them in the other world an inheritance
 incorruptible,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:4">1 Pet. i. 4</A>.

 This will be indeed the excellency of Jacob, for whom, because he loved
 them, he prepared such a happiness as eye has not seen. 

 [2.] The faith and submission of the saints to God. This is the 
 language of every gracious soul, "God shall choose my inheritance for 
 me; let him appoint me my lot, and I will acquiesce in the appointment. 
 He knows what is good for me better than I do for myself, and therefore 
 I will have no will of my own but what is resolved into his."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  God is gone up with a shout, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with the sound of a
 trumpet.
 &nbsp; 6  Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our
 King, sing praises.
 &nbsp; 7  For God <I>is</I> the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
 understanding.
 &nbsp; 8  God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of

 people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth
 <I>belong</I> unto God: he is greatly exalted.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here most earnestly pressed to praise God, and to sing his 
 praises; so backward are we to this duty that we have need to be urged 
 to it by precept upon precept, and line upon line; so we are here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Sing praises to God,</I> and again, <I>Sing praises, Sing praises to
 our King,</I> and again, <I>Sing praises.</I> This intimates that it is 
 a very necessary and excellent duty, that it is a duty we ought to be 
 frequent and abundant in; we may sing praises again and again in the 
 same words, and it is no vain repetition if it be done with new 
 affections. Should not a people praise their God? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:4">Dan. v. 4</A>.

 Should not subjects praise their king? God is our God, our King, and
 therefore we must praise him; we must sing his praises, as those that 
 are pleased with them and that are not ashamed of them. But here is a 
 needful rule subjoined

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Sing you praises with understanding,</I> with <I>Maschil.</I>

 1. "Intelligently; as those that do yourselves understand why and for
 what reasons you praise God and what is the meaning of the service." 
 This is the gospel-rule

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:15">1 Cor. xiv. 15</A>),

 <I>to sing with the spirit and with the understanding also;</I> it is
 only with the heart that we make melody to the Lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:19">Eph. v. 19</A>.

 It is not an acceptable service if it be not a reasonable service. 

 2.  "Instructively, as those that desire to make others understand 
 God's glorious perfections, and to teach them to praise him." Three 
 things are mentioned in these verses as just matter for our praises, 
 and each of them will admit of a double sense:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We must praise God going up 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>God has gone up with a shout,</I> which may refer,

 1. To the carrying up of the ark to the hill of Zion, which was done
 with great solemnity, David himself dancing before it, the priests, it 
 is likely, blowing the trumpets, and the people following with their 
 loud huzzas. The ark being the instituted token of God's special 
 presence with them, when that was brought up by warrant from him he 
 might be said to <I>go up.</I> The emerging of God's ordinances out of 
 obscurity, in order to the more public and solemn administration of 
 them, is a great favour to any people, which they have reason to 
 rejoice in and give thanks for. 

 2. To the ascension of our Lord Jesus into heaven, when he had finished
 his work on earth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:9">Acts i. 9</A>.

 Then <I>God went up with a shout,</I> the shout of a King, of a 
 conqueror, as one who, having <I>spoiled principalities and powers,</I> 
 then <I>led captivity captive,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:18">Ps. lxviii. 18</A>.

 He went up as a Mediator, typified by the ark and the mercy-seat
 over it, and was brought as the ark was into the most holy place, 
 <I>into heaven itself;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:24">Heb. ix. 24</A>.

 We read not of a shout, or of the sound of a trumpet, at the ascension
 of Christ, but they were the inhabitants of the upper world, those sons 
 of God, that then shouted for joy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:7">Job xxxviii. 7</A>.

 He shall come again in the same manner as he went
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:11">Acts i. 11</A>)

 and we are sure that he shall come again with a shout and the sound of
 a trumpet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We must praise God reigning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 God is not only our King, and therefore we owe our homage to him, but 
 he is <I>King of all the earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 over all the kings of the earth, and therefore in every place the
 incense of praise is to be offered up to him. Now this may be 
 understood,

 1. Of the kingdom of providence. God, as Creator, and the God of
 nature, <I>reigns over the heathen,</I> disposes of them and all their 
 affairs, as he pleases, though they know him not, nor have any regard 
 to him: <I>He sits upon the throne of his holiness,</I> which he has 
 prepared in the heavens, and there he rules over all, even over the 
 heathen, serving his own purposes by them and upon them. See here the 
 extent of God's government; all are born within his allegiance; even 
 the heathen that serve other gods are ruled by the true God, our God, 
 whether they will or no. See the equity of his government; it is a 
 throne of holiness, on which he sits, whence he gives warrants, orders, 
 and judgment, in which we are sure there is no iniquity. 

 2. Of the kingdom of the Messiah. Jesus Christ, who is God, and whose 
 <I>throne is for ever and ever reigns over the heathen;</I> not only he 
 is entrusted with the administration of the providential kingdom, but 
 he shall set up the kingdom of his grace in the Gentile world, and rule 
 in the hearts of multitudes that were bred up in heathenism, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:12,13">Eph. ii. 12, 13</A>.

 This the apostle speaks of as a great mystery that the <I>Gentiles
 should be fellow-heirs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:6">Eph. iii. 6</A>.

 Christ <I>sits upon the throne of his holiness,</I> his throne in the
 heavens, where all the administrations of his government are intended 
 to show forth God's holiness and to advance holiness among the children 
 of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We must praise God as attended and honoured by <I>the princes of 
 the people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+47:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 This may be understood,

 1. Of the congress or convention of the states of Israel, the heads and
 rulers of the several tribes, at the solemn feasts, or to despatch the 
 public business of the nation. It was the honour of Israel that they 
 were <I>the people of the God of Abraham,</I> as they were Abraham's 
 seed and taken into his covenant; and, thanks be to God, this blessing 
 of Abraham has come upon the isles of the Gentiles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:14">Gal. iii. 14</A>.

 It was their happiness that they had a settled government, <I>princes
 of their people,</I> who were the <I>shields of their land.</I> 
 Magistracy is the shield of a nation, and it is a great mercy to any 
 people to have this shield, especially when their princes, <I>their 
 shields, belong unto the Lord,</I> are devoted to his honour, and their 
 power is employed in his service, for then he is greatly exalted. It is 
 likewise the honour of God that, in another sense, the <I>shields of 
 the earth do belong to him;</I> magistracy is his institution, and he 
 serves his own purposes by it in the government of the world, turning 
 the hearts of kings as the rivers of water, which way soever he 
 pleases. It was well with Israel when the princes of their people were 
 gathered together to consult for the public welfare.  The unanimous 
 agreement of the great ones of a nation in the things that belong to 
 its peace is a very happy omen, which promises abundance of blessings.

 2. It may be applied to the calling of the Gentiles into the church of 
 Christ, and taken as a prophecy that in the days of the Messiah the 
 kings of the earth and their people should join themselves to the 
 church, and bring their glory and power into the New Jerusalem, that 
 they should all become <I>the people of the God of Abraham,</I> to whom 
 it was promised that he should be <I>the father of many nations.</I> 
 The <I>volunteers</I> of the people (so it may be read); it is the same 
 word that is used in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>,

 <I>Thy people shall be willing;</I> for those that are gathered to 
 Christ are not forced, but made freely willing, to be his. When the 
 <I>shields of the earth,</I> the ensigns of royal dignity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:27,28">1 Kings xiv. 27, 28</A>),

 are surrendered to the Lord Jesus, as the keys of a city are presented
 to the conqueror or sovereign, when princes use their power for the
 advancement of the interests of religion, then Christ is greatly
 exalted.</P>
