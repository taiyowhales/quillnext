 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  These <I>are</I> also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of
 Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This verse is the title of this latter collection of Solomon's 
 proverbs, for he <I>sought out and set in order many proverbs,</I> that 
 by them he might be still <I>teaching the people knowledge,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:9">Eccl. xii. 9</A>.
 
 Observe,

 1. The proverbs were Solomon's, who was divinely inspired to deliver,
 for the use of the church, these wise and weighty sentences; we have 
 had many, but still there are more. Yet herein Christ is greater than 
 Solomon, for if we had all upon record that Christ said, and did, that 
 was instructive, <I>the world could not contain the books that would be 
 written,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:25">John xxi. 25</A>.

 2. The publishers were Hezekiah's servants, who, it is likely, herein
 acted as his servants, being appointed by him to do this good service 
 to the church, among other good offices that he did <I>in the law and 
 in the commandments,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+31:21">2 Chron. xxxi. 21</A>.

 Whether he employed the prophets in this work, as Isaiah, Hosea, or
 Micah, who lived in his time, or some that were trained up in the 
 schools of the prophets, or some of the priests and Levites, to whom we 
 find him giving a charge concerning divine things 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:4">2 Chron. xxix. 4</A>),

 or (as the Jews think) his princes and ministers of state, who were
 more properly called his <I>servants,</I> is not certain; if the work 
 was done by Eliakim, and Joah, and Shebna, it was no diminution to 
 their character.  They copied out these proverbs from the records of 
 Solomon's reign, and published them as an appendix to the former 
 edition of this book. It may be a piece of very good service to the 
 church to publish other men's works that have lain hidden in obscurity,
 perhaps a great while.  Some think they culled these out of the 3000 
 proverbs which Solomon spoke

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:32">1 Kings iv. 32</A>),

 leaving out those that were physical, and that pertained to natural
 philosophy, and preserving such only as were divine and moral; and in 
 this collection some observe that special regard was had to those 
 observations which concern kings and their administration.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  <I>It is</I> the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour
 of kings <I>is</I> to search out a matter.
 &nbsp; 3  The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart
 of kings <I>is</I> unsearchable.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. An instance given of the honour of God: <I>It is his glory to
 conceal a matter.</I> He needs not search into any thing, for he 
 perfectly knows every thing by a clear and certain view, and nothing 
 can be hidden from him; and yet his own <I>way is in the sea</I> and 
 his <I>path in the great waters.</I> There is an unfathomable depth in 
 his counsels, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:33">Rom. xi. 33</A>.

 It is but a little portion that is heard of him. <I>Clouds and darkness
 are round about him.</I> We see what he does, but we know not the 
 reasons. Some refer it to the sins of men; it is his glory to pardon 
 sin, which is covering it, not remembering it, not mentioning it; his 
 forbearance, which he exercises towards sinners, is likewise his 
 honour, in which he seems to keep silence and take no notice of the 
 matter.

 2. A double instance of the honour of kings:--

 (1.) It is God's glory that he needs not <I>search into a matter,</I>
 because he knows it without search; but it is the honour of kings, with 
 a close application of mind, and by all the methods of enquiry, to 
 search out the matters that are brought before them, to take pains in 
 examining offenders, that they may discover their designs and bring to 
 light the hidden works of darkness, not to give judgment hastily or 
 till they have weighed things, nor to leave it wholly to others to 
 examine things, but to see with their own eyes. 

 (2.) It is God's glory that he cannot himself be found out by
 searching, and some of that honour is devolved upon kings, wise kings, 
 that <I>search out matters;</I> their <I>hearts</I> are 
 <I>unsearchable,</I> like the <I>height of heaven</I> or the <I>depth 
 of the earth,</I> which we may guess at, but cannot measure. Princes 
 have their <I>arcana imperii--state secrets,</I> designs which are kept 
 private, and reasons of state, which private persons are not competent 
 judges of, and therefore ought not to pry into. Wise princes, when they 
 <I>search into a matter,</I> have reaches which one would not think of, 
 as Solomon, when he called of a sword to divide the living child with, 
 designing thereby to discover the true mother.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come
 forth a vessel for the finer.
 &nbsp; 5  Take away the wicked <I>from</I> before the king, and his throne
 shall be established in righteousness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This shows that the vigorous endeavour of a prince to suppress vice, 
 and reform the manners of his people, is the most effectual way to 
 support his government. Observe, 

 1. What the duty of magistrates is: To <I>take away the wicked,</I> to
 use their power for the terror of evil works and evil workers, not only 
 to banish those that are vicious and profane from their presence, and 
 forbid them the court, but so to frighten them and restrain them that 
 they may not spread the infection of their wickedness among their 
 subjects. This is called <I>taking away the dross from the silver,</I> 
 which is done by the force of fire.  Wicked people are the dross of a 
 nation, the scum of the country, and, as such, to be taken away. If men 
 will not take them away, God will, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:119">Ps. cxix. 119</A>.

 If the <I>wicked be taken away from before the king,</I> if he abandon
 them and show his detestation of their wicked courses, it will go far 
 towards the disabling of them to do mischief. The reformation of the 
 court will promote the reformation of the kingdom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:3,8">Ps. ci. 3, 8</A>.

 2. What the advantage will be of their doing this duty.

 (1.) It will be the bettering of the subjects; they shall be made like
 silver refined, fit to be made <I>vessels of honour.</I> 

 (2.) It will be the settling of the prince. <I>His throne shall be
 established in</I> this <I>righteousness,</I> for God will bless his 
 government, the people will be pliable to it, and so it will become 
 durable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand
 not in the place of great <I>men:</I>
 &nbsp; 7  For better <I>it is</I> that it be said unto thee, Come up hither;
 than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the
 prince whom thine eyes have seen.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we see, 

 1. That religion is so far from destroying good manners that it reaches 
 us to behave ourselves lowly and reverently towards our superiors, to 
 keep our distance, and give place to those to whom it belongs "<I>Put 
 not forth thyself</I> rudely and carelessly <I>in the king's 
 presence,</I> or in the presence of great men; do not <I>compare with 
 them</I>" (so some understand it); "do not vie with them in apparel, 
 furniture, gardens, house-keeping, or retinue, for that is an affront 
 to them and will waste thy own estate." 

 2. That religion teaches us humility and self-denial, which is a better
 lesson than that of good manners: "Deny thyself the place thou art 
 entitled to; covet not to make a fair show, nor air at preferment, nor 
 thrust thyself into the company of those that are above thee; be 
 content in a low sphere if that is it which God has allotted to thee." 
 The reason he gives is because this is really the way to advancement, 
 as our Saviour shows in a parable that seems to be borrowed from this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:9">Luke xiv. 9</A>.

 Not that we must <I>therefore</I> pretend modesty and humility, and
 make a stratagem of it, for the courting of honour, but 
 <I>therefore</I> we must really be modest and humble, because God will 
 put honour on such and so will men too.  It is better, more for a man's 
 satisfaction and reputation, to be advanced above his pretensions and 
 expectations, than to be thrust down below them, <I>in the presence of 
 the prince,</I> whom it was a great piece of honour to be admitted to 
 the sight of and a great piece of presumption to look upon without 
 leave.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Go not forth hastily to strive, lest <I>thou know not</I> what to
 do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.
 &nbsp; 9  Debate thy cause with thy neighbour <I>himself;</I> and discover
 not a secret to another:
 &nbsp; 10  Lest he that heareth <I>it</I> put thee to shame, and thine
 infamy turn not away.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is good counsel given about going to law:--

 1. "Be not hasty in bringing an action, before thou hast thyself
 considered it, and consulted with thy friends about it: <I>Go not forth 
 hastily to strive;</I> do not send for a writ in a passion, or upon the 
 first appearance of right on thy side, but weigh the matter 
 deliberately, because we are apt to be partial in our own cause; 
 consider the certainty of the expenses and the uncertainty of the 
 success, how much care and vexation it will be the occasion of, and, 
 after all, the cause may go against thee; surely then thou shouldst not 
 <I>go forth hastily to strive.</I>" 

 2. "Bring not an action before thou hast tried to end the matter
 amicably 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:9">
 <I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Debate thy cause with thy neighbour</I> privately, and perhaps you
 will understand one another better and see that there is no occasion to 
 go to law." In public quarrels the war that must at length end might 
 better have been prevented by a treaty of peace, and a great deal of 
 blood and treasure spared.  It is so in private quarrels: "Sue not thy 
 neighbour as a <I>heathen man and a publican</I> until thou hast told 
 him his fault between thee and him alone, and he has refused to refer 
 the matter, or to come to an accommodation. Perhaps the matter in 
 variance is a secret, not fit to be divulged to any, much less to be 
 brought upon the stage before the country; and therefore end it 
 privately, that it may not be discovered." <I>Reveal not the secret of 
 another,</I> so some read it.  "Do not, in revenge, to disgrace thy 
 adversary, disclose that which should be kept private and which does 
 not at all belong to the cause."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Two reasons he gives why we should be thus cautious in going to 
 law:--

 1. "Because otherwise the cause will be in danger of going against
 thee, and thou wilt <I>not know what to do</I> when the defendant has 
 justified himself in what thou didst charge upon him, and made it out 
 that thy complaint was frivolous and vexatious and that thou hadst no 
 just cause of action, and so <I>put thee to shame,</I> non-suit thee, 
 and force thee to pay costs, all which might have been prevented by a 
 little consideration." 

 2. "Because it will turn very much to thy reproach if thou fall under
 the character of being litigious. Not only the defendant himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 but he that hears the cause tried will <I>put thee to shame,</I> will
 expose thee as a man of no principle, and <I>thy infamy will not turn 
 away;</I> thou wilt never retrieve thy reputation."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  A word fitly spoken <I>is like</I> apples of gold in pictures of
 silver.
 &nbsp; 12  <I>As</I> an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, <I>so
 is</I> a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon here shows how much it becomes a man,

 1. To speak pertinently: <I>A word upon the wheels,</I> that runs well,
 is well-circumstanced, in proper time and place--instruction, advice,
 or comfort, given seasonably, and in apt expressions, adapted to the 
 case of the person spoken to and agreeing with the character of the 
 person speaking--<I>is like golden</I> balls resembling <I>apples,</I> 
 or like true apples of a golden colour (golden rennets), or perhaps 
 gilded, as sometimes we have gilded laurels, and those embossed <I>in 
 pictures of silver,</I> or rather brought to table in a silver network 
 basket, or in a silver box of that which we call <I>filigree</I>--work, 
 through which the golden apples might be seen. Doubtless in was some 
 ornament of the table, then well known. As that was very pleasing to 
 the eye, so is <I>a word fitly spoken</I> to the ear. 

 2. Especially to give a reproof with discretion, and so as to make it
 acceptable. If it be well given, by <I>a wise reprover,</I> and well 
 taken, by an <I>obedient ear,</I> it is an <I>earring of gold</I> and 
 an <I>ornament of fine gold,</I> very graceful and well becoming both 
 the reprover and the reproved; both will have their praise, the 
 reprover for giving it so prudently and the reproved for taking it so 
 patiently and making a good use of it. Others will commend them both, 
 and they will have satisfaction in each other; he who gave the reproof 
 is pleased that it had the desired effect, and he to whom it was given 
 has reason to be thankful for it as a kindness. <I>That is well 
 given,</I> we say, <I>that is well taken;</I> yet it does not always 
 prove that that is well taken which is well given. It were to be wished 
 that a <I>wise reprover</I> should always meet with an <I>obedient 
 ear,</I> but often it is not so.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, <I>so is</I> a
 faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the
 soul of his masters.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. What ought to be the care of a servant, the meanest that is sent on 
 an errand and entrusted with any business, much more the greatest, the 
 agent and ambassador of a prince; he ought to be <I>faithful to him 
 that sends him,</I> and to see to it that he do not, by mistake or with 
 design, falsify his trust, and that he be in nothing that lies in his 
 power wanting to his master's interest. Those that act as factors, by 
 commission, ought to act as carefully as for themselves. 

 2. How much this will be the satisfaction of the master; it will
 <I>refresh his soul</I> as much as ever the <I>cold of snow</I> (which 
 is hot countries they preserve by art all the year round) refreshed the 
 labourers in the harvest, that <I>bore the burden and heat of the 
 day.</I> The more important the affair was, and the more fear of its 
 miscarrying, the more acceptable is the messenger, if he have managed 
 it successfully and well. A faithful minister, Christ's messenger, 
 should be thus acceptable to us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:23">Job xxxiii. 23</A>);

 <I>He</I> may be said to boast of a false gift,

 which he never gave, makes a noise of his great accomplishments and his 
 good services, but it is all false; he is not what he pretends to be. 
 Or, 

 2. Who promises what he will give and what he will do, but performs
 nothing, who raises people's expectations of the mighty things he will 
 do for his country, for his friends, what noble legacies he will leave, 
 but either he has not wherewithal to do what he says or he never 
 designs it. Such a one is like the morning-cloud, that passes away, and

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue
 breaketh the bone.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things are here recommended to us, in dealing with others, as 
 likely means to gain our point:--

 1. Patience, to bear a present heat without being put into a heat by
 it, and to wait for a fit opportunity to offer our reasons and to give 
 persons time to consider them. By this means even a <I>prince</I> may 
 be <I>persuaded</I> to do a thing which he seemed very averse to, much 
 more a common person. That which is justice and reason now will be so 
 another time, and therefore we need not urge them with violence now, 
 but wait for a more convenient season.  

 2. Mildness, to speak without passion or provocation: <I>A soft tongue
 breaks the bone;</I> it mollifies the roughest spirits and overcomes 
 those that are most morose, like lightning, which, they say, has 
 sometimes broken the bone, and yet not pierced the flesh. Gideon with a 
 soft tongue pacified the Ephraimites and Abigail turned away David's 
 wrath. <I>Hard words,</I> we say, <I>break no bones,</I> and therefore 
 we should bear them patiently; but, it seems, <I>soft words</I> do, and 
 therefore we should, on all occasions, give them prudently.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for
 thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. We are allowed a sober and moderate use of the delights of sense: 
 <I>Hast thou found honey?</I> It is not forbidden fruit to thee, as it 
 was to Jonathan; thou mayest eat of it with thanksgiving to God, who, 
 having created things grateful to our senses, has given us leave to 
 make use of them. <I>Eat as much as is sufficient,</I> and no more. 
 <I>Enough is as good as a feast.</I> 

 2. We are cautioned to take heed of excess. We must use all pleasures
 as we do honey, with a check upon our appetite, lest we take more than 
 does us good and make ourselves sick with it. We are most in danger of 
 surfeiting upon that which is most sweet, and therefore those that fare 
 sumptuously every day have need to watch over themselves, <I>lest their 
 hearts be at any time overcharged.</I> The pleasures of sense lose 
 their sweetness by the excessive use of them and become nauseous, as 
 honey, which turns sour in the stomach; it is therefore our interest, 
 as well as our duty, to use them with sobriety.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here he mentions another pleasure which we must not take too much of, 
 that of visiting our friends, the former for fear of surfeiting 
 ourselves, this for fear of surfeiting our neighbour. 

 1. It is a piece of civility to visit our neighbours sometimes, to show
 our respect to them and concern for them, and to cultivate and improve 
 mutual acquaintance and love, and that we may have both the 
 satisfaction and advantage of their conversation. 

 2. It is wisdom, as well as good manners, not to be troublesome to our
 friends in our visiting them, not to visit too often, nor stay too 
 long, nor contrive to come at meal-time, nor make ourselves busy in the 
 affairs of their families; hereby we make ourselves cheap, mean, and 
 burdensome. Thy neighbour, who is thus plagued and haunted with thy 
 visits, will be <I>weary of thee and hate thee,</I> and <I>that</I> 
 will be the destruction of friendship which should have been the 
 improvement of it.  <I>Post tres s&aelig;pe dies piscis vilescit et 
 hospes--After the third day fish and company become distasteful.</I> 
 Familiarity breeds contempt. <I>Nulli te facias nimis sodalem--Be not 
 too intimate with any.</I> He that sponges upon his friend loses him. 
 How much better a friend then is God than any other friend; for we need 
 not withdraw our foot from his house, the throne of his grace

 Here, 

 1. The sin condemned is <I>bearing false witness against our

 2. That which it is here condemned for is the mischievousness of it; it
 is in its power to ruin not only men's reputation, but their lives, 
 estates, families, all that is dear to them. A false testimony is every 
 thing that is dangerous; it <I>is a maul</I> (or <I>club</I> to knock a 
 man's brains out with), a flail, which there is no fence against; it is

 vinegar upon nitre, so <I>is</I> he that singeth songs to an heavy
 heart.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The absurdity here censured is <I>singing songs to a heavy 
 heart.</I> Those that are in great sorrow are to be comforted by 
 sympathizing with them, condoling with them, and concurring in their 
 lamentation. If we take that method, the <I>moving of our lips may 
 assuage their grief</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:5">Job xvi. 5</A>);

 but we take a wrong course with them if we think to relieve them by
 being merry with them, and endeavouring to make them merry; for it adds 
 to their grief to see their friends so little concerned for them; it 
 puts them upon ripping up the causes of their grief, and aggravating 
 them, and makes them harden themselves in sorrow against the assaults 
 of mirth.

 2. The absurdities this is compared to are, <I>taking away a
 garment</I> from a man in <I>cold weather,</I> which makes him colder, 
 and pouring <I>vinegar upon nitre,</I> which, like water upon lime, 
 puts it into a ferment; so improper, so incongruous, is it to sing 
 pleasant songs to one that is of a sorrowful spirit. Some read it in a 
 contrary sense: <I>As he that puts on a garment in cold weather</I> 
 warms the body, or as <I>vinegar upon nitre</I> dissolves it, so he 
 that <I>sings songs</I> of comfort to a person in sorrow refreshes him 
 and dispels his grief.</P>

 By this it appears that, however the scribes and Pharisees had 
 corrupted the law, not only the commandment of loving our brethren, but 
 even that of loving our enemies, was not only a new, but also an old 
 commandment, an Old-Testament commandment, though our Saviour has given 
 it to us with the new enforcement of his own great example in loving us 
 when we were enemies. Observe, 

 1. How we must express our love to our enemies by the real offices of
 kindness, even those that are expensive to ourselves and most 
 acceptable to them: "If they be <I>hungry</I> and <I>thirsty,</I> 
 instead of pleasing thyself with their distress and contriving how to 
 cut off supplies from them, relieve them, as Elisha did the Syrians 
 that came to apprehend him," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:22">2 King vi. 22</A>.

 2.  What encouragement we have to do so.

 (1.) It will be a likely means to win upon them, and bring them over to
 be reconciled to us; we shall mollify them as the refiner melts the 
 metal in the crucible, not only by putting it over the fire, but by 
 heaping coals of fire upon it. The way to turn an enemy into a friend 
 is, to act towards him in a friendly manner. If it do not gain him, it 
 will aggravate his sin and punishment, and heap the burning coals of 
 God's wrath upon his head, as rejoicing in his calamity may be an 
 occasion of God's turning his wrath from him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:17"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 17</A>.

 (2.) However, we shall be no losers by our self-denial: "Whether he
 relent towards thee or no, <I>the Lord shall reward thee;</I> he shall 
 forgive thee who thus showest thyself to be of a forgiving spirit. He 
 shall provide for thee when thou art in distress (though thou hast been 
 evil and ungrateful), as thou dost for thy enemy; at least it shall be 
 recompensed in the resurrection of the just, when kindnesses done to 
 our enemies shall be remembered as well as those shown to God's 
 friends."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  The north wind driveth away rain: so <I>doth</I> an angry
 countenance a backbiting tongue.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here see, 

 1. How we must discourage sin and witness against it, and particularly 
 the sin of slandering and backbiting; we must frown upon it, and, by 
 giving it an angry countenance, endeavour to put it out of countenance. 
 Slanders would not be so readily spoken as they are if they were not 
 readily heard; but good manners would silence the slanderer if he saw 
 that his tales displeased the company. We should show ourselves uneasy 
 if we heard a dear friend, whom we value, evil-spoken of; the same 
 dislike we should show of evil-speaking in general. If we cannot 
 otherwise reprove, we may do it by our looks. 

 2. The good effect which this might probably have; who knows but it may
 silence and drive away a <I>backbiting tongue?</I> Sin, if it be 
 countenanced, becomes daring, but, if it receive any check, it is so 
 conscious of its own shame that it becomes cowardly, and this sin in 
 particular, for many abuse those they speak of only in hopes to curry 
 favour with those they speak to.</P>

 This is the same with what he had said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:9"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 9</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. How those are to be pitied that are unequally yoked, especially with
 such as are brawling and contentious, whether husband or wife; for it 
 is equally true of both. It is better to be alone than to be joined to 
 one who, instead of being a meet-help, is a great hindrance to the 
 comfort of life. 

 2. How those may sometimes be envied that live in solitude; as they
 want the comfort of society, so they are free from the vexation of it. 
 And as there are cases which give occasion to say, "Blessed is the womb 
 that has not borne," so there are which give occasion to say, "Blessed 
 is the man who was never married, but who lies like a servant in <I>a

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. How natural it is to us to desire to hear good news from our 
 friends, and concerning our affairs at a distance. It is sometimes with 
 impatience that we expect to hear from abroad; our souls thirst after 
 it. But we should check the inordinateness of that desire; if it be bad 
 news, it will come too soon, if good, it will be welcome at any time. 
 
 2. How acceptable such good news will be when it does come, as
 refreshing as cold water to one that is thirsty. Solomon himself had 
 much trading abroad, as well as correspondence by his ambassadors with 
 foreign courts; and how pleasant it was to hear of the good success of 
 his negotiations abroad he well knew by experience. Heaven is a country 
 afar off; how refreshing is it to hear good news thence, both in the 
 everlasting gospel, which signified glad tidings, and in the witness of 
 the Spirit with our spirits that we are God's children.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>26  A righteous man falling down before the wicked <I>is as</I> a
 troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is here represented as a very lamentable thing, and a public 
 grievance, and of ill consequence to many, like the <I>troubling</I> of 
 a <I>fountain</I> and the <I>corrupting</I> of a <I>spring,</I> for the 
 righteous to <I>fall down before the wicked,</I> that is, 

 1. For the righteous to fall into sin in the sight of the wicked--for
 them to do any thing unbecoming their profession, which is <I>told in 
 Gath,</I> and <I>published in the streets of Ashkelon,</I> and in which 
 the <I>daughters of the Philistines rejoice.</I> For those that have 
 been <I>in reputation for wisdom and honour</I> to fall from their 
 excellency, this <I>troubles the fountains</I> by grieving some, and 
 <I>corrupts the springs</I> by infecting others and emboldening them to 
 do likewise. 

 2. For the righteous to be oppressed, and run down, and trampled upon,
 by the violence or subtlety of evil men, to be displaced and thrust 
 into obscurity, this is the troubling of the fountains of justice and 
 corrupting the very springs of government,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:12,28,29:2"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 12, 28; xxix. 2</A>.

 3. For the righteous to be cowardly, to truckle to the wicked, to be
 afraid of opposing his wickedness and basely to yield to him, this is a 
 reflection upon religion, a discouragement to good men, and strengthens 
 the hands of sinners in their sins, and so is like a <I>troubled 
 fountain</I> and a <I>corrupt spring.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  <I>It is</I> not good to eat much honey: so <I>for men</I> to search
 their own glory <I>is not</I> glory.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Two things we must be graciously dead to:--

 1. To the pleasures of sense, for <I>it is not good to eat much
 honey;</I> though it pleases the taste, and, if eaten with moderation, 
 is very wholesome, yet, if eaten to excess, it becomes nauseous, 
 creates bile, and is the occasion of many diseases. It is true of all 
 the delights of the children of men that they will surfeit, but never 
 satisfy, and they are dangerous to those that allow themselves the 
 liberal use of them. 

 2. To the praise of man. We must not be greedy of that any more than of
 pleasure, because, <I>for men to search their own glory,</I> to court 
 applause and covet to make themselves popular, is not their glory, but 
 their shame; every one will laugh at them for it; and the glory which 
 is so courted <I>is not glory</I> when it is got, for it is really no 
 true honour to a man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Some give another sense of this verse: <I>To eat much honey is not 
 good,</I> but to search into glorious and excellent things is a great 
 commendation, it is true glory; we cannot therein offend by excess. 
 Others thus: "As honey, though pleasant to the taste, if used 
 immoderately, oppresses the stomach, so an over-curious search into 
 things sublime and glorious, though pleasant to us, if we pry too far, 
 will overwhelm our capacities with a greater glory and lustre than they 
 can bear." Or thus: "You may be surfeited with eating too much honey, 
 but the last of glory, of their glory, the glory of the blessed, is 
 glory; it will be ever fresh, and never pall the appetite."</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The good character of a wise and virtuous man implied. He is one 
 that has <I>rule over his own spirit;</I> he maintains the government 
 of himself, and of his own appetites and passions, and does not suffer 
 them to rebel against reason and conscience. He has the rule of his own 
 thoughts, his desires, his inclinations, his resentments, and keeps
 them all in good order. 

 2. The bad case of a vicious man, who has not this rule over his own
 spirit, who, when temptations to excess in eating or drinking are 
 before him, has no government of himself, when he is provoked breaks 
 out into exorbitant passions, such a one is <I>like a city that is 
 broken down and without walls.</I> All that is good goes out, and 
 forsakes him; all that is evil breaks in upon him.  He lies exposed to 
 all the temptations of Satan and becomes an easy prey to that enemy; he 
 is also liable to many troubles and vexations; it is likewise as much a 
 reproach to him as it is to a city to have its walls ruined,
