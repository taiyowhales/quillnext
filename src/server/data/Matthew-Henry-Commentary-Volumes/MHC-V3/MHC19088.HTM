 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is a lamentation, one of the most melancholy of all the 
 psalms; and it does not conclude, as usually the melancholy psalms do, 
 with the least intimation of comfort or joy, but, from first to last, 
 it is mourning and woe. It is not upon a public account that the 
 psalmist here complains (here is no mention of the afflictions of the 
 church), but only upon a personal account, especially trouble of mind, 
 and the grief impressed upon his spirits both by his outward 
 afflictions and by the remembrance of his sins and the fear of God's 
 wrath. It is reckoned among the penitential psalms, and it is well when 
 our fears are thus turned into the right channel, and we take occasion 
 from our worldly grievances to sorrow after a godly sort. In this psalm 
 we have, 

 I. The great pressure of spirit that the psalmist was under, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:3-6">ver. 3-6</A>.

 II. The wrath of God, which was the cause of that pressure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:7,15-17">ver. 7, 15-17</A>.

 III. The wickedness of his friends, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:8,18">ver. 8, 18</A>.

 IV. The application he made to God by prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:1,2,9,13">ver. 1, 2, 9, 13</A>.

 V. His humble expostulations and pleadings with God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:10,12,14">ver. 10, 12, 14</A>.
 
 Those who are in trouble of mind may sing this psalm feelingly; those 
 that are not ought to sing it thankfully, blessing God that it is not 
 their case.</P>

 <P>A song <I>or</I> psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief musician 
 <BR>upon Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of my salvation,
 I have cried day <I>and</I> night before thee:
 &nbsp; 2  Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my
 cry;
 &nbsp; 3  For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh
 unto the grave.
 &nbsp; 4  I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a
 man <I>that hath</I> no strength:
 &nbsp; 5  Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave,
 whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy
 hand.
 &nbsp; 6  Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the
 deeps.
 &nbsp; 7  Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted <I>me</I>
 with all thy waves. Selah.
 &nbsp; 8  Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast
 made me an abomination unto them: <I>I am</I> shut up, and I cannot
 come forth.
 &nbsp; 9  Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I have
 called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It should seem, by the titles of this and the following psalm, that 
 Heman was the penman of the one and Ethan of the other. There were two,
 of these names, who were sons of Zerah the son of Judah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+2:4,6">1 Chron. ii. 4, 6</A>.
 
 There were two others famed for wisdom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:31">1 Kings iv. 31</A>,

 where, to magnify Solomon's wisdom, he is said to be <I>wiser than
 Heman and Ethan.</I> Whether the Heman and Ethan who were Levites and
 precentors in the songs of Zion were the same we are not sure, nor
 which of these, nor whether any of these, were the penmen of these
 psalms. There was a Heman that was one of the chief singers, who is
 called <I>the king's seer, or prophet,</I> in the words of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+25:5">1 Chron. xxv. 5</A>);

 it is probable that this also was a seer, and yet could see no comfort
 for himself, an instructor and comforter of others, and yet himself 
 putting comfort away from him. The very first words of the psalm are 
 the only words of comfort and support in all the psalm. There is 
 nothing about him but clouds and darkness; but, before he begins his 
 complaint, he calls God <I>the God of his salvation,</I> which 
 intimates both that he looked for salvation, bad as things were, and 
 that he looked up to God for the salvation and depended upon him to be 
 the author of it. Now here we have the psalmist,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A man of prayer, one that gave himself to prayer at all times, but 
 especially now that he was in affliction; for <I>is any afflicted? let 
 him pray.</I> It is his comfort that he had prayed; it is his complaint 
 that, notwithstanding his prayer, he was still in affliction. He was, 
 
 1. Very earnest in prayer: "<I>I have cried unto thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and have <I>stretched out my hands unto thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 as one that would take hold on thee, and even catch at the mercy, with 
 a holy fear of coming short and missing of it." 

 2. He was very frequent and constant in prayer: <I>I have called upon
 thee daily</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 nay, <I>day and night,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 For thus men ought always to pray, and not to faint; God's own elect
 cry day and night to him, not only morning and evening, beginning every 
 day and every night with prayer, but spending the day and night in 
 prayer. This is indeed praying always; and then we shall speed in 
 prayer, when we continue instant in prayer.  

 3. He directed his prayer to God, and from him expected and desired an
 answer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>Let my prayer come before thee,</I> to be accepted of thee, not 
 before men, to be seen of them, as the Pharisees' prayers." He does not 
 desire that men should hear them, but, "Lord, <I>incline thy ear unto 
 my cry,</I> for to that I refer myself; give what answer to it thou 
 pleasest."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He was a man of sorrows, and therefore some make him, in this 
 psalm, a type of Christ, whose complaints on the cross, and sometimes 
 before, were much to the same purport with this psalm. He cries out 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:3"><I>v.</I>  3</A>):

 <I>My soul is full of troubles;</I> so Christ said, <I>Now is my soul 
 troubled;</I> and, in his agony, <I>My soul is exceedingly sorrowful 
 even unto death,</I> like the psalmist's here, for he says, <I>My life 
 draws nigh unto the grave.</I> Heman was a very wise man, and a very 
 good man, a man of God, and a singer too, and one may therefore suppose 
 him to have been a man of a cheerful spirit, and yet now a man of 
 sorrowful spirit, troubled in mind, and upon the brink of despair. 
 Inward trouble is the sorest trouble, and that which, sometimes, the 
 best of God's saints and servants have been severely exercised with. 
 <I>The spirit of man,</I> of the greatest of men, will not always 
 sustain his infirmity, but will droop and sink under it; <I>who then 
 can bear a wounded spirit?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He looked upon himself as a dying man, whose heart was ready to 
 break with sorrow 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>Free among the dead</I> (one of that ghastly corporation), <I>like
 the slain that lie in the grave,</I> whose rotting and perishing nobody 
 takes notice of or is concerned for, nay, whom thou rememberest no 
 more, to protect or provide for the dead bodies, but they become an 
 easy prey to corruption and the worms; they are <I>cut off from thy 
 hand,</I> which used to be employed in supporting them and reaching out 
 to them; but, now there is no more occasion for this, they are cut off 
 from it and cut off by it" (<I>for God will not stretch out his hand to 
 the grave,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:24">Job xxx. 24</A>);

 "<I>thou hast laid me in the lowest pit,</I> as low as possible, my 
 condition low, my spirits low, <I>in darkness, in the deep</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 sinking, and seeing no way open of escape, brought to the last
 extremity, and ready to give up all for gone." Thus greatly may good 
 men be afflicted, such dismal apprehensions may they have concerning 
 their afflictions, and such dark conclusions may they sometimes be 
 ready to make concerning the issue of them, through the power of 
 melancholy and the weakness of faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He complained most of God's displeasure against him, which infused 
 the wormwood and the gall into the affliction and the misery 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):
 
 <I>Thy wrath lies hard upon me.</I> Could he have discerned the favour 
 and love of God in his affliction, it would have lain light upon him; 
 but it lay hard, very hard, upon him, so that he was ready to sink and 
 faint under it. The impressions of this wrath upon his spirits were 
 God's <I>waves</I> with which he afflicted him, which rolled upon him, 
 one on the neck of another, so that he scarcely recovered from one dark 
 thought before he was oppressed with another; these waves beat against 
 him with noise and fury; not some, but all, of God's waves were made 
 use of in afflicting him and bearing him down. Even the children of 
 God's love may sometimes apprehend themselves children of wrath, and no 
 outward trouble can lie so hard upon them as that apprehension.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. It added to his affliction that his friends deserted him and made 
 themselves strange to him. When we are in trouble it is some comfort to 
 have those about us that love us, and sympathize with us; but this good 
 man had none such, which gives him occasion, not to accuse them, or 
 charge them with treachery, ingratitude, and inhumanity, but to 
 complain to God, with an eye to his hand in this part of the affliction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Thou hast put away my acquaintance far from me.</I> Providence had 
 removed them, or rendered them incapable of being serviceable to him, 
 or alienated their affections from him; for every creature is that to 
 us (and no more) that God makes it to be. If our old acquaintance be 
 shy of us, and those we expect kindness from prove unkind, we must bear 
 that with the same patient submission to the divine will that we do 
 other afflictions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:13">Job xix. 13</A>.

 Nay, his friends were not only strange to him, but even hated him,
 because he was poor and in distress: "<I>Thou hast made me an 
 abomination to them;</I> they are not only shy of me, but sick of me, 
 and I am looked upon by them, not only with contempt, but with 
 abhorrence." Let none think it strange concerning such a trial as this, 
 when Heman, who was so famed for wisdom, was yet, when the world 
 frowned upon him, neglected, as a vessel in which is no pleasure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He looked upon his case as helpless and deplorable: "<I>I am shut 
 up, and I cannot come forth,</I> a close prisoner, under the arrests of 
 divine wrath, and no way open of escape." He therefore lies down and 
 sinks under his troubles, because he sees not any probability of 
 getting out of them. For thus he bemoans himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>My eye mourneth by reason of affliction.</I> Sometimes giving vent 
 to grief by weeping gives some ease to a troubled spirit. Yet weeping 
 must not hinder praying; we must sow in tears: <I>My eye mourns,</I> 
 but <I>I cry unto thee daily.</I> Let prayers and tears go together, 
 and they shall be accepted together. <I>I have heard thy prayers, I 
 have seen thy tears.</I></P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The psalmist expostulates with God concerning the present deplorable 
 condition he was in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:10-12"><I>v.</I> 10-12</A>):

 "<I>Wilt thou do a miraculous work to the dead,</I> and raise them to 
 life again? Shall those that are dead and buried <I>rise up to praise 
 thee?</I> No; they leave it to their children to rise up in their room 
 to praise God; none expects that they should do it; and wherefore 
 should they rise, wherefore should they live, but to praise God? The 
 life we are born to at first, and the life we hope to rise to at last, 
 must thus be spent. But <I>shall thy lovingkindness to thy people be 
 declared in the grave,</I> either by those or to those that lie buried 
 there? And thy faithfulness to thy promise, shall that be told in 
 destruction? <I>shall thy wonders be wrought in the dark,</I> or known 
 there, <I>and thy righteousness in</I> the grave, which is <I>the land 
 of forgetfulness,</I> where men remember nothing, nor are themselves 
 remembered? Departed souls may indeed know God's wonders and declare 
 his faithfulness, justice, and lovingkindness; but deceased bodies 
 cannot; they can neither receive God's favours in comfort nor return 
 them in praise." Now we will not suppose these expostulations to be the 
 language of despair, as if he thought God could not help him or would 
 not, much less do they imply any disbelief of the resurrection of the 
 dead at the last day; but he thus pleads with God for speedy relief: 
 "Lord, thou art good, thou art faithful, thou art righteous; these 
 attributes of thine will be made known in my deliverance, but, if it be 
 not hastened, it will come too late; for I shall be dead and past 
 relief, dead and not capable of receiving any comfort, very shortly." 
 Job often pleaded thus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:8,10:21">Job vii. 8; x. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He resolves to continue instant in prayer, and the more so because 
 the deliverance was deferred 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>Unto thee have I cried</I> many a time, and found comfort in so 
 doing, and therefore I will continue to do so; <I>in the morning shall 
 my prayer prevent thee.</I>" Note, Though our prayers be not answered 
 immediately, yet we must not therefore give over praying, because 
 <I>the vision is for an appointed time, and at the end it shall speak 
 and not lie.</I> God delays the answer in order that he may try our 
 patience and perseverance in prayer. He resolves to seek God early, in 
 the morning, when his spirits were lively, and before the business of 
 the day began to crowd in--in the morning, after he had been tossed 
 with cares, and sorrowful thoughts in the silence and solitude of the 
 night; but how could he say, <I>My prayer shall prevent thee?</I> Not 
 as if he could wake sooner to pray than God to hear and answer; for he 
 neither slumbers nor sleeps; but it intimates that he would be up 
 earlier than ordinary to pray, would <I>prevent</I> (that is, go 
 before) his usual hour of prayer. The greater our afflictions are the 
 more solicitous and serious we should be in prayer. "My prayer shall 
 present itself before thee, and be betimes with thee, and shall not 
 stay for the encouragement of the beginning of mercy, but reach towards 
 it with faith and expectation even before the day dawns." God often 
 prevents our prayers and expectations with his mercies; let us prevent 
 his mercies with our prayers and expectations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He sets down what he will say to God in prayer. 

 1. He will humbly reason with God concerning the abject afflicted
 condition he was now in

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>Lord, why castest thou off my soul?</I> What is it that provokes 
 thee to treat me as one abandoned? <I>Show me wherefore thou contendest 
 with me.</I>" He speaks it with wonder that God should cast off an old 
 servant, should cast off one that was resolved not to cast him off: "No 
 wonder men cast me off; but, Lord, why dost thou, whose gifts and 
 callings are without repentance? <I>Why hidest thou thy face,</I> as 
 one angry at me, that either hast no favour for me or wilt not let me 
 know that thou hast?" Nothing grieves a child of God so much as God's 
 hiding his face from him, nor is there any thing he so much dreads as 
 God's casting off his soul. If the sun be clouded, that darkens the 
 earth; but if the sun should abandon the earth, and quite cast it off, 
 what a dungeon would it be! 

 2. He will humbly repeat the same complaints he had before made, until
 God have mercy on him. Two things he represents to God as his 
 grievances:--

 (1.) That God was a terror to him: <I>I suffer thy terrors,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 He had continual frightful apprehensions of the wrath of God against
 him for his sins and the consequences of that wrath. It terrified him 
 to think of God, of falling into his hands and appearing before him to 
 receive his doom from him. He perspired and trembled at the 
 apprehension of God's displeasure against him, and the terror of his 
 majesty. Note, Even those that are designed for God's favours may yet, 
 for a time, suffer his terrors. The spirit of adoption is first a 
 spirit of bondage to fear. Poor Job complained of the terrors of <I>God 
 setting themselves in array against him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:4">Job vi. 4</A>.

 The psalmist here explains himself, and tells us what he means by God's
 terrors, even his <I>fierce wrath.</I> Let us see what dreadful 
 impressions those terrors made upon him, and how deeply they wounded 
 him.

 [1.] They had almost taken away his life: "<I>I am so afflicted</I> 
 with them that I am <I>ready to die,</I> and" (as the word is) "<I>to 
 give up the ghost.  Thy terrors have cut me off,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 What is hell, that eternal excision, by which damned sinners are for
 ever cut off from God and all happiness, but God's terrors fastening 
 and preying upon their guilty consciences?  

 [2.] They had almost taken away the use of his reason: <I>When I suffer 
 thy terrors I am distracted.</I> This sad effect the terrors of the 
 Lord have had upon many, and upon some good men, who have thereby been 
 put quite out of the possession of their own souls, a most piteous 
 case, and which ought to be looked upon with great compassion. 

 [3.] This had continued long: <I>From my youth up I suffer thy 
 terrors.</I> He had been from his childhood afflicted with melancholy, 
 and trained up in sorrow under the discipline of that school. If we 
 begin our days with trouble, and the days of our mourning have been 
 prolonged a great while, let us not think it strange, but let 
 tribulation work patience.  It is observable the Heman, who became 
 eminently wise and good, was <I>afflicted and ready to die,</I> and 
 suffered God's terrors, <I>from his youth up.</I> Thus many have found 
 it was good for them to bear the yoke in their youth, that sorrow has 
 been much better for them than laughter would have been, and that being 
 much afflicted, and often ready to die, when they were young, they 
 have, by the grace of God, got such an habitual seriousness and 
 weanedness from the world as have been of great use to them all their 
 days. Sometimes those whom God designs for eminent services are 
 prepared for them by exercises of this kind.  

 [4.] His affliction was now extreme, and worse than ever. God's terrors 
 now came round about him, so that from all sides he was assaulted with 
 variety of troubles, and he had no comfortable gale from any point of 
 the compass. They broke in upon him together like an inundation of 
 water; and this daily, and all the day; so that he had no rest, no 
 respite, not the lest breathing-time, no lucid intervals, nor any gleam 
 of hope.  Such was the calamitous state of a very wise and good man; he 
 was so surrounded with terrors that he could find no place of shelter, 
 nor lie any where under the wind.

 (2.) That no friend he had in the world was a comfort to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 
 <I>Lover and friend hast thou put far from me;</I> some are dead, 
 others at a distance, and perhaps many unkind. Next to the comforts of 
 religion are those of friendship and society; therefore to be 
 friendless is (as to this life) almost to be comfortless; and to those 
 who have had friends, but have lost them, the calamity is the more 
 grievous. With this the psalmist here closes his complaint, as if this 
 were that which completed his woe and gave the finishing stroke to the 
 melancholy piece. If our friends are put far from us by scattering 
 providences, nay, if by death our acquaintance are removed into 
 darkness, we have reason to look upon it as a sore affliction, but must 
 acknowledge and submit to the hand of God in it.</P>
