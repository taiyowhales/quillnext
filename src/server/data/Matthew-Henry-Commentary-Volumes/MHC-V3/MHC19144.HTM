 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The four preceding psalms seem to have been penned by David before his 
 accession to the crown, when he was persecuted by Saul; this seems to 
 have been penned afterwards, when he was still in trouble (for there is 
 no condition in this world privileged with an exemption from trouble), 
 the neighbouring nations molesting him and giving him disturbance, 
 especially the Philistines, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:17">2 Sam. v. 17</A>.

 In this psalm, 

 I. He acknowledges, with triumph and thankfulness, the great goodness
 of God to him in advancing him to the government , 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. He prays to God to help him against the enemies who threatened him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:5-8,11">ver. 5-8 
 and again ver. 11</A>.

 III. He rejoices in the assurance of victory over them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 IV. He prays for the prosperity of his own kingdom, and pleases
 himself with the hopes of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 In singing this psalm we may give God the glory of our spiritual 
 privileges and advancements, and fetch in help from him against our
 spiritual enemies; we may pray for the prosperity of our souls, of our 
 families, and of our land; and, in the opinion of some of the Jewish 
 writers, we may refer the psalm to the Messiah and his kingdom.</P>

 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Blessed <I>be</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my strength,
 which teacheth my hands to war, <I>and</I> my fingers to fight:
 &nbsp; 2  My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my
 deliverer; my shield, and <I>he</I> in whom I trust; who subdueth my
 people under me.

 passeth away.
 &nbsp; 5  Bow thy heavens, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and come down: touch the mountains,
 and they shall smoke.
 &nbsp; 6  Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine
 arrows, and destroy them.
 &nbsp; 7  Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of
 great waters, from the hand of strange children;
 &nbsp; 8  Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand <I>is</I> a
 right hand of falsehood.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. David acknowledges his dependence upon God and his obligations to
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 A prayer for further mercy is fitly begun with a thanksgiving for 
 former mercy; and when we are waiting upon God to bless us we should 
 stir up ourselves to bless him. He gives to God the glory of two 
 things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he was to him: <I>Blessed be the Lord my</I> rock 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>my goodness, my fortress,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He has in the covenant engaged himself to be so, and encouraged us,
 accordingly, to depend upon him; all the saints, who by faith have made 
 him theirs, have found him not only to answer but to out do their 
 expectations. David speaks of it here as the matter of his trust, and 
 that which made him easy, as the matter of his triumph, and that which 
 made him glad, and in which he gloried. See how he multiplies words to 
 express the satisfaction he had in God and his interest in him. 

 (1.) "He is <I>my strength,</I> on whom I stay, and from whom I have
 power both for my work and for my warfare, my rock to build on, to take 
 shelter in." Even when we are weak we may <I>be strong in the Lord and 
 in the power of his might.</I>

 (2.) "<I>My goodness,</I> not only good to me, but my chief good, in
 whose favour I place my felicity, and who is the author of all the 
 goodness that is in me, and <I>from whom comes every good and perfect 
 gift.</I>"

 (3.) "<I>My fortress,</I> and <I>my high tower,</I> in whom I think
 myself as safe as ever any prince thought himself in a castle or 
 strong-hold." David had formerly sheltered himself in strong-holds at 
 En-gedi

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:29">1 Sam. xxiii. 29</A>),

 which perhaps were natural fastnesses. He had lately made himself
 master of the strong-hold of Zion, which was fortified by art, and he 
 <I>dwelt in the fort</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:7,9">2 Sam. v. 7, 9</A>),

 but he depends not on these. "Lord," says he, "thou art <I>my
 fortress</I> and <I>my high tower.</I>" The divine attributes and 
 promises are fortifications to a believer, far exceeding those either 
 of nature or art. 

 (4.) <I>My deliverer,</I> and, as it is in the original, very 
 emphatically, <I>my deliverer to me,</I> "not only a deliverer I have 
 interest in, but who is always nigh unto me and makes all my 
 deliverances turn to my real benefit."

 (5.) "<I>My shield,</I> to guard me against all the malignant darts 
 that my enemies let fly at me, not only <I>my fortress</I> at home, but 
 <I>my shield</I> abroad in the field of battle." Wherever a believer 
 goes he carries his protection along with him. <I>Fear not, Abram, I am 
 thy shield.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What he had done for him. He was bred a shepherd, and seems not to 
 have been designed by his parents, or himself for any thing more. But, 
 
 (1.) God had made him a soldier. His hands had been used to the crook
 and his fingers to the harp, but God <I>taught his hands to war and his 
 fingers to fight,</I> because he designed him for Israel's champion; 
 and what God calls men to he either finds them or makes them fit for. 
 Let the men of war give God the glory of all their military skill; the 
 same that teaches the meanest husbandman his art teaches the greatest 
 general his. It is a pity that any whose fingers God has taught to 
 fight should fight against him or his kingdom among men. Those have 
 special reason to acknowledge God with thankfulness who prove to be 
 qualified for services which they themselves never thought of. 

 (2.) God had made him a sovereign prince, had taught him to wield the
 sceptre as well as the sword, to rule as well as fight, the harder and 
 nobler art of the two: He <I>subdueth my people under me.</I> The 
 providence of God is to be acknowledged in making people subject to 
 their prince, and so preserving the order and benefit of societies. 
 There was a special hand of God inclining the people of Israel to be 
 subject to David, pursuant to the promise God had made him; and it was 
 typical of that great act of divine grace, the bringing of souls into 
 subjection to the Lord Jesus and making them willing in the day of his 
 power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He admires God's condescension to man and to himself in particular 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>):

 "<I>Lord, what is man,</I> what a poor little thing is he, <I>that thou 
 takest knowledge of him, that thou makest account of him,</I> that he 
 falls so much under thy cognizance and care, and that thou hast such a 
 tender regard to any of that mean and worthless race as thou hast had 
 to me!" Considering the many disgraces which the human nature lies 
 under, we have reason to admire the honours God has put upon mankind in 
 general (the saints especially, some in a particular manner, as David) 
 and upon the Messiah (to whom those words are applied, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:6">Heb. ii. 6</A>),

 who was <I>highly exalted because he humbled himself to be found in 
 fashion as a man,</I> and <I>has authority to execute judgment because 
 he is the Son of man.</I> A question to this purport David asked 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:4">Ps. viii. 4</A>),

 and he illustrated the wonder by the consideration of the great dignity
 God has placed man in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:5">Ps. viii. 5</A>),

 <I>Thou hast crowned him with glory and honour.</I> Here he illustrates 
 it by the consideration of the meanness and mortality of man, 
 notwithstanding the dignity put upon him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Man is like to vanity;</I> so frail is he, so weak, so helpless, 
 compassed about with so many infirmities, and his continuance here so 
 very short and uncertain, that he is as like as may be to vanity 
 itself. Nay, he is vanity, he is so at his best estate. <I>His days</I> 
 have little substance in them, considering how many of the thoughts and 
 cares of an immortal soul are employed about a poor dying body; they 
 <I>are as a shadow,</I> dark and flitting, transitory and finishing 
 with the sun, and, when that sets, resolving itself into all shadow. 
 They <I>are as a shadow that passeth away,</I> and there is no loss of 
 it. David puts himself into the number of those that are thus mean and 
 despicable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He begs of God to strengthen him and give him success against the 
 enemies that invaded him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:5-8"><I>v.</I> 5-8</A>.

 He does not specify who they were that he was in fear of, but says,
 <I>Scatter them, destroy them.</I> God knew whom he meant, though he 
 did not name them. But afterwards he describes them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>):

 "They are <I>strange children,</I> Philistines, aliens, bad neighbours 
 to Israel, heathens, whom we are bound to be strange to and not to make 
 any leagues with, and who therefore carry it strangely towards us." 
 Notwithstanding the advantages with which God had blessed David's arms 
 against them, they were still vexatious and treacherous, and men that 
 one could put no confidence in: "One cannot take their word, for their 
 <I>mouth speaketh vanity;</I> nay, if they give their hand upon it, or 
 offer their hand to help you, there is no trusting them; for <I>their 
 right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</I>" Against such as these we 
 cannot defend ourselves, but we may depend on the God of truth and 
 justice, who hates falsehood, to defend us from them. 

 1. David prays that God would appear, that he would do something
 extraordinary, for the conviction of those who preferred their 
 dunghill-deities before the God of Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>Bow thy heavens, O Lord!</I> and make it evident that they are 
 indeed thine, and that thou art the Lord of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:1">Isa. lxvi. 1</A>.

 Let thy providence threaten my enemies, and look black upon them, as 
 the clouds do on the earth when they are thick, and hang very low, big 
 with a storm. Fight against those that fight against us, so that it
 may visibly appear that thou art for us. <I>Touch the mountains,</I> 
 our strong and stately enemies, <I>and</I> let them <I>smoke.</I> Show 
 thyself by the ministry of thy angels, as thou didst upon Mount Sinai." 
 
 2. That he would appear against his enemies, that he would fight from
 heaven against them, as sometimes he had done, by lightnings, which are 
 his arrows (his fiery darts, against which the hardest steel is no 
 armour of proof, so penetrating is the force of lightning), that he 
 himself would shoot these arrows, who, we are sure, never misses his 
 mark, but hits where he aims. 
 
 3. That he would appear for him,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He begs for their destruction, in order to his own deliverance and the
 repose of his people: "<I>Send thy hand,</I> thy power, <I>from 
 above,</I> for that way we look for help; <I>rid me and deliver me out 
 of</I> these <I>great waters</I> that are ready to overflow me." God's 
 time to help his people is when they are sinking and all other helps 
 fail.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery
 <I>and</I> an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
 &nbsp; 10  <I>It is he</I> that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth
 David his servant from the hurtful sword.
 &nbsp; 11  Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children,
 whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand <I>is</I> a right
 hand of falsehood:
 &nbsp; 12  That our sons <I>may be</I> as plants grown up in their youth;
 <I>that</I> our daughters <I>may be</I> as corner stones, polished <I>after</I>
 the similitude of a palace:
 &nbsp; 13  <I>That</I> our garners <I>may be</I> full, affording all manner of
 store: <I>that</I> our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten
 thousands in our streets:
 &nbsp; 14  <I>That</I> our oxen <I>may be</I> strong to labour; <I>that there be</I>
 no breaking in, nor going out; that <I>there be</I> no complaining in
 our streets.
 &nbsp; 15  Happy <I>is that</I> people, that is in such a case: <I>yea,</I> happy
 <I>is that</I> people, whose God <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The method is the same in this latter part of the psalm as in the 
 former; David first gives glory to God and then begs mercy from 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He praises God for the experiences he had had of his goodness to him 
 and the encouragements he had to expect further mercy from him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 In the midst of his complaints concerning the power and treachery of
 his enemies, here is a holy exultation in his God: <I>I will sing a new 
 song to thee, O God!</I> a song of praise for new mercies, for those 
 compassions that are new every morning. Fresh favours call for fresh 
 returns of thanks; nay, we must praise God for the mercies we hope for 
 by his promise as well as those we have received by his providence,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:20,21">2 Chron. xx. 20, 21</A>.

 He will join music with his songs of praise, to express and excite his
 holy joy in God; he will praise God <I>upon a psaltery of ten 
 strings,</I> in the best manner, thinking all little enough to set 
 forth the praises of God. He tells us what this new song shall be 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 <I>It is he that giveth salvation unto kings.</I> This intimates,
 
 1. That great kings cannot save themselves without him. Kings have 
 their life-guards, and have armies at command, and all the means of 
 safety that can be devised; but, after all, it is God that gives them 
 their salvation, and secures them by those means, which he could do, if 
 there were occasion, without them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:16">Ps. xxxiii. 16</A>.

 Kings are the protectors of their people, but it is God that is their 
 protector. How much service do they owe him then with their power who 
 gives them all their salvations! 

 2. That good kings, who are his ministers for the good of their
 subjects, shall be protected and saved by him. He has engaged to give 
 salvation to those kings that are his subjects and rule for him; 
 witness the great things he had done for <I>David his servant,</I> whom 
 he had many a time <I>delivered from the hurtful sword,</I> to which 
 Saul's malice, and his own zeal for the service of his country, had 
 often exposed him. This may refer to Christ the Son of David, and then 
 it is a new song indeed, a New-Testament song. God delivered him from 
 the hurtful sword, upheld him as his servant, and brought him off a 
 conqueror over all the powers of darkness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1,49:8">Isa. xlii. 1; xlix. 8</A>.

 To him he gave salvation, not for himself only, but for us, raising him 
 up to be <I>a horn of salvation.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He prays for the continuance of God's favour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he might be delivered from the public enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Here he repeats his prayer and plea,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 His persecutors were still of the same character, false and perfidious,
 and who would certainly over-reach an honest man and be too hard for 
 him: "Therefore, Lord, do thou <I>deliver me from</I> them, for they 
 are a strange sort of people."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he might see the public peace and prosperity: "Lord, let us 
 have victory, that we may have quietness, which we shall never have 
 while our enemies have it in their power to do us mischief." David, as 
 a king, here expresses the earnest desire he had of the welfare of his 
 people, wherein he was a type of Christ, who provides effectually for 
 the good of his chosen. We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The particular instances of that public prosperity which David 
 desired for his people. 
 
 [1.] A hopeful progeny
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>That our sons</I> and <I>our daughters may be</I> in all respects 
 such as we could wish." He means not those only of his own family, but 
 those of his subjects, that are the seed of the next generation. It 
 adds much to the comfort and happiness of parents in this world to see 
 their children promising and likely to do well. <I>First,</I> It is 
 pleasant to see <I>our sons as plants grown up in their youth,</I> as 
 olive-plants 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:1-6">Ps. cxxviii. 3</A>),

 the <I>planting of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:3">Isa. lxi. 3</A>),--

 to see them as plants, not as weeds, not as thorns,--to see them as 
 plants growing great, not withered and blasted,--to see them of a 
 healthful constitution, a quick capacity, a towardly disposition, and 
 especially of a pious inclination, likely to bring forth fruit unto God 
 in their day,--to see them <I>in their youth,</I> their growing time, 
 increasing in every thing that is good, growing wiser and better, till 
 they grow strong in spirit. <I>Secondly,</I> It is no less desirable to 
 see <I>our daughters as corner-stones,</I> or corner-pillars, 
 <I>polished after the similitude of a palace,</I> or temple. By 
 daughters families are united and connected, to their mutual strength, 
 as the parts of a building are by the corner-stones; and when they are 
 graceful and beautiful both in body and mind they are then polished 
 after the similitude of a nice and curious structure. When we see our 
 daughters well-established and stayed with wisdom and discretion, as 
 corner-stones are fastened in the building,--when we see them by faith 
 united to Christ, as the chief corner-stone, adorned with the graces of 
 God's Spirit, which are the polishing of that which is naturally rough, 
 and <I>become women professing godliness,</I>--when we see them 
 purified and consecrated to God as living temples, we think ourselves 
 happy in them. 

 [2.] Great plenty. Numerous families increase the care, perhaps more
 than the comfort, where there is not sufficient for their maintenance; 
 and therefore he prays for a growing estate with a growing family. 
 <I>First,</I> That their store-houses might be well-replenished with 
 the fruits and products of the earth: <I>That our garners may be 
 full,</I> like those of the good householder, who brings out of them 
 things new and old (those things that are best new he has in that 
 state, those that are best when they are kept he has in that 
 state),--that we may have in them <I>all manner of stores,</I> for 
 ourselves and our friends,--that, living plentifully, we may live not 
 luxuriously, for then we abuse our plenty, but cheerfully and 
 usefully,--that, having abundance, we may be thankful to God, generous 
 to our friends, and charitable to the poor; otherwise, what profit is 
 it to have our garners full?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:3">Jam. v. 3</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> That their flocks might greatly increase: <I>That our
 sheep may bring forth thousands, and ten thousands, in our</I> folds. 
 Much of the wealth of their country consisted in their flocks 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:26">Prov. xxvii. 26</A>),

 and this is the case with ours too, else wool would not be, as it is, a 
 staple commodity. The increase of our cattle is a blessing in which God 
 is to be acknowledged. <I>Thirdly,</I> That their beasts designed for 
 service might be fit for it: <I>That our oxen may be strong to 
 labour</I> in the plough, <I>that they may be fat and fleshy</I> (so 
 some), in good working case. We were none of us made to be idle, and 
 therefore we should pray for bodily health, not that we may be easy and 
 take our pleasures, but that we <I>may be strong to labour,</I> that we 
 may do the work of our place and day, else we are worse than the 
 beasts; for when they are strong it is for labour. 

 [3.] An uninterrupted peace. <I>First,</I> That there be no war, <I>no
 breaking in</I> of invaders, <I>no going out</I> of deserters. "Let not 
 our enemies break in upon us; let us not have occasion to march out 
 against them." War brings with it abundance of mischiefs, whether it be 
 offensive or defensive. <I>Secondly,</I> That there be no oppression
 nor faction--<I>no complaining in our streets,</I> that the people may 
 have no cause to complain either of their government or of one another, 
 nor may be so peevish as to complain without cause. It is desirable 
 thus to dwell in quiet habitations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) His reflection upon this description of the prosperity of the 
 nation, which he so much desired 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+144:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Happy are the people that are in such a case</I> (but it is seldom 
 so, and never long so), <I>yea, happy are the people whose God is the 
 Lord.</I> The relation of a people to God as theirs is here spoken of 
 either, 

 [1.] As that which is the fountain whence all those blessings flow.
 Happy are the Israelites if they faithfully adhere to the Lord as their 
 God, for they may expect to be <I>in such a case.</I> National piety 
 commonly brings national prosperity; for nations as such, in their 
 national capacity, are capable of rewards and punishments only in this 
 life. Or, 

 [2.] As that which is abundantly preferable to all these enjoyments.
 The psalmist began to say, as most do, <I>Happy are the people that are 
 in such a case;</I> those are blessed that prosper in the world. But he 
 immediately corrects himself: <I>Yea, rather, happy are the people 
 whose God is the Lord,</I> who have his favour, and love, and grace, 
 according to the tenour of the covenant, though they have not abundance 
 of this world's goods. As all this, and much more, cannot make us 
 happy, unless the Lord be our God, so, if he be, the want of this, the 
 loss of this, nay, the reverse of this, cannot make us miserable.</P>
