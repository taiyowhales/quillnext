 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This, as the former, is a psalm for families. In that we were taught 
 that the prosperity of our families depends upon the blessing of God; 
 in this we are taught that the only way to obtain that blessing which 
 will make our families comfortable is to live in the fear of God and in 
 obedience to him. Those that do so, in general, shall be blessed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:1,2,4">ver. 1, 2, 4</A>),

 In particular,

 I. They shall be prosperous and successful in their employments,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:2">ver. 2</A>.

 II. Their relations shall be agreeable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:3">ver. 3</A>.

 III. They shall live to see their families brought up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:6">ver. 6</A>.

 IV.  They shall have the satisfaction of seeing the church of God in a
 flourishing condition,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 We must sing this psalm in the firm belief of this truth, That religion
 and piety are the best friends to outward prosperity, giving God the 
 praise that it is so and that we have found it so, and encouraging 
 ourselves and others with it.</P>

 <P>A song of degrees.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Blessed <I>is</I> every one that feareth
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; that walketh in his ways.
 &nbsp; 2  For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy <I>shalt</I>
 thou <I>be,</I> and <I>it shall be</I> well with thee.
 &nbsp; 3  Thy wife <I>shall be</I> as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine
 house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
 &nbsp; 4  Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 5  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the
 good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
 &nbsp; 6  Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, <I>and</I> peace upon
 Israel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is here shown that godliness has the promise of the life that now is 
 and of that which is to come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It is here again and again laid down as an undoubted truth that 
 <I>those who are truly holy are truly happy.</I> Those whose blessed 
 state we are here assured of are such as <I>fear the Lord</I> and 
 <I>walk in his ways,</I> such as have a deep reverence of God upon 
 their spirits and evidence it by a regular and constant conformity to 
 his will. Where the fear of God is a commanding principle in the heart 
 the tenour of the conversation will be accordingly; and in vain do we 
 pretend to be of those that fear God if we do not make conscience both 
 of keeping to his ways and not trifling in them or drawing back. Such 
 are blessed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and shall be blessed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 God blesses them, and his pronouncing them blessed makes them so. They 
 are blessed now, they shall be blessed still, and for ever. This 
 blessedness, arising from this blessing, is here secured, 

 1. To all the saints universally: <I>Blessed is everyone that fears the
 Lord,</I> whoever he be; in every nation he that fears God and works 
 righteousness is accepted of him, and therefore is blessed whether he 
 be high or low, rich or poor, in the world; if religion rule him, it 
 will protect and enrich him. 

 2. To such a saint in particular: <I>Thus shall the man be blessed,</I> 
 not only the nation, the church in its public capacity, but the 
 particular person in his private interests. 

 3.  We are encouraged to apply it to ourselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>Happy shalt thou be;</I> thou mayest take the comfort of the 
 promise, and expect the benefit of it, as if it were directed to thee 
 by name, if thou <I>fear God and walk in his ways.  Happy shalt thou 
 be,</I> that is, <I>It shall be well with thee;</I> whatever befals 
 thee, good shall be brought out of it; it shall be well with thee while 
 thou livest, better when thou diest, and best of all to eternity." It 
 is asserted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+128:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 with a note commanding attention: <I>Behold, thus shall the man be 
 blessed;</I> behold it by faith in the promise; behold it by 
 observation in the performance of the promise; behold it with assurance 
 that it shall be so, for God is faithful, and with admiration that it 
 should be so, for we merit no favour, no blessing, from him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Particular promises are here made to godly people, which they may 
 depend upon, as far as is for God's glory and their good; and that is 
 enough.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That, by the blessing of God, they shall get an honest livelihood 
 and live comfortably upon it. It is not promised that they shall live 
 at ease, without care or pains, but, <I>Thou shalt eat the labour of 
 thy hands.</I> Here is a double promise, 

 (1.) That they shall have something to do (for an idle life is a 
 miserable uncomfortable life) and shall have health, and strength, and 
 capacity of mind to do it, and shall not be forced to be beholden to 
 others for necessary food, and to live, as the disabled poor do, upon 
 the labours of other people. It is as much a mercy as it is a duty 
 <I>with quietness</I> to <I>work and eat our own bread,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:12">
 2 Thess. 3:12</A>.

 (2.) That they shall succeed in their employments, and they and theirs 
 shall enjoy what they get; others shall not come and eat the bread out 
 of their mouths, nor shall it be taken from them either by oppressive 
 rulers or invading enemies.  God will not blast it and blow upon it (as 
 he did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:9">
 Hag. 1:9</A>),

 and his blessing will make a little go a great way.  It is very 
 pleasant to enjoy the fruits of our own industry; as the sleep, so the 
 food, of a labouring man is sweet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they shall have abundance of comfort in their family-relations. 
 As a wife and children are very much a man's care, so, if by the grace 
 of God they are such as they should be, they are very much a man's 
 delight, as much as any creature-comfort.  

 (1.) The <I>wife</I> shall be <I>as a vine by the sides of the 
 house,</I> not only as a spreading vine which serves for an ornament, 
 but as a fruitful vine which is for profit, and with the fruit whereof 
 both God and man are honoured,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:13">Judg. ix. 13</A>.

 The vine is a weak and tender plant, and needs to be supported and 
 cherished, but it is a very valuable plant, and some think (because all 
 the products of it were prohibited to the Nazarites) it was the <I>tree 
 of knowledge</I> itself. The wife's place is the husband's house; there 
 her business lies, and that is her castle.  <I>Where is Sarah thy wife? 
 Behold, in the tent;</I> where should she be else? Her place is <I>by 
 the sides of the house,</I> not under-foot to be trampled on, nor yet 
 upon the house-top to domineer (if she be so, she is but <I>as the 
 grass upon the house-top,</I> in the next psalm), but on the side of 
 the house, being a rib out of the side of the man. She shall be a 
 loving wife, as the vine, which cleaves to the house-side, an obedient 
 wife, as the vine, which is pliable, and grows as it is directed. She 
 shall be fruitful as the vine, not only in children, but in the fruits 
 of wisdom, and righteousness, and good management, the <I>branches</I> 
 of which <I>run over the wall</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:22,Ps+80:11">Gen. xlix. 22; Ps. lxxx. 11</A>),

 <I>like a fruitful vine,</I> not cumbering the ground, nor bringing 
 forth sour grapes, or grapes of Sodom, but good fruit. 

 (2.) The <I>children</I> shall be <I>as olive plants,</I> likely in 
 time to be olive-trees, and, though <I>wild by nature,</I> yet grafted 
 into the good olive, and partaking of its <I>root and fatness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:17">Rom. xi. 17</A>.
 
 It is pleasant to parents who have a table spread, though but with 
 ordinary fare, to see their children round about it, to have many 
 children, enough to surround it, and those with them, and not 
 scattered, or the parents forced from them. Job makes it one of the 
 first instances of his former prosperity that <I>his children were 
 about him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:5">Job xxix. 5</A>.

 Parents love to have their children at table, to keep up the 
 pleasantness of the table-talk, to have them in health, craving food 
 and not physic, to have them like <I>olive-plants,</I> straight and 
 green, sucking in the sap of their good education, and likely in due 
 time to be serviceable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That they shall have those things which God has promised and which 
 they pray for: <I>The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion,</I> where the 
 ark of the covenant was, and where the pious Israelites attended with 
 their devotions. <I>Blessings out of Zion</I> are the best-blessings, 
 which flow, not from common providence, but from special grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:2">Ps. xx. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That they shall live long, to enjoy the comforts of the rising 
 generations: "Thou shalt <I>see thy children's children,</I> as Joseph, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+50:23">Gen. l. 23</A>.

 Thy family shall be built up and continued, and thou shalt have the 
 pleasure of seeing it." <I>Children's children,</I> if they be good 
 children, <I>are the crown of old men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:6">Prov. xvii. 6</A>),

 who are apt to be fond of their grandchildren.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That they shall see the welfare of God's church, and the land of 
 their nativity, which every man who fears God is no less concerned for 
 than for the prosperity of his own family. "Thou shalt be blessed in 
 Zion's blessing, and wilt think thyself so.  Thou shalt <I>see the good
 of Jerusalem</I> as long as thou shalt live, though thou shouldest live 
 long, and shalt not have thy private comforts allayed and embittered by 
 public troubles." A good man can have little comfort in seeing his 
 children's children, unless withal he see peace upon Israel, and have
 hopes of transmitting the entail of religion pure and entire to those 
 that shall come after him, for that is the best inheritance.</P>
