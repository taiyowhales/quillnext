 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is historical; it is a narrative of the great mercies God
 had bestowed upon Israel, the great sins wherewith they had provoked
 him, and the many tokens of his displeasure they had been under for
 their sins. The psalmist began, in the foregoing psalm, to relate God's
 wonders of old, for his own encouragement in a difficult time; there he
 broke off abruptly, but here resumes the subject, for the edification
 of the church, and enlarges much upon it, showing not only how good God
 had been to them, which was an earnest of further finishing mercy, but
 how basely they had conducted themselves towards God, which justified
 him in correcting them as he did at this time, and forbade all
 complaints. Here is,

 I. The preface to this church history, commanding the attention of the
 present age to it and recommending it to the study of the generations
 to come, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. The history itself from Moses to David; it is put into a psalm or
 song that it might be the better remembered and transmitted to
 posterity, and that the singing of it might affect them with the things
 here related, more than they would be with a bare narrative of them.
 The general scope of this psalm we have 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:9-11">ver. 9-11</A>)

 where notice is taken of the present rebukes they were under 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:9">ver. 9</A>),

 the sin which brought them under those rebukes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:10">ver. 10</A>),

 and the mercies of God to them formerly, which aggravated that sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:11">ver. 11</A>.

 As to the particulars, we are here told, 

 1. What wonderful works God had wrought for them in bringing them out
 of Egypt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:12-16">ver. 12-16</A>),

 providing for them in the wilderness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:23-29">ver. 23-29</A>),

 plaguing and ruining their enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:43-55">ver. 43-53</A>),

 and at length putting them in possession of the land of promise, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:54,55">ver. 54, 55</A>.

 2. How ungrateful they were to God for his favours to them and how many
 and great provocations they were guilty of. How they murmured against
 God and distrusted him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:17-20">ver. 17-20</A>),

 and did but counterfeit repentance and submission when he punished them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:34-37">ver. 34-37</A>),

 thus grieving and tempting him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:40-42">ver. 40-42</A>.

 How they affronted God with their idolatries after they came to Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:56-58">ver. 56-58</A>.

 3. How God had justly punished them for their sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:21,22">ver. 21, 22</A>)

 in the wilderness, making their sin their punishment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:29-33">ver. 29-33</A>),

 and now, of late, when the ark was taken by the Philistines, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:59-64">ver. 59-64</A>.

 4. How graciously God had spared them and returned in mercy to them,
 notwithstanding their provocations. He had forgiven them formerly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:38,39">ver. 38, 39</A>),

 and now, of late, had removed the judgments they had brought upon
 themselves, and brought them under a happy establishment both in church 
 and state, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:65-72">ver. 65-72</A>.

 As the general scope of this psalm may be of use to us in the singing
 of it, to put us upon recollecting what God has done for us and for his 
 church formerly, and what we have done against him, so the particulars 
 also may be of use to us, for warning against those sins of unbelief 
 and ingratitude which Israel of old was notoriously guilty of, and the 
 record of which was preserved for our learning. "These things happened 
 unto them for ensamples,"

 <P> Maschil of Asaph.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Give ear, O my people, <I>to</I> my law:
 incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
 &nbsp; 2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings
 of old:
 &nbsp; 3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
 &nbsp; 4 We will not hide <I>them</I> from their children, showing to the
 generation to come the praises of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and his strength, and
 his wonderful works that he hath done.
 &nbsp; 5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law
 in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make
 them known to their children:
 &nbsp; 6 That the generation to come might know <I>them, even</I> the
 children <I>which</I> should be born; <I>who</I> should arise and declare
 <I>them</I> to their children:
 &nbsp; 7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the
 works of God, but keep his commandments:
 &nbsp; 8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
 generation; a generation <I>that</I> set not their heart aright, and
 whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses, which contain the preface to this history, show that the 
 psalm answers the title; it is indeed <I>Maschil--a psalm to give
 instruction;</I> if we receive not the instruction it gives, it is our 
 own fault. Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The psalmist demands attention to what he wrote 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Give ear, O my people! to my law.</I> Some make these the psalmist's 
 words. David, as a king, or Asaph, in his name, as his secretary of
 state, or scribe to the sweet singer of Israel, here calls upon the 
 people, as his people committed to his charge, to give ear to his law. 
 He calls his instructions his <I>law</I> or <I>edict;</I> such was 
 their commanding force in themselves. Every good truth, received in the 
 light and love of it, will have the power of a law upon the conscience; 
 yet that was not all: David was a king, and he would interpose his 
 royal power for the edification of his people. If God, by his grace, 
 make great men good men, they will be capable of doing more good than 
 others, because their word will be a law to all about them, who must 
 therefore give ear and hearken; for to what purpose is divine 
 revelation brought our ears if we will not incline our ears to it, both 
 humble ourselves and engage ourselves to hear it and heed it? Or the 
 psalmist, being a prophet, speaks as God's mouth, and so calls them 
 <I>his people,</I> and demands subjection to what was said as to a law.
 Let him that has an ear thus <I>hear what the Spirit saith unto the 
 churches,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:7">Rev. ii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Several reasons are given why we should diligently attend to that 
 which is here related. 

 1. The things here discoursed of are weighty, and deserve 
 consideration, strange, and need it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I will open my mouth in a parable,</I> in that which is sublime and 
 uncommon, but very excellent and well worthy your attention; <I>I will 
 utter dark sayings,</I> which challenge your most serious regards as 
 much as the enigmas with which the eastern princes and learned men used 
 to try one another. These are called <I>dark sayings,</I> not because 
 they are hard to be understood, but because they are greatly to be 
 admired and carefully to be looked into. This is said to be fulfilled 
 in the parables which our Saviour put forth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:35">Matt. xiii. 35</A>),

 which were (as this) representations of the state of the kingdom of God
 among men. 

 2. They are the monuments of antiquity--<I>dark sayings of old which
 our fathers have told us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They are things of undoubted certainty; we have heard them and known
 them, and there is no room left to question the truth of them. The 
 gospel of Luke is called a <I>declaration of those things which are 
 most surely believed among us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:1">Luke i. 1</A>),

 so were the things here related. The honour we owe to our parents and
 ancestors obliges us to attend to that which our fathers have told us, 
 and, as far as it appears to be true and good, to receive it with so 
 much the more reverence and regard. 

 3. They are to be transmitted to posterity, and it lies as a charge 
 upon us carefully to hand them down

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 because our fathers told them to us <I>we will not hide them from their 
 children.</I> Our children are called <I>theirs,</I> for they were in 
 care for their seed's seed, and looked upon them as theirs; and, in 
 teaching our children the knowledge of God, we repay to our parents 
 some of that debt we owe to them for teaching us. Nay, if we have no 
 children of our own, we must declare the things of God to <I>their</I> 
 children, the children of others. Our care must be for posterity in 
 general, and not only for our own posterity; and for the generation to 
 come hereafter, the children that shall be born, as well as for the 
 generation that is next rising up and the children that are born. That 
 which we are to transmit to our children is not only the knowledge of 
 languages, arts and sciences, liberty and property, but especially the 
 praises of the Lord, and his strength appearing in the wonderful works 
 he has done. Our great care must be to lodge our religion, that great 
 deposit, pure and entire in the hands of those that succeed us. There 
 are two things the full and clear knowledge of which we must preserve 
 the entail of to our heirs:--

 (1.) The law of God; for this was given with a particular charge to 
 teach it diligently to their children

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>He established a testimony</I> or covenant, and enacted a law, in 
 Jacob and Israel, gave them precepts and promises, which he 
 <I>commanded them to make known to their children,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:7,20">Deut. vi. 7, 20</A>.

 The church of God, as the historian says of the Roman commonwealth, was
 not to be <I>res unius &aelig;tatis--a thing of one age</I> but was to 
 be kept up from one generation to another; and therefore, as God 
 provided for a succession of ministers in the tribe of Levi and the 
 house of Aaron, so he appointed that parents should train up their 
 children in the knowledge of his law: and, when they had grown up, they 
 must arise <I>and declare them to their children</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 that, as one generation of God's servants and worshippers passes away, 
 another generation may come, and the church, as the earth, may abide 
 for ever; and thus God's name among men may be as the days of heaven. 
 
 (2.) The providences of God concerning them, both in mercy and in 
 judgment. The former seem to be mentioned for the sake of this; since 
 God gave order that his laws should be made known to posterity, it is 
 requisite that with them his works also should be made known, the 
 fulfilling of the promises made to the obedient and the threatenings 
 denounced against the disobedient. Let these be told to our children 
 and our children's children, 

 [1.] That they may take encouragement to conform to the will of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>that, not forgetting the works of God</I> wrought in former days, 
 <I>they</I> might <I>set their hope in God and keep his 
 commandments,</I> might make his command their rule and his covenant 
 their stay. Those only may with confidence hope for God's salvation 
 that make conscience of doing his commandments. The works of God, duly 
 considered, will very much strengthen our resolution both to set our 
 hope in him and to keep his commandments, for he is able to bear us out 
 in both. 

 [2.] That they may take warning not to conform to the example of their 
 fathers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>That they might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious 
 generation.</I> See here, <I>First,</I> What was the character of their 
 fathers. Though they were the seed of Abraham, taken into covenant with 
 God, and, for aught we know, the only professing people he had then in 
 the world, yet they were stubborn and rebellious, and walked contrary 
 to God, in direct opposition to his will. They did indeed profess 
 relation to him, but they did not set their hearts aright; they were 
 not cordial in their engagements to God, nor inward with him in their 
 worship of him, and therefore their <I>spirit was not stedfast with 
 him,</I> but upon every occasion they flew off from him. Note, 
 Hypocrisy is the high road to apostasy. Those that do not set their 
 hearts aright will not be stedfast with God, but play fat and loose. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> What was a charge to the children: <I>That they be not 
 as their fathers.</I> Note, Those that have descended from wicked and 
 ungodly ancestors, if they will but consider the word and works of God, 
 will see reason enough not to tread in their steps. It will be no 
 excuse for a vain conversation that it was received by tradition from 
 our fathers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:18">1 Pet. i. 18</A>);

 for what we know of them that was evil must be an admonition to us,
 that we dread that which was so pernicious to them as we would shun 
 those courses which they took that were ruinous to their health or 
 estates.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9 The children of Ephraim, <I>being</I> armed, <I>and</I> carrying bows,
 turned back in the day of battle.
 &nbsp; 10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in
 his law;
 &nbsp; 11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had showed
 them.
 &nbsp; 12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in
 the land of Egypt, <I>in</I> the field of Zoan.
 &nbsp; 13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he
 made the waters to stand as a heap.
 &nbsp; 14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the
 night with a light of fire.
 &nbsp; 15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave <I>them</I> drink
 as <I>out of</I> the great depths.
 &nbsp; 16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters
 to run down like rivers.
 &nbsp; 17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most
 High in the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
 lust.
 &nbsp; 19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a
 table in the wilderness?
 &nbsp; 20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and
 the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide
 flesh for his people?
 &nbsp; 21 Therefore the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> heard <I>this,</I> 
 and was wroth: so a fire
 was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
 &nbsp; 22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
 salvation:
 &nbsp; 23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened
 the doors of heaven,
 &nbsp; 24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given
 them of the corn of heaven.
 &nbsp; 25 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
 &nbsp; 26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his
 power he brought in the south wind.
 &nbsp; 27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls
 like as the sand of the sea:
 &nbsp; 28 And he let <I>it</I> fall in the midst of their camp, round about
 their habitations.
 &nbsp; 29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them
 their own desire;
 &nbsp; 30 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their
 meat <I>was</I> yet in their mouths,
 &nbsp; 31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of
 them, and smote down the chosen <I>men</I> of Israel.
 &nbsp; 32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his
 wondrous works.
 &nbsp; 33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their
 years in trouble.
 &nbsp; 34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned
 and enquired early after God.
 &nbsp; 35 And they remembered that God <I>was</I> their rock, and the high
 God their redeemer.
 &nbsp; 36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they
 lied unto him with their tongues.
 &nbsp; 37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
 stedfast in his covenant.
 &nbsp; 38 But he, <I>being</I> full of compassion, forgave <I>their</I>
 iniquity, and destroyed <I>them</I> not: yea, many a time turned he
 his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
 &nbsp; 39 For he remembered that they <I>were but</I> flesh; a wind that
 passeth away, and cometh not again.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The psalmist observes the late rebukes of Providence that the people 
 of Israel had been under, which they had brought upon themselves by 
 their dealing treacherously with God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.

 <I>The children of Ephraim,</I> in which tribe Shiloh was, though they
 were well armed and shot with bows, yet <I>turned back in the day of 
 battle.</I> This seems to refer to that shameful defeat which the 
 Philistines gave them in Eli's time, when they took the ark prisoner,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:10,11">1 Sam. iv. 10, 11</A>.

 Of this the psalmist here begins to speak, and, after a long
 digression, returns to it again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:61"><I>v.</I> 61</A>.

 Well might that event be thus fresh in mind in David's time, above
 forty years after, for the ark, which in that memorable battle was 
 seized by the Philistines, though it was quickly brought out of 
 captivity, was never brought out of obscurity till David fetched it 
 from Kirjath-jearim to his own city. Observe,

 1. The shameful cowardice of the children of Ephraim, that warlike 
 tribe, so famed for valiant men, Joshua's tribe; the children of that 
 tribe, though as well armed as ever, turned back when they came to face 
 the enemy. Note, Weapons of war stand men in little stead without a 
 martial spirit, and that is gone if God be gone. Sin dispirits men and 
 takes away the heart. 

 2. The causes of their cowardice, which were no less shameful; and
 these were,

 (1.) A shameful violation of God's law and their covenant with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 they were basely treacherous and perfidious, for <I>they kept not the 
 covenant of God,</I> and basely stubborn and rebellious (as they were 
 described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 for they peremptorily refused to walk in his law, and, in effect, told
 him to his face they would not be ruled by him.

 (2.) A shameful ingratitude to God for the favours he had bestowed upon 
 them: They <I>forgot his works and his wonders,</I> his works of wonder 
 which they ought to have admired,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Note, Our forgetfulness of God's works is at the bottom of our
 disobedience to his laws.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He takes occasion hence to consult precedents and to compare this 
 with the case of their fathers, who were in like manner unmindful of 
 God's mercies to them and ungrateful to their founder and great 
 benefactor, and were therefore often brought under his displeasure. The 
 narrative in these verses is very remarkable, for it relates a kind of
 struggle between God's goodness and man's badness, and mercy, at 
 length, rejoices against judgment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God did great things for his people Israel when he first 
 incorporated them and formed them into a people: <I>Marvellous things 
 did he in the sight of their fathers,</I> and not only in their sight, 
 but in their cause, and for their benefit, so strange, so kind, that 
 one would think they should never be forgotten. What he did for them in 
 the land of Egypt is only just mentioned here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 but afterwards resumed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 He proceeds here to show, 

 (1.) How he made a lane for them through the Red Sea, and caused them,
 gave them courage, to pass through, though the waters stood over their 
 heads as a heap,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:12,13">Isa. lxiii. 12, 13</A>,

 where God is said to <I>lead them by the hand,</I> as it were,
 <I>through the deep that they should not stumble.</I> 

 (2.) How he provided a guide for them through the untrodden paths of 
 the wilderness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 he led them step by step, <I>in the day time by a cloud,</I> which also 
 sheltered them from the heat, and <I>all the night with a light of 
 fire,</I> which perhaps warmed the air; at least it made the darkness 
 of night less frightful, and perhaps kept off wild beasts,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+2:5">Zech. ii. 5</A>.

 (3.) How he furnished their camp with fresh water in a dry and thirsty
 land where no water was, not by opening the bottles of heaven (that 
 would have been a common way), but by broaching a rock 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>):
 
 <I>He clave the rocks in the wilderness,</I> which yielded water,
 though they were not capable of receiving it either from the clouds 
 above or the springs beneath. Out of the dry and hard rock he gave them 
 drink, not distilled as out of an alembic, drop by drop, but in streams 
 <I>running down like rivers,</I> and as out of the great depths. God 
 gives abundantly, and is rich in mercy; he gives seasonably, and 
 sometimes makes us to feel the want of mercies that we may the better 
 know the worth of them. This water which God gave Israel out of the 
 rock was the more valuable because it was spiritual drink. <I>And that
 rock was Christ.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. When God began thus to bless them they began to affront him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):
 
 <I>They sinned yet more against him,</I> more than they had done in 
 Egypt, though there they were bad enough, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+20:8">Ezek. xx. 8</A>.

 They bore the miseries of their servitude better than the difficulties
 of their deliverance, and never murmured at their taskmasters so much 
 as they did at Moses and Aaron; as if they were <I>delivered to do all 
 these abominations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:10">Jer. vii. 10</A>.

 As sin sometimes takes occasion by the commandment, so at other times
 it takes occasion by the deliverance, to become more exceedingly 
 sinful. <I>They provoked the Most High.</I> Though he is most high, and 
 they knew themselves an unequal match for him, yet they provoked him 
 and even bade defiance to his justice; and this in the wilderness, 
 where he had them at his mercy and therefore they were bound in 
 interest to please him, and where he showed them so much mercy and 
 therefore they were bound in gratitude to please him; yet there they 
 said and did that which they knew would provoke him: <I>They tempted 
 God in their heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Their sin began in their heart, and thence it took its malignity.
 <I>They do always err in their heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+3:10">Heb. iii. 10</A>.

 Thus they tempted God, tried his patience to the utmost, whether he
 would bear with them or no, and, in effect, bade him do his worst. Two 
 ways they provoked him:--

 (1.) By desiring, or rather demanding, that which he had not thought 
 fit to give them: <I>They asked meat for their lust.</I> God had given 
 them meat for their hunger, in the manna, wholesome pleasant food and 
 in abundance; he had given them meat for their faith out of the heads 
 of leviathan which <I>he broke in pieces,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:14">Ps. lxxiv. 14</A>.

 But all this would not serve; they must have meat for their lust,
 dainties and varieties to gratify a luxurious appetite. Nothing is more 
 provoking to God than our quarrelling with our allotment and indulging 
 the desires of the flesh.

 (2.) By distrusting his power to give them what they desired. This was 
 tempting God indeed. They challenged him to give them flesh; and, if he 
 did not, they would say it was because he could not, not because he did 
 not see it fit for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>They spoke against God.</I> Those that set bounds to God's power 
 speak against him. It was as injurious a reflection as could be cast
 upon God to say, <I>Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</I> They 
 had manna, but they did not think they had a table furnished unless they
 had boiled and roast, a first, a second, and a third course, as they 
 had in Egypt, where they had both flesh and fish, and sauce too

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:3,Nu+11:5">Exod. xvi. 3, Num. xi. 5</A>),

 dishes of meat and salvers of fruit. What an unreasonable insatiable
 thin is luxury! Such a mighty thing did these epicures think a table
 well furnished to be that they thought it was more than God himself
 could give them in that wilderness; whereas the <I>beasts of the
 forest,</I> and all the <I>fowls of the mountains,</I> are his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:10,11">Ps. l. 10, 11</A>.

 Their disbelief of God's power was so much the worse in that they did
 at the same time own that he had done as much as that came to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):
 
 <I>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out,</I> which 
 they and their cattle drank of. And which is easier, to furnish a table 
 in the wilderness, which a rich man can do, or to fetch water out of a 
 rock, which the greatest potentate on the earth cannot do? Never did 
 unbelief, though always unreasonable, ask so absurd a question: "Can he 
 that melted down a rock into streams of water give bread also? Or can
 he that has given bread provide flesh also?" Is any thing too hard for 
 Omnipotence? When once the ordinary powers of nature are exceeded God 
 has made bare his arm, and we must conclude that nothing is impossible 
 with him. Be it ever so great a thing that we ask, it becomes us to 
 own, <I>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. God justly resented the provocation and was much displeased with 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>The Lord heard this, and was wroth.</I> Note, God is a witness to 
 all our murmurings and distrusts; he hears them and is much displeased 
 with them. <I>A fire was kindled</I> for this <I>against Jacob;</I> the 
 <I>fire of the Lord burnt among them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:1">Num. xi. 1</A>.

 Or it may be understood of the fire of God's anger which came up
 against Israel. To unbelievers our God is himself a consuming fire. 
 Those that will not believe the power of God's mercy shall feel the 
 power of his indignation, and be made to confess that <I>it is a 
 fearful thing to fall into his hands.</I> Now here we are told,

 (1.) Why God thus resented the provocation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Because</I> by this it appeared that <I>they believed not in 
 God;</I> they did not give credit to the revelation he had made of 
 himself to them, for they durst not commit themselves to him, nor 
 venture themselves with him: <I>They trusted not in the salvation</I> 
 he had begun to work for them; for then they would not thus have 
 questioned its progress. Those cannot be said to trust in God's 
 salvation as their felicity at last who cannot find in their hearts to 
 trust in his providence for food convenient in the way to it. That
 which aggravated their unbelief was the experience they had had of the 
 power and goodness of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:23-25"><I>v.</I> 23-25</A>.

 He had given them undeniable proofs of his power, not only on earth
 beneath, but in heaven above; for <I>he commanded the clouds from
 above,</I> as one that had created them and commanded them into being;
 he made what use he pleased of them. Usually by their showers they
 contribute to the earth's producing corn; but now, when God so
 commanded them, they showered down corn themselves, which is therefore
 called here <I>the corn of heaven;</I> for heaven can do the work
 without the earth, but not the earth without heaven. God, who has the
 key of the clouds, <I>opened the doors of heaven,</I> and that is more
 than <I>opening the windows,</I> which yet is spoken of as a great
 blessing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:10">Mal. iii. 10</A>.

 To all that by faith and prayer ask, seek, and knock, these doors shall
 at any time be opened; for the God of heaven is rich in mercy to all 
 that call upon him. He not only keeps a good house, but keeps open 
 house. Justly might God take it ill that they should distrust him when
 he had been so very kind to them that he <I>had rained down manna upon 
 them to eat,</I> substantial food, daily, duly, enough for all, enough 
 for each. <I>Man did eat angels' food,</I> such as angels, if they had 
 occasion for food, would eat and be thankful for; or rather such as was 
 given by the ministry of angels, and (as the <I>Chaldee</I> reads it) 
 such as descended from the dwelling of angels. Every one, even the 
 least child in Israel, did <I>eat the bread of the mighty</I> (so the 
 margin reads it); the weakest stomach could digest it, and yet it was 
 so nourishing that it was strong meat for strong men. And, though the 
 provision was so good, yet they were not stinted, nor ever reduced to 
 short allowance; for <I>he sent them meat to the full.</I> If they 
 gathered little, it was their own fault; and yet even then they had no 
 lack,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+16:18">Exod. xvi. 18</A>.

 The daily provision God makes for us, and has made ever since we came
 into the world, though it has not so much of miracle as this, has no 
 less of mercy, and is therefore a great aggravation of our distrust of 
 God. 

 (2.) How he expressed his resentment of the provocation, not in denying 
 them what they so inordinately lusted after, but in granting it to 
 them.

 [1.] Did they question his power? He soon gave them a sensible 
 conviction that he could <I>furnish a table in the wilderness.</I> 
 Though the winds seem to blow where they list, yet, when he pleased, he 
 could make them his caterers to fetch in provisions,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 <I>He caused an east wind to blow and a south wind,</I> either a
 south-east wind, or an east wind first to bring in the quails from that 
 quarter and then a south wind to bring in more from that quarter; so 
 that <I>he rained flesh upon them,</I> and that of the most delicate 
 sort, not butchers' meat, but wild-fowl, and abundance of it, <I>as 
 dust, as the sand of the sea</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 so that the meanest Israelite might have sufficient; and it cost them 
 nothing, no, not the pains of fetching it from the mountains, for <I>he 
 let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their 
 habitation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 We have the account 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:31,32">Num. xi. 31, 32</A>.

 See how good God is even to the evil and unthankful, and wonder that
 his goodness does not overcome their badness. See what little reason we 
 have to judge of God's love by such gifts of his bounty as these; 
 dainty bits are no tokens of his peculiar favour. Christ gave dry bread 
 to the disciples that he loved, but a sop dipped in the sauce to Judas 
 that betrayed him.

 [2.] Did they defy his justice and boast that they had gained their 
 point? He made them pay dearly for their quails; for, though he <I>gave 
 them their own desire, they were not estranged from their lust</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:29,30"><I>v.</I> 29, 30</A>);

 their appetite was insatiable; they were well filled and yet they were 
 not satisfied; for they knew not what they would have. Such is the 
 nature of lust; it is content with nothing, and the more it is humoured 
 the more humoursome it grows. Those that indulge their lust will never
 be estranged from it. Or it intimates that God's liberality did not 
 make them ashamed of their ungrateful lustings, as it would have done 
 if they had had any sense of honour. But what came of it? <I>While the 
 meat was yet in their mouth,</I> rolled under the tongue as a sweet 
 morsel, <I>the wrath of God came upon them and slew the fattest of 
 them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),
 
 those that were most luxurious and most daring. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:33,34">Num. xi. 33, 34</A>.

 They were fed <I>as sheep for the slaughter:</I> the butcher takes the
 fattest first. We may suppose there were some pious and contented
 Israelites, that did eat moderately of the quails and were never the 
 worse; for it was not the meat that poisoned them, but their own lust. 
 Let epicures and sensualists here read their doom. The end of those who 
 make a <I>god of their belly is destruction,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:19">Phil. iii. 19</A>.

 <I>The prosperity of fools shall destroy them,</I> and their ruin will
 be the greater.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The judgments of God upon them did not reform them, nor attain the 
 end, any more than his mercies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):

 <I>For all this, they sinned still;</I> they murmured and quarrelled 
 with God and Moses as much as ever. Though God <I>was wroth and smote 
 them, yet they went on frowardly in the way of their heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:17">Isa. lvii. 17</A>);

 <I>they believed not for his wondrous works.</I> Though his works of
 justice were as wondrous and as great proofs of his power as his works 
 of mercy, yet they were not wrought upon by them to fear God, nor 
 convinced how much it was their interest to make him their friend. 
 Those hearts are hard indeed that will neither be melted by the mercies 
 of God nor broken by his judgments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They persisting in their sins, God proceeded in his judgments, but 
 they were judgments of another nature, which wrought not suddenly, but 
 slowly. He punished them not now with such acute diseases as that was 
 which <I>slew the fattest of them,</I> but a lingering chronical 
 distemper 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 <I>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity</I> in the wilderness 
 <I>and their years in trouble.</I> By an irreversible doom they were 
 condemned to wear out thirty-eight tedious years in the wilderness, 
 which indeed were consumed in vanity; for in all those years there was 
 not a step taken nearer Canaan, but they were turned back again, and 
 wandered to and fro as in a labyrinth, not one stroke struck towards 
 the conquest of it: and not only in vanity, but in trouble, for their 
 carcases were condemned to fall in the wilderness and there they all 
 perished but Caleb and Joshua. Note, Those that sin still must expect 
 to be in trouble still. And the reason why we spend our days in so much 
 vanity and trouble, why we live with so little comfort and to so little 
 purpose, is because we do not live by faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. Under these rebukes they professed repentance, but they were not 
 cordial and sincere in this profession. 

 (1.) Their profession was plausible enough

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>):

 <I>When he slew them,</I> or condemned them to be slain, <I>then they 
 sought him;</I> they confessed their fault, and begged his pardon. When 
 some were slain others in a fright cried to God for mercy, and promised 
 they would reform and be very good; then <I>they returned to God, and 
 enquired early after him.</I> So one would have taken them to be such 
 as desired to find him. And they pretended to do this because, however 
 they had forgotten it formerly, now <I>they remembered that God was 
 their rock</I> and therefore now that they needed him they would fly to 
 him and take shelter in him, <I>and</I> that <I>the high God</I> was 
 <I>their Redeemer,</I> who brought them out of Egypt and to whom 
 therefore they might come with boldness. Afflictions are sent to put us 
 in mind of God as our rock and our redeemer; for, in prosperity, we are 
 apt to forget him. 
 
 (2.) They were not sincere in this profession 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:36,37"><I>v.</I> 36, 37</A>):

 <I>They did but flatter him with their mouth,</I> as if they thought by 
 fair speeches to prevail with him to revoke the sentence and remove the 
 judgment, with a secret intention to break their word when the danger 
 was over; they did not <I>return to God with their whole heart, but 
 feignedly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:10">Jer. iii. 10</A>.

 All their professions, prayers, and promises, were extorted by the
 rack. It was plain that they did not mean as they said, for they did 
 not adhere to it. They thawed in the sun, but froze in the shade. They 
 did but <I>lie to God with their tongues, for their heart was not with 
 him,</I> was not right with him, as appeared by the issue, for <I>they 
 were not stedfast in his covenant.</I> They were not sincere in their 
 reformation, for they were not constant; and, by thinking thus to 
 impose upon a heart-searching God, they really put as great an affront 
 upon him as by any of their reflections.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. God hereupon, in pity to them, put a stop to the judgments which 
 were threatened and in part executed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:38,39"><I>v.</I> 38, 39</A>):

 <I>But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity.</I> One 
 would think this counterfeit repentance should have filled up the 
 measure of their iniquity. What could be more provoking than to <I>lie 
 thus to the holy God,</I> than thus to <I>keep back part of the 
 price,</I> the chief part? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:3">Acts v. 3</A>.

 And <I>yet he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity</I>
 thus far, that he did not destroy them and cut them off from being a 
 people, as he justly might have done, but spared their lives till they 
 had reared another generation which should enter into the promised 
 land. <I>Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:8">Isa. lxv. 8</A>.

 <I>Many a time he turned his anger away</I> (for he is Lord of his
 anger) <I>and did not stir up all his wrath,</I> to deal with them as 
 they deserved: and why did he not? Not because their ruin would have 
 been any loss to him, but, 

 (1.) Because he was <I>full of compassion</I> and, when he was going to 
 destroy them, <I>his repentings were kindled together,</I> and he said, 
 <I>How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee, 
 Israel?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:8">Hos. xi. 8</A>.

 (2.) Because, though they did not rightly remember that he was their
 rock, he <I>remembered that they were but flesh.</I> He considered the 
 corruption of their nature, which inclined them to evil, and was 
 pleased to make that an excuse for his sparing them, though it was 
 really no excuse for their sin. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:3">Gen. vi. 3</A>.

 He considered the weakness and frailty of their nature, and what an
 easy thing it would be to crush them: <I>They are as a wind that 
 passeth away and cometh not again.</I> They may soon be taken off, but, 
 when they are gone, they are gone irrecoverably, and then what will 
 become of the covenant with Abraham? They are flesh, they are wind; 
 whence it were easy to argue they may justly, they may immediately, be 
 cut off, and there would be no loss of them: but God argues, on the 
 contrary, therefore he will not destroy them; for the true reason is, 
 <I>He is full of compassion.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, <I>and</I> grieve
 him in the desert!
 &nbsp; 41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy
 One of Israel.
 &nbsp; 42 They remembered not his hand, <I>nor</I> the day when he
 delivered them from the enemy.
 &nbsp; 43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in
 the field of Zoan:
 &nbsp; 44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods,
 that they could not drink.
 &nbsp; 45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured
 them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
 &nbsp; 46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, and their
 labour unto the locust.
 &nbsp; 47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees
 with frost.
 &nbsp; 48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks
 to hot thunderbolts.
 &nbsp; 49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
 indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels <I>among them.</I>
 &nbsp; 50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from
 death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
 &nbsp; 51 And smote all the first-born in Egypt; the chief of <I>their</I>
 strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
 &nbsp; 52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided
 them in the wilderness like a flock.
 &nbsp; 53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the
 sea overwhelmed their enemies.
 &nbsp; 54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, <I>even
 to</I> this mountain, <I>which</I> his right hand had purchased.
 &nbsp; 55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them
 an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in
 their tents.
 &nbsp; 56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept
 not his testimonies:
 &nbsp; 57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers:
 they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
 &nbsp; 58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and
 moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
 &nbsp; 59 When God heard <I>this,</I> he was wroth, and greatly abhorred
 Israel:
 &nbsp; 60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent
 <I>which</I> he placed among men;
 &nbsp; 61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory
 into the enemy's hand.
 &nbsp; 62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth
 with his inheritance.
 &nbsp; 63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were
 not given to marriage.
 &nbsp; 64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
 lamentation.
 &nbsp; 65 Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, <I>and</I> like a
 mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
 &nbsp; 66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to
 a perpetual reproach.
 &nbsp; 67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not
 the tribe of Ephraim:
 &nbsp; 68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
 &nbsp; 69 And he built his sanctuary like high <I>palaces,</I> like the
 earth which he hath established for ever.
 &nbsp; 70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
 sheepfolds:
 &nbsp; 71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to
 feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
 &nbsp; 72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and
 guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

 The matter and scope of this paragraph are the same with the former, 
 showing what great mercies God had bestowed upon Israel, how provoking 
 they had been, what judgments he had brought upon them for their sins, 
 and yet how, in judgment, he remembered mercy at last. Let not those 
 that receive mercy from God be thereby emboldened to sin, for the 
 mercies they receive will aggravate their sin and hasten the punishment 
 of it; yet let not those that are under divine rebukes for sin be 
 discouraged from repentance, for their punishments are means of 
 repentance, and shall not prevent the mercy God has yet in store for 
 them. Observe,</P>

 I. The sins of Israel in the wilderness again reflected on, because 
 written for our admonition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:40,41"><I>v.</I> 40, 41</A>):

 <I>How often did they provoke him in the wilderness!</I> Note once, nor 
 twice, but many a time; and the repetition of the provocation was a 
 great aggravation of it, as well as the place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 God kept an account how often they provoked him, though they did not.
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:22">Num. xiv. 22</A>,

 <I>They have tempted me these ten times.</I> By provoking him they did
 not so much anger him as grieve him, for he looked upon them as his 
 children (<I>Israel is my son, my first-born</I>), and the undutiful 
 disrespectful behaviour of children does more grieve than anger the 
 tender parents; they lay it to heart, and take it unkindly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:2">Isa. i. 2</A>.

 They grieved him because they put him under a necessity of afflicting
 them, which he did not willingly. After they had humbled themselves 
 before him they <I>turned back and tempted God,</I> as before, and 
 <I>limited the Holy One of Israel,</I> prescribing to him what proofs 
 he should give of his power and presence with them and what methods he 
 should take in leading them and providing for them. They limited him to 
 their way and their time, as if he did not observe that they quarrelled 
 with him. It is presumption for us to limit <I>the Holy One of 
 Israel;</I> for, being <I>the Holy One,</I> he will do what is most for 
 his own glory; and, being <I>the Holy One of Israel,</I> he will do 
 what is most for their good; and we both impeach his wisdom and betray 
 our own pride and folly if we go about to prescribe to him. That which 
 occasioned their limiting God for the future was their forgetting his 
 former favours 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>):

 <I>They remembered not his hand,</I> how strong it is and how it had 
 been stretched out for them, nor <I>the day when he delivered them from 
 the enemy,</I> Pharaoh, that great enemy who sought their ruin. There 
 are some days made remarkable by signal deliverances, which ought never 
 to be forgotten; for the remembrance of them would encourage us in our 
 greatest straits.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The mercies of God to Israel, which they were unmindful of when 
 they tempted God and limited him; and this catalogue of the works of 
 wonder which God wrought for them begins higher, and is carried down 
 further, than that before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>,
 
 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This begins with their deliverance out of Egypt, and the plagues 
 with which God compelled the Egyptians to let them go: these were the 
 <I>signs</I> God <I>wrought in Egypt</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>),

 the <I>wonders</I> he wrought <I>in the field of Zoan,</I> that is, in 
 the country of Zoan, as we say, <I>in Agro N.,</I> meaning in such a 
 country.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Several of the plagues of Egypt are here specified, which speak 
 aloud the power of God and his favour to Israel, as well as terror to 
 his and their enemies. As, 

 [1.] The turning of the waters into blood; they had made themselves 
 drunk with the bloods of God's people, even the infants, and now God 
 gave them blood to drink, <I>for they were worthy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:44"><I>v.</I> 44</A>.

 [2.] The flies and frogs which infested them, mixtures of insects in
 swarms, in shoals, <I>which devoured them, which destroyed them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:45"><I>v.</I> 45</A>.

 For God can make the weakest and most despicable animals instruments of
 his wrath when he pleases; what they want in strength may be made up in 
 number. 

 [3.] The plague of locusts, which devoured their increase, and that 
 which they had laboured for,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:46"><I>v.</I> 46</A>.

 They are called <I>God's great army,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:25">Joel ii. 25</A>.

 [4.] The <I>hail,</I> which <I>destroyed</I> their trees, especially
 <I>their vines,</I> the weakest of trees

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>),

 and <I>their cattle,</I> especially <I>their flocks</I> of sheep, the 
 weakest of their cattle, which were killed with <I>hot 
 thunder-bolts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>),

 and the <I>frost,</I> or congealed rain (as the word signifies), was so 
 violent that it destroyed even the <I>sycamore-trees.</I> 

 [5.] The death of the first-born was the last and sorest of the plagues 
 of Egypt, and that which perfected the deliverance of Israel; it was 
 first in intention

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+4:23">Exod. iv. 23</A>),

 but last in execution; for, if gentler methods would have done the
 work, this would have been prevented: but it is here largely described,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:49-51"><I>v.</I> 49-51</A>.

 <I>First,</I> The anger of God was the cause of it. Wrath had now come
 upon the Egyptians to the uttermost; Pharaoh's heart having been often 
 hardened after less judgments had softened it, God now <I>stirred up 
 all his wrath;</I> for he <I>cast upon them the fierceness of his 
 anger,</I> anger in the highest degree, <I>wrath and indignation</I> 
 the cause, <I>and trouble (tribulation and anguish,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:8,9">Rom. ii. 8, 9</A>)

 the effect. This from on high he cast upon them and did not spare, and
 they could not <I>flee out of his hands,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:22">Job xxvii. 22</A>.
 
 <I>He made a way,</I> or (as the word is) <I>he weighed a path, to his
 anger.</I> He did not cast it upon them uncertainly, but by weight. His
 anger was weighed with the greatest exactness in the balances of 
 justice; for, in his greatest displeasure, he never did, nor ever will 
 do, any wrong to any of his creatures: the path of his anger is always 
 weighed. <I>Secondly,</I> The angels of God were the instruments 
 employed in this execution: <I>He sent evil angels among them,</I> not 
 evil in their own nature, but in respect to the errand upon which they 
 were sent; they were destroying angels, or angels of punishment, which 
 passed through all the land of Egypt, with orders, according to the 
 weighed paths of God's anger, not to kill all, but the first-born only.
 Good angels become evil angels to sinners. Those that make the holy God 
 their enemy must never expect the holy angels to be their friends.
 <I>Thirdly,</I> The execution itself was very severe: <I>He spared not 
 their soul from death,</I> but suffered death to ride in triumph among 
 them and <I>gave their life over to the pestilence,</I> which cut the 
 thread of life off immediately; for <I>he smote all the first-born in 
 Egypt</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:51"><I>v.</I> 51</A>),

 <I>the chief of their strength,</I> the hopes of their respective 
 families; children are the parents' strength, and the first-born the 
 <I>chief of their strength.</I> Thus, because Israel was precious in 
 God's sight, he <I>gave men for them and people for their life,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:4">Isa. xliii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) By these plagues on the Egyptians God made a way for <I>his own 
 people to go forth like sheep,</I> distinguishing between them and the 
 Egyptians, <I>as the shepherd divides between the sheep and the 
 goats,</I> having set his own mark on these sheep by the blood of the 
 lamb sprinkled on their door-posts. <I>He made them go forth like 
 sheep,</I> not knowing whither they went, and <I>guided them in the 
 wilderness,</I> as a shepherd guides his flock, with all possible care 
 and tenderness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:52"><I>v.</I> 52</A>.

 <I>He led them on safely,</I> though in dangerous paths, so that
 <I>they feared not,</I> that is, they needed not to fear; they were 
 indeed frightened at the Red Sea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:10">Exod. xiv. 10</A>),

 but that was said to them, and done for them, which effectually
 silenced their fears. <I>But the sea overwhelmed their enemies</I> that 
 ventured to pursue them into it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:63"><I>v.</I> 63</A>.

 It was a lane to them, but a grave to their persecutors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is carried down as far as their settlement in Canaan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:54"><I>v.</I> 54</A>):
 
 <I>He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,</I> to that land in 
 the midst of which he set up his sanctuary, which was, as it were, the 
 centre and metropolis, the crown and glory, of it. That is a happy land 
 which is the border of God's sanctuary. It was the happiness of that 
 land that there God was known, and there were his sanctuary and 
 dwelling-place, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:1,2">Ps.lxxvi. 1, 2</A>.

 The whole land in general, and Zion in particular, was <I>the mountain
 which his right hand had purchased,</I> which by his own power he had 
 set apart for himself. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:3">Ps. xliv. 3</A>.

 He <I>made them to ride on the high places of the earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:14,De+32:13">Isa. lviii. 14; Deut. xxxii. 13</A>.

 They found the Canaanites in the full and quiet possession of that
 land, but God <I>cast out the heathen before them,</I> not only took 
 away their title to it, as the Lord of the whole earth, but himself 
 executed the judgment given against them, and, as Lord of hosts, turned 
 them out of it, and made his people <I>Israel tread upon their high 
 places, dividing</I> each tribe <I>an inheritance by line,</I> and 
 making them <I>to dwell</I> in the houses of those whom they had 
 destroyed. God could have turned the uninhabited uncultivated 
 wilderness (which perhaps was nearly of the same extent as Canaan) into 
 fruitful soil, and have planted them there; but the land he designed 
 for them was to be a type of heaven, and therefore must be <I>the glory 
 of all lands;</I> it must likewise be fought for, for <I>the kingdom of 
 heaven suffers violence.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The sins of Israel after they were settled in Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:56-58"><I>v.</I> 56-58</A>.
 
 The children were <I>like their fathers,</I> and brought their old
 corruptions into their new habitations. Though God had done so much for 
 them, yet <I>they tempted and provoked the most high God</I> still. He 
 gave them his testimonies, but they did not keep them; they began very 
 promisingly, but they turned back, gave God good words, but dealt 
 unfaithfully, and were <I>like a deceitful bow,</I> which seemed likely 
 to send the arrow to the mark, but, when it is drawn, breaks, and drops 
 the arrow at the archer's foot, or perhaps makes it recoil in his face. 
 There was no hold of them, nor any confidence to be put in their 
 promises or professions. They seemed sometimes devoted to God, but they 
 presently <I>turned aside,</I> and <I>provoked him to anger with their 
 high places and their graven images.</I> Idolatry was the sin that did 
 most easily beset them, and which, though they often professed their 
 repentance for, they as often relapsed into. It was spiritual adultery 
 either to worship idols or to worship God by images, as if he had been 
 an idol, and therefore by it they are said to <I>move him to 
 jealousy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:16,21">Deut. xxxii. 16, 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The judgments God brought upon them for these sins. Their place in 
 Canaan would no more secure them in a sinful way than their descent 
 from Israel. <I>You only have I known of all the families of the earth, 
 therefore I will punish you,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:2">Amos iii. 2</A>.

 Idolatry is winked at among the Gentiles, but not in Israel, 

 1. God was displeased with them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:59"><I>v.</I> 59</A>):

 <I>When God heard this,</I> when he heard the cry of their
 iniquity, which came up before him, <I>he was wroth,</I> he took it 
 very heinously, as well he might, and he greatly abhorred Israel, whom 
 he had greatly loved and delighted in. Those that had been the people 
 of his choice became the generation of his wrath. Presumptuous sins, 
 idolatries especially, render even Israelites odious to God's holiness 
 and obnoxious to his justice. 

 2. He deserted his tabernacle among them, and removed the defence which
 was upon that glory,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:60"><I>v.</I> 60</A>.

 God never leaves us till we leave him, never withdraws till we have
 driven him from us. His name is <I>Jealous,</I> and he is a jealous 
 God; and therefore no marvel if a people whom he had betrothed to 
 himself be loathed and rejected, and he refuse to cohabit with them any 
 longer, when they have embraced the bosom of a stranger. The 
 <I>tabernacle at Shiloh</I> was <I>the tent God had placed among 
 men,</I> in which God would <I>in very deed dwell with men upon the 
 earth;</I> but, when his people treacherously forsook it, he justly 
 forsook it, and then all its glory departed. Israel has small joy of 
 the tabernacle without the presence of God in it. 

 3. He gave up all into the hands of the enemy. Those whom God forsakes
 become an easy prey to the destroyer. The Philistines are sworn enemies 
 to the Israel of God, and no less so to the God of Israel, and yet God 
 will make use of them to be a scourge to his people.

 (1.) God permits them to take the ark prisoner, and carry it off as a
 trophy of their victory, to show that he had not only forsaken the 
 tabernacle, but even the ark itself, which shall now be no longer a 
 token of his presence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:61"><I>v.</I> 61</A>):

 <I>He delivered his strength into captivity,</I> as if it had been 
 weakened and overcome, <I>and his glory</I> fell under the disgrace of 
 being abandoned <I>into the enemy's hand.</I> We have the story

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:11">1 Sam. iv. 11</A>.

 When the ark has become as a stranger among Israelites, no marvel if it
 soon be made a prisoner among Philistines. 

 (2.) He suffers the armies of Israel to be routed by the Philistines

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:62,63"><I>v.</I> 62, 63</A>):

 <I>He gave his people over unto the sword,</I> to the sword of his own 
 justice and of the enemy's rage, for he <I>was wroth with his 
 inheritance;</I> and that wrath of his was the <I>fire which consumed 
 their young men,</I> in the prime of their time, by the sword or 
 sickness, and made such a devastation of them that <I>their maidens 
 were not praised,</I> that is, <I>were not given in marriage</I> (which 
 is honourable in all), because there were no young men for them to be 
 given to, and because the distresses and calamities of Israel were so 
 many and great that the joys of marriage-solemnities were judged 
 unseasonable, and it was said, <I>Blessed is the womb that beareth 
 not.</I> General destructions produce a scarcity of men.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+13:12">Isa. xiii. 12</A>,

 <I>I will make a man more precious than fine gold,</I> so that <I>seven
 women shall take hold of one man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:1,Isa+3:25">Isa. iv. 1; iii. 25</A>.

 Yet this was not the worst: 

 (3.) Even <I>their priests,</I> who attended the ark, <I>fell by the
 sword,</I> Hophni and Phinehas. Justly they fell, for they made 
 themselves vile, and were sinners before the Lord exceedingly; and 
 their priesthood was so far from being their protection that it 
 aggravated their sin and hastened their fall. Justly did they fall by 
 the sword, because they exposed themselves in the field of battle, 
 without call or warrant. We throw ourselves out of God's protection 
 when we go out of our place and out of the way of our duty. When the 
 priests fell <I>their widows made no lamentation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:64"><I>v.</I> 64</A>.

 All the ceremonies of mourning were lost and buried in substantial
 grief; the widow of Phinehas, instead of lamenting her husband's death, 
 died herself, when she had called her son <I>Ichabod,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+4:19">1 Sam. iv. 19</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. God's return, in mercy, to them, and his gracious appearances for 
 them after this. We read not of their repentance and return to God, but 
 God was <I>grieved for the miseries of Israel</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+10:16">Judg. x. 16</A>)

 and concerned for his own honour, <I>fearing the wrath of the enemy,
 lest they should behave themselves strangely,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:27">Deut. xxxii. 27</A>.

 And therefore <I>then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:65"><I>v.</I> 65</A>),
 
 <I>and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine,</I> not only 
 like one that is raised out of sleep and recovers himself from the 
 slumber which by drinking he was overcome with, who then regards that 
 which before he seemed wholly to neglect, but like one that is 
 refreshed with sleep, and whose heart is made glad by the sober and 
 moderate use of wine, and is therefore the more lively and vigorous, 
 and fit for business. When God had delivered the ark of his strength 
 into captivity, as one jealous of his honour, he soon put forth the arm 
 of his strength to rescue it, stirred up his strength to do great 
 things for his people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He plagued the Philistines who held the ark in captivity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:66"><I>v.</I> 66</A>.

 He smote them with emerods <I>in the hinder parts,</I> wounded them
 behind, as if they were fleeing from him, even when they thought 
 themselves more than conquerors. He put them to reproach, and they 
 themselves helped to make it a perpetual reproach by the golden images 
 of their emerods, which they returned with the ark for a 
 trespass-offering

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+6:5">1 Sam. vi. 5</A>),

 to remain <I>in perpetuam rei memoriam--as a perpetual memorial.</I>
 Note, Sooner or later God will glorify himself by putting disgrace upon 
 his enemies, even when they are most elevated with their successes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He provided a new settlement for his ark after it had been some 
 months in captivity and some years in obscurity. He did indeed 
 <I>refuse the tabernacle of Joseph;</I> he never sent it back to 
 Shiloh, in the tribe of Ephraim, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:67"><I>v.</I> 67</A>.

 The ruins of that place were standing monuments of divine justice.
 <I>God, see what I did to Shiloh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:12">Jer. vii. 12</A>.

 But he did not wholly take away the glory from Israel; the moving of
 the ark is not the removing of it. Shiloh has lost it, but Israel has 
 not. God will have a church in the world, and a kingdom among men, 
 though this or that place may have its candlestick removed; nay, the 
 rejection of Shiloh is the election of Zion, as, long after, the fall 
 of the Jews was the riches of the Gentiles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:12">Rom. xi. 12</A>.

 When God <I>chose not the tribe of Ephraim,</I> of which tribe Joshua 
 was, he <I>chose the tribe of Judah</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:68"><I>v.</I> 68</A>),

 because of that tribe Jesus was to be, who is greater than Joshua. 
 Kirjath-jearim, the place to which the ark was brought after its rescue 
 out of the hands of the Philistines, was in the tribe of Judah. There 
 it took possession of that tribe; but thence it was removed to Zion, 
 <I>the Mount Zion which he loved</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:68"><I>v.</I> 68</A>),

 which was <I>beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth;</I> 
 there it was that he <I>built his sanctuary like high palaces</I> and 
 <I>like the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:69"><I>v.</I> 69</A>.

 David indeed erected only a tent for the ark, but a temple was then
 designed and prepared for, and finished by his son; and that was, 

 (1.) A very stately place. It was built like the palaces of princes,
 and the great men of the earth, nay, it excelled them all in splendour 
 and magnificence. Solomon built it, and yet here it is said <I>God 
 built it,</I> for his father had taught him, perhaps with reference to
 this undertaking, that <I>except the Lord build the house those labour 
 in vain</I> that build it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:1">Ps. cxxvii. 1</A>,

 which is a psalm for Solomon. 

 (2.) A very stable place, like the earth, though not to continue as 
 long as the earth, yet while it was to continue it was as firm as the 
 earth, which God <I>upholds by the word of his power,</I> and it was 
 not finally destroyed till the gospel temple was erected, which is to 
 continue <I>as long as the sun and moon endure</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:36,37">Ps. lxxxix. 36, 37</A>)

 and against which the <I>gates of hell shall not prevail.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He set a good government over them, a monarchy, and a monarch after 
 his own heart: <I>He chose David his servant</I> out of all the 
 thousands of Israel, and put the sceptre into his hand, out of whose 
 loins Christ was to come, and who was to be a type of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:70"><I>v.</I> 70</A>.
 
 Concerning David observe here, 

 (1.) The meanness of his beginning. His extraction indeed was great, 
 for he descended from the prince of the tribe of Judah, but his 
 education was poor. He was bred not a scholar, not a soldier, but a 
 shepherd. He was <I>taken from the sheep-folds,</I> as Moses was; for 
 God delights to put honour upon the humble and diligent, to raise the 
 poor out of the dust and to set them among princes; and sometimes he 
 finds those most fit for public action that have spent the beginning of 
 their time in solitude and contemplation. The Son of David was 
 upbraided with the obscurity of his original: <I>Is not this the 
 carpenter?</I> David was taken, he does not say from leading the rams, 
 but <I>from following the ewes,</I> especially those <I>great with 
 young,</I> which intimated that of all the good properties of a 
 shepherd he was most remarkable for his tenderness and compassion to 
 those of his flock that most needed his care. This temper of mind 
 fitted him for government, and made him a type of Christ, who, when he 
 feeds his flock like a shepherd, does with a particular care <I>gently 
 lead those that are with young,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11">Isa. xl. 11</A>.

 (2.) The greatness of his advancement. God preferred him to <I>feed
 Jacob his people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:71"><I>v.</I> 71</A>.

 It was a great honour that God put upon him, in advancing him to be a
 king, especially to be king over Jacob and Israel, God's peculiar 
 people, near and dear to him; but withal it was a great trust reposed 
 in him when he was charged with the government of those that were God's 
 own inheritance. God advanced him to the throne that he might feed 
 them, not that he might feed himself, that he might do good, not that 
 he might make his family great. It is the charge given to all the 
 under-shepherds, both magistrates and ministers, that they <I>feed the 
 flock of God.</I> 

 (3.) The happiness of his management. David, having so great a trust 
 put into his hands, obtained mercy of the Lord to be found both skilful 
 and faithful in the discharge of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:72"><I>v.</I> 72</A>):

 <I>So he fed them;</I> he ruled them and taught them, guided and 
 protected them, 

 [1.] Very honestly; he did it <I>according to the integrity of his 
 heart,</I> aiming at nothing but the glory of God and the good of the 
 people committed to his charge; the principles of his religion were the 
 maxims of his government, which he administered, not with carnal 
 policy, but with <I>godly sincerity, by the grace of God.</I> In every 
 thing he did he meant well and had no by-end in view.

 [2.] Very discreetly; he did it <I>by the skilfulness of his hands.</I> 
 He was not only very sincere in what he designed, but very prudent in 
 what he did, and chose out the most proper means in pursuit of his end, 
 for his God did instruct him to discretion. Happy the people that are 
 under such a government! With good reason does the psalmist make this 
 the finishing crowning instance of God's favour to Israel, for David 
 was a type of Christ the great and good Shepherd, who was humbled first 
 and then exalted, and of whom it was foretold that he should be filled 
 with the <I>spirit of wisdom and understanding</I> and should <I>judge 
 and reprove with equity,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:3,4">Isa. xi. 3, 4</A>.

 On the integrity of his heart and the skilfulness of his hands all his
 subjects may entirely rely, and <I>of the increase of his 
 government</I> and people <I>there shall be no end.</I></P>
