 <HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=50>
 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm dwells upon the same subject, and is set to the same tune,
 with the foregoing psalm. Christ is the Alpha and the Omega of both;
 they are both penned, and are both to be sung to his honour; and we
 make nothing of them if we do not, in them, make melody with our hearts
 to the Lord Jesus. He it is that reigns, to the joy of all mankind 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:1">ver. 1</A>);

 and his government speaks,

 I. Terror to his enemies; for he is a prince of inflexible justice and
 irresistible power,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97+2-7">ver. 2-7</A>.

 II.  Comfort to his friends and loyal subjects, arising from his
 sovereign dominion, the care he takes of his people, and the provision
 he makes for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:8-12">ver. 8-12</A>.

 In singing this psalm we must be affected with the glory of the exalted 
 Redeemer, must dread the lot of his enemies, and think ourselves happy 
 if we are of those that "kiss the son."</P>

 What was to be said among the heathen in the foregoing psalm 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 is here said again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 and is made the subject of this psalm, and of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+99:1-9">psalm xcix</A>.

 <I>The Lord reigns;</I> that is the great truth here laid down. The
 Lord Jehovah reigns, he that made the world governs it; he that gave
 being gives motion and power, gives law and commission, gives success
 and event. Every man's judgment proceeds from the Lord, from his 
 counsel and providence, and in all affairs, both public and private, he 
 performs the thing which he himself has appointed. The Lord Jesus 
 reigns; the providential kingdom is twisted in with the mediatorial and 
 the administration of both is in the hand of Christ, who therefore is 
 both the <I>head of the church</I> and <I>head over all things to the 
 church.</I> The kingdom of Christ is so constituted that,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. It may be matter of joy to all; and it will be so if it be not their 
 own fault. <I>Let the earth rejoice,</I> for hereby it is 
 <I>established</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:10">Ps. xcvi. 10</A>);

 it is honoured and enriched, and, in part, rescued from the vanity
 which by sin it is made subject to. Not only let the people of Israel
 rejoice in him as King of the Jews, and the daughter of Zion as her
 King, but let all the earth rejoice in his elevation; for the kingdoms
 of the world shall, more or less, sooner or later, become his kingdoms:
 <I>Let the multitude of isles,</I> the many or great isles, <I>be glad
 thereof.</I> This is applicable to our country, which is a great isle,
 and has many belonging to it; at least, it speaks comfort in general to
 the Gentiles, whose countries are called <I>the isles of the
 Gentiles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:5">Gen. x. 5</A>.

 There is enough in Christ for the multitude of the isles to rejoice in;
 for, though many have been made happy in him, yet still there is room. 
 All have reason to rejoice in Christ's government. 

 1. In the equity of it. There is an incontestable justice in all the
 acts of his government, both legislative and judicial.  Sometimes 
 indeed <I>clouds and darkness are round about him;</I> his 
 dispensations are altogether unaccountable; <I>his way is in the sea 
 and his path in the great waters.</I> We are not aware of what he 
 designs, what he drives at; nor is it fit that we should be let into 
 the secrets of his government.  There is a depth in his counsels, which 
 we must not pretend to fathom.  But still <I>righteousness and judgment 
 are the habitation of his throne;</I> a golden thread of justice runs 
 through the whole web of his administration. In this he resides, for it 
 is his habitation. In this he rules, for it is <I>the habitation of his 
 throne. His commandments are,</I> and will be, <I>all righteous.  
 Righteousness and judgment are the basis of his throne</I> (so Dr.  
 Hammond); for <I>therefore</I> his <I>throne is for ever and ever,</I> 
 because his <I>sceptre is a right sceptre,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:6">Ps. xlv. 6</A>.

 <I>The throne is established in righteousness.</I> Even <I>the heavens 
 declare his righteousness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 it is as conspicuous and as illustrious as the heavens themselves. The
 angels of heaven will declare it, who are employed as messengers in the 
 administration of his government and therefore know more of it than any 
 of his creatures. His righteousness is incontestable; for who can 
 contradict or dispute what the <I>heavens declare?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:6">Ps. l. 6</A>.

 2. In the extent of it in the upper and lower world. 

 (1.) All the men on earth are under his government; either he is served 
 by them or he serves himself by them. <I>All the people see his 
 glory,</I> or may see it. The glory of God, in the face of Christ, was 
 made to shine in distant countries, among many people, more or less 
 among all people; the gospel was preached, for aught we know, in all 
 languages,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:5,11">Acts ii. 5, 11</A>.

 Miracles were wrought in all nations, and so <I>all the people saw his
 glory. Have they not heard?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:18">Rom. x. 18</A>.

 (2.) All the angels in heaven are so. Perhaps we should not have found
 this truth in those words 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 <I>Worship him, all you gods,</I> if we had not been directed to it by 
 the inspired apostle, who, from the Septuagint version of those words, 
 makes the Messiah to be introduced into the upper world at the 
 ascension with this charge

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:6">Heb. i. 6</A>),
 
 <I>Let all the angels of God worship him,</I> which helps us to a key
 to this whole psalm, and shows us that it must be applied to the 
 exalted Redeemer, who has gone into heaven, <I>and is on the right hand 
 of God,</I> which intimates that all power is given him both in heaven 
 and earth, <I>angels, authorities, and powers, being made subject unto 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:22">1 Pet. iii. 22</A>.

 This speaks the honour of Christ, that he has such worshippers, and the
 honour of all good Christians, that they have such 
 fellow-worshippers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Christ's government, though it may be matter of joy to all, will 
 yet be matter of terror to some, and it is their own fault that it is
 so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:3-5,7"><I>v.</I> 3-5, 7</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When the kingdom of Christ was to be set up in the world, after his 
 ascension, it would meet with many enemies, and much opposition would 
 be given to it. He that reigns, to the <I>joy of the whole earth,</I> 
 yet, as he has his subjects, so he has <I>his enemies</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 that not only will not have him to reign over them, but would not have 
 him to reign at all, that not only will not <I>enter into the kingdom 
 of heaven themselves,</I> but do all they can to <I>hinder those that 
 are entering,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:13">Matt. xxiii. 13</A>.

 This was fulfilled in the enmity of the unbelieving Jews to the gospel
 of Christ, and the violent persecution which in all places they stirred 
 up against the preachers and professors of it. These enemies are here 
 called <I>hills</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 
 for their height, and strength, and immovable obstinacy. It was the 
 <I>princes of this world</I> that <I>crucified the Lord of glory,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:8,Ps+2:2">1 Cor. ii. 8; Ps.  ii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The opposition which the Jews gave to the setting up of Christ's 
 kingdom turned to their own ruin. Their persecuting the apostles, and 
 <I>forbidding them to speak to the Gentiles,</I> filled up their sin, 
 and brought <I>wrath upon them to the uttermost,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:15,16">1 Thess. ii. 15, 16</A>.
 
 That wrath is here compared, 

 (1.) To consuming fire, which <I>goes before him, and burns up his 
 enemies,</I> that have made themselves like chaff and stubble, and have 
 <I>set the briers and thorns before him in battle,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4">Isa.  xxvii. 4</A>.

 This fire of divine wrath will not only burn the rubbish upon the
 hills, but will even <I>melt the hills</I> themselves <I>like wax,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 When our God appears as a consuming fire even rocks will be wax before 
 him. The most resolute and daring opposition will be baffled <I>at the 
 presence of the Lord.</I> His very presence is enough to shame and sink 
 it, for he is <I>the Lord of the whole earth,</I> by whom all the 
 children of men are manageable and to whom they are accountable. Men 
 hate and persecute God's people, because they think him absent, that 
 the Lord has <I>forsaken the earth;</I> but, when he manifests his 
 presence, they melt. 
 
 (2.) To amazing <I>lightnings</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 which strike a terror upon many. The judgments God brought upon the 
 enemies of Christ's kingdom were such as all the world took notice of 
 with terror: <I>The earth saw and trembled,</I> and the ears of all 
 that heard were made to tingle. This was fulfilled in the destruction 
 of Jerusalem and the Jewish nation by the Romans, about forty years 
 after Christ's resurrection, which, like fire, wholly destroyed that 
 people, and, like lightning, astonished all their neighbours

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:24">Deut. xxix. 24</A>);

 but the heavens declare God's righteousness in it, and all the people,
 to this day, see his glory, in those lasting monuments of his justice,
 the scattered Jews.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Idolaters also would be put to confusion by the setting up of
 Christ's kingdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Confounded be all those who serve graven images,</I> the Gentile 
 world, who <I>did service to those that by nature are no gods</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:8">Gal. iv. 8</A>),

 who boasted themselves of idols as their protectors and benefactors.
 Did those that served idols boast of them, and shall the servants of 
 the living God distrust him, or be ashamed of him? <I>Let those be 
 ashamed that serve graven images.</I> 

 (1.) This is a prayer for the conversion of the Gentiles, that those 
 who have been so long serving dumb idols may be convinced of their 
 error, ashamed of their folly, and may, by the power of Christ's 
 gospel, be brought to serve the only living and true God, and may be as 
 much ashamed of their idols as ever they were proud of them. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:20,21">Isa.  ii. 20, 21</A>.

 (2.) This is a prophecy of the ruin of those that would not be reformed 
 and reclaimed from their idolatry; they shall be confounded by the 
 destruction of Paganism in the Roman empire, which was fulfilled about 
 300 years after Christ, so much to the terror of idolaters that some 
 think it was the revolution under Constantine that made even the mighty 
 men say to the rocks, <I>Fall on us and hide us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:15,16">Rev. vi. 15, 16</A>.
 
 This prayer and prophecy are still in force against antichristian 
 idolaters, who may here read their doom: <I>Confounded be all those 
 that worship graven images,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced
 because of thy judgments, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 9  For thou, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>art</I> high above all the earth: thou art

 &nbsp; 12  Rejoice in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, ye righteous; and give thanks at the

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The kingdom of the Messiah, like the pillar of cloud and fire, as it 
 has a dark side towards the Egyptians, so it has a bright side towards 
 the Israel of God. It is set up in spite of opposition; and then <I>the 
 earth saw and trembled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 but <I>Zion heard and was glad,</I> very glad, to hear of the
 conversion of some and of the confusion of others, that is, the 
 conquest of all that stood it out against Christ.  <I>Rejoice greatly, 
 O daughter of Zion! for behold thy king comes unto thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:9">Zech. ix. 9</A>.

 And not Zion only, where the temple was, but even <I>the daughters of
 Judah, rejoiced;</I> the common people, the inhabitants of the 
 villages, they shall triumph in Christ's victories.  The command 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)
 
 is, <I>Let the earth rejoice;</I> but it is only the sons of Zion and 
 the daughters of Judah that do rejoice. All should bid the kingdom of 
 the Messiah welcome, but few do. Now here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The reasons that are given for Zion's joy in the government of the 
 Redeemer. The faithful servants of God may well <I>rejoice</I> and be 
 <I>glad,</I> 

 1. Because God is glorified, and whatever redounds to his honour is
 very much his people's pleasure. They rejoice <I>because of thy 
 judgments, O Lord!</I> which may take in both the judgments of his 
 mouth and the judgments of his hand, the word of his gospel and his 
 works wrought for the propagating of it, miracles and marvellous 
 providences; for in these we must own, "<I>Thou, Lord, art high above 
 all the earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 thou hast manifested thy sovereignty in the kingdom of nature, and thy 
 command of all its powers, and thy dominion over all nations, over all 
 hearts; thou art <I>exalted far above all gods</I>" --all deputed gods, 
 that is, princes--all counterfeit gods, that is, idols. The exaltation 
 of Christ, and the advancement of God's glory among men thereby, are 
 the rejoicing of all the saints. 

 2.  Because care is taken for their safety. Those that pay allegiance 
 to Christ as a King shall be sure of his protection. Princes are the 
 shields of the earth; Christ is so to his subjects; they may put their 
 trust under his shadow and rejoice in it, for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 <I>He preserves the souls of the saints;</I> he preserves their lives 
 as long as he has any work for them to do, and wonderfully <I>delivers 
 them</I> many a time <I>out of the hand of the wicked,</I> their 
 persecutors that thirst after their blood; for <I>precious in the sight 
 of the Lord is the death of his saints.</I> But something more is meant 
 than their lives; for those that will be his disciples must be willing 
 to lay down their lives, and not indent for the securing of them. It is 
 the <I>immortal soul</I> that Christ preserves, the <I>inward man,</I> 
 which may be renewed more and more when the <I>outward man decays.</I> 
 He will <I>preserve the souls of his saints</I> from sin, from 
 apostasy, and despair, under their greatest trials; he will <I>deliver 
 them out of the hands of the wicked one</I> that <I>seeks to devour 
 them; he will preserve them</I> safely <I>to his heavenly kingdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:18">2 Tim. iv. 18</A>.
 
 They have therefore reason to be glad, being thus safe. 

 3.  Because provision is made for their comfort. Those that rejoice in 
 Christ Jesus, and in his exaltation, have fountains of joy treasured up 
 for them, which will be opened sooner or later

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Light is sown for the righteous,</I> that is, <I>gladness for the
 upright in heart.</I> The subjects of Christ's kingdom are told to 
 expect tribulation in the world. They must suffer by its malice, and 
 must not share in its mirth; yet let them know, to their comfort, that 
 <I>light is sown</I> for them; it is designed and prepared for them. 
 What is sown will come up again in due time; though, like a winter 
 seedness, it may lie long under the clods, and seem to be lost and 
 buried, yet it will return in a rich and plentiful increase.  God's 
 goodness shall be sure of a <I>harvest</I> in the <I>appointed weeks. 
 Those that sow in tears shall,</I> without fail, <I>reap in joy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:5,6">Ps. cxxvi. 5, 6</A>.

 Christ told his disciples, at parting

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:20">John xvi. 20</A>),

 <I>You shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into
 joy.</I> Gladness is sure to the <I>upright in heart,</I> to those only 
 that are sincere in religion.  <I>The joy of the hypocrite is but for a 
 moment.</I> There is no serenity without a lasting sincerity,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The rules that are given for Zion's joy. 

 1. Let it be a pure and holy joy. "You that love the Lord Jesus, that
 <I>love his appearing</I> and kingdom, that love his word and his 
 exaltation, see that you hate evil, the evil of sin, every thing that 
 is offensive to him and will throw you out of his favour." Note, A true 
 love to God will show itself in a real hatred of all sin, as that 
 abominable thing which he hates.  The joy of the saints should likewise 
 confirm their antipathy to sin and divine comforts should put their 
 mouths out of taste for sensual pleasures.

 2. Let the joy terminate in God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous.</I> Let all the streams of
 comfort, which flow to us in the channel of Christ's kingdom, lead us 
 to the fountain, and oblige us to <I>rejoice in the Lord.</I> All the
 lines of joy must meet in him as in the centre. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:3,4:4">Phil. iii. 3; iv. 4</A>.

 3.  Let it express itself in praise and thanksgiving: <I>Give thanks at
 the remembrance of his holiness.</I> Whatever is the matter of our 
 rejoicing ought to be the matter of our thanksgiving, and particularly 
 the holiness of God. Those that hate sin themselves are glad that God 
 does so, in hopes that therefore he will not suffer it to have dominion 
 over them. Note, 

 (1.) We ought to be much in the remembrance of God's holiness, the 
 infinite purity, rectitude, and perfection of the divine nature. We 
 must be ever mindful of his holy covenant, which he has confirmed with 
 an oath <I>by his holiness.</I> 

 (2.) We ought to give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness, not 
 only give him the glory of it as it is an honour to him, but give him 
 thanks for it as it is a favour to us; and an unspeakable favour it 
 will be if, through grace, we are <I>partakers of his holiness.</I> It 
 is God's holiness which, above all his attributes, the angels 
 celebrate.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:3">Isa. vi. 3</A>,

 <I>Holy, holy, holy.</I> Sinners tremble, but saints rejoice, <I>at the 
 remembrance of God's holiness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:4">Ps.  xxx. 4</A>.</P>
