 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a psalm of instruction concerning good and evil, setting before 
 us life and death, the blessing and the curse, that we may take the 
 right way which leads to happiness and avoid that which will certainly 
 end in our misery and ruin. The different character and condition of 
 godly people and wicked people, those that serve God and those that 
 serve him not, is here plainly stated in a few words; so that every 
 man, if he will be faithful to himself, may here see his own face and 
 then read his own doom. That division of the children of men into 
 saints and sinners, righteous and unrighteous, the children of God and 
 the children of the wicked one, as it is ancient, ever since the 
 struggle began between sin and grace, the seed of the woman and the 
 seed of the serpent, so it is lasting, and will survive all other 
 divisions and subdivisions of men into high and low, rich and poor, 
 bond and free; for by this men's everlasting state will be determined, 
 and the distinction will last as long as heaven and hell. This psalm 
 shows us, 

 I. The holiness and happiness of a godly man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II.  The sinfulness and misery of a wicked man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 III. The ground and reason of both, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:6">ver. 6</A>.

 Whoever collected the psalms of David (probably it was Ezra) with good
 reason put this psalm first, as a preface to the rest, because it is
 absolutely necessary to the acceptance of our devotions that we be
 righteous before God (for it is only the prayer of the upright that is
 his delight), and therefore that we be right in our notions of
 blessedness and in our choice of the way that leads to it.  Those are
 not fit to put up good prayers who do not walk in good ways.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Blessed <I>is</I> the man that walketh not in the counsel of the
 ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the
 seat of the scornful.
 &nbsp; 2  But his delight <I>is</I> in the law of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and in his law
 doth he meditate day and night.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist begins with the character and condition of a godly man,
 that those may first take the comfort of that to whom it belongs. Here
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A description of the godly man's spirit and way, by which we are to 
 try ourselves. The Lord knows those that are his by name, but we must 
 know them by their character; for that is agreeable to a state of 
 probation, that we may study to answer to the character, which is 
 indeed both the command of the law which we are bound in duty to obey 
 and the condition of the promise which we are bound in interest to 
 fulfil. The character of a good man is here given by the rules he 
 chooses to walk by and to take his measures from. What we take at our 
 setting out, and at every turn, for the guide of our conversation, 
 whether the course of this world or the word of God, is of material 
 consequence. An error in the choice of our standard and leader is 
 original and fatal; but, if we be right here, we are in a fair way to 
 do well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A godly man, that he may avoid the evil, utterly renounces the 
 companionship of evil-doers, and will not be led by them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>He walks not in the council of the ungodly, &c.</I> This part of his
 character is put first, because those that will keep the commandments 
 of their God must say to evil-doers, <I>Depart from us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:115">Ps. cxix. 115</A>),

 and departing from evil is that in which wisdom begins.

 (1.) He sees evil-doers round about him; the world is full of them; 
 they walk on every side. They are here described by three characters, 
 <I>ungodly, sinners,</I> and <I>scornful.</I> See by what steps men 
 arrive at the height of impiety. <I>Nemo repente fit turpissimus--None 
 reach the height of vice at once.</I> They are <I>ungodly</I> first, 
 casting off the fear of God and living in the neglect of their duty to 
 him: but they rest not there. When the services of religion are laid 
 aside, they come to be <I>sinners,</I> that is, they break out into 
 open rebellion against God and engage in the service of sin and Satan.  
 Omissions make way for commissions, and by these the heart is so 
 hardened that at length they come to be <I>scorners,</I> that is, they 
 openly defy all that is sacred, scoff at religion, and make a jest of 
 sin. Thus is the way of iniquity down-hill; the bad grow worse, sinners 
 themselves become tempters to others and advocates for Baal. The word 
 which we translate <I>ungodly</I> signifies such as are unsettled, aim 
 at no certain end and walk by no certain rule, but are at the command 
 of every lust and at the beck of every temptation. The word for 
 <I>sinners</I> signifies such as are determined for the practice of sin 
 and set it up as their trade. The <I>scornful</I> are those that set 
 <I>their mouths against the heavens.</I> These the good man sees with a 
 sad heart; they are a constant vexation to his righteous soul. But, 
 
 (2.) He shuns them wherever he sees them. He does not do as they do; 
 and, that he may not, he does not converse familiarly with them. 

 [1.] He does <I>not walk in the counsel of the ungodly.</I> He is not 
 present at their councils, nor does he advise with them; though they 
 are ever so witty, and subtle, and learned, if they are ungodly, they 
 shall not be the men of his counsel. He does not consent to them, nor 
 <I>say as they say,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:51">Luke xxiii. 51</A>.

 He does not take his measures from their principles, nor act according
 to the advice which they give and take. The ungodly are forward to give 
 their advice against religion, and it is managed so artfully that we 
 have reason to think ourselves happy if we escape being tainted and 
 ensnared by it. 

 [2.] He <I>stands not in the way of sinners;</I> he avoids doing as 
 they do; their way shall not be his way; he will not come into it, much 
 less will he continue in it, as the sinner does, who <I>sets himself in 
 a way that is not good,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:4">Ps. xxxvi. 4</A>.

 He avoids (as much as may be) being where they are. That he may not
 imitate them, he will not associate with them, nor choose them for his 
 companions. He does not stand in their way, to be picked up by them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:8">Prov. vii. 8</A>),

 but keeps as far from them as from a place or person infected with the
 plague, for fear of the contagion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:14,15">Prov. iv. 14, 15</A>.

 He that would be kept from harm must keep out of harm's way.

 [3.] He <I>sits not in the seat of the scornful;</I> he does not repose 
 himself with those that sit down secure in their wickedness and please 
 themselves with the searedness of their own consciences. He does not 
 associate with those that sit in close cabal to find out ways and means 
 for the support and advancement of the devil's kingdom, or that sit in 
 open judgment, magisterially to condemn the generation of the 
 righteous. The seat of the drunkards is the <I>seat of the 
 scornful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:12">Ps. lxix. 12</A>.

 Happy is the man that never sits in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:5">Hos.  vii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A godly man, that he may do that which is good and cleave to it, 
 submits to the guidance of the word of God and makes that familiar to 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 This is that which keeps him out of the way of the ungodly and 
 fortifies him against their temptations. <I>By the words of thy lips I 
 have kept me from the path of the deceiver,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:4">Ps. xvii. 4</A>.

 We need not court the fellowship of sinners, either for pleasure or for
 improvement, while we have fellowship with the word of God and with God 
 himself in and by his word. <I>When thou awakest it shall talk with 
 thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:22">Prov. vi. 22</A>.

 We may judge of our spiritual state by asking, "What is the law of God
 to us? What account do we make of it? What place has it in us?" See 
 here,

 (1.) The entire affection which a good man has for the law of God: 
 <I>His delight is in it.</I> He delights in it, though it be a law, a 
 yoke, because it is the law of God, which is holy, just, and good, 
 which he freely consents to, and so delights in, <I>after the inner 
 man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+7:16,22">Rom. vii. 16, 22</A>.

 All who are well pleased that there is a God must be well pleased that
 there is a Bible, a revelation of God, of his will, and of the only way 
 to happiness in him.

 (2.) The intimate acquaintance which a good man keeps up with the word 
 of God: <I>In that law doth he meditate day and night;</I> and by this 
 it appears that his delight is in it, for what we love we love to think 
 of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:97">Ps. cxix. 97</A>.

 To meditate in God's word is to discourse with ourselves concerning the
 great things contained in it, with a close application of mind, a 
 fixedness of thought, till we be suitably affected with those things 
 and experience the savour and power of them in our hearts. This we must 
 do <I>day and night;</I> we must have a constant habitual regard to the 
 word of God as the rule of our actions and the spring of our comforts, 
 and we must have it in our thoughts, accordingly, upon every occasion 
 that occurs, whether night or day. No time is amiss for meditating on 
 the word of God, nor is any time unseasonable for those visits. We must 
 not only set ourselves to meditate on God's word morning and evening, 
 at the entrance of the day and of the night, but these thoughts should
 be interwoven with the business and converse of every day and with the
 repose and slumbers of every night. <I>When I awake I am still with 
 thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An assurance given of the godly man's happiness, with which we 
 should encourage ourselves to answer the character of such. 

 1. In general, he is <I>blessed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+5:1">Ps. v. 1</A>.

 God blesses him, and that blessing will make him happy. Blessednesses
 are to him, blessings of all kinds, of the upper and nether springs, 
 enough to make him completely happy; none of the ingredients of 
 happiness shall be wanting to him. When the psalmist undertakes to 
 describe a blessed man, he describes a good man; for, after all, those 
 only are happy, truly happy, that are holy, truly holy; and we are more 
 concerned to know the way to blessedness than to know wherein that 
 blessedness will consist.  Nay, goodness and holiness are not only the 
 way to happiness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:14">Rev. xxii. 14</A>)

 but happiness itself; supposing there were not another life after this,
 yet that man is a happy man that keeps in the way of his duty.

 2. His blessedness is here illustrated by a similitude 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>He shall be like a tree,</I> fruitful and flourishing. This is the
 effect,

 (1.) Of his pious practice; he meditates in the law of God, turns that 
 <I>in succum et sanguinem--into juice and blood,</I> and that makes him 
 like a tree. The more we converse with the word of God the better 
 furnished we are for every good word and work. Or, 

 (2.) Of the promised blessing; he is blessed of the Lord, and therefore 
 <I>he shall be like a tree.</I> The divine blessing produces real 
 effects. It is the happiness of a godly man, 

 [1.] That he is planted by the grace of God.  These trees were by 
 nature wild olives, and will continue so till they are grafted anew, 
 and so planted by a power from above. Never any good tree grew of 
 itself; it is <I>the planting of the Lord,</I> and therefore he must in 
 it be glorified. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:3">Isa. lxi. 3</A>,

 <I>The trees of the Lord are full of sap.</I>

 [2.] That he is placed by the means of grace, here called <I>the rivers 
 of water,</I> those rivers which <I>make glad the city of our God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:4">Ps. xlvi. 4</A>);

 from these a good man receives supplies of strength and vigour, but in
 secret undiscerned ways.

 [3.] That his practices shall be fruit, abounding to a good account, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:17">Phil.  iv. 17</A>.

 To those whom God first blessed he said, <I>Be fruitful</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:22">Gen. i. 22</A>),

 and still the comfort and honour of fruitfulness are a recompense for
 the labour of it. It is expected from those who enjoy the mercies of 
 grace that, both in the temper of their minds and in the tenour of 
 their lives, they comply with the intentions of that grace, and then 
 they bring forth fruit. And, be it observed to the praise of the great 
 dresser of the vineyard, they bring forth their fruit (that which is 
 required of them) <I>in due season,</I> when it is most beautiful and 
 most useful, improving every opportunity of doing good and doing it in 
 its proper time.

 [4.] That his profession shall be preserved from blemish and decay: 
 <I>His leaf also shall not wither.</I> As to those who bring forth only 
 the leaves of profession, without any good fruit, even their leaf will 
 wither and they shall be as much ashamed of their profession as ever 
 they were proud of it; but, if the word of God rule in the heart, that 
 will keep the profession green, both to our comfort and to our credit; 
 the laurels thus won shall never wither. 

 [5.] That prosperity shall attend him wherever he goes, 
 soul-prosperity.  <I>Whatever he does,</I> in conformity to the law, it 
 <I>shall prosper</I> and succeed to his mind, or above his hope.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:1-3">these verses</A>,

 being duly affected with the malignant and dangerous nature of sin, the
 transcendent excellencies of the divine law, and the power and efficacy 
 of God's grace, from which our fruit is found, we must teach and 
 admonish ourselves, and one another, to watch against sin and all 
 approaches towards it, to converse much with the word of God, and 
 abound in the fruit of righteousness; and, in praying over them, we 
 must seek to God for his grace both to fortify us against every evil 
 word and work and to furnish us for every good word and work.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  The ungodly <I>are</I> not so: but <I>are</I> like the chaff which the
 wind driveth away.
 &nbsp; 5  Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor
 sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
 &nbsp; 6  For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of
 the ungodly shall perish.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The description of the ungodly given, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 1. In general, they are the reverse of the righteous, both in character 
 and condition: <I>They are not so.</I> The LXX. emphatically repeats 
 this: <I>Not so the ungodly; they are not so;</I> they are led by the 
 counsel of the wicked, in the way of sinners, to the seat of the 
 scornful; they have no delight in the law of God, nor ever think of it; 
 they bring forth no fruit but grapes of Sodom; they cumber the ground. 

 2. In particular, whereas the righteous are like valuable, useful, 
 fruitful trees, <I>they are like the chaff which the wind drives 
 away,</I> the very lightest of the chaff, the dust which the owner of 
 the floor desires to have driven away, as not capable of being put to 
 any use.  Would you value them? Would you weigh them? They are like 
 chaff, of no worth at all in God's account, how highly soever they may 
 value themselves.  Would you know the temper of their minds? They are 
 light and vain; they have no substance in them, no solidity; they are 
 easily driven to and fro by every wind and temptation, and have no 
 stedfastness. Would you know their end? The wrath of God will drive 
 them away in their wickedness, as the wind does the chaff, which is 
 never gathered nor looked after more. The chaff may be, for a while, 
 among the wheat; but he is coming <I>whose fan is in his hand</I> and 
 who will <I>thoroughly purge his floor.</I> Those that by their own sin 
 and folly make themselves as chaff will be found so before the 
 whirlwind and fire of divine wrath 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:5">Ps. xxxv. 5</A>),
 
 so unable to stand before it or to escape it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:13">Isa. xvii. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The doom of the ungodly read, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 1. They will be cast, upon their trial, as traitors convicted: <I>They
 shall not stand in the judgment,</I> that is, they shall be found 
 guilty, shall hang down the head with shame and confusion, and all 
 their pleas and excuses will be overruled as frivolous. There is a 
 judgment to come, in which every man's present character and work, 
 though ever so artfully concealed and disguised, shall be truly and 
 perfectly discovered, and appear in their own colours, and accordingly 
 every man's future state will be, by an irreversible sentence, 
 determined for eternity. The ungodly must appear in that judgment, to 
 receive according to the things done in the body.  They may hope to 
 come off, nay, to come off with honour, but their hope will deceive 
 them: <I>They shall not stand in the judgment,</I> so plain will the 
 evidence be against them and so just and impartial will the judgment be 
 upon it. 

 2. They will be for ever shut out from the society of the blessed. They 
 shall not stand <I>in the congregation of the righteous,</I> that is, 
 in the <I>judgment</I> (so some), that court wherein the saints, as 
 assessors with Christ, shall judge the world, those holy myriads with 
 which he shall come to execute <I>judgment upon all,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14,15;1Co+6:2">Jude 14, 15; 1 Cor. vi. 2</A>.

 Or in <I>heaven.  There</I> will be seen, shortly, a <I>general
 assembly of the church of the first-born, a congregation of the 
 righteous,</I> of all the saints, and none but saints, and saints made 
 perfect, such a congregation of them as never was in this world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:1">2 Thess. ii. 1</A>.

 The wicked shall not have a place in that congregation. Into the new
 Jerusalem none unclean nor unsanctified shall enter; they shall see the 
 righteous enter into the kingdom, and themselves, to their everlasting 
 vexation, thrust out, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:27">Luke  xiii. 27</A>.

 The wicked and profane, in this world, ridiculed the righteous and
 their congregation, despised them, and cared not for their company; 
 justly therefore will they be for ever separated from them. Hypocrites 
 in this world, under the disguise of a plausible profession, may thrust 
 themselves into the congregation of the righteous and remain 
 undisturbed and undiscovered there; but Christ cannot be imposed upon, 
 though his ministers may; the day is coming when he will separate 
 <I>between the sheep and the goats, the tares and the wheat;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:41,49">Matt. xiii. 41, 49</A>.

 That <I>great day</I> (so the Chaldee here calls it) will be a day of
 discovery, a day of distinction, and a day of final division. Then you 
 shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, which 
 here it is sometimes hard to do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:18">Mal.  iii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The reason rendered of this different state of the godly and 
 wicked, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 1. God must have all the glory of the prosperity and happiness of the
 righteous. They are blessed because <I>the Lord knows their way;</I> he 
 chose them into it, inclined them to choose it, leads and guides them 
 in it, and orders all their steps. 

 2. Sinners must bear all the blame of their own destruction. 
 <I>Therefore</I> the ungodly perish, because the very way in which they 
 have chosen and resolved to walk leads directly to destruction; it 
 naturally tends towards ruin and therefore must necessarily end in it. 
 Or we may take it thus, The Lord approves and is well pleased with the 
 way of the righteous, and therefore, under the influence of his 
 gracious smiles, it shall prosper and end well; but he is angry at the 
 way of the wicked, all they do is offensive to him, and therefore it 
 shall perish, and they in it. It is certain that every man's judgment 
 proceeds from the Lord, and it is well or ill with us, and is likely to 
 be so to all eternity, accordingly as we are or are not accepted of 
 God. Let this support the drooping spirits of the righteous, that the 
 Lord knows their way, knows their hearts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:3">Jer. xii. 3</A>),
 
 knows their secret devotions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:6">Matt. vi. 6</A>),

 knows their character, how much soever it is blackened and blemished by
 the reproaches of men, and will shortly make them and their way 
 manifest before the world, to their immortal joy and honour. Let this 
 cast a damp upon the security and jollity of sinners, that their way, 
 though pleasant now, will perish at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:4-6">these verses</A>, 

 and praying over them, let us possess ourselves with a holy dread of
 the wicked man's portion, and deprecate it with a firm and lively 
 expectation of the judgment to come, and stir up ourselves to prepare 
 for it, and with a holy care to approve ourselves to God in every 
 thing, entreating his favour with our whole hearts.</P>
