 The description here given of the leviathan, a very large, strong,
 formidable fish, or water-animal, is designed yet further to convince
 Job of his own impotency, and of God's omnipotence, that he might be
 humbled for his folly in making so bold with him as he had done.

 I. To convince Job of his own weakness he is here challenged to subdue
 and tame this leviathan if he can, and make himself master of him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>),

 and, since he cannot do this, he must own himself utterly unable to
 stand before the great God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:10">ver. 10</A>.

 II. To convince Job of God's power and terrible majesty several
 particular instances are here given of the strength and terror of the
 leviathan, which is no more than what God has given him, nor more than
 he has under his check,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 The face of the leviathan is here described to be terrible 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:12,14">ver. 12, 14</A>),
 
 his scales close 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>),
 
 his breath and neesings sparkling 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:18-21">ver. 18-21</A>),

 his flesh firm
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:22-24">ver. 22-24</A>),
 
 his strength and spirit, when he is attacked, insuperable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:25-30">ver. 25-30</A>),

 his motions turbulent, and disturbing to the waters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:31,32">ver. 31, 32</A>),

 so that, upon the whole, he is a very terrible creature, and man is no 
 match for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:33,34">ver. 33, 34</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook? or his tongue
 with a cord <I>which</I> thou lettest down?
 &nbsp; 2  Canst thou put a hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through
 with a thorn?
 &nbsp; 3  Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft
 <I>words</I> unto thee?
 &nbsp; 4  Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a
 servant for ever?
 &nbsp; 5  Wilt thou play with him as <I>with</I> a bird? or wilt thou bind
 him for thy maidens?
 &nbsp; 6  Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part
 him among the merchants?
 &nbsp; 7  Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with
 fish spears?
 &nbsp; 8  Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
 &nbsp; 9  Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not <I>one</I> be cast
 down even at the sight of him?
 &nbsp; 10  None <I>is so</I> fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able
 to stand before me?

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Whether this leviathan be a whale or a crocodile is a great dispute 
 among the learned, which I will not undertake to determine; some of the 
 particulars agree more easily to the one, others to the other; both are 
 very strong and fierce, and the power of the Creator appears in them. 
 The ingenious Sir Richard Blackmore, though he admits the more received 
 opinion concerning the <I>behemoth,</I> that it must be meant of the 
 <I>elephant,</I> yet agrees with the learned Bochart's notion of the 
 <I>leviathan,</I> that it is the <I>crocodile,</I> which was so well 
 known in the river of Egypt. I confess that that which inclines me 
 rather to understand it of the whale is not only because it is much 
 larger and a nobler animal, but because, in the history of the 
 Creation, there is such an express notice taken of it as is not of any 
 other species of animals whatsoever 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:21">Gen. i. 21</A>,

 <I>God created great whales</I>), by which it appears, not only that
 whales were well known in those parts in the time of Moses, who lived a 
 little after Job, but that the creation of whales was generally looked 
 upon as a most illustrious proof of the eternal power and godhead of 
 the Creator; and we may conjecture that this was the reason (for 
 otherwise it seems unaccountable) why Moses there so particularly 
 mentions the creation of the whales, because God had so lately insisted 
 upon the bulk and strength of that creature than of any other, as the 
 proof of his power; and the <I>leviathan</I> is here spoken of as an 
 inhabitant of the sea

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 which the crocodile is not; and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:25,26">Ps. civ. 25, 26</A>,

 <I>there</I> in <I>the great and wide sea, is that leviathan.</I> Here
 in these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He shows how unable Job was to master the leviathan. 

 1. That he could not catch him, as a little fish, with angling,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 He had no bait wherewith to deceive him, no hook wherewith to catch
 him, no fish-line wherewith to draw him out of the water, nor a thorn 
 to run through his gills, on which to carry him home. 

 2. That he could not make him his prisoner, nor force him to cry for 
 quarter, or surrender himself at discretion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 "He knows his own strength too well to <I>make many supplications to 
 thee,</I> and to <I>make a covenant with thee</I> to be thy servant on 
 condition thou wilt save his life."

 3. That he could not entice him into a cage, and keep him there as a
 bird for the children to play with, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 There are creatures so little, so weak, as to be easily restrained
 thus, and triumphed over; but the leviathan is not one of these: he is 
 made to be the terror, not the sport and diversion, of mankind.

 4. That he could not have him served up to his table; he and his 
 companions could not make a banquet of him; his flesh is too strong to 
 be fit for food, and, if it were not, he is not easily caught. 

 5. That they could not enrich themselves with the spoil of him:
 <I>Shall they part him among the merchants,</I> the bones to one, the 
 oil to another? If they can catch him, they will; but it is probable
 that the art of fishing for whales was not brought to perfection then, 
 as it has been since. 

 6. That they could not destroy him, could not <I>fill his head with 
 fish-spears,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He kept out of the reach of their instruments of slaughter, or, if they
 touched him, they could not touch him to the quick.

 7. That it was to no purpose to attempt it: <I>The hope of</I> taking
 <I>him is in vain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 If men go about to seize him, so formidable is he that the very sight 
 of him will appal them, and make a stout man ready to faint away: 
 <I>Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?</I> and will 
 not that deter the pursuers from their attempt? Job is told, at his 
 peril, to <I>lay his hand upon him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 "Touch him if thou dare; <I>remember the battle,</I> how unable thou
 art to encounter such a force, and what is therefore likely to be the 
 issue of the battle, <I>and do no more,</I> but desist from the 
 attempt." It is good to remember the battle before we engage in a war, 
 and put off the harness in time if we foresee it will be to no purpose 
 to gird it on. Job is hereby admonished not to proceed in his 
 controversy with God, but to make his peace with him, remembering what 
 the battle will certainly end in if he come to an engagement. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4,5">Isa. xxvii. 4, 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Thence he infers how unable he was to contend with the Almighty. 
 <I>None is so fierce,</I> none so fool-hardy, <I>that he dares</I> to 
 <I>stir up</I> the leviathan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 it being known that he will certainly be too hard for them; and <I>who 
 then is able to stand before God,</I> either to impeach and arraign his 
 proceedings or to out-face the power of his wrath? If the inferior 
 creatures that are put under the feet of man, and over whom he has 
 dominion, keep us in awe thus, how terrible must the majesty of our 
 great Lord be, who has a sovereign dominion over us and against whom 
 man has been so long in rebellion! <I>Who can stand before him when
 once he is angry?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Who hath prevented me, that I should repay <I>him? whatsoever
 is</I> under the whole heaven is mine.
 &nbsp; 12  I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely
 proportion.
 &nbsp; 13  Who can discover the face of his garment? <I>or</I> who can come
 <I>to him</I> with his double bridle?
 &nbsp; 14  Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth <I>are</I> terrible
 round about.
 &nbsp; 15  <I>His</I> scales <I>are his</I> pride, shut up together <I>as with</I> a
 close seal.
 &nbsp; 16  One is so near to another, that no air can come between
 them.
 &nbsp; 17  They are joined one to another, they stick together, that
 they cannot be sundered.
 &nbsp; 18  By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes <I>are</I> like
 the eyelids of the morning.
 &nbsp; 19  Out of his mouth go burning lamps, <I>and</I> sparks of fire leap
 out.
 &nbsp; 20  Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as <I>out</I> of a seething pot
 or caldron.
 &nbsp; 21  His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his
 mouth.
 &nbsp; 22  In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into
 joy before him.
 &nbsp; 23  The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm
 in themselves; they cannot be moved.
 &nbsp; 24  His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of
 the nether <I>millstone.</I>
 &nbsp; 25  When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason
 of breakings they purify themselves.
 &nbsp; 26  The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear,
 the dart, nor the habergeon.
 &nbsp; 27  He esteemeth iron as straw, <I>and</I> brass as rotten wood.
 &nbsp; 28  The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with
 him into stubble.
 &nbsp; 29  Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of
 a spear.
 &nbsp; 30  Sharp stones <I>are</I> under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed
 things upon the mire.
 &nbsp; 31  He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea
 like a pot of ointment.
 &nbsp; 32  He maketh a path to shine after him; <I>one</I> would think the
 deep <I>to be</I> hoary.
 &nbsp; 33  Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
 &nbsp; 34  He beholdeth all high <I>things:</I> he <I>is</I> a king over all the
 children of pride.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God, having in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:1-6">foregoing verses</A>

 shown Job how unable he was to deal with the leviathan, here sets forth
 his own power in that massy mighty creature. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God's sovereign dominion and independency laid down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 1. That he is indebted to none of his creatures. If any pretend he is
 indebted to them, let them make their demand and prove their debt, and 
 they shall receive it in full and not by composition: "<I>Who has 
 prevented me?</I>" that is, "who has laid any obligations upon me by 
 any services he has done me? Who can pretend to be before-hand with me? 
 If any were, I would not long be behind-hand with them; I would soon 
 repay them." The apostle quotes this for the silencing of all flesh in 
 God's presence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:35">Rom. xi. 35</A>.

 <I>Who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him
 again?</I> As God does not inflict upon us the evils we have deserved, 
 so he does bestow upon us the favours we have not deserved.

 2. That he is the rightful Lord and owner of all the creatures: 
 "<I>Whatsoever is under the whole heaven,</I> animate or inanimate, 
 <I>is mine</I> (and particularly this leviathan), at my command and 
 disposal, what I have an incontestable property in and dominion over." 
 All is his; we are his, all we have and do; and therefore we cannot 
 make God our debtor; but <I>of thy own, Lord, have we given thee.</I> 
 All is his, and therefore, if he were indebted to any, he has 
 wherewithal to repay them; the debt is in good hands. All is his, and 
 therefore he needs not our services, nor can he be benefited by them. 
 <I>If I were hungry I would not tell thee, for the world is mine and
 the fulness thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:12">Ps. l. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The proof and illustration of it, from the wonderful structure of 
 the leviathan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The parts of his body, the power he exerts, especially when he is 
 set upon, and the comely proportion of the whole of him, are what God 
 will not conceal, and therefore what we must observe and acknowledge 
 the power of God in. Though he is a creature of monstrous bulk, yet 
 there is in him a <I>comely proportion.</I> In our eye beauty lies in 
 that which is small (<I>inest sua gratia parvis</I>--<I>little things
 have a gracefulness all their own</I>) because we ourselves are so; but 
 in God's eye even the leviathan is comely; and, if he pronounce even 
 the whale, even the crocodile, so, it is not for us to say of any of
 the works of his hands that they are ugly of ill-favoured; it is enough 
 to say so, as we have cause, of our own works. God here goes about to 
 give us an anatomical view (as it were) of the leviathan; for his works 
 appear most beautiful and excellent, and his wisdom and power appear 
 most in them, when they are taken in pieces and viewed in their several 
 parts and proportions. 

 (1.) The leviathan, even <I>prima facie</I>--<I>at first sight,</I> 
 appears formidable and inaccessible, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Who dares come so near him while he is alive as to discover or take a 
 distinct view of <I>the face of the garment,</I> the skin with which he 
 is clothed as with a garment, so near him as to bridle him like a horse 
 and so lead him away, so near him as to be within reach of his jaws, 
 which are like <I>a double bridle?</I> Who will venture to look into 
 his mouth, as we do into a horse's mouth? He that <I>opens the doors of 
 his face</I> will see <I>his teeth terrible round about,</I> strong and 
 sharp, and fitted to devour; it would make a man tremble to think of 
 having a leg or an arm between them.

 (2.) <I>His scales are</I> his beauty and strength, and therefore 
 <I>his pride,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>.

 The crocodile is indeed remarkable for his scales; if we understand it
 of the whale, we must understand by these <I>shields</I> (for so the 
 word is) the several coats of his skin; or there might be whales in 
 that country with scales. That which is remarkable concerning the 
 scales is that <I>they stick</I> so close <I>together,</I> by which he 
 is not only kept warm, for no air can pierce him, but kept safe, for no 
 sword can pierce him through those scales. Fishes, that live in the 
 water, are fortified accordingly by the wisdom of Providence, which 
 gives clothes as it gives cold.

 (3.) He scatters terror with his very breath and looks; if he sneeze or 
 spout up water, it is like a light shining, either with the froth or 
 the light of the sun shining through it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 The eyes of the whale are reported to shine in the night-time like a 
 flame, or, as here, <I>like the eye-lids of the morning;</I> the same 
 they say of the crocodile. The breath of this creature is so hot and
 fiery, from the great natural heat within, that <I>burning lamps and 
 sparks of fire,</I> smoke and a flame, are said to <I>go out of his 
 mouth,</I> even such as one would think sufficient to set coals on 
 fire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:19-21"><I>v.</I> 19-21</A>.

 Probably these hyperbolical expressions are used concerning the 
 leviathan to intimate the terror of the wrath of God, for that is it 
 which all this is designed to convince us of. <I>Fire out of his mouth
 devours,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:7,8">Ps. xviii. 7, 8</A>.

 <I>The breath of the Almighty,</I> like a <I>stream of brimstone,
 kindles Tophet,</I> and will for ever keep it burning,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:33">Isa. xxx. 33</A>.

 The wicked one shall be <I>consumed with the breath of his mouth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:8">2 Thess. ii. 8</A>.

 (4.) He is of invincible strength and most terrible fierceness, so that
 he frightens all that come in his way, but is not himself frightened by 
 any. Take a view of his neck, and there remains strength, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 His head and his body are well set together. <I>Sorrow rejoices</I> (or 
 <I>rides in triumph) before him,</I> for he makes terrible work 
 wherever he comes. Or, Those storms which are the sorrow of others are
 his joys; what is tossing to others is dancing to him. His flesh is 
 well knit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 <I>The flakes</I> of it <I>are joined</I> so closely <I>together,</I> 
 and <I>are so firm,</I> that it is hard to pierce it; he is as if he 
 were all bone. <I>His flesh is of brass,</I> which Job had complained 
 his was not,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:12"><I>ch.</I> vi. 12</A>.
 
 <I>His heart is as firm as a stone,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.
 
 He has spirit equal to his bodily strength, and, though he is bulky, he
 is sprightly, and not unwieldy. As his flesh and skin cannot be 
 pierced, so his courage cannot be daunted; but, on the contrary, he 
 daunts all he meets and puts them into a consternation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>When he raises up himself</I> like a moving mountain in the great 
 waters even <I>the mighty are afraid</I> lest he should overturn their 
 ships or do them some other mischief. <I>By reason of the breakings</I> 
 he makes in the water, which threaten death, <I>they purify 
 themselves,</I> confess their sins, betake themselves to their prayers, 
 and get ready for death. We read

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:8"><I>ch.</I> iii. 8</A>)

 of those who, when they raise up a leviathan, are in such a fright that
 they curse the day. It was a fear which, it seems, used to drive some 
 to their curses and others to their prayers; for, as now, so then there 
 were seafaring men of different characters and on whom the terrors of 
 the sea have contrary effects; but all agree there is a great fright 
 among them when the leviathan raises up himself. 

 (5.) All the instruments of slaughter that are used against him do him 
 no hurt and therefore are not error to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:26-29"><I>v.</I> 26-29</A>.

 <I>The sword</I> and <I>the spear,</I> which wound nigh at hand, are 
 nothing to him; the <I>darts, arrows,</I> and <I>sling-stones,</I> 
 which wound at a distance, do him no damage; nature has so well armed 
 him <I>cap-a-pie--at all points,</I> against them all. The defensive 
 weapons which men use when they engage with the leviathan, as <I>the 
 habergeon,</I> or breast-plate, often serve men no more than their 
 offensive weapons; <I>iron and brass</I> are to him <I>as straw and 
 rotten wood,</I> and he laughs at them. It is the picture of a 
 hard-hearted sinner, that despises the terrors of the Almighty and 
 laughs at all the threatenings of his word. The leviathan so little 
 dreads the weapons that are used against him that, to show how hardy he 
 is, he chooses to lie on the <I>sharp stones, the sharp-pointed 
 things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 and lies as easy there as if he lay on the soft mire. Those that would 
 endure hardness must inure themselves to it.

 (6.) His very motion in the water troubles it and puts it into a
 ferment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:31,32"><I>v.</I> 31, 32</A>.

 When he rolls, and tosses, and makes a stir in the water, or is in 
 pursuit of his prey, <I>he makes the deep to boil like a pot,</I> he 
 raises a great froth and foam upon the water, such as is upon a boiling 
 pot, especially <I>a pot of</I> boiling <I>ointment;</I> and <I>he 
 makes a path to shine after him,</I> which even <I>a ship in the midst 
 of the sea</I> does not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:19">Prov. xxx. 19</A>.

 One may trace the leviathan under water by the bubbles on the surface;
 and yet who can take that advantage against him in pursuing him? Men 
 track hares in the snow and kill them, but he that tracks the leviathan 
 dares not come near him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Having given this particular account of <I>his parts, and his power, 
 and his comely proportion,</I> he concludes with four things in general 
 concerning this animal:--

 (1.) That he is a non-such among the inferior creatures: <I>Upon earth 
 there is not his like,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 No creature in this world is comparable to him for strength and terror. 
 Or the earth is here distinguished from the sea: <I>His dominion is not 
 upon the earth</I> (so some), but <I>in the waters.</I> None of all the 
 savage creatures upon earth come near him for bulk and strength, and it 
 is well for man that he is confined to the waters and there has <I>a 
 watch set upon him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:12"><I>ch.</I> vii. 12</A>)

 by the divine Providence, for, if such a terrible creature were allowed
 to roam and ravage upon this earth, it would be an unsafe and 
 uncomfortable habitation for the children of men, for whom it is 
 intended. 

 (2.) That he is more bold and daring than any other creature 
 whatsoever: He <I>is made without fear.</I> The creatures are as they 
 are made; the leviathan has courage in his constitution, nothing can 
 frighten him; other creatures, quite contrary, seem as much designed 
 for flying as this for fighting. So, among men, some are in their 
 natural temper bold, others are timorous.

 (3.) That he is himself very proud; though lodged in the deep, yet 
 <I>he beholds all high things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 The rolling waves, the impending rocks, the hovering clouds, and the 
 ships under sail with top and top-gallant, this mighty animal beholds 
 with contempt, for he does not think they either lessen him or threaten 
 him. Those that are great are apt to be scornful.

 (4.) <I>That he is a king over all the children of pride,</I> that is, 
 he is the proudest of all proud ones. He has more to be proud of (so 
 Mr. Caryl expounds it) than the proudest people in the world have; and
 so it is a mortification to the haughtiness and lofty looks of men.
 Whatever bodily accomplishments men are proud of, and puffed up with, 
 the leviathan excels them and is a <I>king over them.</I> Some read it 
 so as to understand it of God: <I>He that beholds all high things, even 
 he, is King over all the children of pride;</I> he can tame the 
 behemoth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:19"><I>ch.</I> xl. 19</A>)

 and the leviathan, big as they are, and stout-hearted as they are. This
 discourse concerning those two animals was brought in to prove that it
 is God only who can <I>look upon proud men and abase them, bring them
 low</I> and <I>tread them down,</I> and <I>hide them in the dust</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:11-13"><I>ch.</I> xl. 11-13</A>),

 and so it concludes with a <I>quod erat demonstrandum--which was to be
 demonstrated;</I> there is one that <I>beholds all high things,</I>
 and, wherein men deal proudly, is above them; he is <I>King over all
 the children of pride,</I> whether brutal or rational, and can make
 them all either bend or break before him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:11">Isa. ii. 11</A>.

 <I>The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men
 shall be bowed down, and</I> thus <I>the Lord alone shall be 
 exalted.</I></P>
