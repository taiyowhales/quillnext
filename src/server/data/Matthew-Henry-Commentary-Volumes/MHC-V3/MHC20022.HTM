 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  A <I>good</I> name <I>is</I> rather to be chosen than great riches,
 <I>and</I> loving favour rather than silver and gold.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are two things which are more valuable and which we should covet 
 more than great riches:--

 1. To be well spoken of: <I>A name</I> (that is, <I>a good name,</I> a 
 name for good things with God and good people) <I>is rather to be 
 chosen than great riches;</I> that is, we should be more careful to do 
 that by which we may get and keep a good name than that by which we may 
 raise and increase a great estate. Great riches bring great cares with 
 them, expose men to danger, and add no real value to a man. A fool and 
 a knave may have <I>great riches,</I> but <I>a good name</I> makes a 
 man easy and safe, supposes a man wise and honest, redounds to the 
 glory of God, and gives a man a greater opportunity of doing good. By 
 great riches we may relieve the bodily wants of others, but by a good 
 name we may recommend religion to them.  

 2. To be well beloved, to have an interest in the esteem and affections
 of all about us; this is better <I>than silver and gold.</I> Christ has 
 neither silver nor gold, but he <I>grew in favour with God and man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:52">Luke ii. 52</A>.

 This should teach us to look with a holy contempt upon the wealth of
 this world, not to set our hearts upon that, but with all possible care 
 to <I>think of those things that are lovely and of good report,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:8">Phil.  iv. 8</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  The rich and poor meet together: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> the maker of
 them all.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Among the children of men divine Providence has so ordered it that 
 some are <I>rich</I> and others <I>poor,</I> and these are intermixed 
 in societies: <I>The Lord is the Maker of both,</I> both the author of 
 their being and the disposer of their lot. The greatest man in the 
 world must acknowledge God to be his Maker, and is under the same 
 obligations to be subject to him that the meanest is; and the poorest 
 has the honour to be the work of God's hands as much as the greatest. 
 <I>Have they not all one Father?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:10,Job+31:15">Mal. ii. 10; Job xxxi. 15</A>.

 God makes some rich, that they may be charitable to the poor, and 
 others poor, that they may be serviceable to the rich; and they have 
 need of one another,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:21">1 Cor. xii. 21</A>.

 He make some poor, to exercise their patience, and contentment, and
 dependence upon God, and others rich, to exercise their thankfulness 
 and beneficence. Even <I>the poor</I> we <I>have always with</I> us; 
 they shall never cease out of the land, nor the rich neither. 

 2.  Notwithstanding the distance that is in many respects between
 <I>rich and poor,</I> yet in most things they <I>meet together,</I> 
 especially before <I>the Lord,</I> who <I>is the Maker of them all,</I> 
 and <I>regards not the rich more than the poor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:19">Job xxxiv. 19</A>.

 <I>Rich and poor meet together</I> at the bar of God's justice, all 
 guilty before God, concluded under sin, and shapen in iniquity, the 
 rich as much as the poor; and they meet at the throne of God's grace; 
 the poor are as welcome there as the rich. There is the same Christ, 
 the same scripture, the same Spirit, the same covenant of promises, for 
 them both. There is the same heaven for poor saints that there is for 
 rich: Lazarus is in the bosom of Abraham. And there is the same hell 
 for rich sinners that there is for poor.  All stand upon the same level 
 before God, as they do also in the grave. <I>The small and great are 
 there.</I></P>

 <A NAME="Pr22_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  A prudent <I>man</I> foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but
 the simple pass on, and are punished.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. The benefit of wisdom and consideration: <I>A prudent man,</I> by
 the help of his prudence, will <I>foresee an evil,</I> before it comes, 
 <I>and hide himself;</I> he will be aware when he is entering into a 
 temptation and will put on his armour and stand on his guard. When the 
 clouds are gathering for a storm he takes the warning, and flies to the 
 name of the Lord as his strong tower. Noah foresaw the deluge, Joseph 
 the years of famine, and provided accordingly. 

 2. The mischief of rashness and inconsideration. <I>The simple,</I> who
 believe every word that flatters them, will believe none that warns 
 them, and so they <I>pass on and are punished.</I> They venture upon 
 sin, though they are told what will be in the end thereof; they throw 
 themselves into trouble, notwithstanding the fair warning given them, 
 and they repent their presumption when it is too late. See an instance 
 of both these,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:20,21">Exod. ix. 20, 21</A>.

 Nothing is so fatal to precious souls as this, they will not take
 warning.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  By humility <I>and</I> the fear of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>are</I> riches, and
 honour, and life.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. Wherein religion does very much consist--in <I>humility and the fear
 of the Lord;</I> that is, walking humbly with God. We must so reverence 
 God's majesty and authority as to submit with all humility to the 
 commands of his word and the disposals of his providence. We must have 
 such low thoughts of ourselves as to behave humbly towards God and man. 
 Where the fear of God is there will be humility. 

 2. What is to be gotten by it--<I>riches, and honour,</I> and comfort,
 <I>and</I> long life, in this world, as far as God sees good, at least 
 spiritual <I>riches and honour</I> in the favour of God, and the 
 promises and privileges of the covenant of grace, <I>and</I> eternal 
 <I>life</I> at last.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr22_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Thorns <I>and</I> snares <I>are</I> in the way of the froward: he that
 doth keep his soul shall be far from them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note 

 1. The way of sin is vexatious and dangerous: <I>In the way of the
 froward,</I> that crooked way, which is contrary to the will and word 
 of God, <I>thorns and snares are</I> found, thorns of grief for past 
 sins and snares entangling them in further sin. He that makes no 
 conscience of what he says and does will find himself hampered by that 
 imaginary liberty, and tormented by his pleasures. Froward people, who 
 are soon angry, expose themselves to trouble at every step. Every thing 
 will fret and vex him that will fret and vex at every thing. 

 2. The way of duty is safe and easy: <I>He that keeps his soul,</I>
 that watches carefully over his own heart and ways, is <I>far from</I> 
 those <I>thorns and snares,</I> for his way is both plain and 
 pleasant.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr22_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old,
 he will not depart from it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A great duty enjoined, particularly to those that are the parents
 and instructors of children, in order to the propagating of wisdom, 
 that it may not die with them: <I>Train up children</I> in that age of 
 vanity, to keep them from the sins and snares of it, in that learning 
 age, to prepare them for what they are designed for.  <I>Catechise</I> 
 them; initiate them; keep them under discipline.  <I>Train</I> them as 
 soldiers, who are taught to handle their arms, keep rank, and observe 
 the word of command. <I>Train</I> them up, not in the way they would go 
 (the bias of their corrupt hearts would draw them aside), but <I>in the 
 way they should go,</I> the way in which, if you love them, you would 
 have them go. <I>Train up a child according as he is capable</I> (as 
 some take it), with a gentle hand, as nurses feed children, little and 
 often, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:7">Deut. vi. 7</A>.

 2. A good reason for it, taken from the great advantage of this care
 and pains with children: When they <I>grow up,</I> when they <I>grow 
 old,</I> it is to be hoped, they <I>will not depart from it.</I> Good 
 impressions made upon them then will abide upon them all their days. 
 Ordinarily the vessel retains the savour with which it was first 
 seasoned. Many indeed have departed from the good way in which they 
 were trained up; Solomon himself did so. But early training may be a 
 means of their recovering themselves, as it is supposed Solomon did. At 
 least the parents will have the comfort of having done their duty and 
 used the means.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr22_7"> </A>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower <I>is</I> servant
 to the lender.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.),

 <I>Rich and poor meet together;</I> but here he finds, here he shows,
 that, as to the things of this life, there is a great difference; for,

 1. Those that have little will be in subjection to those that have
 much, because they have dependence upon them, they have received, and 
 expect to receive, support from them: <I>The rich rule over the 
 poor,</I> and too often more than becomes them, with pride and rigour, 
 unlike to God, who, though he be great, yet despises not any. It is 
 part of the affliction of the poor that they must expect to be trampled 
 upon, and part of their duty to be serviceable, as far as they can, to 
 those that are kind to them, and study to be grateful.  

 2. Those that are but going behindhand find themselves to lie much at
 the mercy of those that are before hand: <I>The borrower is servant to 
 the lender,</I> is obliged to him, and must sometimes beg, <I>Have 
 patience with me.</I> Therefore it is part of Israel's promised 
 happiness that they should lend and borrow,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:12">Deut. xxviii. 12</A>.

 And it should be our endeavour to keep as much as may be out of debt.
 Some sell their liberty to gratify their luxury.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his
 anger shall fail.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Ill-gotten gains will not prosper: <I>He that sows iniquity,</I> 
 that does an unjust thing in hopes to get by it, <I>shall reap 
 vanity;</I> what he gets will never do him any good nor give him any 
 satisfaction. He will meet nothing but disappointment. Those that 
 create trouble to others do but prepare trouble for themselves. Men 
 shall reap as they sow. 

 2. Abused power will not last. If the rod of authority turn into a 
 <I>rod of anger,</I> if men rule by passion instead of prudence, and, 
 instead of the public welfare, aim at nothing so much as the gratifying 
 of their own resentments, it <I>shall fail</I> and be broken, and their 
 power shall not bear them out in their exorbitances,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth
 of his bread to the poor.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The description of a charitable man; he has a <I>bountiful eye,</I>
 opposed to the evil eye

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:6"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 6</A>)

 and the same with the <I>single eye</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:22">Matt. vi. 22</A>),--

 an eye that seeks out objects of charity, besides those that offer 
 themselves,--an eye that, upon the sight of one in want and misery, 
 affects the heart with compassion,--an eye that with the alms gives a 
 pleasant look, which makes the alms doubly acceptable.  He has also a 
 liberal hand: <I>He gives of his bread</I> to those that need--<I>his 
 bread,</I> the bread appointed for his own eating. He will rather 
 abridge himself than see the poor perish for want; yet he does not give 
 all <I>his bread,</I> but <I>of his bread;</I> the poor shall have 
 their share with his own family.

 2. The blessedness of such a man.  The loins of the poor will bless 
 them, all about him will speak well of him, and God himself will bless 
 him, in answer to many a good prayer put up for him, and he <I>shall be 
 blessed.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea,
 strife and reproach shall cease.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. What <I>the scorner</I> does. It is implied that he sows discord and 
 makes mischief wherever he comes. Much of the <I>strife and 
 contention</I> which disturb the peace of all societies is owing to 
 <I>the evil interpreter</I> (as some read it), that construes every 
 thing into the worst, to those that despise and deride every one that 
 comes in their way and take a pride in bantering and abusing all 
 mankind. 

 2. What is to be done with the scorner that will not be reclaimed: 
 <I>Cast</I> him <I>out</I> of your society, as Ishmael, when he mocked 
 Isaac, was thrust out of Abraham's family. Those that would secure the 
 peace must exclude the scorner.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  He that loveth pureness of heart, <I>for</I> the grace of his
 lips the king <I>shall be</I> his friend.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The qualification of an accomplished, a complete gentleman, that is 
 fit to be employed in public business. He must be an honest man, a man 
 <I>that loves pureness of heart</I> and hates all impurity, not only 
 pure from all fleshly lusts, but from all deceit and dissimulation, 
 from all selfishness and sinister designs, that takes care to approve 
 himself a man of sincerity, is just and fair from principle, and 
 delights in nothing more than in keeping his own conscience clean and 
 void of offence. He must also be able to speak with a good grace, not 
 to daub and flatter, but to deliver his sentiments decently and 
 ingeniously, in language clean and smooth as his spirit. 

 2. The preferment such a man stands fair for: <I>The king,</I> if he be 
 wise and good, and understand his own and his people's interest, 
 <I>will be his friend,</I> will make him of his cabinet-council, as 
 there was one in David's court, and another in Solomon's, that was 
 called the <I>king's friend;</I> or, in any business that he has, the 
 king will befriend him. Some understand it of the King of kings. A man 
 <I>in whose spirit there is no guile,</I> and whose speech is always 
 with grace, God will be his friend, Messiah, the Prince, will be his 
 friend.  <I>This honour have all the saints.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  The eyes of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth
 the words of the transgressor.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The special care God takes to <I>preserve knowledge,</I> that is, to 
 keep up religion in the world by keeping up among men the knowledge of 
 himself and of good and evil, notwithstanding the corruption of 
 mankind, and the artifices of Satan to blind men's minds and keep them 
 in ignorance. It is a wonderful instance of the power and goodness of 
 <I>the eyes of the Lord,</I> that is, his watchful providence. He 
 preserves <I>men of knowledge,</I> wise and good men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:9">2 Chron. xvi. 9</A>),
 
 particularly faithful witnesses, who speak what they know; God protects 
 such, and prospers their counsels. He does by his grace <I>preserve 
 knowledge</I> in such, secures his own work and interest in them. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:7,8">Prov. ii. 7, 8</A>.

 2. The just vengeance God takes on those that speak and act against 
 knowledge and against the interests of knowledge and religion in the 
 world: <I>He overthrows the words of the transgressor,</I> and 
 <I>preserves knowledge</I> in spite of him. He defeats all the counsels 
 and designs of false and treacherous men, and turns them to their own 
 confusion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Those that have no love for their business will never want excuses 
 to shake it off. Multitudes are ruined, both for soul and body, by 
 their slothfulness, and yet still they have something or other to say 
 for themselves, so ingenious are men in putting a cheat upon their own 
 souls. And who, I pray, will be the gainer at last, when the pretences 
 will be all rejected as vain and frivolous? 

 2. Many frighten themselves from real duties by imaginary difficulties: 
 <I>The slothful man</I> has work to do <I>without</I> in the fields, 
 but he fancies <I>there is a lion</I> there; nay, he pretends he dares 
 not go along the streets for fear somebody or other should meet him and 
 kill him. He does not himself think so; he only says so to those that 
 call him up. He talks of <I>a lion without,</I> but considers not his 
 real danger from the devil, that <I>roaring lion,</I> which is in bed 
 with him, and from his own slothfulness, which kills him.</P>

 This is designed to warn all young men against the lusts of 
 uncleanness. As they regard the welfare of their souls, let them take 
 heed of <I>strange women,</I> lewd women, whom they ought to be strange 
 to, of <I>the mouth of strange women,</I> of the kisses of their lips 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:13"><I>ch.</I> vii. 13</A>),

 of the words of their lips, their charms and enticements.  Dread them;
 have nothing to do with them; for, 

 1. Those who abandon themselves to that sin give proof that they are
 abandoned of God: it <I>is a deep pit,</I> which those <I>fall</I> into 
 that are <I>abhorred of the Lord,</I> who leaves them to themselves to 
 enter into that temptation, and takes off the bridle of his restraining 
 grace, to punish them for other sins. Value not thyself upon thy being 
 in favour with such women, when it proclaims thee under the wrath of 
 God. 

 2. It is seldom that they recover themselves, for it <I>is a deep 
 pit;</I> it will be hard getting out of it, it so besots the mind and 
 debauches the conscience, by pleasing the flesh.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  Foolishness <I>is</I> bound in the heart of a child; <I>but</I> the
 rod of correction shall drive it far from him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here two very sad considerations:--

 1. That corruption is woven into our nature. Sin is <I>foolishness;</I>
 it is contrary both to our right reason and to our true interest. It 
 <I>is in the heart;</I> there is an inward inclination to sin, to speak 
 and act foolishly. It <I>is in the heart of children;</I> they bring it 
 into the world with them; it is what they were shapen and conceived in. 
 It is not only <I>found</I> there, but it is <I>bound</I> there; it is 
 annexed to the heart (so some); vicious dispositions cleave closely to 
 the soul, are bound to it as the cion to the stock into which it is 
 grafted, which quite alters the property. There is a knot tied between 
 the soul and sin, a true lover's knot; they two became one flesh. It is 
 true of ourselves, it is true of our children, whom we have begotten in 
 our own likeness. <I>O God! thou knowest</I> this <I>foolishness.</I> 
 
 2. That correction is necessary to the cure of it. It will not be got 
 out by fair means and gentle methods; there must be strictness and 
 severity, and that which will cause grief. Children need to be 
 corrected, and kept under discipline, by their parents; and we all need 
 to be corrected by our heavenly Father 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:6,7">Heb. xii. 6, 7</A>),

 and under the correction we must stroke down folly and kiss the 
 rod.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  He that oppresseth the poor to increase his <I>riches, and</I> he
 that giveth to the rich, <I>shall</I> surely <I>come</I> to want.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This shows what evil courses rich men sometimes take, by which, in the 
 end, they will impoverish themselves and provoke God, notwithstanding 
 their abundance, to bring them to want; they <I>oppress the poor and 
 give to the rich.</I> 

 1. They will not in charity relieve the poor, but withhold from them,
 that by saving that which is really the best, but which they think the 
 most needless part of their expenses, they may <I>increase their 
 riches;</I> but they will make presents <I>to the rich,</I> and give 
 them great entertainments, either in pride and vain-glory, that they 
 may look great, or in policy, that they may receive it again with 
 advantage. Such <I>shall surely come to want.</I> Many have been 
 beggared by a foolish generosity, but never any by a prudent charity. 
 Christ bids us to invite the poor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:12,13">Luke xiv. 12, 13</A>.

 2.  They not only will not relieve <I>the poor,</I> but they 
 <I>oppress</I> them, rob the spital, extort from their poor tenants and 
 neighbours, invade the rights of those who have not wherewithal to 
 defend themselves, and then <I>give</I> bribes <I>to the rich,</I> to 
 protect and countenance them in it. But it is all in vain; they 
 <I>shall come to want.</I> Those that rob God, and so make him the 
 enemy, cannot secure themselves by <I>giving to the rich,</I> to make 
 them their friends.</P>

 Solomon here changes his style and manner of speaking. Hitherto, for
 the most part, since the beginning of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:1"><I>ch.</I> x.</A>,

 he had laid down doctrinal truths, and but now and then dropped a word
 of exhortation, leaving us to make the application as we went along; 
 but here, to the end of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:17-24:34"><I>ch.</I> xxiv.</A>,

 he directs his speech to his son, his pupil, his reader, his hearer,
 speaking as to a particular person.  Hitherto, for the most part, his 
 sense was comprised in one verse, but here usually it is drawn out 
 further. See how Wisdom tries variety of methods with us, lest we 
 should be cloyed with any one. To awaken attention and to assist our 
 application the method of direct address is here adopted.  Ministers 
 must not think it enough to preach before their hearers, but must 
 preach to them, nor enough to preach to them all in general, but should 
 address themselves to particular persons, as here: Do <I>thou</I> do so 
 and so. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An earnest exhortation to get wisdom and grace, by attending to 
 <I>the words of the wise</I> men, both written and preached, the words 
 of the prophets and priests, and particularly to that <I>knowledge</I> 
 which Solomon in this book gives men of good and evil, sin and duty, 
 rewards and punishments. To these <I>words,</I> to this 
 <I>knowledge,</I> the ear must be <I>bowed down</I> in humility and 
 serious attention and the heart <I>applied</I> by faith, and love, and 
 close consideration. The ear will not serve without the heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Arguments to enforce this exhortation.  Consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The worth and weight of the things themselves which Solomon in this 
 book gives us the <I>knowledge</I> of. They are not trivial things, for 
 amusements and diversion, not jocular proverbs, to be repeated in sport 
 and in order to pass away time. No; they are <I>excellent things,</I> 
 which concern the glory of God, the holiness and happiness of our 
 souls, the welfare of mankind and all communities; they are <I>princely 
 things</I> (so the word is), fit for kings to speak and senates to 
 hear; they are things that concern <I>counsels and knowledge,</I> that 
 is, wise counsels, relating to the most important concerns; things 
 which will not only make us knowing ourselves, but enable us to advise 
 others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The clearness of the discovery of these things and the directing of 
 them to us in particular. "They are <I>made known,</I> publicly known, 
 that all may read,--plainly known, that he that runs may read,--<I>made
 known this day</I> more fully than ever before, in this day of light 
 and knowledge,--<I>made known in this thy day.</I> But it is only a
 little while that this light is with thee; perhaps the things that are 
 <I>this day made known to thee,</I> if thou improve not the day of thy 
 visitation, may, before to-morrow, be <I>hidden from thy eyes.</I> They 
 are <I>written,</I> for the greater certainty, and that they may be 
 received and the more safely transmitted pure and entire to posterity. 
 But that which the emphasis is here most laid upon is that they are 
 <I>made known to thee, even to thee,</I> and <I>written to thee,</I> as 
 if it were a letter directed to thee by name. It is suited to thee and 
 to thy case; thou mayest in this glass see thy own face; it is intended 
 for thee, to be a rule to thee, and by it thou must be judged." We 
 cannot say of these things, "They are good things, but they are nothing 
 to us;" no, they are of the greatest concern imaginable to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The agreeableness of these things to us, in respect both of comfort 
 and credit. 

 (1.) If we hide them in our hearts, they will be very pleasing and
 yield us an abundant satisfaction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>It is a pleasant thing,</I> and will be thy constant entertainment, 
 <I>if thou keep them within thee;</I> if thou digest them, and be 
 actuated and governed by them, and delivered into them as into a 
 mould." The form of godliness, when that is rested in, is but a force 
 put upon a man, and he does but do penance in that white clothing; 
 those only that submit to the power of godliness, and make heart-work 
 of it, find the pleasure of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:10"><I>ch.</I> ii. 10</A>.

 (2.) If we make use of them in our discourse, they will be very
 becoming, and gain us a good reputation. <I>They shall be fitted in thy 
 lips.</I> "Speak of these things, and thou speakest like thyself, and 
 as is fit for thee to speak considering thy character; thou wilt also 
 have pleasure in speaking of these things as well as in thinking of 
 them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The advantage designed us by them. The <I>excellent things</I> which 
 God has <I>written to</I> us are not like the commands which the master 
 gives his servant, which are all intended for the benefit of the 
 master, but like those which the master gives his scholar, which are 
 all intended for the benefit of the scholar. These things must be kept 
 by us, for they are written to us, 

 (1.) That we may have a confidence in him and communion with him.
 <I>That thy trust may be in the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+22:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 We cannot trust in God except in the way of duty; we are
 <I>therefore</I> taught our duty, that we may have reason to trust in 
 God. Nay, this is itself one great duty we are to learn, and a duty 
 that is the foundation of all practical religion, to live a life of 
 delight in God and dependence on him.

 (2.) That we may have a satisfaction in our own judgment: "<I>That I 
 might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth;</I> that thou 
 mayest know what is truth, mayest plainly distinguish between it and 
 falsehood, and mayest know upon what grounds thou receivest and 
 believest the truths of God." Note,

 [1.] It is a desirable thing to know, not only <I>the words of
 truth,</I> but <I>the certainty of</I> them, that our faith may be 
 intelligent and rational, and may grow up to a full assurance. 

 [2.] The way to <I>know the certainty of the words of truth</I> is to 
 make conscience of our duty; for, <I>if any man do his will, he shall 
 know</I> for certain that the doctrine is of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>.

 (3.) That we may be useful and serviceable to others for their 
 instruction: "<I>That thou mayest</I> give a good account <I>of the 
 words of truth to those that send to thee</I> to consult thee as an 
 oracle," or (as the margin reads it) "<I>to those that send thee,</I> 
 that employ thee as an agent or ambassador in any business." Knowledge 
 is given us to do good with, that others may light their candle at our 
 lamp, and that we may in our place serve our generation according to 
 the will of God; and those who make conscience of keeping God's 
 commandments will be best able to <I>give a reason of the hope that is 
 in</I> them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  Rob not the poor, because he <I>is</I> poor: neither oppress the
 afflicted in the gate:
 &nbsp; 23  For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of
 those that spoiled them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After this solemn preface, one would have expected something new and 
 surprising; but no; here is a plain and common, but very needful 
 caution against the barbarous and inhuman practices of oppressing poor 
 people.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The sin itself, and that is <I>robbing the poor</I> and making them 
 poorer, taking from those that have but little to lose and so leaving 
 them nothing. It is bad to rob any man, but most absurd to rob the 
 poor, whom we should relieve,--to squeeze those with our power whom we
 should water with our bounty,--<I>to oppress the afflicted,</I> and so
 to add affliction to them,--to give judgment against them, and so to
 patronise those that do rob them, which is as bad as if we robbed them 
 ourselves. Rich men will not suffer themselves to be wronged; poor men 
 cannot help themselves, and therefore we ought to be the more careful 
 not to wrong them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The aggravations of the sin. 

 1. If their inability, by reason of their poverty, to right themselves,
 embolden us to rob them, it is so much the worse; this is <I>robbing 
 the poor because he is poor;</I> this is not only a base and cowardly 
 thing, to take advantage against a man because he is helpless, but it 
 is unnatural, and proves men worse than beasts. 

 2. Or, if it be done under the colour of law and justice, that is 
 oppressing <I>the afflicted in the gate,</I> where they ought to be 
 protected from wrong and to have justice done them against those that 
 oppress them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The danger that attends this sin. He that robs and oppresses the 
 poor does it at his peril; for, 

 1. The oppressed will find God their powerful patron. He <I>will plead
 their cause,</I> and not suffer them to be run down and trampled upon. 
 If men will not appear for them, God will. 

 2. The oppressors will find him a just avenger. He will make reprisals 
 upon them, will <I>spoil the souls of those that spoil them;</I> he 
 will repay them in spiritual judgments, in curses to their souls. He 
 that robs the poor will be found in the end a murderer of himself.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr22_25"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man
 thou shalt not go:
 &nbsp; 25  Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 1. A good caution against being intimate with a passionate man. It is 
 the law of friendship that we accommodate ourselves to our friends and 
 be ready to serve them, and therefore we ought to be wise and wary in 
 the choice of a friend, that we come not under the sacred tie to any 
 one whom it would be our folly to accommodate ourselves to. Though we
 must be civil to all, yet we must be careful whom we lay in our bosoms 
 and contract a familiarity with. And, among others, a man who is easily 
 provoked, touchy, and apt to resent affronts, who, when he is in a 
 passion, cares not what he says or does, but grows outrageous, such a 
 one is not fit to be made a friend or companion, for he will be ever 
 and anon angry with us and that will be our trouble, and he will expect 
 that we should, like him, be angry with others, and that will be our 
 sin. 

 2. Good cause given for this caution: <I>Lest thou learn his way.</I> 
 Those we go with we are apt to grow like. Our corrupt hearts have so 
 much tinder in them that it is dangerous conversing with those that 
 throw about the sparks of their passion. We shall thereby <I>get a 
 snare to our souls,</I> for a disposition to anger is a great snare to 
 any man, and an occasion of much sin. He does not say, "Lest thou have 
 ill language given thee or get a broken head," but, which is much
 worse, "Lest thou imitate him, to humour him, and so contract an ill 
 habit."</P>

 <A NAME="Pr22_26"> </A>
 <A NAME="Pr22_27"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>26  Be not thou <I>one</I> of them that strike hands, <I>or</I> of them
 that are sureties for debts.
 &nbsp; 27  If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed
 from under thee?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here, as often before, a caution against suretiship, as a thing 
 both imprudent and unjust. 

 1. We must not associate ourselves, nor contract an intimacy, with men
 of broken fortunes, and reputations, who need and will urge their 
 friends to be bound for them, that they may cheat their neighbours to 
 feed their lusts, and by keeping up a little longer may do the more 
 damage at last to those that give them credit.  Have nothing to do with 
 such; be not thou among them. 

 2. We must not cheat people of their money, by <I>striking hands</I> 
 ourselves, or <I>becoming surety for others,</I> when we <I>have not to 
 pay.</I> If a man by the divine providence is disabled to pay his 
 debts, he ought to be pitied and helped; but he that takes up money or 
 goods himself, or is bound for another, when he knows that he has not 
 wherewithal to pay, or that what he has is so settled that the 
 creditors cannot come at it, does in effect pick his neighbour's 
 pocket, and though, in all cases, compassion is to be used, yet he may 
 thank himself if the law have its course and his <I>bed</I> be <I>taken 
 from under him,</I> which might be taken for a pledge to secure a debt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:26,27">Exod. xxii. 26, 27</A>.

 For, if a man appeared to be so poor that he had nothing else to give 
 for security, he ought to be relieved, and it was honestly done to own 
 it; but, for the recovery of a debt, it seems it might be taken by the 
 <I>summum jus</I>--<I>the strict operation of law.</I> 3.  We must not 
 ruin our own estates and families. Every man ought to be just to 
 himself and to his wife and children; those are not so who live above 
 what they have, who by the mismanagement of their own affairs, or by 
 encumbering themselves with debts of others, waste what they have and 
 bring themselves to poverty. We may <I>take joyfully the spoiling of 
 our goods</I> if it be for the testimony of a good conscience; but, if 
 be for our own rashness and folly, we cannot but take it heavily.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr22_28"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We are here taught not to invade another man's right, though we can 
 find ways of doing it ever so secretly and plausibly, clandestinely and 
 by fraud, without any open force. Let not property in general be 
 entrenched upon, by robbing men of their liberties and privileges, or 
 of any just ways of maintaining them. Let not the property of 
 particular persons be encroached upon. The land-marks, or meer-stones, 
 are standing witnesses to every man's right; let not those be removed 
 quite away, for thence come wars, and fightings, and endless disputes; 
 let them not be removed so as to take from thy neighbour's lot to thy 
 own, for that is downright robbing him and entailing the fraud upon 
 posterity. 

 2. We may infer hence that a deference is to be paid, in all civil 
 matters, to usages that have prevailed time out of mind and the settled 
 constitutions of government, in which it becomes us to acquiesce, lest 
 an attempt to change it, under pretence of changing it for the better, 
 prove of dangerous consequence.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr22_29"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>29  Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand
 before kings; he shall not stand before mean <I>men.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A plain intimation what a hard thing it is to find a truly ingenious
 industrious man: "<I>Seest thou a man diligent in his business?</I> 
 Thou wilt not see many such, so epidemical are dulness and 
 slothfulness." He is here commended who lays out himself to get 
 business, though it be but in a very low and narrow sphere, and is not 
 easy when he is out of business, who loves business, is quick and 
 active in it, and goes through it, not only with constancy and 
 resolution, but with dexterity and expedition, a man of despatch, who 
 knows how to bring a deal of business into a little compass. 

 2. A moral prognostication of the preferment of such a man; though now 
 he <I>stands before mean men,</I> is employed by them and attends upon 
 them, yet he will rise, and is likely enough to <I>stand before 
 kings,</I> as an ambassador to foreign kings or prime-minister of state 
 to his own. <I>Seest thou a man diligent</I> in the business of 
 religion? He is likely to excel in virtue, and shall stand before the 
 King of kings.</P>
