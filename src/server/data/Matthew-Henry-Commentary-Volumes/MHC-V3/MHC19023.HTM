 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Many of David's psalms are full of complaints, but this is full of 
 comforts, and the expressions of delight in God's great goodness and 
 dependence upon him. It is a psalm which has been sung by good 
 Christians, and will be while the world stands, with a great deal of 
 pleasure and satisfaction. 

 I. The psalmist here claims relation to God, as his shepherd, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:1">ver. 1</A>.
 
 II. He recounts his experience of the kind things God had done for him
 as his shepherd, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:2,3,5">ver. 2, 3, 5</A>.

 III. Hence he infers that he should want no good

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:1">ver. 1</A>),

 that he needed to fear no evil 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:4">ver. 4</A>),

 that God would never leave nor forsake him in a way of mercy; and 
 therefore he resolves never to leave nor forsake God in a way of duty,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:6">ver. 6</A>.

 In this he had certainly an eye, not only to the blessings of God's 
 providence, which made his outward condition prosperous, but to the 
 communications of God's grace, received by a lively faith, and returned 
 in a warm devotion, which filled his soul with joy unspeakable. And, as 
 in the foregoing psalm he represented Christ dying for his sheep, so 
 here he represents Christians receiving the benefit of all the care and 
 tenderness of that great and good shepherd.</P>

 <P>A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> my shepherd; I shall not
 want.
 &nbsp; 2  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me
 beside the still waters.
 &nbsp; 3  He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of
 righteousness for his name's sake.
 &nbsp; 4  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
 I will fear no evil: for thou <I>art</I> with me; thy rod and thy
 staff they comfort me.
 &nbsp; 5  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine
 enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
 &nbsp; 6  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
 life: and I will dwell in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> for ever.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 From three very comfortable premises David, in this psalm, draws three 
 very comfortable conclusions, and teaches us to do so too. We are saved 
 by hope, and that hope will not make us ashamed, because it is well 
 grounded. It is the duty of Christians to encourage themselves in the 
 Lord their God; and we are here directed to take that encouragement 
 both from the relation wherein he stands to us and from the experience 
 we have had of his goodness according to that relation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. From God's being his shepherd he infers that he shall not want 
 anything that is good for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 See here,

 1. The great care that God takes of believers. He is their shepherd,
 and they may call him so. Time was when David was himself a shepherd;
 he was taken from following the ewes great with young

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:70,71">Ps. lxxviii. 70, 71</A>),

 and so he knew by experience the cares and tender affections of a good
 shepherd towards his flock. He remembered what need they had of a
 shepherd, and what a kindness it was to them to have one that was 
 skilful and faithful; he once ventured his life to rescue a lamb. By 
 this therefore he illustrates God's care of his people; and to this our 
 Saviour seems to refer when he says, <I>I am the shepherd of the sheep; 
 the good shepherd,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:11">John x. 11</A>.

 He that is the shepherd of Israel, of the whole church in general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:1">Ps. lxxx. 1</A>),

 is the shepherd of every particular believer; the meanest is not below
 his cognizance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:11">Isa. xl. 11</A>.

 He takes them into his fold, and then takes care of them, protects 
 them, and provides for them, with more care and constancy than a 
 shepherd can, that makes it his business to keep the flock. If God be 
 as a shepherd to us, we must be as sheep, inoffensive, meek, and quiet, 
 silent before the shearers, nay, and before the butcher too, useful and 
 sociable; we must know the shepherd's voice, and follow him. 

 2. The great confidence which believers have in God: "If the Lord is my 
 shepherd, my feeder, I may conclude I shall not want any thing that is 
 really necessary and good for me." If David penned this psalm before 
 his coming to the crown, though destined to it, he had as much reason 
 to fear wanting as any man. Once he sent his men a begging for him to 
 Nabal, and another time went himself a begging to Ahimelech; and yet, 
 when he considers that God is his shepherd, he can boldly say, <I>I 
 shall not want.</I> Let not those fear starving that are at God's 
 finding and have him for their feeder. More is implied than is 
 expressed, not only, <I>I shall not want,</I> but, "I shall be supplied 
 with whatever I need; and, if I have not every thing I desire, I may 
 conclude it is either not fit for me or not good for me or I shall have 
 it in due time."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. From his performing the office of a good shepherd to him he infers 
 that he needs not fear any evil in the greatest dangers and 
 difficulties he could be in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>.

 He experiences the benefit of God's presence with him and care of him
 now, and therefore expects the benefit of them when he most needs it. 
 See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The comforts of a living saint. God is his shepherd and his God--a
 God all-sufficient to all intents and purposes. David found him so, and 
 so have we. See the happiness of the saints as the sheep of God's 
 pasture. 
 
 (1.) They are well placed, well laid: <I>He maketh me to lie
 down in green pastures.</I> We have the supports and comforts of this 
 life from God's good hand, our daily bread from him as our Father. The 
 greatest abundance is but a dry pasture to a wicked man, who relishes 
 that only in it which pleases the senses; but to a godly man, who 
 tastes the goodness of God in all his enjoyments, and by faith relishes 
 that, though he has but little of the world, it is a green pasture, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:16,Pr+15:16,17">Ps. xxxvii. 16; Prov. xv. 16, 17</A>.

 God's ordinances are the green pastures in which food is provided for
 all believers; the word of life is the nourishment of the new man. It 
 is milk for babes, pasture for sheep, never barren, never eaten bare, 
 never parched, but always a green pasture for faith to feed in. God 
 makes his saints to lie down; he gives them quiet and contentment in 
 their own minds, what ever their lot is; their souls dwell at ease in 
 him, and that makes every pasture green. Are we blessed with the green 
 pastures of the ordinances? Let us not think it enough to pass through 
 them, but let us lie down in them, abide in them; this is my rest for 
 ever. It is by a constancy of the means of grace that the soul is fed. 
 
 (2.) They are well guided, well led. The shepherd of Israel guides
 Joseph like a flock; and every believer is under the same guidance: 
 <I>He leadeth me beside the still waters.</I> Those that feed on God's 
 goodness must follow his direction; he leads them by his providence, by 
 his word, by his Spirit, disposes of their affairs for the best, 
 according to his counsel, disposes their affections and actions 
 according to his command, directs their eye, their way, and their 
 heart, into his love. The still waters by which he leads them yield 
 them, not only a pleasant prospect, but many a cooling draught, many a 
 reviving cordial, when they are thirsty and weary. God provides for his 
 people not only food and rest, but refreshment also and pleasure. The 
 consolations of God, the joys of the Holy Ghost, are these still 
 waters, by which the saints are led, streams which flow from the 
 fountain of living waters and make glad the city of our God. God leads 
 his people, not to the standing waters which corrupt and gather filth, 
 not to the troubled sea, nor to the rapid rolling floods, but to the 
 silent purling waters; for the still but running waters agree best with 
 those spirits that flow out towards God and yet do it silently. The 
 divine guidance they are under is stripped of its metaphor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness,</I> in the way of my
 duty; in that he instructs me by his word and directs me by conscience 
 and providence. Theses are the paths in which all the saints desire to 
 be led and kept, and never to turn aside out of them. And those only 
 are led by the still waters of comfort that walk in the paths of 
 righteousness. The way of duty is the truly pleasant way. It is the 
 work of righteousness that is peace. In these paths we cannot walk 
 unless God both lead us into them and lead us in them. 

 (3.) They are well helped when any thing ails them: <I>He restoreth my
 soul.</I> 

 [1.] "He restores me when I wander." No creature will lose itself 
 sooner than a sheep, so apt is it to go astray, and then so unapt to 
 find the way back. The best saints are sensible of their proneness to 
 <I>go astray like lost sheep</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:176">Ps. cxix. 176</A>);

 they miss their way, and turn aside into by-paths; but when God shows
 them their error, gives them repentance, and brings them back to their 
 duty again, he restores the soul; and, if he did not do so, they would 
 wander endlessly and be undone. When, after one sin, David's heart 
 smote him, and, after another, Nathan was sent to tell him, <I>Thou art 
 the man,</I> God restored his soul. Though God may suffer his people to 
 fall into sin, he will not suffer them to lie still in it.

 [2.] "He recovers me when I am sick, and revives me when I am faint, 
 and so restores the soul which was ready to depart." He is the Lord our 
 God that heals us,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:26">Exod. xv. 26</A>.

 Many a time we should have fainted unless we had believed; and it was
 the good shepherd that kept us from fainting.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See here the courage of a dying saint 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "Having had such experience of God's goodness to me all my days, in six
 troubles and in seven, I will never distrust him, no, not in the last 
 extremity; the rather because all he has done for me hitherto was not 
 for any merit or desert of mine, but purely for his name's sake, in 
 pursuance of his word, in performance of his promise, and for the glory 
 of his own attributes and relations to his people. That name therefore 
 shall still be my strong tower, and shall assure me that he who has led 
 me, and fed me, all my life long, will not leave me at last." Here 
 is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Imminent danger supposed: "<I>Though I walk through the valley of 
 the shadow of death,</I> that is, though I am in peril of death, though 
 in the midst of dangers, deep as a valley, dark as a shadow, and 
 dreadful as death itself," or rather, "though I am under the arrests of 
 death, have received the sentence of death within myself, and have all 
 the reason in the world to look upon myself as a dying man, yet I am 
 easy." Those that are sick, those that are old, have reason to look 
 upon themselves as in the valley of the shadow of death. Here is one 
 word indeed which sounds terrible; it is <I>death,</I> which we must 
 all count upon; <I>there is no discharge in that war.</I> But, even in 
 the supposition of the distress, there are four words which lessen the 
 terror:--It is death indeed that is before us; but, 

 [1.] It is but the <I>shadow</I> of death; there is no substantial evil 
 in it; the shadow of a serpent will not sting nor the shadow of a sword 
 kill. 

 [2.] It is the <I>valley</I> of the shadow, deep indeed, and dark, and 
 dirty; but the valleys are fruitful, and so is death itself fruitful of 
 comforts to God's people. 

 [3.] It is but a <I>walk</I> in this valley, a gentle pleasant walk. 
 The wicked are chased out of the world, and their souls are required; 
 but the saints take a walk to another world as cheerfully as they take 
 their leave of this. 

 [4.] It is a walk <I>through</I> it; they shall not be lost in this 
 valley, but get safely to the mountain of spices on the other side of 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) This danger made light of, and triumphed over, upon good grounds. 
 Death is a king of terrors, but not to the sheep of Christ; they 
 tremble at it no more than sheep do that are appointed for the 
 slaughter. "Even in <I>the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no 
 evil. None of these things move me.</I>" Note, A child of God may meet 
 the messengers of death, and receive its summons with a holy security 
 and serenity of mind. The sucking child may play upon the hole of this 
 asp; and the weaned child, that, through grace, is weaned from this 
 world, may put his hand upon this cockatrice's den, bidding a holy 
 defiance to death, as Paul, <I>O death! where is thy sting?</I> And 
 there is ground enough for this confidence, 

 [1.] Because there is no evil in it to a child of God; death cannot 
 separate us from the love of God, and therefore it can do us no real 
 harm; it kills the body, but cannot touch the soul. Why should it be 
 dreadful when there is nothing in it hurtful? 

 [2.] Because the saints have God's gracious presence with them in their 
 dying moments; he is then at their right hand, and therefore why should 
 they be moved? The good shepherd will not only conduct, but convoy, his 
 sheep through the valley, where they are in danger of being set upon by 
 the beasts of prey, the ravening wolves; he will not only convoy them, 
 but comfort then when they most need comfort. His presence shall 
 comfort them: <I>Thou art with me.</I> His word and Spirit shall 
 comfort them--<I>his rod and staff,</I> alluding to the shepherd's 
 crook, or the rod under which the sheep passed when they were counted

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+27:32">Lev. xxvii. 32</A>),

 or the staff with which the shepherds drove away the dogs that would
 scatter or worry the sheep. It is a comfort to the saints, when they 
 come to die, that God takes cognizance of them (<I>he knows those that 
 are his</I>), that he will rebuke the enemy, that he will guide them 
 with his rod and sustain them with his staff. The gospel is called 
 <I>the rod of Christ's strength</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:2">Ps. cx. 2</A>),

 and there is enough in that to comfort the saints when they come to
 die, and <I>underneath</I> them are <I>the everlasting arms.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. From the good gifts of God's bounty to him now he infers the 
 constancy and perpetuity of his mercy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 Here we may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How highly he magnifies God's gracious vouchsafements to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou preparest a table before me;</I> thou hast provided for me all
 things pertaining both to life and godliness, all things requisite both 
 for body and soul, for time and eternity:" such a bountiful benefactor 
 is God to all his people; and it becomes them abundantly to utter his 
 great goodness, as David here, who acknowledges, 

 (1.) That he had food convenient, a table spread, a cup filled, meat
 for his hunger, drink for his thirst.

 (2.) That he had it carefully and readily provided for him. His table
 was not spread with any thing that came next to hand, but prepared, and 
 prepared <I>before him.</I>

 (3.) That he was not stinted, was not straitened, but had abundance:
 "<I>My cup runs over,</I> enough for myself and my friends too."

 (4.) That he had not only for necessity, but for ornament and delight:
 <I>Thou anointest my head with oil.</I> Samuel anointed him king, which 
 was a certain pledge of further favor; but this is rather an instance 
 of the plenty with which God had blessed him, or an allusion to the 
 extraordinary entertainment of special friends, whose heads they 
 anointed with oil,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:46">Luke vii. 46</A>.

 Nay, some think he still looks upon himself as a sheep, but such a one
 as the <I>poor man's ewe-lamb</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:3">2 Sam. xii. 3</A>),

 that did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his
 bosom; not only thus nobly, but thus tenderly, are the children of God 
 looked after. Plentiful provision is made for their bodies, for their
 souls, for the life that now is and for that which is to come. If 
 Providence do not bestow upon us thus plentifully for our natural life,
 it is our own fault if it be not made up to us in spiritual
 blessings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How confidently he counts upon the continuance of God's favours,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>I shall not want;</I> but now he speaks more positively, more
 comprehensively: <I>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the 
 days of my life.</I> His hope rises, and his faith is strengthened, by 
 being exercised. Observe,

 (1.) What he promises himself--goodness and mercy, all the streams of 
 mercy flowing from the fountain, pardoning mercy, protecting mercy, 
 sustaining mercy, supplying mercy.

 (2.) The manner of the conveyance of it: It shall <I>follow</I> me, as 
 the water out of the rock followed the camp of Israel through the 
 wilderness; it shall follow into all places and all conditions, shall 
 be always ready.

 (3.) The continuance of it: It shall follow me <I>all my life long,</I>
 even to the last; for whom God loves he loves to the end.

 (4.) The constancy of it: <I>All the days of my life,</I> as duly as
 the day comes; it shall be <I>new every morning</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:22,23">Lam. iii. 22, 23</A>)

 like the manna that was given to the Israelites daily.

 (5.) The certainty of it: <I>Surely</I> it shall. It is as sure as the
 promise of the God of truth can make it; and we know whom we have 
 believed.

 (6.) Here is a prospect of the perfection of bliss in the future state. 
 So some take the latter clause: "Goodness and mercy having followed me 
 all the days of my life on this earth, when that is ended I shall 
 remove to a better world, to <I>dwell in the house of the Lord for 
 ever,</I> in our Father's house above, where there are many mansions. 
 <I>With what I have I am pleased much; with what I hope for I am 
 pleased more.</I>" All this, and heaven too! Then we serve a good 
 Master.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How resolutely he determines to cleave to God and to his duty. We 
 read the last clause as David's covenant with God: "<I>I will dwell in 
 the house of the Lord for ever</I> (as long as I live), and I will 
 praise him while I have any being." We must dwell in his house as
 servants, that desired to have their ears bored to the door-post, to 
 serve him for ever. If God's goodness to us be like the morning light, 
 which shines more and more to the perfect day, let not ours to him be 
 like the morning cloud and the early dew that passeth away. Those that 
 would be satisfied with the fatness of God's house must keep close to 
 the duties of it.</P>
