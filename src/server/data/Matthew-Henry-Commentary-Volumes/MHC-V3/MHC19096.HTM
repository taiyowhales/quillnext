 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is part of that which was delivered into the hand of Asaph
 and his brethren 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:7">1 Chron. xvi. 7</A>),

 by which it appears both that David was the penman of it and that it
 has reference to the bringing up of the ark to the city of David; 
 whether that long psalm was made first, and this afterwards taken out 
 of it, or this made first and afterwards borrowed to make up that, is 
 not certain. But this is certain, that, though it was sung at the 
 translation of the ark, it looks further, to the kingdom of Christ, and 
 is designed to celebrate the glories of that kingdom, especially the 
 accession of the Gentiles to it. Here is, 

 I. A call given to all people to praise God, to worship him, and give
 glory to him, as a great and glorious God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. Notice given to all people of God's universal government and
 judgment, which ought to be the matter of universal joy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10-13">ver. 10-13</A>.

 In singing this psalm we ought to have our hearts filled with great and
 high thoughts of the glory of God and the grace of the gospel, and with 
 an entire satisfaction in Christ's sovereign dominion and in the 
 expectation of the judgment to come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses will be best expounded by pious and devout affections
 working in our souls towards God, with a high veneration for his 
 majesty and transcendent excellency. The call here given us to praise 
 God is very lively, the expressions are raised and repeated, to all 
 which the echo of a thankful heart should make agreeable returns.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are here required to honour God,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. With songs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 Three times we are here called to <I>sing unto the Lord;</I> sing to 
 the Father, to the Son, to the Holy Ghost, as it was <I>in the 
 beginning,</I> when <I>the morning stars sang together, is now,</I> in 
 the church militant, and <I>ever shall be,</I> in the church 
 triumphant. We have reason to do it often, and we have need to be often 
 reminded of it, and stirred up to it. <I>Sing unto the Lord,</I> that 
 is, "<I>Bless his name,</I> speak well of him, that you may bring 
 others to think well of him." 

 (1.) <I>Sing a new song,</I> an excellent song, the product of new 
 affections, clothed with new expressions. We speak of nothing more 
 despicable than "an old song," but the newness of a song recommends it; 
 for there we expect something surprising. A new song is a song for new 
 favours, for those compassions which are new every morning. A new song 
 is New-Testament song, a song of praise for the new covenant and the 
 precious privileges of that covenant. A new song is a song that shall 
 be ever new, and shall never wax old nor vanish away; it is an 
 everlasting song, that shall never be antiquated or out of date. 

 (2.) Let all the earth sing this song, not the Jews only, to whom
 hitherto the service of God had been appropriated, who could not
 <I>sing the Lord's song in</I> (would not sing it to) <I>a strange
 land;</I> but let <I>all the earth,</I> all that are <I>redeemed from
 the earth, learn</I> and sing <I>this new song,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:3">Rev. xiv. 3</A>.

 This is a prophecy of the calling of the Gentiles; all the earth shall
 have this <I>new song put into their mouths,</I> shall have both cause 
 and call to sing it.

 (3.) Let the subject-matter of this song be <I>his salvation,</I> the 
 great salvation which was to be wrought out by the Lord Jesus; that 
 must be shown forth as the cause of this joy and praise. 

 (4.) Let this song be sung constantly, not only in the times appointed 
 for the solemn feasts, but from day to day; it is a subject that can 
 never be exhausted. Let day unto day utter this speech, that, under the 
 influence of gospel devotions, we may daily exemplify a gospel 
 conversation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. With sermons 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Declare his glory among the heathen,</I> even <I>his wonders among 
 all people.</I> 

 (1.) Salvation by Christ is here spoken of as a work of wonder, and 
 that in which the glory of God shines very brightly; in showing forth 
 that salvation we declare God's glory as it shines in the face of 
 Christ. 

 (2.) This salvation was, in the Old-Testament times, as heaven's 
 happiness is now, <I>a glory to be revealed;</I> but in the fulness of 
 time it was declared, and a full discovery made of that, even to babes, 
 which prophets and kings desired and wished to see and might not. 

 (3.) What was then discovered was declared only among the Jews, but it
 is now declared <I>among the heathen, among all people;</I> the nations 
 which long sat in darkness now see this great light. The apostles' 
 commission to preach the gospel to every creature is copied from this: 
 <I>Declare his glory among the heathen.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. With religious services,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.

 Hitherto, though in every nation those that feared God and wrought 
 righteousness were accepted of him, yet instituted ordinances were the 
 peculiarities of the Jewish religion; but, in gospel-times, the 
 kindreds of the people shall be invited and admitted into the service 
 of God and be as welcome as ever the Jews were. The court of the 
 Gentiles shall no longer be an outward court, but shall be laid in 
 common with the court of Israel. All the earth is here summoned to fear 
 before the Lord, to worship him according to his appointment. <I>In 
 every place incense shall be offered to his name,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:11,Zec+14:17,Isa+66:23">Mal. i. 11; 
 Zech. xiv. 17; Isa. lxvi. 23</A>.

 This indeed spoke mortification to the Jews, but, withal, it gave a
 prospect of that which would redound very much to the glory of God and 
 to the happiness of mankind. Now observe how the acts of devotion to 
 God are here described. 

 (1.) We must <I>give unto the Lord;</I> not as if God needed any thing, 
 or could receive any thing, from us or any creature, which was not his 
 own before, much less be benefited by it; but we must in our best 
 affections, adorations, and services, return to him what we have 
 received from him, and do it freely, as what we give; for <I>God loves 
 a cheerful giver.</I> It is debt, it is rent, it is tribute, it is what 
 must be paid, and, if not, will be recovered, and yet, if it come from 
 holy love, God is pleased to accept it as a gift.  

 (2.) We must acknowledge God to be the sovereign Lord and pay homage to 
 him accordingly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Give unto the Lord glory and strength, glory and empire,</I> or 
 <I>dominion,</I> so some. As a king, he is clothed with robes of glory 
 and girt with the girdle of power, and we must subscribe to both. 
 <I>Thine is the kingdom,</I> and therefore <I>thine is the power and 
 the glory.</I> "Give the glory to God; do not take it to yourselves, 
 nor give it to any creature." 

 (3.) We must <I>give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name,</I> 
 that is, to the discovery he has been pleased to make of himself to the 
 children of men. In all the acts of religious worship this is that 
 which we must aim at, to honour God, to pay him some of that reverence 
 which we owe him as the best of beings and the fountain of our being. 
 
 (4.) We must <I>bring an offering in to his courts.</I> We must bring 
 ourselves, in the first place, the <I>offering up of the Gentiles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:16">Rom. xv. 16</A>.

 We must offer up the <I>sacrifices of praise continually</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:15">Heb. xiii. 15</A>),

 must often appear before God in public worship and never appear before 
 him empty. 

 (5.) We must <I>worship him in the beauty of holiness,</I> in the 
 solemn assembly where divine institutions are religiously observed, the 
 beauty of which is their holiness, that is, their conformity to the 
 rule. We must worship him with holy hearts, sanctified by the grace of 
 God, devoted to the glory of God, and purified from the pollutions of 
 sin.  

 (6.) We must <I>fear before him;</I> all the acts of worship must be 
 performed from a principle of the fear of God and with a holy awe and 
 reverence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In the midst of these calls to praise God and give glory to him 
 glorious things are here said of him, both as motives to praise and 
 matter of praise: <I>The Lord is great, and</I> therefore <I>greatly to 
 be praised</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 and <I>to be feared,</I> great and honourable to his attendants, great 
 and terrible to his adversaries. Even the new song proclaims God great 
 as well as good; for his goodness is his glory; and, when the 
 everlasting gospel is preached, it is this, <I>Fear God, and give glory 
 to him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:6,7">Rev. xiv. 6, 7</A>.

 1. He is great in his sovereignty over all that pretend to be deities;
 none dare vie with him: <I>He is to be feared above all gods</I>--all 
 princes, who were often deified after their deaths, and even while they 
 lived were adored as petty gods--or rather all idols, <I>the gods of 
 the nations</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 All the earth being called to sing the new song, they must be convinced 
 that the Lord Jehovah, to whose honour they must sing it, is the one 
 only living and true God, infinitely above all rivals and pretenders; 
 he is great, and they are little; he is all, and they are 
 <I>nothing;</I> so the word used for idols signifies, for we know that 
 <I>an idol is nothing in the world,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:4">1 Cor. viii. 4</A>.

 2. He is great in his right, even to the noblest part of the creation;
 for it is his own work and derives its being from him: <I>The Lord made 
 the heavens</I> and all their hosts; they <I>are the work of his 
 fingers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:3">Ps. viii. 3</A>),

 so nicely, so curiously, are they made. The gods of the nations were
 all made--gods, the creatures of men's fancies; but our God is the 
 Creator of the sun, moon, and stars, those lights of heaven, which they 
 imagined to be gods and worshipped as such. 

 3. He is great in the manifestation of his glory both in the upper and
 lower world, among his angels in heaven and his saints on earth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Splendour and majesty are before him,</I> in his immediate presence 
 above, where the angels cover their faces, as unable to bear the 
 dazzling lustre of his glory. <I>Strength and beauty are in his 
 sanctuary,</I> both that above and this below. In God there is every 
 thing that is awful and yet every thing that is amiable. If we attend 
 him in his sanctuary, we shall behold his beauty, for <I>God is 
 love,</I> and experience his strength, for <I>he is our rock.</I> Let 
 us therefore go forth in his strength, enamoured with his beauty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Say among the heathen <I>that</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> reigneth: the world
 also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall
 judge the people righteously.
 &nbsp; 11  Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the
 sea roar, and the fulness thereof.
 &nbsp; 12  Let the field be joyful, and all that <I>is</I> therein: then
 shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
 &nbsp; 13  Before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the
 earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the
 people with his truth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here instructions given to those who were to preach the gospel 
 to the nations what to preach, or to those who had themselves received 
 the gospel what account to give of it to their neighbours, what to 
 <I>say among the heathen;</I> and it is an illustrious prophecy of the 
 setting up of the kingdom of Christ upon the ruins of the devil's 
 kingdom, which began immediately after his ascension and will continue 
 in the doing till the mystery of God be finished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let it be told <I>that the Lord reigns,</I> the Lord Christ reigns, 
 that King whom God determined to set upon his holy hill of Zion. See 
 how this was first said <I>among the heathen</I> by Peter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:42">Acts x. 42</A>.

 Some of the ancients added a gloss to this, which by degrees crept into
 the text, <I>The Lord reigneth from the tree</I> (so Justin Martyr, 
 Austin, and others, quote it), meaning the cross, when he had this 
 title written over him, <I>The King of the Jews.</I> It was because he 
 became obedient to death, even the death of the cross, that God exalted 
 him, and gave him a name above every name, a throne above every throne. 
 Some of the heathen came betimes to enquire after him that was <I>born 
 King of the Jews,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:2">Matt. ii. 2</A>.

 Now let them know that he has come and his kingdom is set up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let it be told that Christ's government will be the world's happy 
 settlement. <I>The world also shall be established, that it shall not 
 be moved.</I> The natural world shall be established. The standing of 
 the world, and its stability, are owing to the mediation of Christ. Sin 
 had given it a shock, and still threatens it; but Christ, as Redeemer, 
 upholds all things, and preserves the course of nature. The world of 
 mankind shall be established, shall be preserved, till all that belong 
 to the election of grace are called in, though a guilty provoking 
 world. The Christian religion, as far as it is embraced, shall 
 establish states and kingdoms, and preserve good order among men. The 
 church in the world shall be established (so some), that it <I>cannot 
 be moved; for it is built upon a rock, and the gates of hell shall 
 never prevail against it;</I> it is a <I>kingdom that cannot be 
 shaken.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Let them be told that Christ's government will be incontestably 
 just and righteous: <I>He shall judge the people righteously</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:10"><I>v.</I>  10</A>),

 <I>judge the world with righteousness, and with his truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:13"><I>v.</I>  13</A>.
 
 Judging is here put for ruling; and though this may be extended to the 
 general judgment of the world at the last day, which will be <I>in 
 righteousness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:31">Acts xvii. 31</A>),

 yet it refers more immediately to Christ's first coming, and the
 setting up of his kingdom in the world by the gospel. He says himself, 
 <I>For judgment have I come into this world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+9:39,12:31">John ix. 39; xii. 31</A>),

 and declares that <I>all judgment was committed to him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:22,27">John v. 22, 27</A>.

 His ruling and judging with righteousness and truth signify, 

 1. That all the laws and ordinances of his kingdom shall be consonant
 to the rules and principles of eternal truth and equity, that is, to 
 the rectitude and purity of the divine nature and will. 

 2. That all his administrations of government shall be just and 
 faithful, and according to what he has said. 

 3. That he shall rule in the hearts and consciences of men by the
 commanding power of truth and the Spirit of righteousness and 
 sanctification. When Pilate asked our Saviour, <I>Art thou a king?</I> 
 he answered, <I>For this cause came I into the world, that I should 
 bear witness unto the truth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:37">John xviii. 37</A>);

 for he rules by truth, commands men's wills by informing their
 judgments aright.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Let them be told that his coming draws nigh, that this King, this 
 Judge, <I>standeth before the door; for he cometh, for he cometh.</I> 
 Enoch, the seventh from Adam, said so. <I>Behold, the Lord cometh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14">
 Jude 14</A>.

 Between this and his first coming the revolutions of many ages
 intervened, and yet he came at the set time, and so sure will his 
 second coming be; though it is now long since it was said, <I>Behold, 
 he comes in the clouds</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:7">Rev. i. 7</A>)
 
 and he has not yet come. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:4">2 Pet. iii. 4</A>,

 &c.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Let them be called upon to rejoice in this honour that is put upon
 the Messiah, and this great trust that is to be lodged in his hand 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:11,12"><I>v.</I>  11, 12</A>):

 <I>Let heaven and earth rejoice, the sea, the field,</I> and <I>all the 
 trees of the wood.</I> The dialect here is poetical; the meaning is, 

 1.  That the days of the Messiah will be joyful days, and, as far as
 his grace and government are submitted to, will bring joy along with 
 them.  We have reason to give that place, that soul, joy into which 
 Christ is admitted. See an instance of both,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:4-25,26-40">Acts viii.</A>

 When Samaria received the gospel <I>there was great joy in that
 city</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and, when the eunuch was baptized, <I>he went on his way rejoicing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>.

 2.  That it is the duty of every one of us to bid Christ and his 
 kingdom welcome; for, though he comes conquering and to conquer, yet he 
 comes peaceably. <I>Hosanna, Blessed is he that cometh;</I> and again, 
 <I>Hosanna, Blessed be the kingdom of our father David</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+11:9,10">Mark xi. 9, 10</A>);

 not only <I>let the daughter of Zion rejoice that her King comes</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:9">Zech. ix. 9</A>),

 but let all rejoice. 

 3. That the whole creation will have reason to rejoice in the setting
 up of Christ's kingdom, even <I>the sea</I> and <I>the field;</I> for, 
 as by the sin of the first Adam the whole creation was made <I>subject 
 to vanity,</I> so by the grace of the second Adam it shall, some way or 
 other, first or last, be <I>delivered from the bondage of corruption 
 into the glorious liberty of the children of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:20,21">Rom. viii. 20, 21</A>.

 4. That there will, in the first place, be <I>joy in heaven, joy in the 
 presence of the angels of God;</I> for, when the First-begotten was 
 brought into the world, they sang their anthems to his praise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:14">Luke ii. 14</A>.

 5. That God will graciously accept the holy joy and praises of all the
 hearty well-wishers to the kingdom of Christ, be their capacity ever so 
 mean. <I>The sea</I> can but <I>roar,</I> and how <I>the trees of the 
 wood</I> can show that they <I>rejoice</I> I know not; but <I>he that 
 searches the heart knows what is the mind of the Spirit,</I> and 
 understands the language, the broken language, of the weakest.</P>
