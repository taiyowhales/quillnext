 We have now before us, 

 I. A new author, or penman rather, or pen (if you will) made use of by 
 the Holy Ghost for making known the mind of God to us, writing as moved 
 by the <I>finger of God</I> (so the Spirit of God is called), and that 
 is Solomon; through his hand came this book of Scripture and the two 
 that follow it, Ecclesiastes and Canticles, a sermon and a song. Some 
 think he wrote Canticles when he was very young, Proverbs in the midst 
 of his days, and Ecclesiastes when he was old. In the title of his song 
 he only writes himself <I>Solomon,</I> perhaps because he wrote it 
 before his accession to the throne, being filled with the Holy Ghost 
 when he was young. In the title of his Proverbs he writes himself 
 <I>the son of David, king of Israel,</I> for then he ruled over all 
 Israel. In the title of his Ecclesiastes he writes himself <I>the son 
 of David, king of Jerusalem,</I> because then perhaps his influence had 
 grown less upon the distant tribes, and he confined himself very much 
 in Jerusalem. Concerning this author we may observe, 

 1. That he was a king, and a king's son. The penmen of scripture, 
 hitherto, were most of them men of the first rank in the world, as 
 Moses and Joshua, Samuel and David, and now Solomon; but, after him, 
 the inspired writers were generally poor prophets, men of no figure in 
 the world, because that dispensation was approaching in the which God 
 would choose the <I>weak and foolish things of the world to confound 
 the wise and mighty</I> and the poor should be employed to evangelize. 
 Solomon was a very rich king, and his dominions were very large, a king 
 of the first magnitude, and yet he addicted himself to the study of 
 divine things, and was a prophet and a prophet's son. It is no 
 disparagement to the greatest princes and potentates in the world to 
 instruct those about them in religion and the laws of it. 

 2. That he was one whom God endued with extraordinary measures of 
 wisdom and knowledge, in answer to his prayers at his accession to the 
 throne. His prayer was exemplary: <I>Give me a wise and an 
 understanding heart;</I> the answer to it was encouraging: he had what 
 he desired and <I>all other things were added to him.</I> Now here we 
 find what good use he made of the wisdom God gave him; he not only 
 governed himself and his kingdom with it, but he gave rules of wisdom 
 to others also, and transmitted them to posterity. Thus must we trade
 with the talents with which we are entrusted, according as they are. 

 3. That he was one who had his faults, and in his latter end turned
 aside from those good ways of God which in this book he had directed 
 others in. We have the story of it 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:1-43">1 Kings xi.</A>,

 and a sad story it is, that the penman of such a book as this should
 apostatize as he did. <I>Tell it not in Gath.</I> But let those who
 are most eminently useful take warning by this not to be proud or 
 secure; and let us all learn not to think the worse of good 
 instructions though we have them from those who do not themselves 
 altogether live up to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A new way of writing, in which divine wisdom is taught us by 
 Proverbs, or short sentences, which contain their whole design within 
 themselves and are not connected with one another. We have had divine 
 <I>laws, histories,</I> and <I>songs,</I> and now divine
 <I>proverbs;</I> such various methods has Infinite Wisdom used for our 
 instruction, that, no stone being left unturned to do us good, we may 
 be inexcusable if we perish in our folly. Teaching by proverbs was, 

 1. An ancient way of teaching. It was the most ancient way among the
 Greeks; each of the seven wise men of Greece had some one saying that 
 he valued himself upon, and that made him famous. These sentences were 
 inscribed on pillars, and had in great veneration as that which was 
 said to come down from heaven. <I>A c&oelig;lo descendit,</I> <B><I>Gnothi 
 seauton</I></B>--<I>Know thyself is a precept which came down from 
 heaven.</I> 

 2. It was a plain and easy way of teaching, which cost neither the 
 teachers nor the learners much pains, nor put their understandings nor 
 their memories to the stretch. Long periods, and arguments far-fetched, 
 must be laboured both by him that frames them and by him that would 
 understand them, while a proverb, which carries both its sense and its 
 evidence in a little compass, is quickly apprehended and subscribed to, 
 and is easily retained. Both David's devotions and Solomon's 
 instructions are sententious, which may recommend that way of 
 expression to those who minister about holy things, both in praying and 
 preaching. 

 3. It was a very profitable way of teaching, and served admirably well 
 to answer the end. The word <I>Mashal,</I> here used for a proverb, 
 comes from a word that signifies <I>to rule</I> or <I>have 
 dominion,</I> because of the commanding power and influence which wise 
 and weighty sayings have upon the children of men; he that teaches by 
 them <I>dominatur in concionibus--rules his auditory.</I> It is easy to 
 observe how the world is governed by proverbs. <I>As saith the proverb 
 of the ancients</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:13">1 Sam. xxiv. 13</A>),

 or (as we commonly express it) <I>As the old saying is,</I> goes very 
 far with most men in forming their notions and fixing their resolves. 
 Much of the wisdom of the ancients has been handed down to posterity by 
 proverbs; and some think we may judge of the temper and character of a 
 nation by the complexion of its vulgar proverbs. Proverbs in
 conversation are like axioms in philosophy, maxims in law, and 
 postulata in the mathematics, which nobody disputes, but every one 
 endeavours to expound so as to have them on his side. Yet there are 
 many corrupt proverbs, which tend to debauch men's minds and harden 
 them in sin. The devil has his proverbs, and the world and the flesh 
 have their proverbs, which reflect reproach on God and religion (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+12:22,18:2">Ezek. xii. 22; xviii. 2</A>),

 to guard us against the corrupt influences of which God has his 
 proverbs, which are all wise and good, and tend to make us so. These 
 proverbs of Solomon were not merely a collection of the wise sayings 
 that had been formerly delivered, as some have imagined, but were the 
 dictates of the Spirit of God in Solomon. The very first of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:7"><I>ch.</I> i. 7</A>)

 agrees with what God said to man in the beginning 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:28">Job xxviii. 28</A>,

 <I>Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom</I>); so that though
 Solomon was great, and his name may serve as much as any man's to 
 recommend his writings, yet, behold, <I>a greater than Solomon is 
 here.</I> It is God, by Solomon, that here speaks to us: I say, to 
 <I>us;</I> for these proverbs were <I>written for our learning,</I> 
 and, when Solomon speaks to his son, the exhortation is said <I>to 
 speak to us as unto children,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:5">Heb. xii. 5</A>.

 And, as we have no book so useful to us in our devotions as David's 
 psalms, so have we none so serviceable to us, for the right ordering of 
 our conversations, as Solomon's proverbs, which as David says of the 
 commandments, are <I>exceedingly broad,</I> containing, in a little 
 compass, a complete body of divine ethics, politics, and economics, 
 exposing every vice, recommending every virtue, and suggesting rules 
 for the government of ourselves in every relation and condition, and 
 every turn of the conversation. The learned bishop Hall has drawn up a 
 system of moral philosophy out of Solomon's Proverbs and Ecclesiastes.
 The 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:1-32">first nine chapters</A>

 of this book are reckoned as a preface, by way of exhortation to the
 study and practice of wisdom's rules, and caution against those things 
 that would hinder therein. We have then the first volume of Solomon's 
 proverbs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:1-24:34"><I>ch.</I> x.-xxiv.</A>);

 after that a second volume

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:1-29:27"><I>ch.</I> xxv.-xxix.</A>);

 and then Agur's prophecy
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:1-33"><I>ch.</I> xxx.</A>),

 and Lemuel's
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:1-31"><I>ch.</I> xxxi.</A>).

 The scope of all is one and the same, to direct us so to order our
 conversation aright as that in the end we may see the salvation of the 
 Lord. The best comment on these rules is to be ruled by them.</P>
