 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is the probable conjecture of some (Amyraldus particularly) that 
 before Saul began to persecute David by force of arms, and raised the 
 militia to seize him, he formed a process against him by course of law, 
 upon which he was condemned unheard, and attainted as a traitor, by the 
 great council, or supreme court of judicature, and then proclaimed "qui 
 caput gerit lupinum--an outlawed wolf," whom any man might kill and no
 man might protect. The elders, in order to curry favour with Saul, 
 having passed this bill of attainder, it is supposed that David penned 
 this psalm on the occasion. 

 I. He describes their sin, and aggravates that,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. He imprecates and foretels their ruin, and the judgments which the
 righteous God would bring upon them for their injustice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>)

 which would redound,

 1. To the comfort of the saints, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:10">ver. 10</A>.

 2. To the glory of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:11">ver. 11</A>.

 Sin appears here both exceedingly sinful and exceedingly dangerous, and
 God a just avenger of wrong, with which we should be affected in 
 singing this psalm.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation?
 do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
 &nbsp; 2  Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of
 your hands in the earth.
 &nbsp; 3  The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as
 soon as they be born, speaking lies.
 &nbsp; 4  Their poison <I>is</I> like the poison of a serpent: <I>they are</I>
 like the deaf adder <I>that</I> stoppeth her ear;
 &nbsp; 5  Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming
 never so wisely.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have reason to think that this psalm refers to the malice of Saul 
 and his janizaries against David, because it bears the same inscription 
 (<I>Al-taschith,</I> and <I>Michtam of David</I>) with that which goes 
 before and that which follows, both which appear, by the title, to have 
 been penned with reference to that persecution through which God 
 preserved him (<I>Al-taschith--Destroy not</I>), and therefore the
 psalms he then penned were precious to him, <I>Michtams--David's
 jewels,</I> as Dr. Hammond translates it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses David, not as a king, for he had not yet come to the
 throne, but as a prophet, in God's name arraigns and convicts his 
 judges, with more authority and justice than they showed in prosecuting 
 him. Two things he charges them with:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The corruption of their government. They were a congregation, a 
 bench of justices, nay, perhaps, a congress or convention of the 
 states, from whom one might have expected fair dealing, for they were 
 men learned in the laws, had been brought up in the study of these 
 statutes and judgments, which were so righteous that those of other 
 nations were not to be compared with them. One would not have thought a 
 congregation of such could be bribed and biassed with pensions, and 
 yet, it seems, they were, because the son of Kish could do that for 
 them which the son of Jesse could not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:7">1 Sam. xxii. 7</A>.

 He had vineyards, and fields, and preferments, to give them, and
 therefore, to please him, they would do any thing, right or wrong. Of
 all the melancholy views which Solomon took of this earth and its
 grievances, nothing vexed him so much as to see that in the <I>place of
 judgment wickedness was there,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16">Eccl. iii. 16</A>.

 So it was in Saul's time.

 1. The judges would not do right, would not protect or vindicate
 oppressed innocency 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>Do you indeed speak righteousness, or judge uprightly?</I> No; you 
 are far from it; your own consciences cannot but tell you that you do 
 not discharge the trust reposed in you as magistrates, by which you are 
 bound to be <I>a terror to evil-doers and a praise to those that do 
 well.</I> Is this the justice you pretend to administer? Is this the 
 patronage, this the countenance, which an honest man and an honest 
 cause may expect from you? Remember you are sons of men; mortal and 
 dying, and that you stand upon the same level before God with the 
 meanest of those you trample upon, and must yourselves be called to an 
 account and judged. You are <I>sons of men,</I> and therefore we may 
 appeal to yourselves, and to that law of nature which is written in 
 every man's heart: <I>Do you indeed speak righteousness?</I> And will 
 not your second thoughts correct what you have done?" Note, It is good 
 for us often to reflect upon what we say with this serious question, 
 <I>Do we indeed speak righteousness?</I> that we may unsay what we have 
 spoken amiss and may proceed no further in it.

 2. They did a great deal of wrong; they used their power for the 
 support of injury and oppression 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>In heart you work wickedness</I> (all the wickedness of the life is 
 wrought in the heart). It intimates that they wrought with a great deal 
 of plot and management, not by surprise, but with premeditation and 
 design, and with a strong inclination to it and resolution in it. The 
 moire there is of the heart in any act of wickedness the worse it is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+8:11">Eccl. viii. 11</A>.

 And what was their wickedness?  It follows, "<I>You weigh the violence
 of your hands in the earth</I>" (or <I>in the land</I>), "the peace of 
 which you are appointed to be the conservators of." They did all the 
 violence and injury they could, either to enrich or avenge themselves, 
 and they weighed it; that is,

 (1.)  They did it with a great deal of craft and caution: "<I>You frame
 it by rule and lines</I>" (so the word signifies), "that it may
 effectually answer your mischievous intentions; such masters are you of
 the art of oppression."

 (2.) They did it under colour of justice. They held the balances (the
 emblem of justice) in their hands, as if they designed to do right, and 
 right is expected from them, but the result is violence and oppression, 
 which are practised the more effectually for being practised under the 
 pretext of law and right.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The corruption of their nature. This was the root of bitterness 
 from which that gall and wormwood sprang 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>The wicked,</I> who in heart work wickedness, <I>are estranged from 
 the womb,</I> estranged from God and all good, <I>alienated from the 
 divine life,</I> and its principles, powers, and pleasures, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:18">Eph. iv. 18</A>.

 A sinful state is a state of estrangement from that acquaintance with 
 God and service of him which we were made for. Let none wonder that 
 these wicked men dare do such things, for wickedness is bred in the 
 bone with them; they brought it into the world with them; they have in 
 their natures a strong inclination to it; they learned it from their 
 wicked parents, and have been trained up in it by a bad education. They 
 are called, and not miscalled, <I>transgressors from the womb;</I> one 
 can therefore expect no other than that they will <I>deal very 
 treacherously;</I> see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:8">Isa. xlviii. 8</A>.

 They go astray from God and their duty as soon as they are born, (that
 is, as soon as possibly they can); the foolishness that is bound up in
 their hearts appears with the first operations of reason; as the wheat
 springs up, the tares spring up with it. Three instances are here given
 of the corruption of nature:--

 1. Falsehood. They soon learn to speak lies, and <I>bend their tongues,
 like their</I> bows, for that purpose,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:3">Jer. ix. 3</A>.

 How soon will little children tell a lie to excuse a fault, or in their
 own commendation! No sooner can they speak than they speak to God's 
 dishonour; tongue-sins are some of the first of our actual 
 transgressions.

 2. Malice. <I>Their poison</I> (that is, their ill-will, and the spite
 they bore to goodness and all good men, particularly to David) was 
 <I>like the poison of a serpent,</I> innate, venomous, and very 
 mischievous, and that which they can never be cured of. We pity a dog 
 that is poisoned by accident, but hate a serpent that is poisonous by 
 nature. Such as the cursed enmity in this serpent's brood against the 
 Lord and his anointed. 

 3. Untractableness. They are malicious, and nothing will work upon
 them, no reason, no kindness, to mollify them, and bring them to a 
 better temper. <I>They are like the deaf adder that stops her ear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 The psalmist, having compared these wicked men, whom he here complains
 of, to serpents, for their poisonous malice, takes occasion thence, 
 upon another account, to compare them to the deaf adder or viper, 
 concerning which there was then this vulgar tradition, that whereas, by 
 music or some other art, they had a way of charming serpents, so as 
 either to destroy them or at least disable them to do mischief, this 
 deaf adder would lay one ear to the ground and stop the other with her 
 tail, so that she could not hear the voice of the enchantment, and so 
 defeated the intention of it and secured herself.  The using of this 
 comparison neither verifies the story, nor, if it were true, justifies 
 the use of this enchantment; for it is only an allusion to the report 
 of such a thing, to illustrate the obstinacy of sinners in a sinful 
 way. God's design, in his word and providence, is to cure serpents of 
 their malignity; to this end how wise, how powerful, how well-chosen 
 are the charms! How forcible the right words!  But all in vain with 
 most men; and what is the reason? It is because they will not hearken. 
 None so deaf as those that will not hear. We <I>have piped unto men, 
 and they have not danced;</I> how should they, when they have stopped 
 their ears?</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David's prayers against his enemies, and all the enemies of God's 
 church and people; for it is as such that he looks upon them, so that 
 he was actuated by a public spirit in praying against them, and not by 
 any private revenge. 

 1. He prays that they might be disabled to do any further mischief 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:6"><I>v.</I>  6</A>):

 <I>Break their teeth, O God!</I> Not so much that they might not feed
 themselves as that they might not be able to make prey of others,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:7">Ps. iii. 7</A>.

 He does not say, "Break their necks" (no; let them live to repent, 
 <I>slay them not, lest my people forget</I>), but, "Break their teeth, 
 for they are lions, they are young lions, that live by rapine." 

 2. That they might be disappointed in the plots they had already laid, 
 and might not gain their point: "<I>When he bends his bow,</I> and 
 takes aim <I>to shoot his arrows</I> at the upright in heart, <I>let 
 them be as cut in pieces,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Let them fall at his feet, and never come near the mark."

 3. That they and their interest might waste and come to nothing, that
 they might <I>melt away as waters that run continually;</I> that is, as 
 the waters of a land-flood, which, though they seem formidable for a 
 while, soon soak into the ground or return to their channels, or, in 
 general, as <I>water spilt upon the ground, which cannot be gathered up 
 again,</I> but gradually dries away and disappears. Such shall the 
 <I>floods of ungodly men</I> be, which sometimes <I>make us afraid</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:4">Ps. xviii. 4</A>);

 so shall the proud waters be reduced, which threaten to go over our 
 soul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+124:4,5">Ps. cxxiv. 4, 5</A>.

 Let us by faith then see what they shall be and then we shall not fear 
 what they are. He prays 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 that they might <I>melt as a snail,</I> which wastes by its own motion, 
 in every stretch it makes leaving some of its moisture behind, which, 
 by degrees, must needs consume it, though it makes a path to shine 
 after it. He that like a snail in her house is <I>plenus sui--full of 
 himself,</I> that pleases himself and trusts to himself, does but 
 consume himself, and will quickly bring himself to nothing. And he 
 prays that they might be <I>like the untimely birth of a woman,</I> 
 which dies as soon as it begins to live and never <I>sees the sun.</I> 
 Job, in his passion, wished he himself had been such a one 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:16">Job iii. 16</A>),
 
 but he knew not what he said. We may, in faith, pray against the
 designs of the church's enemies, as the prophet does 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:14">Hos.  ix. 14</A>,

 <I>Give them, O Lord! what wilt thou give them? Give them a miscarrying
 womb and dry breasts</I>), which explains this prayer of the 
 psalmist.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His prediction of their ruin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Before your pots can feel the</I> heat of a fire of <I>thorns</I> 
 made under them (which they will presently do, for it is a quick fire 
 and violent while it lasts), so speedily, with such a hasty and violent 
 flame, God shall hurry them away, as terribly and as irresistibly as 
 with a whirlwind, as it were alive, as it were in fury."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The proverbial expressions are somewhat difficult, but the sense is
 plain, 

 (1.) That the judgments of God often surprise wicked people in the 
 midst of their jollity, and hurry them away of a sudden. When they are 
 beginning to walk in the light of their own fire, and the sparks of 
 their own kindling, they are made to <I>lie down in sorrow</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:11">Isa. l. 11</A>),

 and their laughter proves like the crackling of thorns under a pot, the
 comfort of which is soon gone, ere they can say, <I>Alas! I am 
 warm,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:6">Eccl. vii. 6</A>.

 (2.) That there is no standing before the destruction that comes from
 the Almighty; for <I>who knows the power of God's anger?</I> When God 
 will take sinners away, dead or alive, they cannot contest with him. 
 <I>The wicked are driven away in their wickedness.</I> Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. There are two things which the psalmist promises himself as the good 
 effects of sinners' destruction:--

 (1.) That saints would be encouraged and comforted by it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance.</I> The pomp 
 and power, the prosperity and success, of the wicked, are a 
 discouragement to the righteous; they sadden their hearts, and weaken 
 their hands, and are sometimes a strong temptation to them to question 
 their foundations,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:2,13">Ps. lxxiii. 2, 13</A>.

 But when they see the judgments of God hurrying them away, and just 
 vengeance taken on them for all the mischief they have done to the 
 people of God, they rejoice in the satisfaction thereby given to their 
 doubts and the confirmation thereby given to their faith in the 
 providence of God and his justice and righteousness in governing the 
 world; they shall rejoice in the victory thus gained over that 
 temptation by seeing <I>their end,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:17">Ps. lxxiii. 17</A>.

 <I>He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;</I> that is, 
 there shall be abundance of bloodshed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:23">Ps.  lxviii. 23</A>),

 and it shall be as great a refreshment to the saints to see God 
 glorified in the ruin of sinners as it is to a weary traveller to have 
 his feet washed. It shall likewise contribute to their sanctification; 
 the sight of the vengeance shall make them tremble before God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:120">Ps. cxix. 120</A>)

 and shall convince them of the evil of sin, and the obligations they
 lie under to that God who pleads their cause and will suffer no man to 
 do them wrong and go unpunished for it.  The joy of the saints in the 
 destruction of the wicked is then a holy joy, and justifiable, when it 
 helps to make them holy and to purify them from sin. 

 (2.) That sinners would be convinced and converted by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The vengeance God sometimes takes on the wicked in this world will
 bring men to say, <I>Verily, there is a reward for the righteous.</I> 
 Any man may draw this inference from such providences, and many a man 
 shall, who before denied even these plain truths or doubted of them.  
 Some shall have this confession extorted from them, others shall have 
 their minds so changed that they shall willingly own it, and thank God 
 who has given them to see it and see it with satisfaction, That God is, 
 and,

 [1.] That he is the bountiful rewarder of his saints and servants: 
 <I>Verily (however it be,</I> so it may be read) <I>there is a fruit to 
 the righteous;</I> whatever damage he may run, and whatever hardship he 
 may undergo for his religion, he shall not only be no loser by it, but 
 an unspeakable gainer in the issue.  Even in this world there is a 
 reward for the righteous; they shall be recompensed in the earth. Those 
 shall be taken notice of, honoured, and protected, that seemed 
 slighted, despised, and abandoned.

 [2.] That he is the righteous governor of the world, and will surely 
 reckon with the enemies of his kingdom: <I>Verily,</I> however it be, 
 though wicked people prosper, and bid defiance to divine justice, yet 
 it shall be made to appear, to their confusion, that the world is not 
 governed by chance, but by a Being of infinite wisdom and justice; 
 <I>there is a God that judges in the earth,</I> though he has prepared 
 his throne in the heavens. He presides in all the affairs of the 
 children of men, and directs and disposes them according to the counsel 
 of his will, to his own glory; and he will punish the wicked, not only 
 in the world to come, but <I>in the earth,</I> where they have laid up 
 their treasure and promised themselves a happiness--<I>in the 
 earth,</I> that the Lord may be known by the judgments which he 
 executes, and that they may be taken as earnests of a judgment to come.  
 <I>He is a God</I> (so we read it), not a weak man, not an angel, not a 
 mere name, not (as the atheists suggest) a creature of men's fear and 
 fancy, not a deified hero, not the sun and moon, as idolaters imagined, 
 but a God, a self-existent perfect Being; he it is that judges the 
 earth; his favour therefore let us seek, from whom every man's judgment 
 proceeds, and to him let all judgment be referred.</P>
