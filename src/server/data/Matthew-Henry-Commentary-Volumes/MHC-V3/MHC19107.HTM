 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist, having in the two foregoing psalms celebrated the wisdom, 
 power, and goodness of God, in his dealings with his church in 
 particular, here observes some of the instances of his providential 
 care of the children of men in general, especially in their distresses; 
 for he is not only King of saints, but King of nations, not only the 
 God of Israel, but the God of the whole earth, and a common Father to
 all mankind. Though this may especially refer to Israelites in their
 personal capacity, yet there were those who pertained not to the 
 commonwealth of Israel and yet were worshippers of the true God; and 
 even those who worshipped images had some knowledge of a supreme 
 "Numen," to whom, when they were in earnest, they looked above all 
 their false gods. And of these, when they prayed in their distresses, 
 God took a particular care, 

 I. The psalmist specifies some of the most common calamities of human
 life, and shows how God succours those that labour under them, in 
 answer to their prayers. 

 I. Banishment and dispersion,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:2-9">ver. 2-9</A>.

 2. Captivity and imprisonment,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:10-16">ver. 10-16</A>.

 3. Sickness and distemper of body,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:17-22">ver. 17-22</A>.

 4. Danger and distress at sea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:23-32">ver. 23-32</A>.

 These are put for all similar perils, in which those that cry unto God
 have ever found him a very present help.

 II. He specifies the varieties and vicissitudes of events concerning
 nations and families, in all which God's hand is to be eyed by his own
 people, with joyful acknowledgments of his goodness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:33-43">ver. 33-43</A>.

 When we are in any of these or the like distresses it will be
 comfortable to sing this psalm, with application; but, if we be not,
 others are, and have been, of whose deliverances it becomes us to give
 God the glory, for we are members one of another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O give thanks unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, for <I>he is</I> good: for his mercy
 <I>endureth</I> for ever.
 &nbsp; 2  Let the redeemed of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> say <I>so,</I> whom he hath redeemed
 from the hand of the enemy;
 &nbsp; 3  And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from
 the west, from the north, and from the south.
 &nbsp; 4  They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found
 no city to dwell in.
 &nbsp; 5  Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
 &nbsp; 6  Then they cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in their trouble, <I>and</I> he
 delivered them out of their distresses.
 &nbsp; 7  And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to
 a city of habitation.
 &nbsp; 8  Oh that <I>men</I> would praise the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>for</I> his goodness, and
 <I>for</I> his wonderful works to the children of men!
 &nbsp; 9  For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry
 soul with goodness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A general call to all to give thanks to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Let all that sing this psalm, or pray over it, set themselves herein to
 <I>give thanks to the Lord;</I> and those that have not any special 
 matter for praise may furnish themselves with matter enough from God's 
 universal goodness. In the fountain <I>he is good;</I> in the streams 
 <I>his mercy endures for ever</I> and never fails.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A particular demand hereof from <I>the redeemed of the Lord,</I> 
 which may well be applied spiritually to those that have an interest in 
 the great Redeemer and are saved by him from sin and hell. They have, 
 of all people, most reason to say that God is good, and his mercy 
 everlasting; these are the <I>children of God that were scattered 
 abroad,</I> whom Christ died to <I>gather together in one,</I> out of 
 all lands, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:52,Mt+24:31">John xi. 52; Matt. xxiv. 31</A>.

 But it seems here to be meant of a temporal deliverance, wrought for
 them when in their distress <I>they cried unto the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 <I>Is any afflicted? Let him pray.</I> Does any pray? God will
 certainly hear and help. When troubles become extreme that is man's 
 time to cry; those who but whispered prayer before then cry aloud, and 
 then it is God's time to succour. In the mount he will be seen. 

 1. They were in an enemy's country, but God wrought out their rescue:
 <I>He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 not by <I>might or power,</I> it may be

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+4:6">Zech. iv. 6</A>),

 nor by <I>price or reward</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:13">Isa. xlv. 13</A>),

 <I>but by the Spirit of God</I> working on the spirits of men.

 2. They were dispersed as out-casts, but God gathered them out of all 
 the countries whither they were scattered in the cloudy and dark day, 
 that they might again be incorporated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:4,Eze+34:12">Deut. xxx. 4; Ezek. xxxiv. 12</A>.
 
 God knows those that are his, and where to find them. 

 3. They were bewildered, had no road to travel in, no dwelling place to
 rest in,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 <I>When they were redeemed</I> out of the <I>hand of the enemy, and
 gathered out of the lands,</I> they were in danger of perishing in 
 their return home through the dry and barren deserts. <I>They wandered 
 in the wilderness,</I> where there was no trodden path, no company, but 
 <I>a solitary way,</I> no lodging, no conveniences, no accommodations, 
 no inhabited city where they might have quarters or refreshment. But 
 <I>God led them forth by the right way</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 directed them to an inn, nay, directed them to a home, <I>that they 
 might go to a city of habitation,</I> which was inhabited, nay which 
 them themselves should inhabit. This may refer to poor travellers in 
 general, those particularly whose way lay through the wilds of Arabia, 
 where we may suppose they were often at a loss; and yet many in that 
 distress were wonderfully relieved, so that few perished. Note, We 
 ought to take notice of the good hand of God's providence over us in 
 our journeys, going out and coming in, directing us in our way, and 
 providing for us places both to bait in and rest in. Or (as some think) 
 it has an eye to the wanderings of the children of Israel in the 
 wilderness for forty years; it is said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:10">Deut. xxxii. 10</A>),

 <I>God led them about,</I> and yet here <I>he led them by the right
 way.</I> God's way, though to us it seems about, will appear at last to 
 have been the right way. It is applicable to our condition in this 
 world; we are here as in a wilderness, have here <I>no continuing 
 city,</I> but dwell in tents as strangers and pilgrims. But we are 
 under the guidance of his wise and good providence, and, if we commit 
 ourselves to it, we shall be <I>led in the right way to the city that 
 has foundations.</I> 
 
 4. They were ready to perish for hunger
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Their soul even fainted in them.</I> They were spent with the 
 fatigues of their journey and ready to drop down for want of 
 refreshment. Those that have constant plenty, and are every day fed to 
 the full, know not what a miserable case it is to be <I>hungry and 
 thirsty,</I> and to have no supply. This was sometimes the case of 
 Israel in the wilderness, and perhaps of other poor travellers; but 
 God's providence finds out ways to <I>satisfy the longing soul and fill 
 the hungry soul with goodness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Israel's wants were seasonably supplied, and many have been wonderfully
 relieved when they were ready to perish. The same God that has led us 
 has fed us all our life long unto this day, has fed us with food 
 convenient, has provided food for the soul, <I>and filled the hungry 
 soul with goodness. Those that hunger and thirst after 
 righteousness,</I> after God, the living God, and communion with him, 
 shall be abundantly <I>replenished with the goodness of his house,</I> 
 both in grace and glory. Now for all this those who receive mercy are 
 called upon to return thanks

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Oh that men</I> (it is meant especially of those men whom God has 
 graciously relieved) <I>would praise the Lord for his goodness</I> to 
 them in particular, <I>and for his wonderful works to</I> others of 
 <I>the children of men!</I> Note, 

 (1.) God's works of mercy are wonderful works, works of wonderful power 
 considering the weakness, and of wonderful grace considering the 
 unworthiness, of those he shows mercy to. 

 (2.) It is expected of those who receive mercy from God that they 
 return praise to him. 

 (3.) We must acknowledge God's goodness to the children of men as well 
 as to the children of God, to others as well as to ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, <I>being</I>
 bound in affliction and iron;
 &nbsp; 11  Because they rebelled against the words of God, and
 contemned the counsel of the most High:
 &nbsp; 12  Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
 down, and <I>there was</I> none to help.
 &nbsp; 13  Then they cried unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> in their trouble, <I>and</I> he
 saved them out of their distresses.
 &nbsp; 14  He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and
 brake their bands in sunder.
 &nbsp; 15  Oh that <I>men</I> would praise the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>for</I> his goodness, and
 <I>for</I> his wonderful works to the children of men!
 &nbsp; 16  For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of
 iron in sunder.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are to take notice of the goodness of God towards prisoners and 
 captives. Observe, 

 1. A description of this affliction. Prisoners are said to <I>sit in
 darkness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 in dark dungeons, close prisons, which intimates that they are desolate 
 and disconsolate; they sit <I>in the shadow of death,</I> which 
 intimates not only great distress and trouble, but great danger. 
 Prisoners are many times appointed to die; they sit despairing to get 
 out, but resolving to make the best of it. They are <I>bound in 
 affliction, and</I> many times <I>in iron,</I> as Joseph. Thus sore a 
 calamity is imprisonment, which should make us prize liberty, and be 
 thankful for it. 
 
 2. The cause of this affliction,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 It is <I>because they rebelled against the words of God.</I> Wilful sin
 is rebellion against the words of God; it is a contradiction to his 
 truths and a violation of his laws. <I>They contemned the counsel of 
 the Most High,</I> and thought they neither needed it nor could be the 
 better for it; and those that will not be counselled cannot be helped. 
 Those that despise prophesying, that regard not the admonitions of 
 their own consciences nor the just reproofs of their friends, contemn 
 the counsel of the Most High, and for this they are bound in 
 affliction, both to punish them for and to reclaim them from their 
 rebellions. 

 3. The design of this affliction, and that is to bring <I>down their
 heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 to humble them for sin, to make them low in their own eyes, to cast 
 down every high, proud, aspiring thought. Afflicting providences must 
 be improved as humbling providences; and we not only lose the benefit 
 of them, but thwart God's designs and walk contrary to him in them if 
 our hearts be unhumbled and unbroken, as high and hard as ever under 
 them. Is the estate brought down with labour, the honour sunk? Have
 those that exalted themselves fallen down, and is there none to help 
 them? Let this bring down the spirit to confess sin, to accept the 
 punishment of it, and humbly to sue for mercy and grace. 

 4. The duty of this afflicted state, and that is to pray

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble,</I> though before 
 perhaps they had neglected him. Prisoners have time to pray, who, when 
 they were at liberty, could not find time; they see they have need of 
 God's help, though formerly they thought they could do well enough 
 without him. Sense will make men cry when they are in trouble, but
 grace will direct them to cry unto the Lord, from whom the affliction 
 comes and who alone can remove it.

 5. Their deliverance out of the affliction: <I>They cried unto the
 Lord, and he saved them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 <I>He brought them out of darkness into light,</I> welcome light, and
 then doubly sweet and pleasant, <I>brought them out of the shadow of 
 death</I> to the comforts of life, and their liberty was to them life 
 from the dead, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Were they <I>fettered? He broke their bands asunder.</I> Were they
 imprisoned in strong castles? <I>He broke the gates of brass</I> and 
 the <I>bars of iron</I> wherewith those gates were made fast; he did 
 not put back, but <I>cut in sunder.</I> Note, When God will work 
 deliverance the greatest difficulties that lie in the way shall be made 
 nothing of. Gates of brass and bars of iron, as they cannot keep him 
 out from him people (he was with Joseph in the prison), so they cannot 
 keep them in when the time, the set-time, for their enlargement, comes.

 6. The return that is required from those whose bands God has loosed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Let them praise the Lord for his goodness,</I> and take occasion 
 from their own experience of it, and share in it, to bless him for that 
 goodness which the earth is full of, <I>the world and those that dwell 
 therein.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Bodily sickness is another of the calamities of this life which gives 
 us an opportunity of experiencing the goodness of God in recovering us, 
 and of that the psalmist speaks in these verses, where we may
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That we, by our sins, bring sickness upon ourselves and then it is 
 our duty to pray, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:17-18"><I>v.</I> 17-19</A>.

 1. It is the sin of the soul that is the cause of sickness; we bring it
 upon ourselves both meritoriously and efficiently: <I>Fools, because of 
 their transgression, are thus afflicted;</I> they are thus corrected 
 for the sins they have committed and thus cured of their evil 
 inclinations to sin. If we knew no sin, we should know no sickness; but 
 the transgression of our life, and the iniquity of our heart, make it 
 necessary. Sinners are fools; they wrong themselves, and all against 
 their own interest, not only their spiritual, but their secular 
 interest. They prejudice their bodily health by intemperance and 
 endanger their lives by indulging their appetites. This their way is 
 their folly, and they need the rod of correction to drive out the 
 foolishness that is bound up in their hearts. 

 2. The weakness of the body is the effect of sickness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.
 
 When people are sick <I>their soul abhors all manner of meat;</I> they
 not only have no desire to eat nor power to digest it, but they 
 nauseate it, and their stomach is turned against it. And here they may 
 read their sin in their punishment: those that doted most on the meat 
 that perishes, when they come to be sick are sick of it, and the 
 dainties they loved are loathed; what they took too much of now they 
 can take nothing of, which commonly follows upon the overcharging of 
 the heart with surfeiting and drunkenness. And when the appetite is 
 gone the life is as good as gone: <I>They draw near unto the gates of 
 death;</I> they are, in their own apprehension and in the apprehension 
 of all about them, at the brink of the grave, as ready to be turned to 
 destruction. 

 3. Then is a proper time for prayer: <I>Then they cry unto the
 Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Is any sick? Let him pray; let him be prayed for. Prayer is a salve
 for every sore.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That it is by the power and mercy of God that we are recovered from 
 sickness, and then it is our duty to be thankful. Compare with this 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:18,28">Job xxxiii. 18, 28</A>.

 1. When those that are sick call upon God he returns them an answer of
 peace. They cry unto him and he <I>saves them out of their 
 distresses</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 he removes their griefs and prevents their fears. 

 (1.) He does it easily: <I>He sent his word and healed them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 This may be applied to the miraculous cures which Christ wrought when
 he was upon earth, by a word's speaking; he said, <I>Be clean, Be 
 whole,</I> and the work was done. It may also be applied to the 
 spiritual cures which the Spirit of grace works in regeneration; he 
 sends his word, and heals souls, convinces, converts, sanctifies them, 
 and all by the word. In the common instances of recovery from sickness 
 God in his providence does but speak, and it is done. 

 (2.) He does it effectually: <I>He delivereth them out of their 
 destructions,</I> that they shall neither be destroyed nor distressed 
 with the fear of being so. Nothing is too hard for that God to do who 
 kills and makes alive again, brings down to the grave and raises up, 
 who <I>turneth man</I> almost <I>to destruction,</I> and yet saith, 
 <I>Return.</I> 

 2. When those that have been sick are restored they must return to God 
 an answer of praise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>):

 <I>Let all men praise the Lord for his goodness,</I> and let those, 
 particularly, to whom God has thus granted a new life, spend it in his 
 service; <I>let them sacrifice with thanksgiving,</I> not only bring a 
 thank-offering to the altar, but a thankful heart to God.
 Thanksgivings are the best thank-offerings, and shall please the Lord 
 better than an ox or bullock. <I>And let them declare his works with 
 rejoicing,</I> to his honour and for the encouragement of others.
 <I>The living, the living, they shall praise him.</I></P>

 bringeth them out of their distresses.
 &nbsp; 29  He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are
 still.
 &nbsp; 30  Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth
 them unto their desired haven.
 &nbsp; 31  Oh that <I>men</I> would praise the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>for</I> his goodness, and
 <I>for</I> his wonderful works to the children of men!
 &nbsp; 32  Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people,
 and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist here calls upon those to give glory to God who are 
 delivered from dangers at sea. Though the Israelites dealt not much in 
 merchandise, yet their neighbours the Tyrians and Zidonians did, and 
 for them perhaps this part of the psalm was especially calculated.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Much of the power of God appears at all times in the sea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 It appears to those <I>that go down to the sea in ships,</I> as
 mariners, merchants, fishermen, or passengers, <I>that do business in 
 great waters.</I> And surely none will expose themselves there but 
 those that have business (among all Solomon's pleasant things we do not 
 read of any pleasure-boat he had), but those that go on business, 
 lawful business, may, in faith, put themselves under the divine 
 protection. <I>These see the works of the Lord, and his wonders,</I>
 which are the more surprising, because most are born and bred upon 
 land, and what passes at sea is new to them. The deep itself is a 
 wonder, its vastness, its saltness, its ebbing and flowing. The great 
 variety of living creatures in the sea is wonderful. Let those that go 
 to sea be led, by all the wonders they observe there, to consider and 
 adore the infinite perfections of that God whose the sea is, for he 
 made it and manages it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It especially appears in storms at sea, which are much more 
 terrible than at land. Observe here, 

 1. How dangerous and dreadful a tempest at sea is. <I>Then</I> wonders
 begin to appear in the deep, when God <I>commands and raises the</I> 
 strong <I>wind,</I> which <I>fulfils his word,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+148:8">Ps. cxlviii. 8</A>.

 He raises the winds, as a prince by his commission raises forces. Satan 
 pretends to be the <I>prince of the power of the air;</I> but he is a 
 pretender; the powers of the air are at God's command, not at his. When 
 the wind becomes stormy it <I>lifts up the waves</I> of the sea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 Then the ships are kicked like tennis-balls on the tops of the waves;
 they seem to <I>mount up to the heavens,</I> and then they couch again, 
 as if they would <I>go down to the depths,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 A stranger, who had never seen it, would not think it possible for a
 ship to live at sea, as it will in a storm, and ride it out, but would 
 expect that the next wave would bury it and it would never come up 
 again; and yet God, who taught man discretion to make ships that should 
 so strangely keep above water, does by his special providence preserve 
 them, that they answer the end to admiration. When the ships are thus 
 tossed the <I>soul</I> of the seaman <I>melts because of trouble;</I> 
 and, when the storm is very high, even those that are used to the sea 
 can neither shake off nor dissemble their fears, but <I>they reel to 
 and fro,</I> and tossing makes them giddy, <I>and</I> they 
 <I>stagger</I> and are sick, it may be, <I>like a drunken man;</I> the 
 whole ship's crew are in confusion <I>and</I> quite <I>at their wits' 
 end</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),

 not knowing what to do more for their preservation; all their wisdom is 
 swallowed up, and they are ready to give up themselves for gone,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jon+1:5-11">Jonah i. 5</A>,

 &c. 

 2. How seasonable it is at such a time to pray. Those that go to sea 
 must expect such perils as are here described, and the best preparation 
 they can make for them is to make sure a liberty of access to God by 
 prayer, for <I>then they</I> will <I>cry unto the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 We have a saying, "Let those that would learn to pray go to sea;" I
 say, Let those that will go to sea learn to pray, and accustom 
 themselves to pray, that they may come with the more boldness to the 
 throne of grace when they are in trouble. Even heathen mariners, in a 
 storm, <I>cried every man to his god;</I> but those that have the Lord 
 for their God have a present and powerful help in that and every other 
 time of need, so that when they are at their wits' end they are not at 
 their faith's end. 

 3. How wonderfully God sometimes appears for those that are in distress
 at sea, in answer to their prayers: <I>He brings them out</I> of the 
 danger; and,

 (1.) The sea is still: <I>He makes the storm a calm,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 The winds fall, and only by their soft and gentle murmurs serve to lull
 the waves asleep again, so that the surface of the sea becomes smooth 
 and smiling. By this Christ proved himself to be more than a man 
 <I>that even the winds and the seas obeyed him.</I> 

 (2.) The seamen are made easy: <I>They are glad because they are 
 quiet,</I> quiet from the noise, quiet from the fear of evil. Quietness 
 after a storm is a very desirable thing, and sensibly pleasant. 

 (3.) The voyage becomes prosperous and successful: <I>So he brings them 
 to their desired haven,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 Thus he carries his people safely through all the storms and tempests
 that they meet with in their voyage heaven-ward, and lands them, at 
 length, in the desired harbour. 

 4. How justly it is expected that all those who have had a safe passage 
 over the sea, and especially who have been delivered from remarkable 
 perils at sea, should acknowledge it with thankfulness, to the glory of 
 God. Let them do it privately in their closets and families. Let them
 <I>praise the Lord for his goodness</I> to themselves and others,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 
 Let them do it publicly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 <I>in the congregation of the people and in the assembly of the 
 elders;</I> there let them erect the memorials of their deliverance, to 
 the honour of God, and for the encouragement of others to trust 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>33  He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings
 into dry ground;
 &nbsp; 34  A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
 that dwell therein.
 &nbsp; 35  He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry
 ground into watersprings.
 &nbsp; 36  And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may
 prepare a city for habitation;
 &nbsp; 37  And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield
 fruits of increase.
 &nbsp; 38  He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
 and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
 &nbsp; 39  Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
 affliction, and sorrow.
 &nbsp; 40  He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander
 in the wilderness, <I>where there is</I> no way.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist, having given God the glory of the providential reliefs 
 granted to persons in distress, here gives him the glory of the 
 revolutions of providence, and the surprising changes it sometimes 
 makes in the affairs of the children of men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He gives some instances of these revolutions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Fruitful countries are made barren and barren countries are made 
 fruitful. Much of the comfort of this life depends upon the soil in 
 which our lot is cast. Now, 

 (1.) The sin of man has often marred the fruitfulness of the soil and 
 made it unserviceable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:33,34"><I>v.</I> 33, 34</A>.

 Land watered with <I>rivers</I> is sometimes <I>turned into a
 wilderness,</I> and that which had been full of water-springs now has 
 not so much as water-streams; it is turned <I>into dry</I> and <I>sandy 
 ground,</I> that has not consistency and moisture enough to produce any 
 thing valuable. Many <I>a fruitful land</I> is turned into saltness, 
 not so much from natural causes as from the just judgment of God, who 
 thus punished <I>the wickedness of those that dwell therein;</I> as the 
 vale of Sodom became a salt sea. Note, If the land be bad, it is 
 because the inhabitants are so. Justly is the ground made unfruitful to 
 those that bring not forth fruit unto God, but serve Baal with their 
 corn and wine. 

 (2.) The goodness of God has often mended the barrenness of the soil, 
 and turned a <I>wilderness,</I> a land o drought, <I>into 
 water-springs,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 The land of Canaan, which was once the glory of all lands for
 fruitfulness, is said to be, at this day, a fruitless, useless, 
 worthless spot of ground, as was foretold,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:23">Deut. xxix. 23</A>.

 This land of ours, which formerly was much of it an uncultivated
 desert, is now full of all good things, and <I>more abundant honour</I> 
 is <I>given to that part which lacked.</I> Let the plantations in 
 America, and the colonies settled there, compared with the desolations 
 of many countries in Asia and Europe, that formerly were famous, 
 expound this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Necessitous families are raised and enriched, while prosperous 
 families are impoverished and go to decay. If we look broad in the 
 world, 

 (1.) We see many greatly increasing whose beginning was small, and 
 whose ancestors were mean and made no figure,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:36-38"><I>v.</I> 36-38</A>.

 Those that were <I>hungry</I> are made <I>to dwell</I> in fruitful
 lands; there they take root, and gain a settlement, and <I>prepare a 
 city for habitation</I> for themselves and theirs after them. 
 Providence puts good land under their hands, and they build upon it. 
 Cities took rise from rising families. But as lands, will not serve for 
 men without lodgings, and therefore they must <I>prepare a city of 
 habitation,</I> so lodgings, though ever so convenient, will not serve 
 without lands, and therefore they must <I>sow the fields, and plant 
 vineyards</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:37"><I>v.</I> 37</A>),

 for the king himself is served of the field. And yet the fields, though 
 favoured with water-springs, will not <I>yield fruits of increase,</I> 
 unless they be sown, nor will vineyards be had, unless they be planted; 
 man's industry must attend God's blessing, and then God's blessing will 
 crown man's industry. The fruitfulness of the soil should engage, for 
 it does encourage, diligence; and, ordinarily, <I>the hand of the 
 diligent,</I> by the blessing of God, <I>makes rich,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.

 <I>He blesses them also, so that they are,</I> in a little time,
 <I>multiplied greatly, and</I> he <I>diminishes not their cattle.</I> 
 As in the beginning, so still it is, by the blessing of God, that the 
 earth and all the creatures <I>increase and multiply</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:22">Gen. i. 22</A>),
 
 and we depend upon God for the increase of the cattle as well as for
 the increase of the ground. Cattle would decrease many ways if God 
 should permit it, and men would soon suffer by it.

 (2.) We see many that have thus suddenly risen as suddenly sunk and
 brought to nothing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 <I>Again they are diminished and brought low</I> by adverse 
 providences, and end their days as low as they began them; or their 
 families after them lose as fast as they got, and scatter what they
 heaped together. Note, Worldly wealth is an uncertain thing, and often 
 those that are filled with it, ere they are aware, grow so secure and 
 sensual with it that, ere they are aware, they lose it again. Hence it 
 is called <I>deceitful riches</I> and the <I>mammon of 
 unrighteousness.</I> God has many ways of making men poor; he can do it 
 by <I>oppression, affliction, and sorrow,</I> as he tempted Job and 
 brought him low.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Those that were high and great in the world are abased, and those 
 that were mean and despicable are advanced to honour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:40,41"><I>v.</I> 40, 41</A>.

 We have seen, 

 (1.) Princes dethroned and reduced to straits. <I>He pours contempt 
 upon</I> them, even among those that have idolized them. Those that
 exalt themselves God will abase, and, in order thereunto, will 
 infatuate: He makes <I>them to wander in the wilderness, where there is 
 no way.</I> He baffles those counsels by which they thought to support 
 themselves, and their own power and pomp, and drives them headlong, so 
 that they know not what course to steer, nor what measures to take. We 
 met with this before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:24,25">Job xii. 24, 25</A>.

 (2.) Those of low degree advanced to the posts of honour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:41"><I>v.</I> 41</A>):

 <I>Yet setteth he the poor on high,</I> raiseth <I>from the dust</I> to
 the <I>throne of glory,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:8,Ps+113:7,8">1 Sam. ii. 8; Ps. cxiii. 7, 8</A>.

 Those that were afflicted and trampled on are not only delivered, but
 set on high out of the reach of their troubles, above their enemies, 
 and have dominion over those to whom they had been in subjection. That 
 which adds to their honour, and strengthens them in their elevation, is 
 the multitude of their children: <I>He maketh him families like a 
 flock</I> of sheep, so numerous, so useful, so sociable with one 
 another, and so meek and peaceable. He that sent them meat sent them 
 mouths. <I>Happy is the man that has his quiver filled</I> with arrows, 
 for he shall boldly <I>speak with the enemy in the gate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:5">Ps. cxxvii. 5</A>.

 God is to be acknowledged both in setting up families and in building 
 them up. Let not princes be envied, nor the poor despised, for God has 
 many ways of changing the condition of both.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He makes some improvement of these remarks; such surprising turns 
 as these are of use, 

 1. For the solacing of saints. They observe these dispensations with
 pleasure

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:42"><I>v.</I> 42</A>):

 <I>The righteous shall see it and rejoice</I> in the glorifying of 
 God's attributes and the manifesting of his dominion over the children 
 of men. It is a great comfort to a good man to see how God manages the 
 children of men, as the potter does the clay, so as to serve his own 
 purposes by them, to see despised virtue advanced and impious pride 
 brought low to the dust, to see it evinced beyond dispute that 
 <I>verily there is a God that judges in the earth.</I> 

 2. For the silencing of sinners: <I>All iniquity shall stop her 
 mouth;</I> it shall be a full conviction of the folly of atheists, and 
 of those that deny the divine providence; and, forasmuch as practical 
 atheism is at the bottom of all sin, it shall in effect <I>stop the 
 mouth of all iniquity.</I> When sinners see how their punishment 
 answers to their sin, and how justly God deals with them in taking away 
 from them those gifts of his which they had abused, they shall not have 
 one word to say for themselves; for God will be justified, he will be 
 clear. 
 
 3. For the satisfying of all concerning the divine goodness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>):

 <I>Whoso is wise, and will observe these things,</I> these various 
 dispensations of divine providence, <I>even they shall understand the 
 lovingkindness of the Lord.</I> Here is, 

 (1.) A desirable end proposed, and that is, rightly to <I>understand 
 the loving kindness of the Lord.</I> It is of great use to us, in 
 religion, to be fully assured of God's goodness, to be experimentally 
 acquainted and duly affected with it, that his <I>lovingkindness</I> 
 may be <I>before our eyes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:3">Ps. xxvi. 3</A>.

 (2.) A proper means prescribed for attaining this end, and that is a
 due observance of God's providence. We must lay up these things, mind
 them, and keep them in mind,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:19">Luke ii. 19</A>.

 (3.) A commendation of the use of this means as an instance of true
 wisdom: <I>Whoso is wise,</I> let him by this both prove his wisdom and
 improve it. A prudent observance of the providences of God will
 contribute very much to the accomplishing of a good Christian.</P>
