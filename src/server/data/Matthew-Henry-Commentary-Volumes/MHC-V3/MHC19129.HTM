 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm relates to the public concerns of God's Israel. It is not 
 certain when it was penned, probably when they were in captivity in 
 Babylon, or about the time of their return. 

 I. They look back with thankfulness for the former deliverances God had
 wrought for them and their fathers out of the many distresses they had 
 been in from time to time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+129:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. They look forward with a believing prayer for and a prospect of the
 destruction of all the enemies of Zion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+129:5-8">ver. 5-8</A>.

 In singing this psalm we may apply it both ways to the Gospel-Israel, 
 which, like the Old-Testament Israel, has weathered many a storm and is 
 still threatened by many enemies.</P>

 <P>A song of degrees.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Many a time have they afflicted me
 from my youth, may Israel now say:
 &nbsp; 2  Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they
 have not prevailed against me.
 &nbsp; 3  The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their
 furrows.
 &nbsp; 4  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the
 wicked.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The church of God, in its several ages, is here spoken of, or, rather, 
 here speaks, as one single person, now old and gray-headed, but calling 
 to remembrance the former days, and reflecting upon the times of old. 
 And, upon the review, it is found, 

 1.  That the church has been often greatly distressed by its enemies on
 earth: <I>Israel may now say,</I> "I am the people that has been 
 oppressed more than any people, that has been <I>as a speckled 
 bird,</I> pecked at by <I>all the birds round about,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:9">Jer. xii. 9</A>.

 It is true, they brought their troubles upon themselves by their sins; 
 it was for them that God punished them; but it was for the peculiarity 
 of their covenant, and the singularities of their religion, that their 
 neighbours hated and persecuted them. "For these <I>many a time have 
 they afflicted me from my youth.</I>" Note, God's people have always 
 had many enemies, and the state of the church, from its infancy, has 
 frequently been an afflicted state. Israel's youth was in Egypt, or in 
 the times of the Judges; then they were afflicted, and thenceforward 
 more or less. The gospel-church, ever since it had a being, has been at 
 times afflicted; and it bore this yoke most of all in its youth, 
 witness the ten persecutions which the primitive church groaned under. 
 <I>The ploughers ploughed upon my back,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+129:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 We read
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+125:3">Ps. cxxv. 3</A>)
 
 of <I>the rod of the wicked upon the lot of the righteous,</I> where we 
 rather expected the plough, to mark it out for themselves; here we read 
 of the <I>plough</I> of the wicked <I>upon the back of the 
 righteous,</I> where we rather expected to find the rod. But the 
 metaphors in these places may be said to be <I>crossed;</I> the sense 
 however of both is the same, and is too plain, that the enemies of 
 God's people have all along used them very barbarously. They tore them, 
 as the husbandman tears the ground with his plough-share, to pull them 
 to pieces and get all they could out of them, and so to <I>wear out the 
 saints of the Most High,</I> as the ground is worn out that has been 
 long tilled, tilled (as we say) quite out of heart. When God permitted 
 them to plough thus he intended it for his people's good, that, their 
 fallow ground being thus broken up, he might sow the seeds of his grace 
 upon them, and reap a harvest of good fruit from them: howbeit, the 
 enemies meant not so, neither did their hearts think so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:7">Isa. x. 7</A>);
 
 <I>they made long their furrows,</I> never knew when to have done, 
 aiming at nothing less than the destruction of the church. Many by the 
 <I>furrows</I> they made on the backs of God's people understand the 
 stripes they gave them. <I>The cutters cut upon my back,</I> so they 
 read it. The saints have often <I>had trials of cruel scourgings</I> 
 (probably the captives had) <I>and cruel mockings</I> (for we read of 
 the scourge or lash of the tongue, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:36">Heb. xi. 36</A>),

 and so it was fulfilled in Christ, who <I>gave his back to the 
 smiters,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:6">Isa. l. 6</A>.

 Or it may refer to the desolations they made of the cities of Israel. 
 <I>Zion shall, for your sake, be ploughed as a field,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:12">Mic.  iii. 12</A>.

 2. That the church has been always graciously delivered by her friend 
 in heaven. 

 (1.) The enemies' projects have been defeated. They have afflicted the 
 church, in hopes to ruin it, but they have not gained their point. Many 
 a storm it has weathered; many a shock, and many a brunt, it has borne; 
 and yet it is in being: <I>They have not prevailed against me.</I> One 
 would wonder how this ship has lived at sea, when it has been tossed 
 with tempests, and all the waves and billows have gone over it. Christ 
 has built his church upon a rock, and the gates of hell have not 
 prevailed against it, nor ever shall.  

 (2.) The enemies' power has been broken: God <I>has cut asunder the 
 cords of the wicked,</I> has cut their gears, their traces, and so 
 spoiled their ploughing, has cut their scourges, and so spoiled their 
 lashing, has cut the bands of union by which they were combined 
 together, has cut the bands of captivity in which they held God's 
 people. God has many ways of disabling wicked men to do the mischief 
 they design against his church and shaming their counsels. These words, 
 <I>The Lord is righteous,</I> may refer either to the distresses or to 
 the deliverances of the church.

 [1.] <I>The Lord is righteous</I> in suffering Israel to be afflicted. 
 This the people of God were always ready to own, that, how unjust 
 soever their enemies were, God was <I>just in all that was brought upon 
 them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:33">Neh. ix. 33</A>.

 [2.] <I>The Lord is righteous</I> in not suffering Israel to be ruined;
 for he has promised to preserve it a people to himself, and he will be 
 as good as his word. He is righteous in reckoning with their 
 persecutors, and rendering to them <I>a recompence,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
 &nbsp; 6  Let them be as the grass <I>upon</I> the housetops, which
 withereth afore it groweth up:
 &nbsp; 7  Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth
 sheaves his bosom.
 &nbsp; 8  Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 <I>be</I> upon you: we bless you in the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist, having triumphed in the defeat of the many designs that 
 had been laid as deep as hell to ruin the church, here concludes his 
 psalm as Deborah did her song, <I>So let all thy enemies perish, O 
 Lord!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:31">Judg.  v. 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. There are many that hate Zion, that hate Zion's God, his worship, 
 and his worshippers, that have an antipathy to religion and religious 
 people, that seek the ruin of both, and do what they can that God may 
 not have a church in the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We ought to pray that all their attempts against the church may be 
 frustrated, that in them they may be <I>confounded</I> and <I>turned 
 back</I> with shame, as those that have not been able to bring to pass 
 their enterprise and expectation: <I>Let them all be confounded</I> is 
 as much as, <I>They shall be</I> all confounded. The confusion 
 imprecated and predicted is illustrated by a similitude; while God's 
 people shall flourish as the loaded palm-tree, or the green and 
 fruitful olive, their enemies shall <I>wither as the grass upon the 
 house-top.</I> As men they are not to be feared, for they shall be made 
 as grass, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:12">Isa. li. 12</A>.

 But as they are enemies to Zion they are so certainly marked for ruin 
 that they may be looked upon with as much contempt as the grass on the 
 house-tops, which is little, and short, and sour, and good for nothing. 
 
 1. It perishes quickly: It <I>withers before it grows up</I> to any
 maturity, having no root; and the higher its place is, which perhaps is 
 its pride, the more it is exposed to the scorching heat of the sun, and 
 consequently the sooner does it wither.  <I>It withers before it is 
 plucked up,</I> so some read it. The enemies of God's church wither of 
 themselves, and stay not till they are rooted out by the judgments of 
 God. 

 2. It is of no use to any body; nor are <I>they</I> any thing but the
 unprofitable burdens of the earth, nor will their attempts against Zion 
 ever ripen or come to any head, nor, whatever they promise themselves, 
 will they get any more by them than the husbandman does by the grass on 
 his house-top. Their <I>harvest will be a heap in the day of grief,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:11">Isa.  xvii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. No wise man will pray God to bless the mowers or reapers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+129:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. It has been an ancient and laudable custom not only to salute and 
 wish a good day to strangers and travellers, but particularly to pray 
 for the prosperity of harvest-labourers. Thus Boas prayed for his 
 reapers.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:4">Ruth ii. 4</A>,

 <I>The Lord be with you.</I> We must thus acknowledge God's providence, 
 testify our good-will to our neighbours, and commend their industry, 
 and it will be accepted of God as a pious ejaculation if it come from a 
 devout and upright heart. 

 2.  Religious expressions, being sacred things, must never be made use
 of in light and ludicrous actions.  Mowing the grass on the house-top 
 would be a jest, and therefore those that have a reverence for the name 
 of God will not prostitute to it the usual forms of salutation, which 
 savoured of devotion; for holy things must not be jested with. 

 3. It is a dangerous thing to let the church's enemies have our good
 wishes in their designs against the church. If we <I>wish them God 
 speed, we are partakers of their evil deeds,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Jo+1:11">
 2 John 11</A>.

 When it is said, None will bless them, and show them respect, more is
 implied, namely, that all wise and good people will cry out shame on 
 them, and beg of God to defeat them; and woe to those that have the 
 prayers of the saints against them. <I>I cursed his habitation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:3">Job v. 3</A>.</P>
