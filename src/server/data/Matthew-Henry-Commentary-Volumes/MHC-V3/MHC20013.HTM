 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  A wise son <I>heareth</I> his father's instruction: but a scorner
 heareth not rebuke.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Among the children of the same parents it is no new thing for some to 
 be hopeful and others the contrary; now here we are taught to 
 distinguish. 

 1. There is great hope of those that have a reverence for their 
 parents, and are willing to be advised and admonished by them. He is 
 <I>a wise son,</I> and is in a far way to be wiser, that <I>hears his 
 father's instruction,</I> desires to hear it, regards it, and complies 
 with it, and does not merely give it the hearing. 

 2. There is little hope of those that will not so much as <I>hear 
 rebuke</I> with any patience, but scorn to submit to government and 
 scoff at those that deal faithfully with them. How can those mend a 
 fault who will not be told of it, but count those their enemies who do 
 them that kindness?</P>

 <A NAME="Pr13_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  A man shall eat good by the fruit of <I>his</I> mouth: but the
 soul of the transgressors <I>shall eat</I> violence.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. If that which comes from within, out of the heart, be good, and from 
 a good treasure, it will return with advantage. Inward comfort and 
 satisfaction will be daily bread; nay, it will be a continual feast to 
 those who delight in that communication which is <I>to the use of 
 edifying.</I> 

 2. Violence done will recoil in the face of him that does it: <I>The 
 soul of the transgressors</I> that harbours and plots mischief, and 
 vents it by word and deed, <I>shall eat violence;</I> they shall have 
 their belly full of it. <I>Reward her as she has rewarded thee,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:6">Rev. xviii. 6</A>.

 we must be justified or condemned,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: <I>but</I> he that
 openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. A guard upon the lips is a guard to the soul. He that is cautious, 
 that thinks twice before he speaks once, that, if he have <I>thought 
 evil, lays his hand upon his mouth</I> to suppress it, that keeps a 
 strong bridle on his tongue and a strict hand on that bridle, he 
 <I>keeps his soul</I> from a great deal both of guilt and grief and 
 saves himself the trouble of many bitter reflections on himself and 
 reflections of others upon him. 

 2. There is many a one ruined by an ungoverned tongue: <I>He that opens 
 widely his lips,</I> to let our <I>quod in buccam venerit--whatever 
 comes uppermost,</I> that loves to bawl, and bluster, and make a noise, 
 and affects such a liberty of speech as bids defiance both to God and 
 man, he <I>shall have destruction.</I> it will be the destruction of 
 his reputation, his interest, his comfort, and his soul for ever,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  The soul of the sluggard desireth, and <I>hath</I> nothing: but
 the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The misery and shame of the slothful. See how foolish and absurd 
 they are; they desire the gains which the diligent get, but they hate 
 the pains which the diligent take; they covet every thing that is to be 
 coveted, but will do nothing that is to be done; and therefore it 
 follows, They have nothing; for he that will not labour let him hunger, 
 and let him not <I>eat,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:10">2 Thess. iii. 10</A>.

 <I>The desire of the slothful,</I> which should be his excitement, is 
 his torment, which should make him busy, makes him always uneasy, and 
 is really a greater toil to him than labour would be. 

 2. The happiness and honour of the diligent: Their <I>soul shall be 
 made fat;</I> they shall have abundance, and shall have the comfortable 
 enjoyment of it, and the more for its being the fruit of their 
 diligence. This is especially true in spiritual affairs. Those that 
 rest in idle wishes know not what the advantages of religion are; 
 whereas those that take pains in the service of God find both the 
 pleasure and profit of it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  A righteous <I>man</I> hateth lying: but a wicked <I>man</I> is
 loathsome, and cometh to shame.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Where grace reigns sin is loathsome. It is the undoubted character 
 of every <I>righteous man</I> that he <I>hates lying</I> (that is, all 
 sin, for every sin is a lie, and particularly all fraud and falsehood 
 in commerce and conversation), not only that he will not tell a lie, 
 but he abhors lying, from a rooted reigning principle of love to truth 
 and justice, and conformity to God. 

 2. Where sin reigns the <I>man is loathsome.</I> If his eyes were 
 opened, and his conscience awakened, he would be so to himself, he 
 would <I>abhor himself and repent in dust and ashes;</I> however, he is 
 so to God and all good men; particularly, he makes himself so by lying, 
 than which there is nothing more detestable. And, though he may think 
 to face it out awhile, yet he will <I>come to shame</I> and contempt at 
 last and will blush to show his face,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. Saints secured from ruin. Those that are <I>upright in their 
 way,</I> that mean honestly in all their actions, adhere 
 conscientiously to the sacred and eternal rules of equity, and deal 
 sincerely both with God and man, their integrity will keep them from 
 the temptations of Satan, which shall not prevail over them, the 
 reproaches and injuries of evil men, which shall not fasten upon them, 
 to do them any real mischief,

 2. Sinners secured for ruin. Those that are wicked, even their 
 wickedness will be their overthrow at last, and they are held in the 
 cords of it in the mean time. Are they corrected, destroyed? It is 
 their own wickedness that corrects them, that destroys them; they alone 
 shall bear it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  There is that maketh himself rich, yet <I>hath</I> nothing: <I>there
 is</I> that maketh himself poor, yet <I>hath</I> great riches.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This observation is applicable,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To men's worldly estate. The world is a great cheat, not only the 
 things of the world, but the men of the world. <I>All men are 
 liars.</I> Here is an instance in two sore evils under the sun:--

 1. Some that are really poor would be thought to be rich and are
 thought to be so; they trade and spend as if they were rich, make a 
 great bustle and a great show as if they had hidden treasures, when 
 perhaps, if all their debts were paid, they are not worth a groat. This 
 is sin, and will be shame; many a one hereby ruins his family and 
 brings reproach upon his profession of religion. Those that thus live 
 above what they have choose to be subject to their own pride rather 
 than to God's providence, and it will end accordingly. 

 2. Some that are really rich would be thought to be poor, and are 
 thought to be so, because they sordidly and meanly live below what God 
 has given them, and choose rather to bury it than to use it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+6:1,2">Eccl. vi. 1, 2</A>.

 In this there is an ingratitude to God, injustice to the family and 
 neighbourhood, and uncharitableness to the poor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To their spiritual state. Grace is the riches of the soul; it is 
 true riches; but men commonly misrepresent themselves, either 
 designedly or through mistake and ignorance of themselves. 

 1. There are many presuming hypocrites, that are really poor and empty 
 of grace and yet either think themselves rich, and will not be 
 convinced of their poverty, or pretend themselves rich, and will not 
 own their poverty. 

 2. There are many timorous trembling Christians, that are spiritually
 rich, and full of grace, and yet think themselves poor, and will not be 
 persuaded that they are rich, or, at least, will not own it; by their 
 doubts and fears, their complaints and griefs, they <I>make themselves 
 poor.</I> The former mistake is destroying at last; this is disquieting 
 in the mean time.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr13_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  The ransom of a man's life <I>are</I> his riches: but the poor
 heareth not rebuke.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are apt to judge of men's blessedness, at least in this world, by 
 their wealth, and that they are more or less happy accordingly as they 
 have more or less of this world's goods; but Solomon here shows what a 
 gross mistake it is, that we may be reconciled to a poor condition, and 
 may neither covet riches ourselves nor envy those that have abundance. 

 1. Those that are rich, if by some they are respected for their riches, 
 yet, to balance that, by others they are envied and struck at, and 
 brought in danger of their lives, which therefore they are forced to 
 ransom with their riches. <I>Slay us not, for we have treasures in the 
 field,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:8">Jer. xli. 8</A>.

 Under some tyrants, it has been crime enough to be rich; and how little 
 is a man beholden to his wealth when it only serves to redeem that life 
 which otherwise would not have been exposed!

 2. Those that are poor, if by some, that should be their friends, they 
 are despised and overlooked, yet, to balance that, they are also 
 despised and overlooked by others that would be their enemies if they 
 had any thing to lose: <I>The poor hear not rebuke,</I> are not 
 censured, reproached, accused, nor brought into trouble, as the rich 
 are; for nobody thinks it worth while to take notice of them. When the 
 rich Jews were carried captives to Babylon <I>the poor of the land were 
 left,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+25:12">2 Kings xxv. 12</A>.

 Welcome nothing, once in seven years. <I>Cantabit vacuus coram latrone
 viator</I>--<I>When a traveller is met by a robber he will rejoice at 
 not having much property about him.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the
 wicked shall be put out.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The comfort of good men flourishing and lasting: <I>The light of the 
 righteous rejoices,</I> that is, it increases, and makes them glad. 
 Even their outward prosperity is their joy, and much more those gifts, 
 graces, and comforts, with which their souls are illuminated; these 
 <I>shine more and more,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:18"><I>ch.</I> iv. 18</A>.

 The Spirit is their light, and he gives them a fulness of joy, and
 <I>rejoices to do them good.</I> 

 2. The comfort of bad men withering and dying: <I>The lamp of the 
 wicked</I> burns dimly and faint; it looks melancholy, like a taper in 
 an urn, and it will shortly <I>be put out</I> in utter darkness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:11">Isa. l. 11</A>.

 The light of the righteous is as that of the sun, which may be eclipsed 
 and clouded, but will continue; that of the wicked is as a lamp of 
 their own kindling, which will presently go out and is easily put 
 out.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr13_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised
 <I>is</I> wisdom.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Foolish pride is the great make-bate. Would you know <I>whence come 
 wars and fightings?</I> They come from this root of bitterness.
 Whatever hand other lusts may have in contention (passion, envy, 
 covetousness), pride has the great hand; it is its pride that it will 
 itself sow discord and needs no help. Pride makes men impatient of 
 contradiction in either their opinions or their desires, impatient of 
 competition and rivalship, impatient of contempt, or any thing that 
 looks like a slight, and impatient of concession, and receding, from a 
 conceit of certain right and truth on their side; and hence arise 
 quarrels among relations and neighbours, quarrels in states and 
 kingdoms, in churches and Christian societies. Men will be revenged, 
 will not forgive, because they are proud. 

 2. Those that are humble and peaceable are wise and <I>well 
 advised.</I> Those that will ask and take advice, that will consult 
 their own consciences, their Bibles, their ministers, their friends, 
 and will do nothing rashly, are wise, as in other things, so in this, 
 that they will humble themselves, will stoop and yield, to preserve 
 quietness and prevent quarrels.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr13_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Wealth <I>gotten</I> by vanity shall be diminished: but he that
 gathereth by labour shall increase.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This shows that riches wear as they are won and woven. 

 1. That which is won ill will never wear well, for a curse attends it 
 which will waste it, and the same corrupt dispositions which incline 
 men to the sinful ways of getting well incline them to the like sinful 
 ways of spending: <I>Wealth gotten by vanity</I> will be bestowed upon 
 vanity, and then it <I>will be diminished.</I> That which is got by 
 such employments as are not lawful, or not becoming Christians, such as 
 only serve to feed pride and luxury, that which is got by gaming or by 
 the stage, may as truly be said to be <I>gotten by vanity</I> as that 
 which is got by fraud and lying, and <I>will be diminished. De male 
 qu&aelig;sitis vix gaudet tertius h&aelig;res--Ill-gotten wealth will 
 scarcely be enjoyed by the third generation.</I> 

 2. That which is got by industry and honesty will grow more, instead of 
 growing less; it will be a maintenance; it will be an inheritance; it 
 will be an abundance. <I>He that labours, working with his hands, 
 shall</I> so <I>increase</I> as that he shall <I>have to give to him 
 that needs</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:28">Eph. iv. 28</A>);

 and, when it comes to that, it will increase yet more and more.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr13_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but <I>when</I> the desire
 cometh, <I>it is</I> a tree of life.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Nothing is more grievous than the disappointment of a raised 
 expectation, though not in the thing itself by a denial, yet in the 
 time of it by a delay: <I>Hope deferred makes the heart sick</I> and 
 languishing, fretful and peevish; but hope quite dashed kills the 
 heart, and the more high the expectation was raised the more cutting is 
 the frustration of it. It is therefore our wisdom not to promise 
 ourselves any great matters from the creature, not to feed ourselves 
 with any vain hopes from this world, lest we lay up matter for our own 
 vexation; and what we do hope for let us prepare to be disappointed in, 
 that, if it should prove so, it may prove the easier; and let us not be 
 hasty. 

 2. Nothing is more grateful than to enjoy that, at last, which we have 
 long wished and waited for: <I>When the desire does come</I> it puts 
 men into a sort of paradise, a garden of pleasure, for <I>it is a tree 
 of life.</I> It will aggravate the eternal misery of the wicked that 
 their hopes will be frustrated; and it will make the happiness of 
 heaven the more welcome to the saints that it is what they have 
 earnestly longed for as the crown of their hopes.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that
 feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The character of one that is marked for ruin: He that <I>despises 
 the word</I> of God, and has no regard to it, no veneration for it, nor 
 will be ruled by it, certainly he <I>shall be destroyed,</I> for he 
 slights that which is the only means of curing a destructive disease 
 and makes himself obnoxious to that divine wrath which will certainly 
 be his destruction. Those that prefer the rules of carnal policy before 
 divine precepts, and the allurements of the world and the flesh before 
 God's promises and comforts, despise his word, giving the preference to 
 those things that stand in competition with it; and it is to their own 
 just destruction: they would not take warning. 

 2. The character of one that is sure to be happy: <I>He that fears the 
 commandment,</I> that stands in awe of God, pays a deference to his 
 authority, has a reverence for his word, is afraid of displeasing God 
 and incurring the penalties annexed to the commandment, shall not only 
 escape destruction, but <I>shall be rewarded</I> for his godly fear. 
 <I>In keeping the commandment there is great reward.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  The law of the wise <I>is</I> a fountain of life, to depart from
 the snares of death.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 By <I>the law of the wise</I> and righteous, here, we may understand 
 either the principles and rules by which they govern themselves or 
 (which comes all to one) the instructions which they give to others, 
 which ought to be as a law to all about them; and if they be so, 

 1. They will be constant springs of comfort and satisfaction, as <I>a
 fountain of life,</I> sending forth streams of living water; the closer 
 we keep to those rules the more effectually we secure our own peace. 

 2. They will be constant preservatives from the temptations of Satan.
 Those that follow the dictates of this law will keep at a distance from 
 the snares of sin, and so escape <I>the snares of death</I> which those 
 run into that forsake <I>the law of the wise.</I></P>

 <A NAME="Pr13_15"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of
 transgressors <I>is</I> hard.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 If we compare not only the end, but the way, we shall find that 
 religion has the advantage; for, 

 1. The way of saints is pleasant and agreeable: <I>Good 
 understanding</I> gains <I>favour</I> with God and man; our Saviour 
 grew in that favour when he <I>increased in wisdom.</I> Those that 
 conduct themselves prudently, and order their conversation aright in 
 every thing, that <I>serve Christ in righteousness, and peace, and joy 
 in the Holy Ghost,</I> are <I>accepted of God and approved of men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:17,18">Rom. xiv. 17, 18</A>.

 And how comfortably will that man pass through the world who is well 
 understood and is therefore well accepted! 

 2. The way of sinners is rough and uneasy, and, for <I>this</I> reason, 
 unpleasant to themselves, because unacceptable to others. It is 
 <I>hard,</I> hard upon others, who complain of it, hard to the sinner 
 himself, who can have little enjoyment of himself while he is doing 
 that which is disobliging to all mankind. The service of sin is perfect 
 slavery, and the road to hell is strewed with the thorns and thistles 
 that are the products of the curse. Sinners labour in the very 
 fire.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is wisdom to be cautious. <I>Every prudent</I> discreet 
 <I>man</I> does all <I>with knowledge</I> (considering with himself and 
 consulting with others), acts with deliberation and is upon the 
 reserve, is careful not to meddle with that which he has not some 
 knowledge of, not to launch out into business which he has not 
 acquainted himself with, will not <I>deal with</I> those that he has 
 not some <I>knowledge</I> of, whether they may be confided in. He is 
 still dealing in knowledge, that he may increase the stock he has. 

 2. It is folly to be rash, as the <I>fool</I> is, who is forward to
 talk of things he knows nothing of and undertake that which he is no 
 way fit for, and so <I>lays open his folly</I> and makes himself 
 ridiculous. He <I>began to build and was not able to finish.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have, 

 1. The ill consequences of betraying a trust. <I>A wicked 
 messenger,</I> who, being sent to negotiate any business, is false to 
 him that employed him, divulges his counsels, and so defeats his 
 designs, cannot expect to prosper, but will certainly <I>fall into</I> 
 some <I>mischief</I> or other, will be discovered and punished, since 
 nothing is more hateful to God and man than the treachery of those that 
 have a confidence reposed in them. 

 2. The happy effects of fidelity: An <I>ambassador</I> who 
 <I>faithfully</I> discharges his trust, and serves the interests of 
 those who employ him, <I>is health;</I> he is health to those by whom 
 and for whom he is employed, heals differences that are between them, 
 and preserves a good understanding; he is health to himself, for he 
 secures his own interest. This is applicable to ministers, Christ's 
 messengers and ambassadors; those that are wicked and false to Christ 
 and the souls of men do mischief and <I>fall into mischief,</I> but 
 those that are faithful will find sound words to be healing words to 
 others and themselves.</P>

 Note, 

 1. He that is so proud that he scorns to be taught will certainly be 
 abased. He that <I>refuses</I> the good <I>instruction</I> offered him,
 as if it were a reflection upon his honour and an abridgment of his 
 liberty, <I>poverty and shame shall be to him:</I> he will become a 
 beggar and live and die in disgrace; every one will despise him as 
 foolish, and stubborn, and ungovernable. 

 2. He that is so humble that he takes it well to be told of his faults 
 shall certainly be exalted: <I>He that regards a reproof,</I> whoever 
 gives it to him, and will mend what is amiss when it is shown him, 
 gains respect as wise and candid; he avoids that which would be a 
 disgrace to him and is in a fair way to make himself considerable.</P>

 This shows the folly of those that refuse instruction, for they might 
 be happy and will not. 

 1. They might be happy. There are in man strong desires of happiness; 
 God has provided for the accomplishment of those desires, and that 
 would be <I>sweet to the soul,</I> whereas the pleasures of sense are 
 grateful only to the carnal appetite. <I>The desire</I> of good men 
 towards the favour of God and spiritual blessings brings that which 
 <I>is sweet to their souls;</I> we know those that can say so by 
 experience,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6,7">Ps. iv. 6, 7</A>.

 2. Yet they will not be happy; for <I>it is</I> an <I>abomination 
 to</I> them <I>to depart from evil,</I> which is necessary to their 
 being happy. Never let those expect any thing truly sweet to their 
 souls that will not be persuaded to leave their sins, but that roll 
 them under their tongues as a sweet morsel.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  He that walketh with wise <I>men</I> shall be wise: but a
 companion of fools shall be destroyed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Those that would be good must keep good company, which is an 
 evidence for them that they would be good (men's character is known by 
 the company they choose) and will be a means of making them good, of 
 showing them the way and of quickening and encouraging them in it. He 
 that would be himself wise must walk with those that are so, must 
 choose such for his intimate acquaintance, and converse with them 
 accordingly; must ask and receive instruction from them, and keep up 
 pious and profitable talk with them. <I>Miss not the discourse of the 
 elders, for they also learned of their fathers,</I>

 <U>Ecclesiasticus viii. 9.</U>

 And 
 
 (<U>Ecclesiasticus vi. 35</U>),

 <I>Be willing to hear every godly discourse, and let not the parables 
 of understanding escape thee.</I> 

 2. Multitudes are brought to ruin by bad company: <I>A companion of
 fools shall be broken</I> (so some), <I>shall be known</I> (so the 
 LXX.), known to be a fool; <I>noscitur ex socio--he is known by his 
 company.</I> He <I>will be like them</I> (so some), <I>will be made 
 wicked</I> (so others); it comes all to one, for all those, and those 
 only, that make themselves wicked, will <I>be destroyed,</I> and those 
 that associate with evil-doers are debauched, and so undone, and at 
 last ascribe their death to it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be
 repayed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here see, 

 1. How unavoidable the destruction of sinners is; the wrath of God 
 pursues them, and all the terrors of that wrath: <I>Evil pursues</I> 
 them closely wherever they go, as the avenger of blood pursued the 
 manslayer, and they have no city of refuge to flee to; they attempt an 
 escape, but in vain. Whom God pursues he is sure to overtake. They may 
 prosper for a while and grow very secure, but their damnation slumbers 
 not, though they do. 

 2. How indefeasible the happiness of the saints is; the God that cannot 
 lie has engaged that <I>to the righteous good shall be repaid.</I> They 
 shall be abundantly recompensed for all the good they have done, and 
 all the ill they have suffered, in this world; so that, though many 
 have been losers for their righteousness, they shall not be losers by 
 it. Though the recompence do not come quickly, it will come in the day 
 of payment, in the world of retribution; and it will be an abundant 
 recompence.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  A good <I>man</I> leaveth an inheritance to his children's
 children: and the wealth of the sinner <I>is</I> laid up for the just.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. How <I>a good man's</I> estate lasts: He <I>leaves an inheritance to 
 his children's children.</I> It is part of his praise that he is 
 thoughtful for posterity, that he does not lay all out upon himself, 
 but is in care to do well for those that come after him, not by 
 withholding more than is meet, but by a prudent and decent frugality. 
 He trains up his children to this, that they may leave it to their 
 children; and especially he is careful, both by justice and charity, to 
 obtain the blessing of God upon what he has, and to entail that 
 blessing upon his children, without which the greatest industry and 
 frugality will be in vain: <I>A good man,</I> by being good and doing 
 good, by honouring the Lord with his substance and spending it in his 
 service, secures it to his posterity; or, if he should not leave them 
 much of this world's goods, his prayers, his instructions, his good 
 example, will be the best entail, and the promises of the covenant will 
 be an inheritance to his <I>children's children,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:17">Ps. ciii. 17</A>.

 2. How it increases by the accession of <I>the wealth of the sinner</I> 
 to it, for that <I>is laid up for the just.</I> If it be asked, How 
 should good men grow so rich, who are not so eager upon the world as 
 others are and who commonly suffer for their well-doing? It is here 
 answered, God, in his providence, often brings into their hands that 
 which wicked people had laid up for themselves. <I>The innocent shall 
 divide the silver,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  Much food <I>is in</I> the tillage of the poor: but there is
 <I>that is</I> destroyed for want of judgment.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. How a small estate may be improved by industry, so that a man, by 
 making the best of every thing, may live comfortably upon it: <I>Much 
 food is in the tillage of the poor,</I> the poor farmers, that have but 
 a little, but take pains with that little and husband it well. Many
 make it an excuse for their idleness that they have but a little to 
 work on, a very little to be doing with; but the less compass the field 
 is of the more let the skill and labour of the owner be employed about 
 it, and it will turn to a very good account. Let him dig, and he needs 
 not beg. 

 2. How a great estate may be ruined by indiscretion: <I>There is 
 that</I> has a great deal, but it <I>is destroyed</I> and brought to 
 nothing <I>for want of judgment,</I> that is, prudence in the 
 management of it. Men over-build themselves or over-buy themselves, 
 keep greater company, or a better table, or more servants, than they 
 can afford, suffer what they have to go to decay and do not make the 
 most of it; by taking up money themselves, or being bound for others, 
 their estates are sunk, their families reduced, and all <I>for want of 
 judgment.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth
 him chasteneth him betimes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. To the education of children in that which is good there is 
 necessary a due correction of them for what is amiss; every child of 
 ours is a child of Adam, and therefore has that foolishness bound up in 
 its heart which calls for rebuke, more or less, the rod and reproof 
 which give wisdom. Observe, It is <I>his</I> rod that must be used, the 
 rod of a parent, directed by wisdom and love, and designed for good, 
 not the rod of a servant. 

 2. It is good to begin betimes with the necessary restraints of 
 children from that which is evil, before vicious habits are confirmed. 
 The branch is easily bent when it is tender. 

 3. Those really hate their children, though they pretend to be fond of 
 them, that do not keep them under a strict discipline, and by all 
 proper methods, severe ones when gentle ones will not serve, make them 
 sensible of their faults and afraid of offending. They abandon them to 
 their worst enemy, to the most dangerous disease, and therefore hate 
 them. Let this reconcile children to the correction their good parents 
 give them; it is from love, and for their good,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the
 belly of the wicked shall want.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is the happiness of the righteous that they shall have enough and 
 that they know when they have enough. They desire not to be surfeited, 
 but, being moderate in their desires, they are soon satisfied. Nature
 is content with a little and grace with less; enough is as good as a 
 feast. Those that feed on the bread of life, that feast on the 
 promises, meet with abundant satisfaction of soul there, eat, and are
 filled. 

 2. It is the misery of the wicked that, through the insatiableness of
 their own desires, they are always needy; not only their souls shall 
 not be satisfied with the world and the flesh, but even their <I>belly 
 shall want;</I> their sensual appetite is always craving. In hell they 
 shall be denied a drop of water.</P>
