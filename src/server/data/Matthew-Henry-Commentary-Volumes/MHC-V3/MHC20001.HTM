 Those who read David's psalms, especially those towards the latter end, 
 would be tempted to think that religion is all rapture and consists in 
 nothing but the ecstasies and transports of devotion; and doubtless 
 there is a time for them, and if there be a heaven upon earth it is in 
 them: but, while we are on earth, we cannot be wholly taken up with 
 them; we have a life to live in the flesh, must have a conversation in 
 the world, and into that we must now be taught to carry our religion, 
 which is a rational thing, and very serviceable to the government of 
 human life, and tends as much to make us discreet as to make us devout, 
 to make the face shine before men, in a prudent, honest, useful 
 conversation, as to make the heart burn towards God in holy and pious 
 affections. In this chapter we have, 

 I. The title of the book, showing the general scope and design of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. The first principle of it recommended to our serious consideration,

 III. A necessary caution against bad company, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:10-19">ver. 10-19</A>.

 IV. A faithful and lively representation of wisdom's reasonings with
 the children of men, and the certain ruin of those who turn a deaf ear 
 to those reasonings,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an introduction to this book, which some think was 
 prefixed by the collector and publisher, as Ezra; but it is rather 
 supposed to have been penned by Solomon himself, who, in the beginning 
 of his book, proposes his end in writing it, that he might keep to his 
 business, and closely pursue that end. We are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who wrote these wise sayings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They are <I>the proverbs of Solomon.</I> 

 1. His name signifies <I>peaceable,</I> and the character both of his 
 spirit and of his reign answered to it; both were peaceable. David, 
 whose life was full of troubles, wrote a book of devotion; for <I>is 
 any afflicted? let him pray.</I> Solomon, who lived quietly, wrote a 
 book of instruction; for when the <I>churches had rest they were 
 edified.</I> In times of peace we should learn ourselves, and teach 
 others, that which in troublous times both they and we must practise. 

 2. He was <I>the son of David;</I> it was his honour to stand related 
 to that good man, and he reckoned it so with good reason, for he fared 
 the better for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:12">1 Kings xi. 12</A>.

 He had been blessed with a good education, and many a good prayer had 
 been put up for him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:1">Ps. lxxii. 1</A>),

 the effect of both which appeared in his wisdom and usefulness. The
 <I>generation of the upright</I> are sometimes thus blessed, that they 
 are made blessings, eminent blessings, in their day. Christ is often 
 called <I>the Son of David,</I> and Solomon was a type of him in this, 
 as in other things, that he <I>opened his mouth in parables</I> or 
 <I>proverbs.</I>

 3. He was <I>king of Israel</I>--a king, and yet it was no 
 disparagement to him to be an instructor of the ignorant, and a teacher 
 of babes--king of Israel, that people among whom God was known and his 
 name was great; among them he learned wisdom, and to them he 
 communicated it. All the earth sought to Solomon <I>to hear his 
 wisdom,</I> which excelled all men's 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:30,10:24">1 Kings iv. 30; x. 24</A>);

 it was an honour to Israel that their king was such a dictator, such an 
 oracle. Solomon was famous for apophthegms; every word he said had
 weight in it, and something that was surprising and edifying. His
 servants who attended him, and heard his wisdom, had, among them, 
 collected 3000 proverbs of his which they wrote in their day-books; but 
 these were of his own writing, and do not amount to nearly a thousand. 
 In these he was divinely inspired. Some think that out of those other 
 proverbs of his, which were not so inspired, the apocryphal books of 
 <I>Ecclesiasticus</I> and the <I>Wisdom of Solomon</I> were compiled, 
 in which are many excellent sayings, and of great use; but, take 
 altogether, they are far short of this book. The Roman emperors had 
 each of them his symbol or motto, as many now have with their coat of 
 arms. But Solomon had many weighty sayings, not as theirs, borrowed 
 from others, but all the product of that extraordinary wisdom which God 
 had endued him with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. For what end they were written 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>),

 not to gain a reputation to the author, or strengthen his interest
 among his subjects, but for the use and benefit of all that in every 
 age and place will govern themselves by these dictates and study them 
 closely. This book will help us,

 1. To form right notions of things, and to possess our minds with clear 
 and distinct ideas of them, that we may <I>know wisdom and 
 instruction,</I> that wisdom which is got by instruction, by divine 
 revelation, may know both how to speak and act wisely ourselves and to 
 give instruction to others. 

 2. To distinguish between truth and falsehood, good and evil--<I>to 
 perceive the words of understanding,</I> to apprehend them, to judge of 
 them, to guard against mistakes, and to accommodate what we are taught 
 to ourselves and our own use, that we may <I>discern things that 
 differ</I> and not be imposed upon, and may <I>approve things that are 
 excellent</I> and not lose the benefit of them, as the apostle prays, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:10">Phil. i. 10</A>.

 3. To order our conversation aright in every things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This book will give, that we may <I>receive, the instruction of 
 wisdom,</I> that knowledge which will guide our practice in <I>justice, 
 judgment, and equity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 which will dispose us to render to all their due, to God the things 
 that are God's, in all the exercises of religion, and to all men what 
 is due to them, according to the obligations which by relation, office, 
 contract, or upon any other account, we lie under to them. Note, Those 
 are truly wise, and none but those, who are universally conscientious; 
 and the design of the scripture is to teach us that wisdom, 
 <I>justice</I> in the duties of the first table, <I>judgment</I> in 
 those of the second table, <I>and equity</I> (that is sincerity) in 
 both; so some distinguish them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. For whose use they were written, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They are of use to all, but are designed especially,

 1. For <I>the simple, to give subtlety to</I> them. The instructions 
 here given are plain and easy, and level to the meanest capacity, 
 <I>the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein;</I> and 
 those are likely to receive benefit by them who are sensible of their 
 own ignorance and their need to be taught, and are therefore desirous 
 to receive instruction; and those who receive these instructions in 
 their light and power, though they be simple, will hereby be made 
 subtle, graciously crafty to know the sin they should avoid and the 
 duty they should do, and to escape the tempter's wiles. He that is
 <I>harmless as</I> the <I>dove</I> by observing Solomon's rules may 
 become <I>wise as</I> the <I>serpent;</I> and he that has been sinfully 
 foolish when he begins to govern himself by the word of God becomes 
 graciously wise. 

 2. For young people, to give them <I>knowledge and discretion.</I> 
 Youth is the learning age, catches at instructions, receives 
 impressions, and retains what is then received; it is therefore of 
 great consequence that the mind be then seasoned well, nor can it 
 receive a better tincture than from Solomon's proverbs. Youth is rash, 
 and heady, and inconsiderate; <I>man is born like the wild ass's 
 colt,</I> and therefore needs to be broken by the restraints and 
 managed by the rules we find here. And, if young people will but take 
 heed to their ways according to Solomon's proverbs, they will soon gain 
 the knowledge and discretion of the ancients. Solomon had an eye to 
 posterity in writing this book, hoping by it to season the minds of the 
 rising generation with the generous principles of wisdom and 
 virtue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. What good use may be made of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 Those who are young and simple may by them be made wise, and are not 
 excluded from Solomon's school, as they were from Plato's. But is it 
 only for such? No; here is not only milk for babes, but strong meat for 
 strong men. This book will not only make the foolish and bad wise and 
 good, but the wise and good wiser and better; and though the simple and 
 the young man may perhaps slight those instructions, and not be the 
 better for them, yet the <I>wise man will hear.</I> Wisdom will be 
 justified by her own children, though not by the children sitting in 
 the market-place. Note, Even wise men must hear, and not think 
 themselves too wise to learn. <I>A wise man</I> is sensible of his own
 defects (<I>Plurima ignoro, sed ignorantiam meam non ignoro</I>--<I>I 
 am ignorant of many things, but not of my own ignorance</I>), and 
 therefore is still pressing forward, that he may <I>increase</I> in 
 <I>learning,</I> may know more and know it better, more clearly and 
 distinctly, and may know better how to make use of it. As long as we 
 live we should strive to increase in all useful learning. It was a 
 saying of one of the greatest of the rabbin, <I>Qui non auget 
 scientiam, amittit de ea--If our stock of knowledge by not increasing, 
 it is wasting;</I> and those that would increase in learning must study 
 the scriptures; these <I>perfect the man of God.</I> A wise man, by 
 increasing in learning, is not only profitable to himself, but to 
 others also,

 1. As a counsellor. <I>A man of understanding</I> in these precepts of 
 wisdom, by comparing them with one another and with his own 
 observations, <I>shall</I> by degrees <I>attain unto wise counsels;</I> 
 he stands fair for preferment, and will be consulted as an oracle, and 
 entrusted with the management of public affairs; he shall come to 
 <I>sit at the helm,</I> so the word signifies. Note, Industry is the 
 way to honour; and those whom God has blessed with wisdom must study to 
 do good with it, according as their sphere is. It is more dignity 
 indeed to be counsellor to the prince, but it is more charity to be 
 counsellor to the poor, as Job was with his wisdom. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:15">Job xxix. 15</A>,

 <I>I was eyes to the blind.</I>

 2. As an interpreter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 --<I>to understand a proverb.</I> Solomon was himself famous for 
 expounding riddles and resolving hard questions, which was of old the 
 celebrated entertainment of the eastern princes, witness the solutions 
 he gave to the enquiries with which the queen of Sheba thought to 
 puzzle him. Now here he undertakes to furnish his readers with that 
 talent, as far as would be serviceable to the best purposes. "They
 shall <I>understand a proverb,</I> even <I>the interpretation,</I> 
 without which the proverb is a nut uncracked; when they hear a wise 
 saying, though it be figurative, they shall take the sense of it, and 
 know how to make use of it." <I>The words of the wise</I> are sometimes 
 <I>dark sayings.</I> In St. Paul's epistles there is that which is 
 <I>hard to be understood;</I> but to those who, being well-versed in 
 the scriptures, know how to <I>compare spiritual things with 
 spiritual,</I> they will be easy and safe; so that, if you ask them, 
 <I>Have you understood all these things?</I> they may answer, <I>Yea, 
 Lord.</I> Note, It is a credit to religion when men of honesty are men 
 of sense; all good people therefore should aim to be intelligent, and 
 <I>run to and fro,</I> take pains in the use of means, that their 
 <I>knowledge may be increased.</I></P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon, having undertaken to <I>teach a young man knowledge and 
 discretion,</I> here lays down two general rules to be observed in 
 order thereunto, and those are, to fear God and honour his parents, 
 which two fundamental laws of morality Pythagoras begins his golden 
 verses with, but the former of them in a wretchedly corrupted state. 
 <I>Primum, deos immortales cole, parentesque honora--First worship the
 immortal gods, and honour your parents.</I> To make young people such 
 as they should be,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let them have regard to God as their supreme.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He lays down this truth, that <I>the fear of the Lord is the 
 beginning of knowledge</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 it is <I>the principal part of knowledge</I> (so the margin); it is the 
 head of knowledge; that is,

 (1.) Of all things that are to be known this is most evident, that
 <I>God is to be feared,</I> to be reverenced, served, and worshipped; 
 this is so the beginning of knowledge that those know nothing who do 
 not know this. 

 (2.) In order to the attaining of all useful knowledge this is most 
 necessary, that we fear God; we are not qualified to profit by the 
 instructions that are given us unless our minds be possessed with a 
 holy reverence of God, and every thought within us be brought into 
 obedience to him. <I>If any man will do his will, he shall know of his 
 doctrine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>.

 (3.) As all our knowledge must take rise from the fear of God, so it 
 must tend to it as its perfection and centre. Those know enough who
 know how to fear God, who are careful in every thing to please him and 
 fearful of offending him in any thing; this is the Alpha and Omega of 
 knowledge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To confirm this truth, that an eye to God must both direct and 
 quicken all our pursuits of knowledge, he <I>observes, Fools</I> 
 (atheists, who have no regard to God) <I>despise wisdom and 
 instruction;</I> having no dread at all of God's wrath, nor any desire 
 of his favour, they will not give you thanks for telling them what they 
 may do to escape his wrath and obtain his favour. Those who say to the 
 Almighty, <I>Depart from us,</I> who are so far from fearing him that 
 they set him at defiance, can excite no surprise if they desire not the 
 knowledge of his ways, but despise that instruction. Note, Those are 
 fools who do not fear God and value the scriptures; and though they may 
 pretend to be admirers of wit they are really strangers and enemies to 
 wisdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let them have regard to their parents as their superiors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>):
 
 <I>My son, hear the instruction of thy father.</I> He means, not only 
 that he would have his own children to be observant of him, and of what 
 he said to them, nor only that he would have his pupils, and those who 
 came to him to be taught, to look upon him as their father and attend 
 to his precepts with the disposition of children, but that he would 
 have all children to be dutiful and respectful to their parents, and to 
 conform to the virtuous and religious education which they give them, 
 according to the law of the fifth commandment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He takes it for granted that parents will, with all the wisdom they 
 have, instruct their children, and, with all the authority they have, 
 give law to them for their good. They are reasonable creatures, and 
 therefore we must not give them law without instruction; we must draw 
 them with the cords of a man, and when we tell them what they must do 
 we must tell them why. But they are corrupt and wilful, and therefore 
 with the instruction there is need of a law. Abraham will not only 
 catechize, but command, his household. Both the father and the mother 
 must do all they can for the good education of their children, and all 
 little enough.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He charges children both to receive and to retain the good lessons 
 and laws their parents give them. 

 (1.) To receive them with readiness: "<I>Hear the instruction of thy 
 father;</I> hear it and heed it; hear it and bid it welcome, and be 
 thankful for it, and subscribe to it." 

 (2.) To retain them with resolution: "<I>Forsake not their law;</I> 
 think not that when thou art grown up, and no longer under tutors and 
 governors, thou mayest live at large; no, <I>the law of thy mother</I> 
 was according to the law of thy God, and therefore it must never be 
 forsaken; thou wast trained up in the way in which thou shouldst go, 
 and therefore, when thou art old, thou must not depart from it." Some 
 observe that whereas the Gentile ethics, and the laws of the Persians 
 and Romans, provided only that children should pay respect to their 
 father, the divine law secures the honour of the mother also.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He recommends this as that which is very graceful and will put an 
 honour upon us: "The instructions and laws of thy parents, carefully 
 observed and lived up to, <I>shall be an ornament of grace unto thy 
 head</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 such an ornament as is, in the sight of God, of great price, and shall 
 make thee look as great as those that wear gold <I>chains about their 
 necks.</I>" Let divine truths and commands be to us a coronet, or a 
 collar of SS, which are badges of first-rate honours; let us value 
 them, and be ambitious of them, and then they shall be so to us. Those 
 are truly valuable, and shall be valued, who value themselves more by 
 their virtue and piety than by their worldly wealth and dignity.</P>

 Here Solomon gives another general rule to young people, in order to 
 their finding out, and keeping in, the paths of wisdom, and that is to 
 take heed of the snare of bad company. David's psalms begin with this 
 caution, and so do Solomon's proverbs; for nothing is more destructive, 
 both to a lively devotion and to a regular conversation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>My son,</I> whom I love, and have a tender concern for, <I>if 
 sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</I>" This is good advice for 
 parents to give their children when they send them abroad into the 
 world; it is the same that St. Peter gave to his new converts, 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:40">Acts ii. 40</A>),

 <I>Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</I> Observe,

 1. How industrious wicked people are to seduce others into the paths of 
 the destroyer: they will entice. Sinners love company in sin; the 
 angels that fell were tempters almost as soon as they were sinners. 
 They do not threaten or argue, but entice with flattery and fair 
 speech; with a bait they draw the unwary young man to the hook. But 
 they mistake if they think that by bringing others to partake with them 
 in their guilt, and to be bound, as it were, in the bond with them, 
 they shall have the less to pay themselves; for they will have so much 
 the more to answer for. 

 2. How cautious young people should be that they be not seduced by 
 them: "<I>Consent thou not;</I> and then, though they entice thee, they 
 cannot force thee. Do not say as they say, nor do as they do or would 
 have thee to do; have no fellowship with them." To enforce this 
 caution,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He represents the fallacious reasonings which sinners use in their 
 enticements, and the arts of wheedling which they have for the 
 beguiling of unstable souls. He specifies highwaymen, who do what they 
 can to draw others into their gang, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:11-14"><I>v.</I> 11-14</A>.

 See here what they would have the young man to do: "<I>Come with us</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 let us have thy company." At first they pretend to ask no more; but the 
 courtship rises higher 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>Cast in thy lot among us;</I> come in partner with us, join thy 
 force to ours, and let us resolve to live and die together: thou shalt 
 fare as we fare; and <I>let us all have one purse,</I> that what we get 
 together we may spend merrily together," for that is it they aim at. 
 Two unreasonable insatiable lusts they propose to themselves the 
 gratification of, and therewith entice their pray into the snare:--

 1. Their cruelty. They thirst after blood, and hate those that are 
 innocent and never gave them any provocation, because by their honesty 
 and industry they shame and condemn them: "<I>Let us</I> therefore 
 <I>lay wait for</I> their <I>blood,</I> and <I>lurk privily</I> for 
 them; they are conscious to themselves of no crime and consequently 
 apprehensive of no danger, but travel unarmed; therefore we shall make 
 the more easy prey of them. And, O how sweet it will be to <I>swallow 
 them up alive!</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 These bloody men would do this as greedily as the hungry lion devours 
 the lamb. If it be objected, "The remains of the murdered will betray 
 the murderers;" they answer, "No danger of that; we will swallow them 
 whole as those that are buried." Who could imagine that human nature 
 should degenerate so far that it should ever be a pleasure to one man 
 to destroy another!

 2. Their covetousness. They hope to get a good booty by it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):
 
 "We shall <I>find all precious substance</I> by following this trade. 
 What though we venture our necks by it? we shall <I>fill our houses 
 with spoil.</I>" See here,

 (1.) The idea they have of worldly wealth. They call it <I>precious 
 substance;</I> whereas it is neither substance nor precious; it is a 
 shadow; it is vanity, especially that which is got by robbery, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:10">Ps. lxii. 10</A>.

 It is as that which is not, which will give a man no solid 
 satisfaction. It is cheap, it is common, yet, in their account, it is 
 precious, and therefore they will hazard their lives, and perhaps their 
 souls, in pursuit of it. It is the ruining mistake of thousands that 
 they over-value the wealth of this world and look on it as <I>precious 
 substance.</I>

 (2.) The abundance of it which they promise themselves: We shall 
 <I>fill our houses with it.</I> Those who trade with sin promise 
 themselves mighty bargains, and that it will turn to a vast account 
 (All this will I give thee, says the tempter); but they only <I>dream 
 that they eat;</I> the housefuls dwindle into scarcely a handful, like 
 the grass on the house-tops.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He shows the perniciousness of these ways, as a reason why we 
 should dread them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>My son, walk not thou in the way with them;</I> do not associate 
 with them; get, and keep, as far off from them as thou canst; 
 <I>refrain thy foot from their path;</I> do not take example by them, 
 not do as they do." Such is the corruption of our nature that our foot 
 is very prone to step into the path of sin, so that we must use 
 necessary violence upon ourselves to refrain our foot from it, and 
 check ourselves if at any time we take the least step towards it. 
 Consider,

 1. How pernicious their way is in its own nature 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Their feet run to evil,</I> to that which is displeasing to God and 
 hurtful to mankind, for they <I>make haste to shed blood.</I> Note, The 
 way of sin is down-hill; men not only cannot stop themselves, but, the 
 longer they continue in it, the faster they run, and make haste in it, 
 as if they were afraid they should not do mischief enough and were 
 resolved to lose no time. They said they would proceed leisurely (Let 
 us <I>lay wait for blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 but thou wilt find they are all in haste, so much has Satan <I>filled 
 their hearts.</I>

 2. How pernicious the consequences of it will be. They are plainly
 told that this wicked way will certainly end in their own destruction, 
 and yet they persist in it. Herein,

 (1.) They are like the silly bird, that sees the net spread to take 
 her, and yet it is in vain; she is decoyed into it by the bait, and 
 will not take the warning which her own eyes gave her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 But we think ourselves <I>of more value than many sparrows,</I> and 
 therefore should have more wit, and act with more caution. God has 
 <I>made us wiser than the fowls of heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:11">Job xxxv. 11</A>),

 and shall we then be as stupid as they?

 (2.) They are worse than the birds, and have not the sense which we 
 sometimes perceive them to have; for the fowler knows it is in vain to 
 lay his snare <I>in the sight of the bird,</I> and therefore he has 
 arts to conceal it. But the sinner sees ruin at the end of his way; the 
 murderer, the thief, see the jail and the gallows before them, nay, 
 they may see hell before them; their watchmen tell them they shall 
 surely die, but it is to no purpose; they rush into sin, and rush on in 
 it, like the horse into the battle. For really the stone they roll will 
 turn upon themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 They lay wait, and lurk privily, for the blood and lives of others, but 
 it will prove, contrary to their intention, to be for <I>their own 
 blood, their own lives;</I> they will come, at length, to a shameful 
 end; and, if they escape the sword of the magistrate, yet there is a 
 divine Nemesis that pursues them. <I>Vengeance suffers</I> them <I>not
 to live.</I> Their greediness of gain hurries them upon those practices 
 which will not suffer them to live out half their days, but will cut 
 off the number of their months in the midst. They have little reason to 
 be proud of their property in that which <I>takes away the life of the 
 owners</I> and then passes to other masters; and what is a man 
 profited, though he gain the world, if he lose his life? For then he 
 can enjoy the world no longer; much less if he lose his soul, and that 
 be drowned in destruction and perdition, as multitudes are by the love 
 of money.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, though Solomon specifies only the temptation to rob on the 
 highway, yet he intends hereby to warn us against all other evils which 
 sinners entice men to. Such are the ways of the drunkards and unclean; 
 they are indulging themselves in those pleasures which tend to their 
 ruin both here and for ever; and therefore consent not to them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the
 streets:
 &nbsp; 21  She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings
 of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, <I>saying,</I>
 &nbsp; 22  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the
 scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
 &nbsp; 23  Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit
 unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
 &nbsp; 24  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out
 my hand, and no man regarded;
 &nbsp; 25  But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of
 my reproof:
 &nbsp; 26  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your
 fear cometh;
 &nbsp; 27  When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction
 cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
 &nbsp; 28  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they
 shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
 &nbsp; 29  For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear
 of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 &nbsp; 30  They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
 &nbsp; 31  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and
 be filled with their own devices.
 &nbsp; 32  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the
 prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
 &nbsp; 33  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall
 be quiet from fear of evil.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon, having shown how dangerous it is to hearken to the temptations 
 of Satan, here shows how dangerous it is not to hearken to the calls of 
 God, which we shall for ever rue the neglect of. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By whom God calls to us--by <I>wisdom.</I> It is <I>wisdom</I> that
 <I>crieth without.</I> The word is plural--<I>wisdoms,</I> for, as there
 is infinite wisdom in God, so there is the <I>manifold wisdom of 
 God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:10">Eph. iii. 10</A>.

 God speaks to the children of men by all the kinds of wisdom, and, as 
 in every will, so in every word, of God there is a counsel.

 1. Human understanding is wisdom, the light and law of nature, the 
 powers and faculties of reason, and the office of conscience, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:36">Job xxxviii. 36</A>.

 By these God speaks to the children of men, and reasons with them. 
 <I>The spirit of a man is the candle of the Lord;</I> and, wherever men 
 go, they may hear a voice behind them, saying, <I>This is the way;</I> 
 and the voice of conscience is the voice of God, and not always a still 
 small voice, but sometimes it cries.

 2. Civil government is wisdom; it is God's ordinance; magistrates are 
 his vicegerents. God by David had <I>said to the fools, Deal not
 foolishly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:4">Ps. lxxv. 4</A>.

 <I>In the opening of the gates,</I> and in the <I>places of 
 concourse,</I> where courts were kept, the judges, the wisdom of the 
 nation, called to wicked people, in God's name, to repent and reform.

 3. Divine revelation is wisdom; all its dictates, all its laws, are 
 wise as wisdom itself. God does, by the written word, by the law of 
 Moses, which sets before us the blessing and the curse, by the priests' 
 lips which keep knowledge, by his servants the prophets, and all the 
 ministers of this word, declare his mind to sinners, and give them 
 warning as plainly as that which is proclaimed in the streets or courts 
 of judicature by the criers. God, in his word, not only opens the case, 
 but argues it with the children of men. <I>Come, now, and let us reason 
 together,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:18">Isa. i. 18</A>.

 4. Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms, for <I>in him are hidden all
 the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,</I> and he is the centre of all 
 divine revelation, not only the <I>essential Wisdom,</I> but the 
 <I>eternal Word,</I> by whom God speaks to us and to whom he has 
 <I>committed all judgment;</I> he it is therefore who here both pleads 
 with sinners and passes sentence on them. He calls himself 
 <I>Wisdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:35">Luke vii. 35</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he calls to us, and in what manner. 

 1. Very publicly, that whosoever hath ears to hear may hear, since all 
 are welcome to take the benefit of what is said and all are concerned 
 to heed it. The rules of wisdom are published <I>without in the 
 streets,</I> not in the schools only, or in the palaces of princes, but 
 <I>in the chief places of concourse,</I> among the common people that 
 pass and repass <I>in the opening of the gates</I> and <I>in the 
 city.</I> It is comfortable casting the net of the gospel where there 
 is a multitude of fish, in hopes that then some will be enclosed. This 
 was fulfilled in our Lord Jesus, who taught openly in the temple, in 
 crowds of people, and <I>in secret said nothing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:20">John xviii. 20</A>),

 and charged his ministers to <I>proclaim</I> his gospel <I>on the 
 housetop,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:27">Matt. x. 27</A>.
 
 God says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:19">Isa. xlv. 19</A>),

 <I>I have not spoken in secret.</I> There is <I>no speech or language 
 where</I> Wisdom's <I>voice is not heard.</I> Truth seeks not corners, 
 nor is virtue ashamed of itself.

 2. Very pathetically; she <I>cries,</I> and again she <I>cries,</I> as 
 one in earnest. <I>Jesus stood and cried.</I> She <I>utters her 
 voice,</I> she <I>utters her words</I> with all possible clearness and 
 affection. God is desirous to be heard and heeded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What the call of God and Christ is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He reproves sinners for their folly and their obstinately persisting 
 in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) Who they are that Wisdom here reproves and expostulates with. In 
 general, they are such as are <I>simple,</I> and therefore might justly 
 be despised, such as <I>love simplicity,</I> and therefore might justly 
 be despaired of; but we must use the means even with those that we have 
 but little hopes of, because we know not what divine grace may do. 
 Three sorts of persons are here called to:--

 [1.] <I>Simple ones that love simplicity.</I> Sin is simplicity, and 
 sinners are simple ones; they do foolishly, very foolishly; and the 
 condition of those is very bad who love simplicity, are fond of their 
 simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the 
 ways of God, and are in their element when they are doing a simple 
 thing, sporting themselves in their own deceivings and flattering 
 themselves in their wickedness. 

 [2.] <I>Scorners that delight in scorning</I>--proud people that take a 
 pleasure in hectoring all about them, jovial people that banter all 
 mankind, and make a jest of every thing that comes in their way. But 
 scoffers at religion are especially meant, the worst of sinners, that 
 scorn to submit to the truths and laws of Christ, and to the reproofs 
 and admonitions of his word, and take a pride in running down every 
 thing that is sacred and serious.

 [3.] <I>Fools</I> that <I>hate knowledge.</I> None but fools hate 
 knowledge. Those only are enemies to religion that do not understand it 
 aright. And those are the worst of fools that hate to be instructed
 and reformed, and have a rooted antipathy to serious godliness. 

 (2.) How the reproof is expressed: "<I>How long will you</I> do so?" 
 This implies that the God of heaven desires the conversion and 
 reformation of sinners and not their ruin, that he is much displeased 
 with their obstinacy and dilatoriness, that he waits to be gracious, 
 and is willing to reason the case with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He invites them to repent and become wise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 And here,

 (1.) The precept is plain: <I>Turn you at my reproof.</I> We do not 
 make a right use of the reproofs that are given us for that which is 
 evil if we do not turn from it to that which is good; for for this end 
 the reproof was given. Turn, that is, return to your right mind, turn 
 to God, turn to your duty, turn and live. 

 (2.) The promises are very encouraging. Those that love simplicity
 find themselves under a moral impotency to change their own mind and 
 way; they cannot turn by any power of their own. To this God answers, 
 "<I>Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you;</I> set yourselves to 
 do what you can, and the grace of God shall set in with you, and work 
 in you both to will and to do that good which, without that grace, you 
 could not do." Help thyself, and God will help thee; <I>stretch forth 
 thy</I> withered <I>hand,</I> and Christ will strengthen and heal it.

 [1.] The author of this grace is the Spirit, and that is promised: <I>I 
 will pour out my Spirit unto you,</I> as oil, as water; you shall have 
 the Spirit in abundance, <I>rivers of living water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:38">John vii. 38</A>.

 Our heavenly Father <I>will give the Holy Spirit to those that ask 
 him.</I>

 [2.] The means of this grace is the word, which, if we take it aright, 
 will turn us; it is therefore promised, "<I>I will make known my words 
 unto you,</I> not only speak them to you, but make them known, give you 
 to understand them." Note, Special grace is necessary to a sincere 
 conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any that honestly 
 seek it and submit to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He reads the doom of those that continue obstinate against all these 
 means and methods of grace. It is large and very terrible, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:24-32"><I>v.</I> 24-32</A>.

 Wisdom, having called sinners to return, pauses awhile, to see what 
 effect the call has, <I>hearkens and hears; but they speak not 
 aright</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:6">Jer. viii. 6</A>),

 and therefore she goes on to tell them what will be in the end 
 hereof.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The crime is recited and it is highly provoking. See what it is 
 for which judgment will be given against impenitent sinners in the 
 great day, and you will say they deserve it, and the Lord is righteous 
 in it. It is, in short, rejecting Christ and the offers of his grace, 
 and refusing to submit to the terms of his gospel, which would have 
 saved them both from the curse of the <I>law of God</I> and from the 
 dominion of the <I>law of sin.</I> 

 [1.] Christ called to them, to warn them of their danger; he 
 <I>stretched out his hand</I> to offer them mercy, nay, to help them 
 out of their miserable condition, <I>stretched out his hand</I> for 
 them to <I>take hold of,</I> but they <I>refused</I> and <I>no man 
 regarded;</I> some were careless and never heeded it, nor took notice 
 of what was said to them; others were wilful, and, though they could 
 not avoid hearing the will of Christ, yet they gave him a flat denial, 
 they refused, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 They were in love with their folly, and would not be made wise. They 
 were obstinate to all the methods that were taken to reclaim them. God 
 <I>stretched out his hand</I> in mercies bestowed upon them, and, when 
 those would not work upon them, in corrections, but all were in vain; 
 they regarded the operations of his hand no more than the declarations 
 of his mouth.

 [2.] Christ reproved and counselled them, not only reproved them for 
 what they did amiss, but counselled them to do better (those are 
 <I>reproofs of instruction</I> and evidences of love and good-will), 
 but they <I>set at nought all his counsel</I> as not worth heeding, and 
 <I>would none of his reproof,</I> as if it were below them to be 
 reproved by him and as if they had never done any thing that deserved 
 reproof, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 This is repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 "They <I>would none of my counsel,</I> but rejected it with disdain; 
 they called reproofs reproaches, and took them as an insult 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:10">Jer. vi. 10</A>);

 nay, <I>they despised all my reproof,</I> as if it were all a jest, and 
 not worth taking notice of." Note, Those are marked for ruin that are 
 deaf to reproof and good counsel.

 [3.] They were exhorted to submit to the government of right reason and 
 religion, but they rebelled against both. <I>First,</I> Reason should 
 not rule them, for <I>they hated knowledge</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 hated the light of divine truth because it discovered to them the evil 
 of their deeds, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:20">John iii. 20</A>.

 They hated to be told that which they could not bear to know.
 <I>Secondly,</I> Religion could not rule them, for they <I>did not 
 choose the fear of the Lord,</I> but chose to walk in the way of 
 <I>their heart and in the sight of their eyes.</I> They were pressed to 
 <I>set God always before them,</I> but they chose rather to cast him 
 and his fear <I>behind their backs.</I> Note, Those who do not 
 <I>choose the fear of the Lord</I> show that they <I>have no 
 knowledge.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The sentence is pronounced, and it is certainly ruining. Those 
 that will not submit to God's government will certainly perish under 
 his wrath and curse, and the gospel itself will not relieve them. They 
 would not take the benefit of God's mercy when it was offered them, and 
 therefore justly fall as victims to his justice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:1"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 1</A>.

 The threatenings here will have their full accomplishment in the
 judgment of the great day and the eternal misery of the impenitent, of 
 which yet there are some earnests in present judgments.

 [1.] Now sinners are in prosperity and secure; they live at ease, and 
 set sorrow at defiance. But, <I>First,</I> Their <I>calamity will
 come</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>);

 sickness will come, and those diseases which they shall apprehend to be 
 the very arrests and harbingers of death; other troubles will come, in 
 mind, in estate, which will convince them of their folly in setting God 
 at a distance. <I>Secondly,</I> Their calamity will put them into a 
 great fright. Fear seizes them, and they apprehend that bad will be 
 worse. When public judgments are abroad the <I>sinners in Zion are
 afraid, fearfulness surprises the hypocrites.</I> Death is the <I>king 
 of terrors</I> to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:21,18:11">Job xv. 21, &c.; xviii. 11</A>,

 &c.); this fear will be their continual torment. <I>Thirdly,</I>
 According to their fright will it be to them. Their <I>fear shall 
 come</I> (the thing they were afraid of shall befal them); it shall
 <I>come as desolation,</I> as a mighty deluge bearing down all before 
 it; it shall be their <I>destruction,</I> their total and final 
 destruction; and it shall come <I>as a whirlwind,</I> which suddenly 
 and forcibly drives away all the chaff. Note, Those that will not admit 
 the fear of God lay themselves open to all other fears, and their fears 
 will not prove causeless. <I>Fourthly,</I> Their fright will then be 
 turned into despair: <I>Distress and anguish shall come upon them,</I> 
 for, having fallen into the pit they were afraid of, they shall see no 
 way to escape, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Saul cries out 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:9">2 Sam. i. 9</A>),

 <I>Anguish has come upon me;</I> and in hell there is <I>weeping, and 
 wailing, and gnashing of teeth</I> for anguish, <I>tribulation and 
 anguish to the soul</I> of the sinner, the fruit of the <I>indignation 
 and wrath of the righteous God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:8,9">Rom. ii. 8, 9</A>.

 [2.] Now God pities their folly, but he will then <I>laugh at their 
 calamity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "I also will laugh at your distress, even as you laughed at my 
 counsel." Those that ridicule religion will thereby but make themselves 
 ridiculous before all the world. The righteous will <I>laugh at
 them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:6">Ps. lii. 6</A>),

 for God himself will. It intimates that they shall be for ever shut out 
 of God's compassions; they have so long sinned against mercy that they 
 have now quite sinned it away. <I>His eye shall not spare, neither
 will he have pity.</I> Nay, his justice being glorified in their ruin, 
 he will be pleased with it, though now he would rather they should 
 <I>turn and live. Ah! I will ease me of my adversaries.</I>

 [3.] Now God is ready to hear their prayers and to meet them with 
 mercy, if they would but seek to him for it; but then the door will be 
 shut, and they shall cry in vain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 "<I>Then shall they call upon me</I> when it is too late, <I>Lord, 
 Lord, open to us.</I> They would then gladly be beholden to that mercy 
 which now they reject and make light of; but <I>I will not answer,</I> 
 because, when I called, they would not answer;" all the answer then 
 will be, <I>Depart from me, I know you not.</I> This has been the case 
 of some even in this life, as of Saul, whom God answered not by 
 <I>Urim</I> or <I>prophets;</I> but, ordinarily, while there is life 
 there is room for prayer and hope of speeding, and therefore this must 
 refer to the inexorable justice of the last judgment. Then those that 
 slighted God will <I>seek him early</I> (that is, earnestly), but in 
 vain; <I>they shall not find him,</I> because they sought him not when 
 he might be found, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:6">Isa. lv. 6</A>.

 The rich man in hell begged, but was denied.

 [4.] Now they are eager upon their own way, and fond of their own 
 devices; but then they will have enough of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 according to the proverb, <I>Let men drink as they brew;</I> they shall 
 <I>eat the fruit of their own way;</I> their wages shall be according 
 to their work, and, as was their choice, <I>so shall their doom be,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:7,8">Gal. vi. 7, 8</A>.

 Note, <I>First,</I> There is a natural tendency in sin to destruction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:15">Jam. i. 15</A>.

 Sinners are certainly miserable if they do but <I>eat the fruit of 
 their own way. Secondly,</I> Those that perish must thank themselves,
 and can lay no blame upon any other. It is <I>their own device;</I> let 
 them make their boast of it. God <I>chooses their delusions,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:4">Isa. lxvi. 4</A>.

 [5.] Now they value themselves upon their worldly prosperity; but then 
 that shall help to aggravate their ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 <I>First,</I> They are now proud that they can turn away from God and 
 get clear of the restraints of religion; but that very thing shall slay 
 them, the remembrance of it shall cut them to the heart. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> They are now proud of their own security and 
 sensuality; but <I>the ease of the simple</I> (so the margin reads it) 
 <I>shall slay them;</I> the more secure they are the more certain and 
 the more dreadful will their destruction be, <I>and the prosperity of 
 fools shall</I> help to <I>destroy them,</I> by puffing them up with 
 pride, gluing their hearts to the world, furnishing them with fuel for 
 their lusts, and hardening their hearts in their evil ways.</P>

 4. He concludes with an assurance of safety and happiness to all those 
 that submit to the instructions of wisdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:33">
 <I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 "<I>Whoso hearkeneth unto me,</I> and will be ruled by me, he shall,"

 (1.) "Be safe; he <I>shall dwell</I> under the special protection of 
 Heaven, so that nothing shall do him any real hurt." 

 (2.) "He shall be easy, and have no disquieting apprehensions of 
 danger; he shall not only be safe from evil, but <I>quiet from the fear 
 of</I> it." <I>Though the earth be removed, yet shall not they 
 fear.</I> Would we be safe from evil, and quiet from the fear of it? 
 Let religion always rule us and the word of God be our counsellor. That 
 is the way to <I>dwell safely</I> in this world, and to <I>be quiet 
 from the fear of evil</I> in the other world.</P>
