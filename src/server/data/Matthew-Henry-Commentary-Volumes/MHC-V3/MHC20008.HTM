 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The word of God is two-fold, and, in both senses, is wisdom; for a word 
 without wisdom is of little value, and wisdom without a word is of 
 little use. Now, 

 I. Divine revelation is the word and wisdom of God, and that pure
 religion and undefiled which is built upon it; and of that Solomon here 
 speaks, recommending it to us as faithful, and well worthy of all 
 acceptation, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:1-21">ver. 1-21</A>.

 God, by it, instructs, and governs, and blesses, the children of men.

 II. The redeemer is the eternal Word and wisdom, the Logos. He is the
 Wisdom that speaks to the children of men in the former part of the
 chapter. All divine revelation passes through his hand, and centres in
 him; but of him as the personal Wisdom, the second person in the
 Godhead, in the judgment of many of the ancients, Solomon here speaks,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:22-31">ver. 22-31</A>.

 He concludes with a repeated charge to the children of men diligently
 to attend to the voice of God in his word,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?
 &nbsp; 2  She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the
 places of the paths.
 &nbsp; 3  She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the
 coming in at the doors.
 &nbsp; 4  Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice <I>is</I> to the sons of
 man.
 &nbsp; 5  O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an
 understanding heart.
 &nbsp; 6  Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening
 of my lips <I>shall be</I> right things.
 &nbsp; 7  For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness <I>is</I> an
 abomination to my lips.
 &nbsp; 8  All the words of my mouth <I>are</I> in righteousness; <I>there is</I>
 nothing froward or perverse in them.
 &nbsp; 9  They <I>are</I> all plain to him that understandeth, and right to
 them that find knowledge.
 &nbsp; 10  Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather
 than choice gold.
 &nbsp; 11  For wisdom <I>is</I> better than rubies; and all the things that
 may be desired are not to be compared to it.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The will of God revealed to us for our salvation is here largely 
 represented to us as easy to be known and understood, that none may 
 have an excuse for their ignorance or error, and as worthy to be 
 embraced, that none may have an excuse for their carelessness and 
 unbelief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The things revealed are easy to be known, for they <I>belong to us 
 and to our children</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:29">Deut. xxix. 29</A>),

 and we need not soar up to heaven, or dive into the depths, to get the 
 knowledge of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+30:11">Deut. xxx. 11</A>),

 for they are published and proclaimed in some measure by the works of 
 the creation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:1">Ps. xix. 1</A>),

 more fully by the consciences of men and the eternal reasons and rules 
 of good and evil, but most clearly by Moses and the prophets; let them 
 hear them. The precepts of wisdom may easily be known; for,

 1. They are proclaimed aloud 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Does not Wisdom cry?</I> Yes, she cries aloud, and does not spare 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:1">Isa. lviii. 1</A>);

 she <I>puts forth her voice,</I> as one in earnest and desirous to be 
 heard. <I>Jesus stood and cried,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:37">John vii. 37</A>.

 The curses and blessings were read with a loud voice by the Levites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+27:14">Deut. xxvii. 14</A>.

 And men's own hearts sometimes speak aloud to them; there are clamours 
 of conscience, as well as whispers.

 2. They are proclaimed from on high 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>She stands in the top of high places;</I> it was from the top of 
 Mount Sinai that the law was given, and Christ expounded it in a sermon 
 upon the mount. Nay, if we slight divine revelation, we <I>turn away 
 from him that speaks from heaven,</I> a high place indeed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:25">Heb. xii. 25</A>.
 
 The adulterous woman spoke in secret, the oracles of the heathen 
 muttered, but Wisdom speaks openly; truth seeks no corners, but gladly 
 appeals to the light.

 3. They are proclaimed <I>in the places of concourse,</I> where
 multitudes are gathered together, the more the better. Jesus spoke 
 <I>in the synagogues and in the temple, whither the Jews always 
 resorted,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:20">John xviii. 20</A>.

 Every man that passes by on the road, of what rank or condition soever, 
 may know what is good, and what the Lord requires of him, if it be not 
 his own fault. There is no speech nor language where Wisdom's voice is 
 not heard; her discoveries and directions are given to all 
 promiscuously. <I>He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</I>

 4. They are proclaimed where they are most needed. They are intended
 for the guide of our way, and therefore are published <I>in the places 
 of the paths,</I> where many ways meet, that travellers may be shown, 
 if they will but ask, which is the right way, just then when they are 
 at a loss; thou shalt then <I>hear the word behind thee, saying, This 
 is the way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:21">Isa. xxx. 21</A>.

 The foolish man <I>knows not how to go to the city</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:15">Eccl. x. 15</A>),
 
 and therefore Wisdom stands ready to direct him, stands <I>at the 
 gates, at the entry of the city,</I> ready to tell him where the seer's 
 house is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+9:18">1 Sam. ix. 18</A>.

 Nay, she follows men to their own houses, and cries to them <I>at the 
 coming in at the doors,</I> saying, <I>Peace be to this house; and, if 
 the son of peace be there,</I> it shall certainly abide upon it. God's
 ministers are appointed to testify to people both publicly and from 
 house to house. Their own consciences follow them with admonitions
 wherever they go, which they cannot be out of the hearing of while they 
 carry their own heads and hearts about with them, which are a law unto 
 themselves.

 5. They are directed to the children of men. We attend to that
 discourse in which we hear ourselves named, though otherwise we should 
 have neglected it; therefore Wisdom speaks to us: "<I>Unto you, O men! 
 I call</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 not to angels (they need not these instructions), not to devils (they 
 are past them), not to the brute-creatures (they are not capable of 
 them), but <I>to you, O men!</I> who are taught more than the beasts of 
 the earth and made wiser than the fowls of heaven. To you is this law
 given, to you is the word of this invitation, this exhortation sent. 
 <I>My voice is to the sons of men,</I> who are concerned to receive 
 instruction, and to whom, one would think, it should be very welcome. 
 It is not, to you, O Jews! only, that Wisdom cries, nor to you, O
 gentlemen! not to you, O scholars! but <I>to you, O men! O sons of 
 men!</I> even the meanest."

 6. They are designed to make them wise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 they are calculated not only for men that are capable of wisdom, but 
 for sinful men, fallen men, foolish men, that need it, and are undone 
 without it: "<I>O you simple ones! understand wisdom.</I> Though you 
 are ever so simple, Wisdom will take you for her scholars, and not only 
 so, but, if you will be ruled by her, will undertake to give you <I>an 
 understanding heart.</I>" When sinners leave their sins, and become 
 truly religious, then the <I>simple understand wisdom.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The things revealed are worthy to be known, well worthy of all 
 acceptation. We are concerned to hear; for, 

 1. They are of inestimable value. They are <I>excellent things</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>princely things,</I> so the word is. Though they are level to the 
 capacity of the meanest, yet there is that in them which will be 
 entertainment for the greatest. They are divine and heavenly things,
 so excellent that, in comparison with them, all other learning is but 
 children's play. Things which relate to an eternal God, an immortal 
 soul, and an everlasting state, must needs be <I>excellent things.</I>

 2. They are of incontestable equity, and carry along with them the 
 evidence of their own goodness. They are <I>right things</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 <I>all in righteousness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and <I>nothing froward or perverse in them.</I> All the dictates and 
 directions of revealed religion are consonant to, and perfective of, 
 the light and law of nature, and there is nothing in them that puts any 
 hardship upon us, that lays us under any undue restraints, unbecoming 
 the dignity and liberty of the human nature, nothing that we have 
 reason to complain of. <I>All God's precepts concerning all things are 
 right.</I>

 3. They are of unquestionable truth. Wisdom's doctrines, upon which her
 laws are founded, are such as we may venture our immortal souls upon: 
 <I>My mouth shall speak truth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, for it is a testimony to 
 the world. Every word of God is true; there are not so much as pious 
 frauds in it, nor are we imposed upon in that which is told us for our 
 good. Christ is a faithful witness, is the truth itself;
 <I>wickedness</I> (that is, lying) <I>is an abomination to his 
 lips.</I> Note, Lying is wickedness, and we should not only refrain 
 from it, but it should be an abomination to us, and as far from what we 
 say as from what God says to us. His word to us is <I>yea, and 
 amen;</I> never then let ours be <I>yea and nay.</I>

 4. They are wonderfully acceptable and agreeable to those who take
 them aright, who understand themselves aright, who have not their 
 judgments blinded and biassed by the world and the flesh, are not under 
 the power of prejudice, are taught of God, and whose understanding he 
 has opened, who impartially <I>seek knowledge,</I> take pains for it, 
 and have found it in the enquiries they have hitherto made. To them,

 (1.) They are all <I>plain,</I> and not hard to be understood. If the 
 book is sealed, it is to those who are willingly ignorant. <I>If our 
 gospel is hidden, it is hidden to those who are lost;</I> but to those 
 who <I>depart from evil,</I> which <I>is understanding,</I> who have 
 that <I>good understanding</I> which those have who <I>do the 
 commandments,</I> to them <I>they are all plain</I> and there is 
 nothing difficult in them. The way of religion is a highway, and <I>the 
 way-faring men, though fools, shall not err therein,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:8">Isa. xxxv. 8</A>.
 
 Those therefore do a great wrong to the common people who deny them the 
 use of the scripture under pretence that they cannot understand it, 
 whereas it is plain for plain people. 

 (2.) They are all <I>right,</I> and not hard to be submitted to. Those 
 who discern things that differ, who know good and evil, readily 
 subscribe to the rectitude of all Wisdom's dictates, and therefore, 
 with out murmuring or disputing, govern themselves by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. From all this he infers that the right knowledge of those things, 
 such as transforms us into the image of them, is to be preferred before 
 all the wealth of this world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>):

 <I>Receive my instruction, and not silver.</I> Instruction must not 
 only be heard, but received. We must bid it welcome, receive the
 impressions of it, and submit to the command of it; and this <I>rather 
 than choice gold,</I> that is,

 1. We must prefer religion before riches, and look upon it that, if we
 have the knowledge and fear of God in our hearts, we are really more 
 happy and better provided for every condition of life than if we had 
 ever so much silver and gold. <I>Wisdom is</I> in itself, and therefore 
 must be in our account, <I>better than rubies.</I> It will bring us in 
 a better price, be to us a better portion; show it forth, and it will 
 be a better ornament than jewels and precious stones of the greatest 
 value. Whatever we can sit down and wish for of the wealth of this 
 world would, if we had it, be unworthy to be compared with the 
 advantages that attend serious godliness. 

 2. We must be dead to the wealth of this world, that we may the more 
 closely and earnestly apply ourselves to the business of religion. We 
 must receive instruction as the main matter, and then be indifferent 
 whether we receive silver or no; nay, we must not receive it as our 
 portion and reward, as the rich man in his life-time <I>received his 
 good things.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of
 witty inventions.
 &nbsp; 13  The fear of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> to hate evil: pride, and
 arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.
 &nbsp; 14  Counsel <I>is</I> mine, and sound wisdom: I <I>am</I> understanding; I
 have strength.
 &nbsp; 15  By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
 &nbsp; 16  By me princes rule, and nobles, <I>even</I> all the judges of the
 earth.
 &nbsp; 17  I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall
 find me.
 &nbsp; 18  Riches and honour <I>are</I> with me; <I>yea,</I> durable riches and
 righteousness.
 &nbsp; 19  My fruit <I>is</I> better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my
 revenue than choice silver.
 &nbsp; 20  I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the
 paths of judgment:
 &nbsp; 21  That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance;
 and I will fill their treasures.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Wisdom here is Christ, <I>in whom are hidden all the treasures of 
 wisdom and knowledge;</I> it is Christ in the word and Christ in the 
 heart, not only Christ revealed to us, but Christ revealed in us. It is 
 the word of God, the whole compass of divine revelation; it is God the 
 Word, in whom all divine revelation centres; it is the soul formed by 
 the word; it is Christ formed in the soul; it is religion in the purity 
 and power of it. Glorious things are here spoken of this excellent 
 person, this excellent thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Divine wisdom gives men good heads 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>I Wisdom dwell with prudence,</I> not with carnal policy (the wisdom 
 that is from above is contrary to that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:12">2 Cor. i. 12</A>),

 but with true discretion, which serves for the right ordering of the 
 conversation, that wisdom of the prudent which is to <I>understand his 
 way</I> and is in all cases <I>profitable to direct,</I> the wisdom of 
 the serpent, not only to guard from harm, but to guide in doing food. 
 <I>Wisdom dwells with prudence;</I> for prudence is the product of 
 religion and an ornament to religion; and there are more <I>witty 
 inventions</I> found out with the help of the scripture, both for the 
 right understanding of God's providences and for the effectual 
 countermining of Satan's devices and the doing of good in our 
 generation, than were ever discovered by the learning of the 
 philosophers or the politics of statesmen. We may apply it to Christ 
 himself; he <I>dwells with prudence,</I> for his whole undertaking is 
 the <I>wisdom of God in a mystery,</I> and in it God <I>abounds towards 
 us in all wisdom and prudence.</I> Christ <I>found out the knowledge 
 of</I> that great <I>invention,</I> and a costly one it was to him, 
 man's salvation, by his satisfaction, an admirable expedient. We had 
 found out many inventions for our ruin; he found out one for our 
 recovery. The covenant of grace is so well ordered in all things that 
 we must conclude that he who ordered it <I>dwelt with prudence.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. It gives men good hearts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 True religion, consisting in <I>the fear of the Lord,</I> which is the 
 wisdom before recommended, teaches men,

 1. To hate all sin, as displeasing to God and destructive to the soul:
 <I>The fear of the Lord is to hate evil, the evil way,</I> to hate sin 
 as sin, and therefore to <I>hate every false way.</I> Wherever there is 
 an awe of God there is a dread of sin, as an evil, as only evil. 

 2. Particularly to hate pride and passion, those two common and
 dangerous sins. Conceitedness of ourselves, <I>pride and
 arrogancy,</I> are sins which Christ hates, and so do all those who 
 have the Spirit of Christ; every one hates them in others, but we must 
 hate them in ourselves. <I>The froward mouth,</I> peevishness towards
 others, God hates, because it is such an enemy to the peace of mankind, 
 and therefore we should hate it. Be it spoken to the honour of religion 
 that, however it is unjustly accused, it is so far from making men 
 conceited and sour that there is nothing more directly contrary to it 
 than pride and passion, nor which it teaches us more to detest.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It has a great influence upon public affairs and the 
 well-governing of all societies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Christ, as God, has strength and wisdom; wisdom and might are his; as 
 Redeemer, he is <I>the wisdom of God and the power of God.</I> To all 
 that are his he is made of God both <I>strength</I> and <I>wisdom;</I> 
 in him they are laid up for us, that we may both know and do our duty. 
 He is the wonderful counsellor and gives that grace which alone is 
 <I>sound wisdom.</I> He <I>is understanding</I> itself, and <I>has 
 strength</I> for all those that strengthen themselves in him. True 
 religion gives men the best counsel in all difficult cases, and helps 
 to make their way plain. Wherever it is, it is <I>understanding,</I> it 
 has <I>strength;</I> it will be all that to us that we need, both for 
 services and sufferings. Where the word of God dwells richly it makes a 
 man <I>perfect</I> and <I>furnishes him thoroughly for every good word 
 and work.</I> Kings, princes, and judges, have of all men most need of 
 wisdom and strength, of counsel and courage, for the faithful discharge 
 of the trusts reposed in them, and that they may be blessings to the 
 people over whom they are set. And therefore Wisdom says, <I>By me 
 kings reign</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>),
 
 that is,

 1. Civil government is a divine institution, and those that are
 entrusted with the administration of it have their commission from 
 Christ; it is a branch of his kingly office that <I>by him kings 
 reign;</I> from him to whom all judgment is committed their power is 
 derived. They reign by him, and therefore ought to reign for him.

 2. Whatever qualifications for government any kings or princes have
 they are indebted to the grace of Christ for them; he gives them the 
 spirit of government, and they have nothing, no skill, no principles of 
 justice, but what he endues them with. <I>A divine sentence is in the 
 lips of the king;</I> and kings are to their subjects what he makes 
 them. 

 3. Religion is very much the strength and support of the civil
 government; it teaches subjects their duty, and so <I>by it kings 
 reign</I> over them the more easily; it teaches kings their duty, and 
 so <I>by it kings reign</I> as they ought; they <I>decree justice,</I> 
 while they <I>rule in the fear of God.</I> Those rule well whom 
 religion rules.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. It will make all those happy, truly happy, that receive and embrace 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They shall be happy in the love of Christ; for he it is that says, 
 <I>I love those that love me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Those that <I>love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity</I> shall be 
 beloved of him with a peculiar distinguishing love: he will <I>love 
 them and manifest himself to them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They shall be happy in the success of their enquiries after him: 
 "<I>Those that seek me early,</I> seek an acquaintance with me and an 
 interest in me, seek me <I>early,</I> that is, seek me earnestly, seek 
 me first before any thing else, that begin betimes in the days of their 
 youth to seek me, they shall find what they seek." Christ shall be 
 theirs, and they shall be his. He never said, <I>Seek in vain.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They shall be happy in the wealth of the world, or in that which is 
 infinitely better. 

 (1.) They shall have as much riches and honour as Infinite Wisdom sees 
 good for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 they are <I>with Christ,</I> that is, he has them to give, and whether 
 he will see fit to give them to us must be referred to him. Religion 
 sometimes helps to make people rich and great in this world, gains them 
 a reputation, and so increases their estates; and the riches which 
 Wisdom gives to her favourites have these two advantages:--

 [1.] That they are <I>riches and righteousness,</I> riches honestly 
 got, not by fraud and oppression, but in regular ways, and riches 
 charitably used, for alms are called <I>righteousness.</I> Those that 
 have their wealth from God's blessing on their industry, and that have 
 a heart to do good with it, have <I>riches and righteousness.</I>

 [2.] That therefore they are <I>durable riches.</I> Wealth gotten by 
 vanity will soon be diminished, but that which is well got will wear 
 well and will be left to the children's children, and that which is 
 well spent in works of piety and charity is put out to the best 
 interest and so will be durable; for the friends made by <I>the mammon 
 of unrighteousness when we fail will receive us into everlasting 
 habitations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:9">Luke xvi. 9</A>.

 It will be found after many days, for the days of eternity.

 (2.) They shall have that which is infinitely better, if they have not 
 riches and honour in this world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 "<I>My fruit is better than gold,</I> and will turn to a better 
 account, will be of more value in less compass, <I>and my revenue 
 better than</I> the <I>choicest silver,</I> will serve a better trade." 
 We may assure ourselves that not only Wisdom's products at last, but 
 her income in the mean time, not only her fruit, but her revenue, is 
 more valuable than the best either of the possessions or of the 
 reversions of this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They shall be happy in the grace of God now; that shall be their 
 guide in the good way, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 This is that fruit of wisdom which is <I>better than gold, than fine 
 gold,</I> it <I>leads us in the way of righteousness,</I> shows us that 
 way and goes before us in it, the way that God would have us walk in 
 and which will certainly bring us to our desired end. It leads <I>in 
 the midst of the paths of judgment,</I> and saves us from deviating on 
 either hand. <I>In medio virtus--Virtue lies in the midst.</I> Christ 
 by his Spirit guides believers into all truth, and so <I>leads them in 
 the way of righteousness,</I> and they <I>walk after the 
 Spirit.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They shall be happy in the glory of God hereafter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.
 
 <I>Therefore</I> Wisdom <I>leads in the paths of righteousness,</I> not 
 only that she may keep her friends in the way of duty and obedience, 
 but that she may <I>cause them to inherit substance</I> and may <I>fill 
 their treasures,</I> which cannot be done with the things of this 
 world, nor with any thing less than God and heaven. The happiness of 
 those that love God, and devote themselves to his service, is 
 substantial and satisfactory. 

 (1.) It is substantial; it is substance itself. It is a happiness which 
 will subsist of itself, and stand alone, without the accidental 
 supports of outward conveniences. Spiritual and eternal things are the
 only real and substantial things. Joy in God is substantial joy, solid
 and well-grounded. The promises are their bonds, Christ is their 
 surety, and both substantial. They <I>inherit substance;</I> that is, 
 their inheritance hereafter is substantial; it is a weight of glory; it 
 is substance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:34">Heb. x. 34</A>.

 All their happiness they have as heirs; it is grounded upon their
 sonship.

 (2.) It is satisfying; it will not only fill their hands, but <I>fill 
 their treasures,</I> not only maintain them, but make them rich. The 
 things of this world may fill men's bellies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>),

 but not their treasures, for they cannot in them secure to themselves 
 <I>goods for many years;</I> perhaps they may be deprived of them 
 <I>this night.</I> But let the treasures of the soul be ever so 
 capacious there is enough in God, and Christ, and heaven, to fill them. 
 In Wisdom's promises believers have goods laid up, not for days and 
 years, but for eternity; her fruit therefore <I>is better than 
 gold.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> possessed me in the beginning of his way, before

 &nbsp; 23  I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever
 the earth was.

 <I>there were</I> no fountains abounding with water.
 &nbsp; 25  Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I
 brought forth:
 &nbsp; 26  While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor
 the highest part of the dust of the world.
 &nbsp; 27  When he prepared the heavens, I <I>was</I> there: when he set a
 compass upon the face of the depth:
 &nbsp; 28  When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened
 the fountains of the deep:
 &nbsp; 29  When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should
 not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of
 the earth:
 &nbsp; 30  Then I was by him, <I>as</I> one brought up <I>with him:</I> and I was
 daily <I>his</I> delight, rejoicing always before him;
 &nbsp; 31  Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my
 delights <I>were</I> with the sons of men.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 That it is an intelligent and divine person that here speaks seems very 
 plain, and that it is not meant of a mere essential property of the 
 divine nature, for Wisdom here has personal properties and actions; and 
 that intelligent divine person can be no other than the Son of God 
 himself, to whom the principal things here spoken of wisdom are 
 attributed in other scriptures, and we must explain scripture by 
 itself. If Solomon himself designed only the praise of wisdom as it is 
 an attribute of God, by which he made the world and governs it, so to
 recommend to men the study of that wisdom which belongs to them, yet
 the Spirit of God, who indited what he wrote, carried him, as David
 often, to such expressions as could agree to no other than the Son of
 God, and would lead us into the knowledge of great things concerning
 him. All divine revelation is <I>the revelation of Jesus Christ, which
 God gave unto him,</I> and here we are told who and what he is, as God,
 designed in the eternal counsels to be the Mediator between God and
 man. The best exposition of these verses we have in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1-4">first four verses</A>

 of St. John's gospel.

 <I>In the beginning was the Word,</I> &c. Concerning the Son of God
 observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His personality and distinct subsistence, one with the Father and of 
 the same essence, and yet a person of himself, whom <I>the Lord 
 possessed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 <I>who was set up</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 <I>was brought forth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>),
 
 <I>was by him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>),

 for he was <I>the express image of his person,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:3">Heb. i. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His eternity; he was begotten of the Father, for <I>the Lord 
 possessed</I> him, as his own Son, his beloved Son, laid him in his 
 bosom; he was <I>brought forth as the only-begotten of the Father,</I> 
 and this <I>before all worlds,</I> which is most largely insisted upon 
 here. The Word was eternal, and had a being before the world, before 
 the beginning of time; and therefore it must follow that it was from 
 eternity. <I>The Lord possessed him in the beginning of his way,</I> of 
 his eternal counsels, for those were <I>before his works.</I> This way 
 indeed had no beginning, for God's purposes in himself are eternal like 
 himself, but God speaks to us in our own language. Wisdom explains 
 herself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>I was set up from everlasting.</I> The Son of God was, in the 
 eternal counsels of God, designed and advanced to be the wisdom and 
 power of the Father, light and life, and all in all both in the 
 creation and in the redemption of the world. That he <I>was brought 
 forth</I> as to his being, and <I>set up</I> as to the divine counsels 
 concerning his office, before the world was made, is here set forth in 
 a great variety of expressions, much the same with those by which the 
 eternity of God himself is expressed. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:2">Ps. xc. 2</A>,

 <I>Before the mountains were brought forth.</I>

 1. <I>Before the earth was,</I> and that was made <I>in the
 beginning,</I> before man was made; therefore the second Adam had a 
 being before the first, for the first Adam was <I>made of the 
 earth,</I> the second had a being <I>before the earth,</I> and 
 therefore is <I>not of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:31">John iii. 31</A>.

 2. Before the sea was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 <I>when there were no depths</I> in which the waters were gathered 
 together, <I>no fountains</I> from which those waters might arise, none 
 of that deep on which the Spirit of God moved for the production of the 
 visible creation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:2">Gen. i. 2</A>.

 3. Before the mountains were, the everlasting mountains, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.
 
 Eliphaz, to convince Job of his inability to judge of the divine 
 counsels, asks him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:7">Job xv. 7</A>),

 <I>Wast thou made before the hills?</I> No, thou wast not. But
 <I>before the hills was</I> the eternal Word <I>brought forth.</I>

 4. Before the habitable parts of the world, which men cultivate, and 
 reap the profits of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>),

 <I>the fields</I> in the valleys and plains, to which the mountains are 
 as a wall, which are <I>the highest part of the dust of the world;</I> 
 the <I>first part of the dust</I> (so some), the atoms which compose 
 the several parts of the world; <I>the chief or principal part of the 
 dust,</I> so it may be read, and understood of man, who was made of the 
 dust of the ground and is dust, but is the principal part of the dust, 
 dust enlivened, dust refined. The eternal Word had a being before man
 was made, for <I>in him was the life of men.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His agency in making the world. He not only had a being before the 
 world, but he was present, not as a spectator, but as the architect, 
 when the world was made. God silenced and humbled Job by asking him, 
 "<I>Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Who hath 
 laid the measures thereof?</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:4">Job xxxviii. 4</A>,

 &c.). Wast thou that eternal Word and wisdom, who was the prime manager 
 of that great affair? No; thou art of yesterday." But here the Son of 
 God, referring, as it should seem, to the discourse God had with Job, 
 declares himself to have been engaged in that which Job could not 
 pretend to be a witness of and a worker in, the creation of the world. 
 <I>By him God made the worlds,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:9,Heb+1:2,Col+1:16">Eph. iii. 9; 
 Heb. i. 2; Col. i. 16</A>.

 1. When, on the first day of the creation, in the very beginning of
 time, God said, <I>Let there be light,</I> and with a word produced it, 
 this eternal Wisdom was that almighty Word: Then <I>I was there, when 
 he prepared the heavens,</I> the fountain of that light, which, 
 whatever it is here, is there substantial. 

 2. He was no less active when, on the second day, he stretched out the 
 firmament, the vast expanse, and <I>set</I> that as <I>a compass upon 
 the face of the depth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>),
 
 surrounded it on all sides with that
 canopy, that curtain. Or it may refer to the exact order and method 
 with which God framed all the parts of the universe, as the workman 
 marks out his work with his line and compasses. The work in nothing 
 varied from the plan of it formed in the eternal mind. 

 3. He was also employed in the third day's work, when the <I>waters
 above the heavens,</I> were gathered together by <I>establishing the 
 clouds above,</I> and those under the heavens by <I>strengthening the 
 fountains of the deep,</I> which send forth those waters 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 and by preserving the bounds of the sea, which is the receptacle of
 those waters, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 This speaks much the honour of this eternal Wisdom, for by this 
 instance God proves himself a God greatly to be feared 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:22">Jer. v. 22</A>)
 
 that <I>he has placed the sand for the bound of the sea,</I> that the 
 dry land might continue to appear above water, fit to be a habitation 
 for man; and thus he has <I>appointed the foundation of the earth.</I> 
 How able, how fit, is the Son of God to be the Saviour of the world, 
 who was the Creator of it!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The infinite complacency which the Father had in him, and he in the 
 Father 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>I was by him, as one brought up with him.</I> As by an eternal
 generation he was brought forth of the Father, so by an eternal counsel 
 he was brought up with him, which intimates, not only the infinite love 
 of the Father to the Son, who is therefore called <I>the Son of his 
 love</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:13">Col. i. 13</A>),

 but the mutual consciousness and good understanding that were between 
 them concerning the work of man's redemption, which the Son was to 
 undertake, and about which the <I>counsel of peace was between them 
 both,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+6:13">Zech. vi. 13</A>.

 He was <I>alumnus patris--the Father's pupil,</I> as I may say, trained
 up from eternity for that service which in time, in the fulness of 
 time, he was to go through with, and is therein taken under the special 
 tuition and protection of the Father; he is <I>my servant whom I 
 uphold,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1">Isa. xlii. 1</A>.
 
 He did what he saw the Father do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:19">John v. 19</A>),
 
 pleased his Father, sought his glory, did according to the commandment 
 he received from his Father, and all this <I>as one brought up with 
 him.</I> He was <I>daily his Father's delight (my elect, in whom my 
 soul delighteth,</I> says God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:1">Isa. xliii. 1</A>),

 and he also <I>rejoiced always before him.</I> This may be understood 
 either,

 1. Of the infinite delight which the persons of the blessed Trinity
 have in each other, wherein consists much of the happiness of the 
 divine nature. Or, 

 2. Of the pleasure which the Father took in the operations of the Son, 
 when he <I>made the world;</I> God saw every thing that the Son made, 
 <I>and, behold, it was very good,</I> it pleased him, and therefore his 
 Son was <I>daily,</I> day by day, during the six days of the creation, 
 upon that account, <I>his delight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+39:43">Exod. xxxix. 43</A>.

 And the Son also did himself <I>rejoice before him</I> in the beauty 
 and harmony of the whole creation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:31">Ps. civ. 31</A>.
 
 Or,

 3. Of the satisfaction they had in each other, with reference to the
 great work of man's redemption. The Father delighted in the Son, as 
 Mediator between him and man, was well-pleased with what he proposed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+3:17">Matt. iii. 17</A>),

 and <I>therefore</I> loved him because he undertook to <I>lay down his 
 life for the sheep;</I> he put a confidence in him that he would go 
 through his work, and not fail nor fly off. The Son also <I>rejoiced
 always before him,</I> delighted to do his will 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:8">Ps. xl. 8</A>),

 adhered closely to his undertaking, as one that was well-satisfied in 
 it, and, when it came to the setting to, expressed as much satisfaction 
 in it as ever, saying, <I>Lo, I come,</I> to do <I>as in the volume of 
 the book it is written of me.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The gracious concern he had for mankind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Wisdom <I>rejoiced,</I> not so much in the rich products of the earth, 
 or the treasures hid in the bowels of it, as <I>in the habitable parts 
 of</I> it, for her <I>delights were with the sons of men;</I> not only
 in the creation of man is it spoken with a particular air of pleasure 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:26">Gen. i. 26</A>),

 <I>Let us make man,</I> but in the redemption and salvation of man. The 
 Son of God was <I>ordained, before the world,</I> to that great work, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:20">1 Pet. i. 20</A>.

 A remnant of the sons of men were given him to be brought, through his 
 grace, to his glory, and these were those in whom his delights were. 
 His church was the habitable part of his earth, made habitable for him, 
 <I>that the Lord God might dwell</I> even <I>among those</I> that had 
 been rebellious; and this he rejoiced in, in the prospect of seeing his 
 seed. Though he foresaw all the difficulties he was to meet with in his 
 work, the services and sufferings he was to go through, yet, because it 
 would issue in the glory of his Father and the salvation of those sons 
 of men that were given him, he looked forward upon it with the greatest 
 satisfaction imaginable, in which we have all the encouragement we can 
 desire to come to him and rely upon him for all the benefits designed 
 us by his glorious undertaking.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the application of Wisdom's discourse; the design and 
 tendency of it is to bring us all into an entire subjection to the laws 
 of religion, to make us wise and good, not to fill our heads with 
 speculations, or our tongues with disputes, but to rectify what is 
 amiss in our hearts and lives. In order to this, here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An exhortation to hear and obey the voice of Wisdom, to attend and 
 comply with the good instructions that the word of God gives us, and in 
 them to discern the voice of Christ, as the sheep know the shepherd's 
 voice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We must be diligent <I>hearers of the word;</I> for how can we 
 believe in him of whom we have not heard? "<I>Hearken unto me, O you
 children!</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 "Read the word written, sit under the word preached, bless God for 
 both, and hear him in both speaking to you." Let children in age, and what
 they hearken to then, it is likely, they will be so seasoned by as to 
 be governed by all their days. Let Wisdom's children justify Wisdom by 
 hearkening to her and show themselves to be indeed her children. We 
 must hear Wisdom's words,

 (1.) Submissively, and with a willing heart 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):

 "<I>Hear instruction, and refuse it not,</I> either as that which you
 need not or as that which you like not; it is offered you as a 
 kindness, and it is at your peril if you refuse it." Those that reject 
 the counsel of God reject it against themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+7:30">Luke vii. 30</A>.

 "Refuse it not now, lest you should not have another offer."

 (2.) Constantly, and with an attentive ear. We must hear Wisdom so as 
 to <I>watch daily at her gates,</I> as beggars to receive an alms, as 
 clients and patients to receive advice, and to wait as servants, with 
 humility, and patience, and ready observance, <I>at the posts of her 
 doors.</I> See here what a good house Wisdom keeps, for every day is 
 dole-day; what a good school, for every day is lecture-day. While we 
 have God's works before our eyes, and his word in our hand, we may be 
 every day hearing Wisdom, and learning instruction from her. See here 
 what a dutiful and diligent attendance is required of all Christ's 
 disciples; they must <I>watch at the gates.</I>

 [1.] We must lay hold on all opportunities of getting knowledge and 
 grace, and must get into, and keep in, a constant settled course of 
 communion with God.

 [2.] We must be very humble in our attendance on divine instructions, 
 and be glad of any place, even the meanest, so we may but be within 
 hearing of them, as David, who would gladly be a door-keeper in the 
 house of God.

 [3.] We must raise our expectations of these instructions, and hearken 
 to them with care, and patience, and perseverance, must watch and wait, 
 as Christ's hearers, that <I>hanged on him</I> to hear him, as the word 
 in the original is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:48">Luke xix. 48</A>)
 
 and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:38"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 38</A>)

 <I>came early in the morning to hear him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We must be conscientious <I>doers of the work,</I> for we are 
 <I>blessed only in our deed.</I> It is not enough to hearken unto 
 Wisdom's words, but we must <I>keep her ways</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),

 do every thing that she prescribes, keep within the hedges of her ways,
 and not transgress them, keep in the tracks of her ways, proceed and 
 persevere in them. "<I>Hear instruction and be wise;</I> let it be a 
 means to make you wise in ordering your conversation." What we know is 
 known in vain if it do not make us wise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An assurance of happiness to all those that do hearken to Wisdom. 
 They are blessed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>,
 
 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Those are blessed that watch and wait at Wisdom's gates; even their 
 attendance there is their happiness; it is the best place they can be 
 in. Those are blessed that wait there, for they shall not be put to 
 wait long; let them continue to knock awhile and it shall be opened to 
 them. They are seeking Wisdom, and they shall find what they seek. But 
 will it make them amends if they do find it? Yes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>):

 <I>Whoso finds me finds life,</I> that is, all happiness, all that good
 which he needs or can desire. He finds life in that grace which is the 
 principle of spiritual life and the pledge of eternal life. He <I>finds 
 life,</I> for he shall <I>obtain favour of the Lord,</I> and <I>in his 
 favour is life.</I> If the king's favour is towards a wise son, much 
 more the favour of the King of kings. Christ is Wisdom, and he that 
 finds Christ, that obtains an interest in him, he <I>finds life;</I> 
 for Christ is life to all believers. <I>He that has the Son of God has 
 life,</I> eternal life, and he <I>shall obtain favour of the Lord,</I> 
 who is well-pleased with all those that are in Christ; nor can we 
 obtain God's favour, unless we find Christ and be found in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The doom passed upon all those that reject Wisdom and her 
 proposals, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>.

 They are left to ruin themselves, and Wisdom will not hinder them, 
 because they have set at nought all her counsel.

 1. Their crime is very great; they <I>sin against Wisdom,</I> rebel
 against its light and laws, thwart its designs, and by their folly 
 offend it. They <I>sin against Christ;</I> they act in contempt of his 
 authority, and in contradiction to all the purposes of his life and 
 death. This is construed into hating Wisdom, hating Christ; they are 
 his enemies, who will not have him to reign over them. What can appear 
 worse than hating him who is the centre of all beauty and fountain of 
 all goodness, love itself? 

 2. Their punishment will be very just, for they wilfully bring it upon 
 themselves.

 (1.) Those that offend Christ do the greatest wrong to themselves; they 
 <I>wrong their own souls;</I> they wound their own consciences, bring a 
 blot and stain upon their souls, which renders them odious in the eyes 
 of God, and unfit for communion with him; they deceive themselves, 
 disturb themselves, destroy themselves. Sin is a wrong to the soul. 
 
 (2.) Those that are at variance with Christ are in love with their own 
 ruin: <I>Those that hate me love death;</I> they love that which will 
 be their death, and put that from them which would be their life. 
 Sinners die because they will die, which leaves them inexcusable, makes 
 their condemnation the more intolerable, and will for ever justify God 
 when he judges. <I>O Israel! thou hast destroyed thyself.</I></P>
