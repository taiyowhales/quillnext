 Elihu here goes on to extol the wonderful power of God in the meteors 
 and all the changes of the weather: if, in those changes, we submit to 
 the will of God, take the weather as it is and make the best of it, why 
 should we not do so in other changes of our condition? Here he observes 
 the hand of God, 

 I. In the thunder and lightning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. In the frost and snow, the rains and wind, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:6-13">ver. 6-13</A>.

 III. He applies it to Job, and challenges him to solve the phenomena of
 these works of nature, that confessing his ignorance in them, he might
 own himself an incompetent judge in the proceedings of divine
 Providence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:14-22">ver. 14-22</A>.
 
 And then, 

 IV. Concludes with his principle, which he undertook to make out, That
 God is great and greatly to be feared,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his
 place.
 &nbsp; 2  Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound <I>that</I>
 goeth out of his mouth.

 unto the ends of the earth.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thunder and lightning, which usually go together, are sensible 
 indications of the glory and majesty, the power and terror, of Almighty 
 God, one to the ear and the other to the eye; in these God leaves not 
 himself without witness of his greatness, as, in the rain from heaven 
 and fruitful seasons, he leaves not himself without witness of his 
 goodness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:17">Acts xiv. 17</A>),

 even to the most stupid and unthinking. Though there are natural causes
 and useful effects of them, which the philosophers undertake to account 
 for, yet they seem chiefly designed by the Creator to startle and 
 awaken the slumbering world of mankind to the consideration of a God 
 above them. The eye and the ear are the two learning senses; and 
 therefore, though such a circumstance is possible, they say it was 
 never known in fact that any one was born both blind and deaf. By the 
 word of God divine instructions are conveyed to the mind through the 
 ear, by his works through the eye; but, because those ordinary sights 
 and sounds do not duly affect men, God is pleased sometimes to astonish 
 men by the eye with his lightnings and by the ear with his thunder. It 
 is very probable that at this time, when Elihu was speaking, it 
 thundered and lightened, for he speaks of the phenomena as present; 
 and, God being about to speak

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:1"><I>ch.</I> xxxviii. 1</A>),

 these were, as afterwards on Mount Sinai, the proper prefaces to
 command attention and awe. Observe here, 

 1. How Elihu was himself affected, and desired to affect Job, with the
 appearance of God's glory in the thunder and lightning 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>):

 "For my part," says Elihu, "<I>my heart trembles</I> at it; though I 
 have often heard it, often seen it, yet it is still terrible to me, and 
 makes every joint of me tremble, and my heart beat as if it would move 
 <I>out of its place.</I>" Thunder and lightning have been dreadful to 
 the wicked: the emperor Caligula would run into a corner, or under a 
 bed, for fear of them. Those who are very much astonished, we say, are 
 <I>thunder-struck.</I> Even good people think thunder and lightning 
 very awful; and that which makes them the more terrible is the hurt 
 often done by lightning, many having been killed by it. Sodom and 
 Gomorrah were laid in ruins by it. It is a sensible indication of what 
 God could do to this sinful world, and what he <I>will do,</I> at last, 
 by the fire to which it is reserved. Our hearts, like Elihu's should 
 tremble at it for fear of God's judgments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:120">Ps. cxix. 120</A>.

 He also calls upon Job to attend to it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Hear attentively the noise of his voice.</I> Perhaps as yet it 
 thundered at a distance, and could not be heard without listening: or 
 rather, Though the thunder will be heard, and whatever we are doing we 
 cannot help attending to it, yet, to apprehend and understand the 
 instructions God thereby gives us, we have need to hear with great 
 attention and application of mind. Thunder is called <I>the voice of 
 the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+29:3-9">Ps. xxix. 3</A>,

 &c.), because by it God speaks to the children of men to fear before
 him, and it should put us in mind of that mighty word by which the 
 world was at first made, which is called thunder. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:7">
 Ps. civ. 7</A>, 

 <I>At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away,</I> namely, the
 waters, when God said, <I>Let them be gathered into one place.</I> 
 Those that are themselves affected with God's greatness should labour 
 to affect others.

 2. How he describes them.

 (1.) Their original, not their second causes, but the first. God
 directs the thunder, and the lightning is his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Their production and motion are not from chance, but from the counsel 
 of God and under the direction and dominion of his providence, though 
 to us they seem accidental and ungovernable.

 (2.) Their extent. The claps of thunder roll <I>under the whole 
 heaven,</I> and are heard far and near; so are the lightnings darted to 
 <I>the ends of the earth;</I> they come out of the one part under 
 heaven and shine to the other,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:24">Luke xvii. 24</A>.

 Though the same lightning and thunder do not reach to all places, yet
 they reach to very distant places in a moment, and there is no place 
 but, some time or other, has these alarms from heaven. 

 (3.) Their order. The lightning is first directed, and <I>after it a 
 voice roars,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The flash of fire, and the noise it makes in a watery cloud, are really 
 at the same time; but, because the motion of light is much quicker than 
 that of sound, we see the lightning some time before we hear the 
 thunder, as we see the firing of a great gun at a distance before we 
 hear the report of it. The thunder is here called <I>the voice of God's 
 excellency,</I> because by it he proclaims his transcendent power and 
 greatness. <I>He sends forth his voice and that a mighty voice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:33">Ps. lxviii. 33</A>.

 (4.) Their violence. <I>He will not stay them,</I> that is, he does not 
 need to check them, or hold them back, lest they should grow unruly and 
 out of his power to restrain them, but lets them take their course, 
 says to them, <I>Go, and they go--Come, and they come--Do this, and 
 they do it.</I> He will not stay the rains and showers that usually 
 follow upon the thunder (which he had spoken of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:27,29"><I>ch.</I>  xxxvi. 27, 29</A>),

 so some, but will pour them out upon the earth <I>when his voice is
 heard.</I> Thunder-showers are sweeping rains, and for them he <I>makes 
 the lightnings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:7">Ps. cxxxv. 7</A>.

 (5.) The inference he draws from all this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Does God thunder thus marvellously with his voice? We must then 
 conclude that his other works are great, and such as we cannot 
 comprehend. From this one instance we may argue to all, that, in the 
 dispensations of his providence, there is that which is too great, too 
 strong, for us to oppose or strive against, and too high, too deep, for 
 us to arraign or quarrel with.</P>

 &nbsp; 10  By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the
 waters is straitened.

 do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in

 land, or for mercy.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The changes and extremities of the weather, wet or dry, hot or cold, 
 are the subject of a great deal of our common talk and observation; but 
 how seldom do we think and speak of these things, as Elihu does here, 
 with an awful regard to God the director of them, who shows his power 
 and serves the purposes of his providence by them! We must take notice 
 of the glory of God, not only in the thunder and lightning, but in the 
 more common revolutions of the weather, which are not so terrible and 
 which make less noise. As,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In the snow and rain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Thunder and lightning happen usually in the summer, but here he takes 
 notice of the winter-weather. Then <I>he saith to the snow, Be thou on 
 the earth;</I> he commissions it, he commands it, he appoints it, where 
 it shall light and how long it shall lie. He speaks, and it is done: as 
 in the creation of the world, <I>Let there be light,</I> so in the 
 works of common providence, <I>Snow, be thou on the earth.</I> Saying 
 and doing are not two things with God, though they are with us. When he 
 speaks the word <I>the small rain</I> distils and <I>the great rain</I> 
 pours down as he pleases--<I>the winter-rain</I> (so the LXX.), for in 
 those countries, when the winter was past, the rain was over and gone, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:11">Cant. ii. 11</A>.

 The distinction in the Hebrew between the small rain and the great rain
 is this, that the former is called a shower of <I>rain,</I> the latter 
 of <I>rains,</I> many showers in one; but all are the showers <I>of his 
 strength:</I> the power of God is to be observed as much in the small 
 rain that soaks into the earth as in the great rain that batters on the 
 house-top and washes away all before it.  Note, The providence of God 
 is to be acknowledged, both by husbandmen in the fields and travellers 
 upon the road, in every shower of rain, whether it does them a kindness 
 of a diskindness. It is sin and folly to contend with God's providence 
 in the weather; if he send the snow or rain, can we hinder them? Or 
 shall we be angry at them? It is as absurd to quarrel with any other 
 disposal of Providence concerning ourselves or ours. The effect of the 
 extremity of the winter-weather is that it obliges both men and beasts 
 to retire, making it uncomfortable and unsafe for them to go abroad.

 1. Men retire to their houses from their labours in the field, and keep 
 within doors 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>He seals up the hand of every man.</I> In frost and snow, husbandmen 
 cannot follow their business, nor some tradesmen, nor travellers, when 
 the weather is extreme. The plough is laid by, the shipping laid up, 
 nothing is to be done, nothing to be got, that men, being taken off 
 from their own work, <I>may know his work,</I> and contemplate that, 
 and give him the glory of that, and, by the consideration of that work 
 of his in the weather which seals up their hands, be led to celebrate 
 his other great and marvellous works. Note, When we are, upon any 
 account, disabled from following our worldly business, and taken off 
 from it, we should spend our time rather in the exercises of piety and 
 devotion (in acquainting ourselves with the works of God and praising 
 him in them) than in foolish idle sports and recreations. When our 
 hands are sealed up our hearts should be thus opened, and the less we 
 have at any time to do in the world the more we should thereby be 
 driven to our Bibles and our knees.

 2. <I>The beasts</I> also <I>retire to</I> their <I>dens and remain in 
 their</I> close <I>places,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 It is meant of the wild beasts, which, being wild, must seek a shelter 
 for themselves, to which by instinct they are directed, while the tame 
 beasts, which are serviceable to man, are housed and protected by his 
 care, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+9:20">Exod. ix. 20</A>.

 The ass has no den but his master's crib, and thither he goes, not only
 to be safe and warm, but to be fed. Nature directs all creatures to 
 shelter themselves from a storm; and shall man alone be unprovided with 
 an ark?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In the winds, which blow from different quarters and produce 
 different effects 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Out of the hidden place</I> (so it may be read) <I>comes the 
 whirlwind;</I> it turns round, and so it is hard to say from which 
 point it comes but it comes from <I>the secret chamber,</I> as the word 
 signifies, which I am not so willing to understand of the <I>south,</I> 
 because he says here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 that the wind out of the south is so far from being a whirlwind that it 
 is a warming, quieting, wind. But at this time, perhaps, Elihu saw a 
 whirlwind-cloud coming out of the south and making towards them, out of 
 which the Lord spoke soon after,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:1"><I>ch.</I> xxxviii. 1</A>.

 Or, if turbulent winds which bring showers come out of the south, cold
 and drying blasts come out of the north to scatter the vapours and 
 clear the air of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In the frost, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 See the cause of it: It <I>is given by the breath of God,</I> that is, 
 by the word of his power and the command of his will; or, as some 
 understand it, by the wind, which is the breath of God, as the thunder 
 is his voice; it is caused by the cold freezing wind out of the north. 
 See the effect of it: <I>The breadth of the waters is straitened,</I> 
 that is, the waters that had spread themselves, and flowed with 
 liberty, are congealed, benumbed, arrested, bound up in crystal 
 fetters. This is such an instance of the power of God as, if it were 
 not common, would be next to a miracle.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. In the clouds, the womb where all these watery meteors are 
 conceived, of which he had spoken, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:28"><I>ch.</I> xxxvi. 28</A>.

 Three sorts of clouds he here speaks of:--

 1. Close, black, thick clouds, pregnant with showers; and these with
 watering <I>he wearies</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 that is, they spend themselves, and are exhausted by the rain into 
 which they melt and are dissolved, pouring out water till they are 
 weary and can pour out no more. See what pains, as I may say, the 
 creatures, even those above us, take to serve man: the clouds water the 
 earth till they are weary; they spend and are spent for our benefit, 
 which shames and condemns us for the little good we do in our places, 
 though it would be to our own advantage, for <I>he that watereth shall 
 be watered also himself.</I>

 2. Bright thin clouds, clouds without water; and these <I>he 
 scattereth;</I> they are dispersed of themselves, and not dissolved 
 into rain, but what becomes of them we know not. The bright cloud, in 
 the evening, when the sky is red, is scattered, and proves an earnest 
 of a fair day,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:2">Matt. xvi. 2</A>.

 3. Flying clouds, which do not dissolve, as the thick cloud, into a
 close rain, but are carried upon the wings of the wind from place to 
 place, dropping showers as they go; and these are said to be <I>turned 
 round about</I> by his counsels, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 The common people say that the rain is determined by the planets, which 
 is as bad divinity as it is philosophy, for it is guided and governed 
 by the counsel of God, which extends even to those things that seem 
 most casual and minute, <I>that they may do whatsoever he commands 
 them;</I> for the stormy winds, and the clouds that are driven by them, 
 fulfil his word; and by this means he <I>causes it to rain upon one 
 city and not upon another,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:7,8">Amos iv. 7, 8</A>.

 Thus his will is done <I>upon the face of the world in the earth,</I>
 that is, among the children of men, to whom God has an eye in all these 
 things, of whom it is said that he <I>made them to dwell on the face of 
 the earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:26">Acts xvii. 26</A>.

 The inferior creatures, being incapable of doing moral actions, are
 incapable of receiving rewards and punishments: but, among the children 
 of men, God causes the rain to come, either for the correction of his 
 land or for a mercy to it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:13"><I>v.</I>  13</A>.

 (1.) Rain sometimes turns into a judgment. It is a scourge to a sinful 
 land; as once it was for the destruction of the whole world, so it is 
 now often for the correction or discipline of some parts of it, by 
 hindering seedness and harvest, raising the waters, and damaging the 
 fruits. Some have said that our nation has received much more prejudice 
 by the excess of rain than by the want of it. 

 (2.) At other times it is a blessing. It is <I>for his land,</I> that 
 this may be made fruitful; and, besides that which is just necessary, 
 he gives <I>for mercy,</I> to fatten it and make it more fruitful. See 
 what a necessary dependence we have upon God, when the very same thing, 
 according to the proportion in which it is given, may be either a great 
 judgment or a great mercy, and without God we cannot have either a 
 shower or a fair gleam.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the
 wondrous works of God.
 &nbsp; 15  Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light
 of his cloud to shine?
 &nbsp; 16  Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous
 works of him which is perfect in knowledge?
 &nbsp; 17  How thy garments <I>are</I> warm, when he quieteth the earth by
 the south <I>wind?</I>
 &nbsp; 18  Hast thou with him spread out the sky, <I>which is</I> strong,
 <I>and</I> as a molten looking glass?
 &nbsp; 19  Teach us what we shall say unto him; <I>for</I> we cannot order
 <I>our speech</I> by reason of darkness.
 &nbsp; 20  Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he
 shall be swallowed up.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Elihu here addresses himself closely to Job, desiring him to apply what 
 he had hitherto said to himself. He begs that he would hearken to this 
 discourse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 that he would pause awhile: <I>Stand still, and consider the wondrous 
 works of God.</I> What we hear is not likely to profit us unless we 
 consider it, and we are not likely to consider things fully unless we 
 stand still and compose ourselves to the consideration of them. The 
 works of God, being wondrous, both deserve and need our consideration, 
 and the due consideration of them will help to reconcile us to all his 
 providences. Elihu, for the humbling of Job, shows him,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That he had no insight into natural causes, could neither see the 
 springs of them nor foresee the effects of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:15-17"><I>v.</I> 15-17</A>):

 <I>Dost thou know</I> this and know that which are <I>the wondrous 
 works of him who is perfect in knowledge?</I> We are here taught,

 1. The perfection of God's knowledge. It is one of the most glorious 
 perfections of God that he is perfect in knowledge; he is omniscient. 
 His knowledge is intuitive: he <I>sees,</I> and does not know by 
 report. It is intimate and entire: he knows things truly, and not by 
 their colours--thoroughly, and not by piecemeal. To his knowledge there 
 is nothing distant, but all near--nothing future, but all 
 present--nothing hid, but all open. We ought to acknowledge this in all 
 his wondrous works, and it is sufficient to satisfy us in those 
 wondrous works which we know not the meaning of that they are the works 
 of one that knows what he does. 

 2.  The imperfection of our knowledge.  The greatest philosophers are 
 much in the dark concerning the powers and works of nature. We are a 
 paradox to ourselves, and every thing about us is a mystery. The 
 gravitation of bodies, and the cohesion of the parts of matter, are 
 most certain, and yet unaccountable. It is good for us to be made 
 sensible of our own ignorance.  Some have confessed their ignorance, 
 and those that would not do this have betrayed it. But we must all 
 infer from it what incompetent judges we are of the divine politics, 
 when we understand so little even of the divine mechanics.

 (1.) We know not what orders God has given concerning the clouds, nor 
 what orders he will give, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 That all is done by determination and with design we are sure; but what 
 is determined, and what designed, and when the plan was laid, we know 
 not. God often <I>causes the light of his cloud to shine,</I> in the 
 rainbow (so some), in the lightning (so others); but did we foresee, or
 could we foretel, when he would to it?  If we foresee the change of 
 weather a few hours before, by vulgar observation, or when second 
 causes have begun to work by the weather-glass, yet how little do these 
 show us of the purposes of God by these changes!

 (2.) We know not how the clouds are poised in the air, the 
 <I>balancing</I> of them, which is one of the wondrous works of God. 
 They are so balanced, so spread, that they never rob us of the benefit 
 of the sun (even the cloudy day is day), so balanced that they do not 
 fall at once, nor burst into cataracts or water-spouts. The rainbow is 
 an intimation of God's favour in balancing the clouds so as to keep 
 them from drowning the world.  Nay, so are they balanced that they 
 impartially distribute their showers on the earth, so that, one time or 
 other, every place has its share. 

 (3.) We know not how the comfortable change comes when the winter is 
 past, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:17"><I>v.</I>  17</A>.

 [1.] How the weather becomes warm after it has been cold. We know how 
 our garment came to be warm upon us, that is, how we come to be warm in 
 our clothes, by reason of the warmth of the air we breathe in. Without 
 God's blessing we should clothe ourselves, yet not be warm, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:6">Hag. i. 6</A>.

 But, when he so orders it, the clothes are warm upon us, which, in the
 extremity of cold weather, would not serve to keep us warm. 

 [2.] How it becomes calm after it has been stormy: <I>He quiets the 
 earth by the south wind,</I> when the spring comes. As he has a 
 blustering freezing north wind, so he has a thawing, composing, south 
 wind; the Spirit is compared to both, because he both convinces and 
 comforts,

 II. That he had no share at all in the first making of the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>Hast thou with him spread out the sky?</I> Thou canst not pretend 
 to have stretched it out without him, no, nor to have stretched it out 
 in conjunction with him; for he was far from needing any help either in 
 contriving or in working." The creation of the vast expanse of the 
 visible heavens 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:6-8">Gen. i. 6-8</A>),

 which we see in being to this day, is a glorious instance of the divine
 power, considering,

 1. That, though it is fluid, yet it is firm. It <I>is strong,</I> and 
 has its name from its stability. It still is what it was, and suffers 
 no decay, nor shall the ordinances of heaven be altered till the lease 
 expires with time. 

 2. That, though it is large, it is bright and most curiously fine: It 
 is a <I>molten looking-glass,</I> smooth and polished, and without the 
 least flaw or crack. In this, as in a looking-glass, we may <I>behold 
 the glory of God</I> and the wisdom of <I>his handy work,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:1">Ps. xix. 1</A>.

 When we look up to heaven above we should remember it is a mirror or 
 looking-glass, not to show us our own faces, but to be a faint 
 representation of the purity, dignity, and brightness of the upper 
 world and its glorious inhabitants.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That neither he nor they were able to speak of the glory of God in 
 any proportion to the merit of the subject, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 1. He challenges Job to be their director, if he durst undertake the 
 task. He speaks it ironically: "<I>Teach us,</I> if thou canst, <I>what 
 we shall say unto him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Thou hast a mind to reason with God, and wouldst have us to contend 
 with him on thy behalf; teach us then what we shall say.  Canst thou 
 see further into this abyss than we can?  If thou canst, favour us with 
 thy discoveries, furnish us with instructions."

 2. He owns his own insufficiency both in speaking to God and in 
 speaking of him: <I>We cannot order our speech by reason of 
 darkness.</I> Note, The best of men are much in the dark concerning the 
 glorious perfections of the divine nature and the administrations of 
 the divine government.  Those that through grace know much of God, yet 
 know little, yea, nothing, in comparison with what is to be known, and 
 what will be known, when that which is perfect shall come and the veil 
 shall be rent. When we would speak of God we speak confusedly and with 
 great uncertainly, and are soon at a loss and run aground, not for want 
 of matter, but for want of words. As we must always begin with fear and 
 trembling, lest we speak amiss (<I>De Deo etiam vera dicere periculosum 
 est</I>--<I>Even while affirming what is true concerning God we incur 
 risk</I>), so we must conclude with shame and blushing, for having 
 spoken no better. Elihu himself had, for his part, spoken well on God's 
 behalf, and yet is so far from expecting a fee, or thinking that God 
 was beholden to him for it, or that he was fit to be standing counsel 
 for him, that

 (1.) He is even ashamed of what he has said, not of the cause, but of 
 his own management of it: "<I>Shall it be told him that I speak?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Shall it be reported to him as a meritorious piece of service, worthy 
 his notice? By no means; let it never be spoken of," for he fears that 
 the subject has suffered by his undertaking it, as a fine face is 
 wronged by a bad painter, and his performance is so far from meriting 
 thanks that it needs pardon. When we have done all we can for God we 
 must acknowledge that we are unprofitable servants and have nothing at 
 all to boast of. He is afraid of saying any more: <I>If a man 
 speak,</I> if he undertake to plead for God, much more if he offer to 
 plead against him, <I>surely he shall be swallowed up.</I> If he speak 
 presumptuously, God's wrath shall soon consume him; but, if ever so 
 well, he will soon lose himself in the mystery and be over powered by 
 the divine lustre. Astonishment will strike him blind and dumb.</P>

 Elihu here concludes his discourse with some short but great sayings 
 concerning the glory of God, as that which he was himself impressed, 
 and desired to impress others, with a holy awe of. He speaks concisely, 
 and in haste, because, it should seem, he perceived that God was about 
 to take the work into his own hands. 

 1. He observes that God who has said that he will <I>dwell in the thick 
 darkness</I> and <I>make that his pavilion</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+6:1,Ps+18:11">2 Chron. vi. 1, Ps. xviii. 11</A>)

 is in that awful chariot advancing towards them, as if he were
 preparing his throne for judgment, surrounded with <I>clouds and 
 darkness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+97:2,9">Ps. xcvii. 2, 9</A>.

 He saw the cloud, with a whirlwind in the bosom of it, coming out of
 the south; but now it hung so thick, so black, over their heads, that 
 they could none of them <I>see the bright light which</I> just before 
 <I>was in the clouds.</I> The light of the sun was now eclipsed. This 
 reminded him of the darkness by reason of which he could not speak

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and made him afraid to go on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Thus the disciples <I>feared when they entered into a cloud,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+9:34">Luke ix. 34</A>.

 Yet he looks to the north, and sees it clear that way, which gives him
 hope that the clouds are not gathering for a deluge; they are covered, 
 but not surrounded, with them. He expects that <I>the wind will 
 pass</I> (so it may be read) <I>and cleanse them,</I> such a wind as
 passed over the earth to clear it from the waters of Noah's flood 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:1">Gen. viii. 1</A>),

 in token of the return of God's favour; and then <I>fair weather will
 come out of the north</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>)

 and all will be well. God will not always frown, nor contend for ever.

 2. He hastens to conclude, now that God is about to speak; and 
 therefore delivers much in a few words, as the sum of all that he had 
 been discoursing of, which, if duly considered, would not only clench 
 the nail he had been driving, but make way for what God would say. He 
 observes,

 (1.) That <I>with God is terrible majesty.</I> He is a God of glory and 
 such transcendent perfection as cannot but strike an awe upon all his 
 attendants and a terror upon all his adversaries. <I>With God is 
 terrible praise</I> (so some), for he is <I>fearful in praises,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:11">Exod. xv. 11</A>.

 (2.) That when we speak <I>touching the Almighty</I> we must own that
 <I>we cannot find him out;</I> our finite understandings cannot 
 comprehend his infinite perfections, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Can we put the sea into an egg-shell? We cannot trace the steps he 
 takes in his providence. <I>His way is in the sea.</I>

 (3.) That <I>he is excellent in power.</I> It is the excellency of his 
 power that he can do whatever he pleases in heaven and earth. The 
 universal extent and irresistible force of his power are the excellency 
 of it; no creature has an arm like him, so long, so strong. 

 (4.) That he is not less excellent in wisdom and righteousness, <I>in 
 judgment and plenty of justice,</I> else there would be little 
 excellency in his power. We may be sure that he who can do every thing 
 will do every thing for the best, for he is infinitely wise, and will 
 not in any thing do wrong, for he is infinitely just.  When he executes 
 judgment upon sinners, yet there is plenty of justice in the execution, 
 and he inflicts not more than they deserve. 

 (5.) That <I>he will not afflict,</I> that is, that he will not afflict 
 willingly; it is no pleasure to him to grieve the children of men, much 
 less his own children. He never afflicts but when there is cause and 
 when there is need, and he does not overburden us with affliction, but 
 considers our frame. Some read it thus: "<I>The Almighty, whom we 
 cannot find out, is great in power, but he will not afflict in 
 judgment, and with him is plenty of justice,</I> nor is he extreme to 
 mark what we do amiss." 

 (6.) He values not the censures of those who are wise in their own 
 conceit: <I>He respecteth them not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 He will not alter his counsels to oblige them, nor can those that 
 prescribe to him prevail with him to do as they would have him do. He 
 regards the prayer of the humble, but not the policies of the crafty.  
 No, the foolishness of God is wiser than men,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:15">1 Cor. i. 15</A>.

 (7.) From all this it is easy to infer that, since God is great, he is
 greatly to be feared; nay, because he is gracious and will not afflict, 
 <I>men do therefore fear him,</I> for <I>there is forgiveness with him, 
 that he may be feared,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:1-8">Ps. cxxx.</A>

 4. It is the duty and interest of all men to fear God. <I>Men shall
 fear him</I> (so some); sooner or later they shall fear him. Those that
 will not fear the Lord and his goodness shall for ever tremble under
 the pourings out of the vials of his wrath.</P>
