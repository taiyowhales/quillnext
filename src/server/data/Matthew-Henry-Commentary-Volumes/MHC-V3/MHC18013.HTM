 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job here comes to make application of what he had said in the foregoing
 chapter; and now we have him not in so good a temper as he was in then:
 for, 

 I. He is very bold with his friends, comparing himself with them,
 notwithstanding the mortifications he was under, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 Condemning them for their falsehood, their forwardness to judge, their
 partiality and deceitfulness under colour of pleading God's cause

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:4-8">ver. 4-8</A>),

 and threatening them with the judgments of God for their so doing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:9-12">ver. 9-12</A>),

 desiring them to be silent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:5,13,17">ver. 5, 13, 17</A>),

 and turning from them to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:3">ver. 3</A>.

 II. He is very bold with his God. 

 1. In some expressions his faith is very bold, yet that is not more 
 bold than welcome, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:15,16,18">ver. 15, 16, 18</A>.
 
 But, 

 2. In other expressions his passion is rather too bold in
 expostulations with God concerning the deplorable condition he was in

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:14,19">ver. 14, 19</A>,

 &c.), complaining of the confusion he was in

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:20-22">ver. 20-22</A>),

 and the loss he was at to find out the sin that provoked God thus to
 afflict him, and in short of the rigour of God's proceedings against
 him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:23-28">ver. 23-28</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Lo, mine eye hath seen all <I>this,</I> mine ear hath heard and
 understood it.
 &nbsp; 2  What ye know, <I>the same</I> do I know also: I <I>am</I> not inferior
 unto you.
 &nbsp; 3  Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason
 with God.
 &nbsp; 4  But ye <I>are</I> forgers of lies, ye <I>are</I> all physicians of no
 value.
 &nbsp; 5  O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be
 your wisdom.
 &nbsp; 6  Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my
 lips.
 &nbsp; 7  Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
 &nbsp; 8  Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?
 &nbsp; 9  Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man
 mocketh another, do ye <I>so</I> mock him?
 &nbsp; 10  He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept
 persons.
 &nbsp; 11  Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall
 upon you?
 &nbsp; 12  Your remembrances <I>are</I> like unto ashes, your bodies to
 bodies of clay.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job here warmly expresses his resentment of the unkindness of his 
 friends.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He comes up with them as one that understood the matter in dispute 
 as well as they, and did not need to be taught by them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 They compelled him, as the Corinthians did Paul, to commend himself and 
 his own knowledge, yet not in a way of self-applause, but of 
 self-justification. All he had before said his eye had seen confirmed 
 by many instances, and his ear had heard seconded by many authorities, 
 and he well understood it and what use to make of it. Happy are those 
 who not only see and hear, but understand, the greatness, glory, and 
 sovereignty of God. This, he thought, would justify what he had said 
 before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:3"><I>ch.</I> xii. 3</A>),

 which he repeats here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>What you know, the same do I know also,</I> so that I need not come
 to you to be taught; <I>I am not inferior unto you</I> in wisdom." 
 Note, Those who enter into disputation enter into temptation to magnify 
 themselves and vilify their brethren more than is fit, and therefore 
 ought to watch and pray against the workings of pride.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He turns from them to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Surely I would speak to the Almighty;</I> as if he had said, "I can
 promise myself no satisfaction in talking to you. O that I might have 
 liberty to <I>reason with God!</I> He would not be so hard upon me as 
 you are." The prince himself will perhaps give audience to a poor 
 petitioner with more mildness, patience, and condescension, than the 
 servants will. Job would rather argue with God himself than with his 
 friends. See here,

 1.  What confidence those have towards God whose hearts condemn them 
 not of reigning hypocrisy: they can, with humble boldness, appear 
 before him and appeal to him. 

 2. What comfort those have in God whose neighbours unjustly condemn 
 them: if they may not speak to them with any hopes of a fair hearing, 
 yet they may speak to the Almighty; they have easy access to him and 
 shall find acceptance with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He condemns them for their unjust and uncharitable treatment of 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 1. They falsely accused him, and that was unjust: <I>You are forgers of 
 lies.</I> They framed a wrong hypothesis concerning the divine 
 Providence, and misrepresented it, as if it did never remarkably 
 afflict any but wicked men in this world, and thence they drew a false 
 judgment concerning Job, that he was certainly a hypocrite. For this 
 gross mistake, both in doctrine and application, he thinks an 
 indictment of forgery lies against them. To speak lies is bad enough, 
 though but at second hand, but to forge them with contrivance and 
 deliberation is much worse; yet against this wrong neither innocency 
 nor excellency will be a fence. 

 2. They basely deceived him, and that was unkind. They undertook his 
 cure, and pretended to be his physicians; but they were all 
 <I>physicians of no value,</I> "idol-physicians, who can do me no more 
 good than an idol can." They were worthless physicians, who neither 
 understood his case nor knew how to prescribe to him--mere empirics, 
 who pretended to great things, but in conference added nothing to him: 
 he was never the wiser for all they said. Thus to broken hearts and 
 wounded consciences all creatures, without Christ, are physicians of no 
 value, on which one may spend all and be never the better, but rather 
 grow worse,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+5:26">Mark  v. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He begs they would be silent and give him a patient hearing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 1. He thinks it would be a credit to them if they would say no more, 
 having said too much already: "<I>Hold your peace, and it shall be your 
 wisdom,</I> for thereby you will conceal your ignorance and ill-nature, 
 which now appear in all you say." They pleaded that they could not 
 forbear speaking

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:2,11:2,3"><I>ch.</I> iv. 2, xi. 2, 3</A>);

 but he tells them that they would better have consulted their own
 reputation if they had enjoined themselves silence. Better say nothing 
 than nothing to the purpose or that which tends to the dishonour of God 
 and the grief of our brethren.  <I>Even a fool, when he holds his 
 peace, is accounted wise,</I> because nothing appears to the contrary, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:28">Prov. xvii. 28</A>.

 And, as silence is an evidence of wisdom, so it is a means of it, as it
 gives time to think and hear.

 2. He thinks it would be a piece of justice to him to hear what he had 
 to say: <I>Hear now my reasoning.</I> Perhaps, though they did not 
 interrupt him in his discourse, yet they seemed careless, and did not 
 much heed what he said. He therefore begged that they would not only 
 hear, but hearken.  Note, We should be very willing and glad to hear 
 what those have to say for themselves whom, upon any account, we are 
 tempted to have hard thoughts of. Many a man, if he could but be fairly 
 heard, would be fairly acquitted, even in the consciences of those that 
 run him down.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He endeavours to convince them of the wrong they did to God's 
 honour, while they pretended to plead for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 They valued themselves upon it that they spoke for God, were advocates
 for him, and had undertaken to justify him and his proceedings against 
 Job; and, being (as they thought) of counsel for the sovereign, they 
 expected not only the ear of the court and the last word, but judgment 
 on their side. But Job tells them plainly,

 1. That God and his cause did not need such advocates: "<I>Will you</I> 
 think to <I>contend for God,</I> as if his justice were clouded and 
 wanted to be cleared up, or as if he were at a loss what to say and 
 wanted you to speak for him? Will you, who are so weak and passionate, 
 put in for the honour of pleading God's cause?" Good work ought not to 
 be put into bad hands. <I>Will you accept his person?</I> If those who 
 have not right on their side carry their cause, it is by the partiality 
 of the judge in favour of their persons; but God's cause is so just 
 that it needs no such methods for the support of it. He is a God, and 
 can plead for himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:31">Judg. vi. 31</A>);

 and, if you were for ever silent, the heavens would declare his
 righteousness. 

 2. That God's cause suffered by such management. Under pretence of 
 justifying God in afflicting Job they magisterially condemned him as a 
 hypocrite and a bad man. "This" (says he) "<I>is speaking wickedly</I>" 
 (for uncharitableness and censoriousness are wickedness, great 
 wickedness; it is an offence to God to wrong our brethren); "it is 
 talking <I>deceitfully,</I> for you condemn one whom yet perhaps your 
 own consciences, at the same time, cannot but acquit.  Your principles 
 are false and your arguings fallacious, and will it excuse you to say, 
 <I>It is for God?</I>" No, for a good intention will not justify, much 
 less will it sanctify, a bad word or action. God's truth needs not our 
 lie, nor God's cause either our sinful policies or our sinful passions. 
 The wrath of man works not the righteousness of God, nor may we <I>do 
 evil that good may come,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:7,8">Rom. iii. 7, 8</A>.

 Pious frauds (as they call them) are impious cheats; and devout
 persecutions are horrid profanations of the name of God, as theirs who 
 <I>hated their brethren,</I> and <I>cast them out, saying, Let the Lord 
 be glorified,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:5,Joh+16:2">Isa. lxvi. 5; John xvi. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He endeavours to possess them with a fear of God's judgment, and so 
 to bring them to a better temper. Let them not think to impose upon God 
 as they might upon a man like themselves, nor expect to gain his 
 countenance in their bad practices by pretending a zeal for him and his 
 honour. "As one man mocks another by flattering him, do you think so to 
 mock him and deceive him?" Assuredly those who think to put a cheat 
 upon God will prove to have put a cheat upon themselves. <I>Be not 
 deceived, God is not mocked.</I> That they might not think thus to jest 
 with God, and affront him, Job would have them to consider both God and 
 themselves, and then they would find themselves unable to enter into 
 judgment with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let them consider what a God he is into whose service they had thus 
 thrust themselves, and to whom they really did so much disservice, and 
 enquire whether they could give him a good account of what they did. 
 Consider, 

 (1.) The strictness of his scrutiny and enquiries concerning them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 "<I>Is it good that he should search you out?</I> Can you bear to have
 the principles looked into which you go upon in your censures, and to 
 have the bottom of the matter found out?" Note, It concerns us all 
 seriously to consider whether it will be to our advantage or no that 
 God searches the heart. It is good to an upright man who means honestly 
 that God should search him; therefore he prays for it: <I>Search me, O 
 God! and know my heart.</I> God's omniscience is a witness of his 
 sincerity. But it is bad to him who looks one way and rows another that 
 God should search him out, and lay him open to his confusion.

 (2.) The severity of his rebukes and displeasure against them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 "<I>If you do accept persons,</I> though but secretly and in heart,
 <I>he will surely reprove you;</I> he will be so far from being pleased 
 with your censures of me, though under colour of vindicating him, that 
 he will resent them as a great provocation, as any prince or great man 
 would if a base action were done under the sanction of his name and 
 under the colour of advancing his interest." Note, What we do amiss we 
 shall certainly be reproved for, one way or other, one time or other, 
 though it be done ever so secretly. 

 (3.) The terror of his majesty, which if they would duly stand in awe 
 of they would not do that which would make them obnoxious to his wrath 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>Shall not his excellency make you afraid?</I> You that have great
 knowledge of God, and profess religion and a fear of him, how dare you 
 talk at this rate and give yourselves so great a liberty of speech?  
 <I>Ought you not to walk</I> and talk <I>in the fear of God?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:9">Neh. v. 9</A>.

 <I>Should not his dread fall upon you,</I> and give a check to your
 passions?" Methinks Job speaks this as one that did himself know the 
 terror of the Lord, and lived in a holy fear of him, whatever his 
 friends suggested to the contrary. Note,

 [1.] There is in God a dreadful excellency. He is the most excellent 
 Being, has all excellencies in himself and in each infinitely excels 
 any creature. His excellencies in themselves are amiable and lovely. He 
 is the most beautiful Being; but considering man's distance from God by 
 nature, and his defection and degeneracy by sin, his excellencies are 
 dreadful. His power, holiness, justice, yea, and his goodness too, are 
 dreadful excellencies. They shall fear the Lord and his goodness.

 [2.] A holy awe of this dreadful excellency should fall upon us and 
 make us afraid.  This would awaken impenitent sinners and bring them to 
 repentance, and would influence all to be careful to please him and 
 afraid of offending him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let them consider themselves, and what an unequal match they were
 for this great God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>Your remembrances</I> (all that in you for which you hope to be
 remembered when you are gone) <I>are like unto ashes,</I> worthless and 
 weak, and easily trampled on and blown away.  <I>Your bodies are like 
 bodies of clay,</I> mouldering and coming to nothing. Your memories, 
 you think, will survive your bodies, but, alas!  they are like ashes 
 which will be shovelled up with your dust." Note, the consideration of 
 our own meanness and mortality should make us afraid of offending God, 
 and furnishes a good reason why we should not despise and trample upon 
 our brethren. Bishop Patrick gives another sense of this verse: "Your 
 remonstrances on God's behalf are no better than dust, and the 
 arguments you accumulate but like so many heaps of dirt."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let
 come on me what <I>will.</I>
 &nbsp; 14  Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in
 mine hand?
 &nbsp; 15  Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will
 maintain mine own ways before him.
 &nbsp; 16  He also <I>shall be</I> my salvation: for a hypocrite shall not
 come before him.
 &nbsp; 17  Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your
 ears.
 &nbsp; 18  Behold now, I have ordered <I>my</I> cause; I know that I shall
 be justified.
 &nbsp; 19  Who <I>is</I> he <I>that</I> will plead with me? for now, if I hold my
 tongue, I shall give up the ghost.
 &nbsp; 20  Only do not two <I>things</I> unto me: then will I not hide
 myself from thee.
 &nbsp; 21  Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make
 me afraid.
 &nbsp; 22  Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and
 answer thou me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job here takes fresh hold, fast hold, of his integrity, as one that was 
 resolved not to let it go, nor suffer it to be wrested from him. His 
 firmness in this matter is commendable and his warmth excusable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He entreats his friends and all the company to let him alone, and 
 not interrupt him in what he was about to say 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 but diligently to hearken to it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 He would have his own protestation to be decisive, for none but God and
 himself knew his heart. "Be silent therefore, and let me hear no more 
 of you, but hearken diligently to what I say, and let my own oath for 
 confirmation be an end of the strife."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He resolves to adhere to the testimony his own conscience gave of 
 his integrity; and though his friends called it obstinacy that should 
 not shake his constancy: "I will speak in my own defence, and <I>let 
 come on me what will,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Let my friends put what construction they please upon it, and think the
 worse of me for it; I hope God will not make my necessary defence to be 
 my offence, as you do. He will justify me

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 and then nothing can come amiss to me." Note, Those that are upright,
 and have the assurance of their uprightness, may cheerfully welcome 
 every event. Come what will, <I>bene pr&aelig;paratum pectus--they are ready
 for it.</I> He resolves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 that he will <I>maintain his own ways.</I> He would never part with the
 satisfaction he had in having walked uprightly with God; for, though he 
 could not justify every word he had spoken, yet, in the general, his 
 ways were good, and he would maintain his uprightness; and why should 
 he not, since that was his great support under his present exercises, 
 as it was Hezekiah's, <I>Now, Lord, remember how I have walked before 
 thee?</I> Nay, he would not only not betray his own cause, or give it 
 up, but he would openly avow his sincerity; for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 "<I>If hold my tongue,</I> and do not speak for myself, my silence now
 will for ever silence me, for <I>I shall</I> certainly <I>give up the 
 ghost,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 "If I cannot be cleared, yet let me be eased, by what I say," as Elihu,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:17,20"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 17, 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He complains of the extremity of pain and misery he was in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):
 
 <I>Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth?</I> That is,

 1. "Why do I suffer such agonies? I cannot but wonder that God should 
 lay so much upon me when he knows I am not a wicked man." He was ready, 
 not only to rend his clothes, but even to tear his flesh, through the 
 greatness of his affliction, and saw himself at the brink of death, and 
 his life in his hand, yet his friends could not charge him with any 
 enormous crime, nor could he himself discover any; no marvel then that 
 he was in such confusion. 

 2. "Why do I stifle and smother the protestations of my innocency?" 
 When a man with great difficulty keeps in what he would say, he bites 
 his lips. "Now," says he, "why may not I take liberty to speak, since I 
 do but vex myself, add to my torment, and endanger my life, by 
 refraining?" Note, It would vex the most patient man, when he has lost 
 every thing else, to be denied the comfort (if he deserves it) of a 
 good conscience and a good name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He comforts himself in God, and still keeps hold of his confidence 
 in him. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he depends upon God for--justification and salvation, the two
 great things we hope for through Christ. 

 (1.) Justification 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>I have ordered my cause, and,</I> upon the whole matter, <I>I know
 that I shall be justified.</I> This he knew because he knew that his 
 Redeemer lived,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:25"><I>ch.</I> xix. 25</A>.

 Those whose hearts are upright with God, in walking not after the flesh
 but after the Spirit, may be sure that through Christ there shall be no 
 condemnation to them, but that, whoever lays any thing to their charge, 
 they shall be justified: they may know that they shall. 

 (2.) Salvation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>He also shall be my salvation.</I> He means it not of temporal
 salvation (he had little expectation of that); but concerning his 
 eternal salvation he was very confident that God would not only be his 
 Saviour to make him happy, but his salvation, in the vision and 
 fruition of whom he should be happy.  And the reason why he depended on 
 God for salvation was because <I>a hypocrite shall not come before 
 him.</I> He knew himself not to be a hypocrite, and that none but 
 hypocrites are rejected of God, and therefore concluded he should not 
 be rejected. Sincerity is our evangelical perfection; nothing will ruin 
 us but the want of that.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. With what constancy he depends upon him: <I>Though he slay me, yet 
 will I trust in him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This is a high expression of faith, and what we should all labour to
 come up to--to trust in God, though he slay us, that is, we must be 
 well pleased with God as a friend even when he seems to come forth 
 against us as an enemy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:8-10"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 8-10</A>.

 We must believe that all shall work for good to us even when all seems 
 to make against us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:5">Jer. xxiv. 5</A>.

 We must proceed and persevere in the way of our duty, though it cost us
 all that is dear to us in this world, even life itself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:35">Heb. xi. 35</A>.

 We must depend upon the performance of the promise when all the ways
 leading to it are shut up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:18">Rom. iv. 18</A>.

 We must rejoice in God when we have nothing else to rejoice in, and
 cleave to him, yea, though we cannot for the present find comfort in 
 him. In a dying hour we must derive from him living comforts; and this 
 is to trust in him though he slay us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He wishes to argue the case even with God himself, if he might but 
 have leave to settle the preliminaries of the treaty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:20-22"><I>v.</I> 20-22</A>.

 He had desired

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 to <I>reason with God,</I> and is still of the same mind. He <I>will
 not hide himself,</I> that is, he will not decline the trial, nor dread 
 the issue of it, but under two provisos:--

 1. That his body might not be tortured with this exquisite pain:
 "<I>Withdraw thy hand far from me;</I> for, while I am in this 
 extremity, I am fit for nothing. I can make a shift to talk with my
 friends, but I know not how to address myself to thee." When we are to 
 converse with God we have need to be composed, and as free as possible 
 from every thing that may make us uneasy.

 2. That his mind might not be terrified with the tremendous majesty of 
 God: "<I>Let not thy dread make me afraid;</I> either let the 
 manifestations of thy presence be familiar or let me be enabled to bear 
 them without disorder and disturbance." Moses himself trembled before 
 God, so did Isaiah and Habakkuk. <I>O God! thou art terrible even in 
 thy holy places.</I> "Lord," says Job, "let me not be put into such a 
 consternation of spirit, together with this bodily affliction; for then 
 I must certainly drop the cause, and shall make nothing of it." See 
 what a folly it is for men to put off their repentance and conversion 
 to a sick-bed and a death-bed. How can even a good man, much less a bad 
 man, reason with God, so as to be justified before him, when he is upon 
 the rack of pain and under the terror of the arrests of death? At such 
 a time it is very bad to have the great work to do, but very 
 comfortable to have it done, as it was to Job, who, if he might but 
 have a little breathing-time, was ready either,

 (1.) To hear God speaking to him by his word, and return an answer: 
 <I>Call thou, and I will answer;</I> or, 

 (2.) To speak to him by prayer, and expect an answer: <I>Let me speak, 
 and answer thou me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 Compare this with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:34,35"><I>ch.</I> ix. 34, 35</A>,

 where he speaks to the same purport. In short, the badness of his case
 was at present such a damp upon him as he could not get over; otherwise 
 he was well assured of the goodness of his cause, and doubted not but 
 to have the comfort of it at last, when the present cloud was over. 
 With such holy boldness may the upright come to the throne of grace, 
 not doubting but to find mercy there.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Job enquires after his sins, and begs to have them discovered to 
 him. He looks up to God, and asks him what was the number of them 
 (<I>How many are my iniquities?</I>) and what were the particulars of 
 them: <I>Make me to know my transgressions,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 His friends were ready enough to tell him how numerous and how heinous
 they were,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:5"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 5</A>.

 "But, Lord," says he, "let me know them from thee; <I>for thy judgment
 is according to truth,</I> theirs is not." This may be taken either, 

 1.  As a passionate complaint of hard usage, that he was punished for 
 his faults and yet was not told what his faults were. Or, 

 2. As a prudent appeal to God from the censures of his friends. He 
 desired that all his sins might be brought to light, as knowing they 
 would then appear not so many, nor so mighty, as his friends suspected 
 him to be guilty of.  Or, 

 3. As a pious request, to the same purport with that which Elihu 
 directed him to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:32"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv. 32</A>.

 <I>That which I see not, teach thou me.</I> Note, A true penitent is
 willing to know the worst of himself; and we should all desire to know 
 what our transgressions are, that we may be particular in the 
 confession of them and on our guard against them for the future.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He bitterly complains of God's withdrawings from him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):
 
 <I>Wherefore hidest thou thy face?</I> This must be meant of something
 more than his outward afflictions; for the loss of estate, children, 
 health, might well consist with God's love; when that was all, he 
 blessed the name of the Lord; but <I>his soul was also sorely 
 vexed,</I> and that is it which he here laments. 

 1. That the favours of the Almighty were suspended. God hid his face as 
 one strange to him, displeased with him, shy and regardless of him. 

 2.  That the terrors of the Almighty were inflicted and impressed upon 
 him.  God held him for his enemy, shot his arrows at him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:4"><I>ch.</I> vi. 4</A>),

 and set him as a mark, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:20"><I>ch.</I> vii. 20</A>.

 Note, The Holy Ghost sometimes denies his favours and discovers his
 terrors to the best and dearest of his saints and servants in this 
 world. This case occurs, not only in the production, but sometimes in 
 the progress of the divine life. Evidences for heaven are eclipsed, 
 sensible communications interrupted, dread of divine wrath impressed, 
 and the returns of comfort, for the present, despaired of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:7-9,88:7,15,16">Ps. lxxvii. 7-9; lxxxviii. 7, 15, 16</A>.

 These are grievous burdens to a gracious soul, that values God's
 loving-kindness as better than life,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:14">Prov. xviii. 14</A>.

 <I>A wounded spirit who can bear?</I> Job, by asking here, <I>Why
 hidest thou thy face?</I> teaches us that, when at any time we are 
 under the sense of God's withdrawings, we are concerned to enquire into 
 the reason of them--what is the sin for which he corrects us and what 
 the good he designs us. Job's sufferings were typical of the sufferings 
 of Christ, from whom not only men hid their faces

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:3">Isa. liii. 3</A>),

 but God hid his, witness the darkness which surrounded him on the cross
 when he cried out, <I>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</I> If 
 this were done to these green trees, what shall be done to the dry? 
 They will for ever be forsaken.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He humbly pleads with God his own utter inability to stand before 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>Wilt thou break a leaf, pursue the dry stubble?</I> Lord, is it for
 thy honour to trample upon one that is down already, or to crush one 
 that neither has nor pretends to any power to resist thee?" Note, We 
 ought to have such an apprehension of the goodness and compassion of 
 God as to believe that he will not <I>break the bruised reed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:20">Matt. xii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He sadly complains of God's severe dealings with him. He owns it 
 was for his sins that God thus contended with him, but thinks it 
 hard,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That his former sins, long since committed, should now be remembered 
 against him, and he should he reckoned with for the old scores 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):
 
 <I>Thou writest bitter things against me.</I> Afflictions are bitter
 things. Writing them denotes deliberation and determination, written as 
 a warrant for execution; it denotes also the continuance of his 
 affliction, for that which is written remains, and, "Herein <I>thou 
 makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth,</I>" that is, "thou 
 punishest me for them, and thereby puttest me in mind of them, and 
 obligest me to renew my repentance for them." Note, 

 (1.) God sometimes writes very bitter things against the best and 
 dearest of his saints and servants, both in outward afflictions and 
 inward disquiet; trouble in body and trouble in mind, that he may 
 humble them, and prove them, and do them good in their latter end. 

 (2.) That the sins of youth are often the smart of age both in respect 
 of sorrow within 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:18,19">Jer. xxxi. 18, 19</A>)
 
 and suffering without,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:11"><I>ch.</I> xx. 11</A>.

 Time does not wear out the guilt of sin. 

 (3.) That when God writes bitter things against us his design therein 
 is to make us possess our iniquities, to bring forgotten sins to mind, 
 and so to bring us to remorse for them as to break us off from them. 
 <I>This is all the fruit, to take away our sin.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That his present mistakes and miscarriages should be so strictly 
 taken notice of, and so severely animadverted upon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 "<I>Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks,</I> not only to afflict me
 and expose me to shame, not only to keep me from escaping the strokes 
 of thy wrath, but that thou mayest critically remark all my motions and 
 look narrowly to all my paths, to correct me for every false step, nay, 
 for but a look awry or a word misapplied; nay, thou <I>settest a print 
 upon the heels of my feet,</I> scorest down every thing I do amiss, to 
 reckon for it; or no sooner have I trodden wrong, though ever so 
 little, than immediately I smart for it; the punishment treads upon the 
 very heels of the sin. Guilt, both of the oldest and of the freshest 
 date, is put together to make up the cause of my calamity." Now,

 (1.) It was not true that God did thus seek advantages against him. He 
 is not thus extreme to mark what we do amiss; if he were, there were no 
 abiding for us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:3">Ps. cxxx. 3</A>.

 But he is so far from this that he deals not with us according to the
 desert, no, not of our manifest sins, which are not <I>found by secret 
 search,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:34">Jer. ii.34</A>.

 This therefore was the language of Job's melancholy; his sober thoughts
 never represented God thus as a hard Master.

 (2.) But we should keep such a strict and jealous eye as this upon 
 ourselves and our own steps, both for the discovery of sin past and the 
 prevention of it for the future. It is good for us all to <I>ponder the 
 path of our feet.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He finds himself wasting away apace under the heavy hand of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 <I>He</I> (that is, man) <I>as a rotten thing,</I> the principle of
 whose putrefaction is in itself, <I>consumes, even like a moth-eaten 
 garment,</I> which becomes continually worse and worse. Or, <I>He</I> 
 (that is, God) <I>like rottenness, and like a moth, consumes me.</I> 
 Compare this with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:12">Hos. v. 12</A>,

 <I>I will be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as
 rottenness;</I> and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:11">Ps. xxxix. 11</A>.

 Note, Man, at the best, wears fast; but, under God's rebukes
 especially, he is soon gone. While there is so little soundness in the 
 soul, no marvel there is so little soundness in the flesh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+38:3">Ps. xxxviii. 3</A>.</P>
