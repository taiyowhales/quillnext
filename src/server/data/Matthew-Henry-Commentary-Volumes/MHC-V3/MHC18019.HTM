 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter is Job's answer to Bildad's discourse in the foregoing 
 chapter. Though his spirit was grieved and much heated, and Bildad was 
 very peevish, yet he gave him leave to say all he designed to say, and 
 did not break in upon him in the midst of his argument; but, when he 
 had done, he gave him a fair answer, in which, 

 I. He complains of unkind usage. And very unkindly he takes it. 

 1. That his comforters added to his affliction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:2-7">ver. 2-7</A>.

 2. That his God was the author of his affliction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:8-12">ver.  8-12</A>.

 3. That his relations and friends were strange to him, and shy of him,
 in his affliction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:20-22">ver.  20-22</A>.

 II. He comforts himself with the believing hopes of happiness in the
 other world, though he had so little comfort in this, making a very 
 solemn confession of his faith, with a desire that it might be recorded 
 as an evidence of his sincerity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:23-27">ver. 23-27</A>.

 III. He concludes with a caution to his friends not to persist in their 
 hard censures of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:28,29">ver.  28, 29</A>.

 If the remonstrance Job here makes of his grievances may serve
 sometimes to justify our complaints, yet his cheerful views of the 
 future state, at the same time, may shame us Christians, and may serve 
 to silence our complaints, or at least to balance them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then Job answered and said,
 &nbsp; 2  How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with
 words?
 &nbsp; 3  These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed
 <I>that</I> ye make yourselves strange to me.
 &nbsp; 4  And be it indeed <I>that</I> I have erred, mine error remaineth
 with myself.
 &nbsp; 5  If indeed ye will magnify <I>yourselves</I> against me, and plead
 against me my reproach:
 &nbsp; 6  Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me
 with his net.
 &nbsp; 7  Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud,
 but <I>there is</I> no judgment.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job's friends had passed a very severe censure upon him as a wicked man 
 because he was so grievously afflicted; now here he tells them how ill 
 he took it to be so censured. Bildad had twice begun with a <I>How 
 long</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:2,18:2"><I>ch.</I> viii. 2, xviii. 2</A>),

 and therefore Job, being now to answer him particularly, begins with a
 <I>How long</I> too, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 What is not liked is commonly thought long; but Job had more reason to
 think those long who assaulted him than they had to think him long who 
 only vindicated himself.  Better cause may be shown for defending 
 ourselves, if we have right on our side, than for offending our 
 brethren, though we have right on our side. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he describes their unkindness to him and what account he gives 
 of it. 

 1. They <I>vexed his soul,</I> and that is more grievous than the 
 vexation of the bones, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:2,3">Ps. vi. 2, 3</A>.

 They were his friends; they came to comfort him, pretended to counsel
 him for the best; but with a great deal of gravity, and affectation of 
 wisdom and piety, they set themselves to rob him of the only comfort he 
 had now left him in a good God, a good conscience, and a good name; and 
 this vexed him to his heart.

 2. They <I>broke him in pieces with words,</I> and those were surely
 hard and very cruel words that would break a man to pieces: they 
 grieved him, and so broke him; and therefore there will be a reckoning 
 hereafter for all the hard speeches spoken against Christ and his 
 people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:15">Jude 15</A>.

 3. They <I>reproached him,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 gave him a bad character and laid to his charge things that he knew 
 not. To an ingenuous mind reproach is a cutting thing. 

 4. They <I>made themselves strange to him,</I> were shy of him now that 
 he was in his troubles, and seemed as if they did not know him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:12"><I>ch.</I> ii. 12</A>),

 were not free with him as they used to be when he was in his
 prosperity. Those are governed by the spirit of the world, and not by 
 any principles of true honour or love, who make themselves strange to 
 their friends, or God's friends, when they are in trouble. <I>A friend 
 loves at all times.</I> 

 5. They not only estranged themselves from him, but <I>magnified
 themselves against him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 not only looked shy of him, but looked big upon him, and insulted over 
 him, magnifying themselves to depress him. It is a mean thing, it is a 
 base thing, thus to trample upon those that are down. 

 6. <I>They pleaded against him his reproach,</I> that is, they made use
 of his affliction as an argument against him to prove him a wicked man. 
 They should have pleaded for him his integrity, and helped him to take 
 the comfort of that under his affliction, and so have pleaded that 
 against his reproach (as St. Paul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:12">2 Cor. i. 12</A>);

 but, instead of that, they pleaded his reproach against his integrity,
 which was not only unkind, but very unjust; for where shall we find an 
 honest man if reproach may be admitted for a plea against him?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he aggravates their unkindness. 

 1. They had thus abused him often

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>These ten times you have reproached me,</I> that is, very often, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:7,Nu+14:22">Gen. xxxi. 7; Num. xiv. 22</A>.

 Five times they had spoken, and every speech was a double reproach. He
 spoke as if he had kept a particular account of their reproaches, and 
 could tell just how many they were. It is but a peevish and unfriendly 
 thing to do so, and looks like a design of retaliation and revenge. We 
 better befriend our own peace by forgetting injuries and unkindnesses 
 than by remembering them and scoring them up.

 2. They continued still to abuse him, and seemed resolved to persist in
 it: "How long will you do it?" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:2,5"><I>v.</I> 2, 5</A>.

 "I see you will magnify yourselves against me, notwithstanding all I 
 have said in my own justification." Those that speak too much seldom 
 think they have said enough; and, when the mouth is opened in passion, 
 the ear is shut to reason.

 3. They were not ashamed of what they did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They had reason to be ashamed of their hard-heartedness, so ill
 becoming men, of their uncharitableness, so ill becoming good men, and 
 of their deceitfulness, so ill becoming friends: but were they ashamed? 
 No, though they were told of it again and again, yet they could not 
 blush.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How he answers their harsh censures, by showing them that what 
 they condemned was capable of excuse, which they ought to have 
 considered. 

 1. The errors of his judgment were excusable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Be it indeed that I have erred,</I> that I am in the wrong through 
 ignorance or mistake," which may well be supposed concerning men, 
 concerning good men. <I>Humanum est errare</I>--<I>Error cleaves to 
 humanity;</I> and we must be willing to suppose it concerning 
 ourselves. It is folly to think ourselves infallible. "But be it so," 
 said Job, "<I>my error remaineth with myself,</I>" that is, "I speak 
 according to the best of my judgment, with all sincerity, and not from 
 a spirit of contradiction." Or, "If I be in an error, I keep it to 
 myself, and do not impose it upon others as you do. I only prove myself 
 and my own work by it. I meddle not with other people, either to teach 
 them or to judge them." Men's errors are the more excusable if they 
 keep them to themselves, and do not disturb others with them.  <I>Hast 
 thou faith? Have it to thyself.</I> Some give this sense of these 
 words: "If I be in an error, it is I that must smart for it; and 
 therefore you need not concern yourselves: nay, it is I that do smart, 
 and smart severely, for it; and therefore you need not add to my misery 
 by your reproaches." 

 2. The breakings out of his passion, though not justifiable, yet were
 excusable, considering the vastness of his grief and the extremity of 
 his misery. "If you will go on to cavil at every complaining word I 
 speak, will make the worst of it and improve it against me, yet take 
 the cause of the complaint along with you, and weigh that, before you 
 pass a judgment upon the complaint, and turn it to my reproach: <I>Know 
 then that God has overthrown me,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:6"><I>v.</I>  6</A>.

 Three things he would have them consider:--

 (1.) That his trouble was very great. He was overthrown, and could not 
 help himself, enclosed as in a net, and could not get out. 

 (2.) That God was the author of it, and that, in it, he fought against 
 him: "It was his hand that overthrew me; it is in his net that I am 
 enclosed; and therefore you need not appear against me thus. I have 
 enough to do to grapple with God's displeasure; let me not have yours 
 also. Let God's controversy with me be ended before you begin yours." 
 It is barbarous to <I>persecute him whom God hath smitten and to talk 
 to the grief of one whom he hath wounded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:26">Ps. lxix. 26</A>.

 (3.) That he could not obtain any hope of the redress of his 
 grievances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He complained of his pain, but got no ease--begged to know the cause of 
 his affliction, but could not discover it--appealed to God's tribunal 
 for the clearing of his innocency, but could not obtain a hearing, much 
 less a judgment, upon his appeal: <I>I cry out of wrong, but I am not 
 heard.</I> God, for a time, may seem to turn away his ear from his 
 people, to be angry at their prayers and overlook their appeals to him, 
 and they must be excused if, in that case, they complain bitterly. Woe 
 unto us if God be against us!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set
 darkness in my paths.
 &nbsp; 9  He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown <I>from</I>
 my head.
 &nbsp; 10  He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine
 hope hath he removed like a tree.

 me unto him as <I>one of</I> his enemies.

 &nbsp; 22  Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my
 flesh?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Bildad had very disingenuously perverted Job's complaints by making 
 them the description of the miserable condition of a wicked man; and 
 yet he repeats them here, to move their pity, and to work upon their 
 good nature, if they had any left in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He complains of the tokens of God's displeasure which he was under, 
 and which infused the wormwood and gall into the affliction and misery. 
 How doleful are the accents of his complaints! "<I>He hath kindled his 
 wrath against me,</I> which flames and terrifies me, which burns and 
 pains me," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 What is the fire of hell but the wrath of God? Seared consciences will 
 feel it hereafter, but do not fear it now. Enlightened consciences fear 
 it now, but shall not feel it hereafter. Job's present apprehension was 
 that <I>God counted him as one of his enemies;</I> and yet, at the same 
 time, God loved him, and gloried in him, as his faithful friend. It is 
 a gross mistake, but a very common one, to think that whom God afflicts 
 he treats as his enemies; whereas, on the contrary, <I>as many as he 
 loves he rebukes and chastens;</I> it is the discipline of his sons. 
 Which way soever Job looked he thought he saw the tokens of God's 
 displeasure against him.

 1. Did he look back upon his former prosperity? He saw God's hand 
 putting an end to that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 "<I>He has stripped me of my glory,</I> my wealth, honour, power, and 
 all the opportunity I had of doing good. My children were my glory, but 
 I have lost them; and whatever was a crown to my head he has taken it 
 from me, and has laid all my honour in the dust." See the vanity of 
 worldly glory: it is what we may be soon stripped of; and, whatever 
 strips us, we must see and own God's hand in it and comply with his 
 design. 

 2. Did he look down upon his present troubles? He saw God giving them 
 their commission, and their orders to attack him. They are <I>his 
 troops,</I> that act by his direction, which <I>encamp against me,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 It did not so much trouble him that his miseries came upon him in 
 troops as that they were <I>God's</I> troops, in whom it seemed as if 
 God fought against him and intended his destruction. God's troops 
 <I>encamped around his tabernacle,</I> as soldiers lay siege to a 
 strong city, cutting off all provisions from being brought into it and 
 battering it continually; thus was Job's tabernacle besieged. Time was 
 when God's hosts encamped round him for safety: <I>Hast thou not made a 
 hedge about him?</I> Now, on the contrary, they surrounded him, to his 
 terror, and <I>destroyed him on every side,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 3. Did he look forward for deliverance? He saw the hand of God cutting
 off all hopes of that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>He hath fenced up my way, that I cannot pass.</I> I have now no way 
 left to help myself, either to extricate myself out of my troubles or 
 to ease myself under them. Would I make any motion, take any steps 
 towards deliverance? I find <I>my way hedged up;</I> I cannot do what I 
 would; nay, if I would please myself with the prospect of a deliverance 
 hereafter, I cannot do it; it is not only out of my reach, but out of 
 my sight: God <I>hath set darkness in my paths,</I> and there is none 
 to tell me how long," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:9">Ps. lxxiv. 9</A>.

 He concludes
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 "I am gone, quite lost and undone for this world; <I>my hope hath he 
 removed like a tree</I> cut down, or plucked up by the roots, which 
 will never grow again." Hope in this life is a perishing thing, but the 
 hope of good men, when it is cut off from this world, is but removed 
 like a tree, transplanted from this nursery to the garden of the Lord. 
 We shall have no reason to complain if God thus remove our hopes from 
 the sand to the rock, from things temporal to things eternal.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He complains of the unkindness of his relations and of all his old 
 acquaintance. In this also he owns the hand of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>He has put my brethren far from me,</I> that is, "He has laid those 
 afflictions upon me which frighten them from me, and make them stand 
 aloof from my sores." As it was their sin God was not the author of it; 
 it is Satan that alienates men's minds from their brethren in 
 affliction. But, as it was Job's trouble, God ordered it for the 
 completing of his trial. As we must eye the hand of God in all the 
 injuries we receive from our enemies ("the Lord has bidden Shimei curse 
 David"), so also in all the slights and unkindnesses we receive from
 our friends, which will help us to bear them the more patiently. Every 
 creature is that to us (kind or unkind, comfortable or uncomfortable) 
 which God makes it to be. Yet this does not excuse Job's relations and 
 friends from the guilt of horrid ingratitude and injustice to him, 
 which he had reason to complain of; few could have borne it so well as 
 he did. He takes notice of the unkindness, 

 1. Of his kindred and acquaintance, his neighbours, and such as he had 
 formerly been familiar with, who were bound by all the laws of 
 friendship and civility to concern themselves for him, to visit him, to 
 enquire after him, and to be ready to do him all the good offices that 
 lay in their power; yet these were <I>estranged from him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 They took no more care about him than if he had been a stranger whom 
 they never knew. His kinsfolk, who claimed relation to him when he was 
 in prosperity, now failed him; they came short of their former 
 professions of friendship to him and his present expectations of 
 kindness from them. Even his familiar friends, whom he was mindful of, 
 had now forgotten him, had forgotten both his former friendliness to 
 them and his present miseries: they had heard of his troubles, and 
 designed him a visit; but truly they forgot it, so little affected were 
 they with it. Nay, his inward friends, the men of his secret, whom he 
 was most intimate with and laid in his bosom, not only forgot him, but 
 abhorred him, kept as far off from him as they could, because he was 
 poor and could not entertain them as he used to do, and because he was 
 sore and a loathsome spectacle. Those whom he loved, and who therefore 
 were worse than publicans if they did not love him now that he was in 
 distress, not only turned from him, but were turned against him, and 
 did all they could to make him odious, so to justify themselves in 
 being so strange to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 So uncertain is the friendship of men; but, if God be our friend, he
 will not fail us in a time of need. But let none that pretend either to 
 humanity or Christianity ever use their friends as Job's friends used 
 him: adversity is the proof of friendship.

 2. Of his domestics and family relations. Sometimes indeed we find 
 that, beyond our expectation, there is a friend that sticks closer than 
 a brother; but the master of a family ordinarily expects to be attended 
 on and taken care of by those of his family, even when, through 
 weakness of body or mind, he has become despicable to others.  But poor 
 Job was misused by his own family, and some of his worst foes were 
 those of his own house. He mentions not his children; they were all 
 dead, and we may suppose that the unkindness of his surviving relations 
 made him lament the death of his children so much the more: "If they 
 had been alive," would he think, "I should have had comfort in them." 
 As for those that were now about him,

 (1.) His own servants slighted him. His maids did not attend him in his 
 illness, but <I>counted him for a stranger and an alien,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 His other servants never heeded him; if he called to them they would 
 not come at his call, but pretended that they did not hear him. If he 
 asked them a question, they would not vouchsafe to <I>give him an 
 answer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Job had been a good master to them, and did not <I>despise their cause 
 when they pleaded with him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:13"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 13</A>),

 and yet they were rude to him now, and despised his cause when he
 pleaded with them. We must not think it strange if we receive evil at 
 the hand of those from whom we have deserved well. Though he was now 
 sickly, yet he was not cross with his servants, and imperious, as is 
 too common, but he entreated his servants with his mouth, when he had 
 authority to command; and yet they would not be civil to him, neither 
 kind nor just. Note, Those that are sick and in sorrow are apt to take 
 things ill, and be jealous of a slight, and to lay to heart the least 
 unkindness done to them: when Job was in affliction even his servants' 
 neglect of him troubled him. 

 (2.) But, one would think, when all forsook him, the wife of his bosom 
 should have been tender of him: no, because he would not curse God and 
 die, as she persuaded him, his breath was strange to her too; she did 
 not care for coming near him, nor took any notice of what he said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Though he spoke to her, not with the authority, but with the tenderness 
 of a husband, did not command, but entreated her by that conjugal love 
 which their children were the pledges of, yet she regarded him not. 
 Some read it, "Though I lamented, or bemoaned myself, for the 
 children," that is, "for the death of the children of my own body," an 
 affliction in which she was equally concerned with him. Now, it 
 appeared, the devil spared her to him, not only to be his tempter, but 
 to be his tormentor. By what she said to him at first, <I>Curse God and 
 die,</I> it appeared that she had little religion in her; and what can 
 one expect that is kind and good from those that have not the fear of 
 God before their eyes and are not governed by conscience?

 (3.) Even the little children who were born in his house, the children 
 of his own servants, who were his servants by birth, despised him, and 
 spoke against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 though he arose in civility to speak friendly to them, or with 
 authority to check them, they let him know that they neither feared him 
 nor loved him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He complains of the decay of his body; all the beauty and strength 
 of that were gone. When those about him slighted him, if he had been in 
 health, and at ease, he might have enjoyed himself. But he could take 
 as little pleasure in himself as others took in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>My bone cleaves now to my skin,</I> as formerly it did to my flesh; 
 it was this that filled <I>him with wrinkles</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:8"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 8</A>);

 he was a perfect skeleton, nothing but skin and bones. Nay, his skin
 too was almost gone, little remained unbroken but the <I>skin of his 
 teeth,</I> his gums and perhaps his lips; all the rest was fetched off 
 by his sore boils. See what little reason we have to indulge the body, 
 which, after all our care, may be thus consumed by the diseases which 
 it has in itself the seeds of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Upon all these accounts he recommends himself to the compassion of 
 his friends, and justly blames their harshness with him. From this 
 representation of his deplorable case, it was easy to infer, 

 1. That they ought to pity him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 This he begs in the most moving melting language that could be, enough 
 (one would think) to break a heart of stone: "<I>Have pity upon me, 
 have pity upon me, O you my friends!</I> if you will do nothing else 
 for me, be sorry for me, and show some concern for me; <I>have pity 
 upon me, for the hand of God hath touched me.</I> My case is sad 
 indeed, for I have fallen into the hands of the living God, my spirit 
 is touched with the sense of his wrath, a calamity of all other the 
 most piteous." Note, It becomes friends to pity one another when they 
 are in trouble, and not to shut up the bowels of compassion.

 2. That, however, they ought not to persecute him; if they would not 
 ease his affliction by their pity, yet they must not be so barbarous as 
 to add to it by their censures and reproaches

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 "<I>Why do you persecute me as God?</I> Surely his rebukes are enough 
 for one man to bear; you need not add your wormwood and gall to the cup 
 of affliction he puts into my hand, it is bitter enough without that: 
 God has a sovereign power over me, and may do what he pleases with me; 
 but do you think that you may do so too?" No, we must aim to be like 
 the Most Holy and the Most Merciful, but not like the Most High and 
 Most Mighty. God gives not account of any of his matters, but we must 
 give account of ours. If they did delight in his calamity, let them be 
 satisfied with his flesh, which was wasted and gone, but let them not, 
 as if that were too little, wound his spirit, and ruin his good name. 
 Great tenderness is due to those that are in affliction, especially to 
 those that are troubled in mind.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In all the conferences between Job and his friends we do not find any 
 more weighty and considerable lines than these; would one have expected 
 it? Here is much both of Christ and heaven in these verses: and he that
 said such things as these <I>declared plainly that he sought the better 
 country, that is, the heavenly;</I> as the patriarchs of that age did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:14">Heb. xi. 14</A>.

 We have here Job's creed, or confession of faith. His belief in God the
 Father Almighty, the Maker of heaven and earth, and the principles of 
 natural religion, he had often professed: but here we find him no 
 stranger to revealed religion; though the revelation of the promised 
 Seed, and the promised inheritance, was then discerned only like the 
 dawning of the day, yet Job was taught of God to believe in a living 
 Redeemer, and to <I>look for the resurrection of the dead and the life 
 of the world to come,</I> for of these, doubtless, he must be 
 understood to speak. These were the things he comforted himself with 
 the expectation of, and not a deliverance from his trouble or a revival 
 of his happiness in this world, as some would understand him; for 
 besides that the expressions he here uses, of the Redeemer's 
 <I>standing at the latter day upon the earth,</I> of his seeing God, 
 and <I>seeing him for himself,</I> are wretchedly forced if they be 
 understood of any temporal deliverance, it is very plain that he had no 
 expectation at all of his return to a prosperous condition in this 
 world. He had just now said that <I>his way was fenced up,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:8"><I>v.</I>  8</A>)
 
 and his <I>hope removed like a tree,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Nay, and after this he expressed his despair of any comfort in this 
 life,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:8,9,30:23"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 8, 9; xxx. 23</A>.

 So that we must necessarily understand him of the redemption of his
 soul from the power of the grave, and his reception to glory, which is 
 spoken of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:15">Ps. xlix. 15</A>.

 We have reason to think that Job was just now under an extraordinary
 impulse of the blessed Spirit, which raised him above himself, gave him 
 light, and gave him utterance, even to his own surprise. And some 
 observe that, after this, we do not find Job's discourses such 
 passionate, peevish, unbecoming, complaints of God and his providence 
 as we have before met with: this hope quieted his spirit, stilled the 
 storm and, having here cast anchor within the veil, his mind was kept 
 steady from this time forward. Let us observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To what intent Job makes this confession of his faith here. Never 
 did any thing come in more pertinently, or to better purpose. 

 1. Job was now accused, and this was his appeal. His friends reproached 
 him as a hypocrite and contemned him as a wicked man; but he appeals to 
 his creed, to his faith, to his hope, and to his own conscience, which 
 not only acquitted him from reigning sin, but comforted him with the 
 expectation of a blessed resurrection. <I>These are not the words of 
 him that has a devil.</I> He appeals to the coming of the Redeemer, 
 from this wrangle at the bar to the judgment of the bench, even to him 
 to whom all judgment is committed, who he knew would right him. The 
 consideration of God's day coming will make it a <I>very small thing 
 with us to be judged of man's judgment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:3,4">1 Cor. iv. 3, 4</A>.

 How easily may we bear the unjust calumnies and reproaches of men while
 we expect the glorious appearance of our Redeemer, and his redeemed, at 
 the last day, and that there will then be a resurrection of names, as 
 well as bodies! 

 2. Job was now afflicted, and this was his cordial; when he was pressed 
 above measure this kept him from fainting--he believed that he should 
 <I>see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living;</I> not in 
 this world, for that is the land of the dying.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. With what a solemn preface he introduces it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 He breaks off his complaints abruptly, to triumph his comforts, which 
 he does, not only for his own satisfaction, but for the edification of 
 others.  Those now about him, he feared, would little regard what he 
 said, and so it proved, He therefore wished it might be recorded for 
 the generations to come. <I>O that my words were now written,</I> the 
 words I am now about to say! As if he had said, "I own I have spoken 
 many unadvised words, which I could wish might be forgotten, for they 
 will neither do me credit nor do others good. But I am now going to 
 speak deliberately, and that which I desire may be published to all the 
 world and preserved for the generations to come, <I>in perpetuam rei 
 memoriam</I>--<I>for an abiding memorial,</I> and therefore that it may 
 be written plainly and <I>printed,</I> or drawn out in large and 
 legible characters, so that he that runs may read it; and that it may 
 not be left in loose papers, but put into <I>a book;</I> or, if that 
 should perish, that it may be <I>engraven</I> like an inscription upon 
 a monument, <I>with an iron pen in lead, or in the stone;</I> let the 
 engraver use all his art to make it a durable appeal to posterity." 
 That which Job here somewhat passionately wished for God graciously 
 granted him. His words are written; they are printed in God's book; so 
 that, wherever that book is read, there shall this be told for a 
 memorial concerning Job. He believed, therefore he spoke.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What his confession itself is; what are the words which he would 
 have to be written; we here have them written, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:25-27"><I>v.</I> 25-27</A>.

 Let us observe them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He believes the glory of the Redeemer and his own interest in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>I know that my Redeemer liveth,</I> that he is in being and is my 
 life, <I>and that he shall stand at last,</I> or stand the last, or at 
 the latter day, <I>upon</I> (or above) <I>the earth.</I> He shall be 
 raised up, or, He shall be, at the latter day, (that is, in the fulness 
 of time: the gospel day is called <I>the last time</I> because that is 
 the last dispensation) upon the earth: so it points at his incarnation; 
 or, He shall be lifted up from the earth (so it points at his 
 crucifixion), or raised up out of the earth (so it is applicable to his 
 resurrection), or, as we commonly understand it, At the end of time he 
 shall appear over the earth, for <I>he shall come in the clouds, and 
 every eye shall see him,</I> so close shall he come to this earth. He 
 shall stand <I>upon the dust</I> (so the word is), upon all his 
 enemies, which shall be put as dust under his feet; and he shall tread
 upon them and triumph over them.  Observe here,

 (1.) That there is a Redeemer provided for fallen man, and Jesus Christ 
 is that Redeemer.  The word is <I>Go&euml;l</I> which is used for the 
 next of kin, to whom, by the law of Moses, the right of redeeming a 
 mortgaged estate did belong, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+25:25">Lev. xxv. 25</A>.

 Our heavenly inheritance was mortgaged by sin; we are ourselves utterly
 unable to redeem it; Christ is near of kin to us, the next kinsman that 
 is able to redeem; he has paid our debt, satisfied God's justice for 
 sin, and so has taken off the mortgage and made a new settlement of the 
 inheritance. Our persons also want a Redeemer; we are sold for sin, and 
 sold under sin; our Lord Jesus has wrought out a redemption for us, and 
 proclaims redemption for us, and proclaims redemption to us, and so he 
 is truly the Redeemer.

 (2.) He is a living Redeemer. As we are made by a living God, so we are 
 saved by a living Redeemer, who is both almighty and eternal, and is 
 therefore able to save to the uttermost. <I>Of him it is witnessed that 
 he liveth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:8,Re+1:18">Heb. vii. 8; Rev. i. 18</A>.

 We are dying, but he liveth, and hath assured us that <I>because he
 lives we shall live also,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:19">John xiv. 19</A>.

 (3.) There are those that through grace have an interest in this
 Redeemer, and can, upon good grounds, call him theirs. When Job had 
 lost all his wealth and all his friends, yet he was not separated from 
 Christ, nor cut off from his relation to him: "Still he is my 
 Redeemer." That next kinsman adhered to him when all his other kindred 
 forsook him, and he had the comfort of it. 

 (4.) Our interest in the Redeemer is a thing that may be known; and, 
 where it is known, it may be triumphed in, as sufficient to balance all 
 our griefs: <I>I know</I> (observe with what an air of assurance he 
 speaks it, as one confident of this very thing), <I>I know that my 
 Redeemer lives.</I> His friends have often charged him with ignorance 
 or vain knowledge; but he knows enough, and knows to good purpose, who 
 knows Christ to be his Redeemer.  

 (5.) There will be a latter day, a last day, a day when <I>time shall
 be no more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:6">Rev. x. 6</A>.

 That is a day we are concerned to think of every day.

 (6.) Our Redeemer will at that day stand upon the earth, or over the 
 earth, to summon the dead out of their graves, and determine them to an 
 unchangeable state; for to him all judgment is committed. He shall 
 stand, at the last, on the dust to which this earth will be reduced by 
 the conflagration.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He believes the happiness of the redeemed, and his own title to that 
 happiness, that, at Christ's second coming, believers shall be raised 
 up in glory and so made perfectly blessed in the vision and fruition of 
 God; and this he believes with application to himself. 

 (1.) He counts upon the corrupting of his body in the grave, and speaks 
 of it with a holy carelessness and unconcernedness: <I>Though, after my 
 skin</I> (which is already wasted and gone, none of it remaining but 
 <I>the skin of my teeth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>)

 <I>they destroy</I> (those that are appointed to destroy it, the grave 
 and the worms in it of which he had spoken,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+17:14"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 14</A>)

 <I>this body.</I> The word <I>body</I> is added: "Though they destroy
 this, this skeleton, this shadow

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+17:7"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 7</A>),

 this that I lay my hand upon," or (pointing perhaps to his weak and
 withered limbs) "this that you see, call it what you will; I expect 
 that shortly it will be a feast for the worms." Christ's body saw not 
 corruption, but ours must. And Job mentions this, that the glory of the 
 resurrection he believed and hoped for might shine the more brightly. 
 Note, It is good for us often to think, not only of the approaching 
 death of our bodies, but of their destruction and dissolution in the 
 grave; yet let not that discourage our hope of their resurrection, for 
 the same power that made man's body at first, out of common dust, can 
 raise it out of its own dust. This body which we now take such care 
 about, and make such provision for, will in a little time be destroyed.  
 Even <I>my reins</I> (says Job) <I>shall be consumed within me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);
 
 the innermost part of the body, which perhaps putrefies first.
 
 (2.) He comforts himself with the hopes of happiness on the other side 
 death and the grave: <I>After I shall awake</I> (so the margin reads 
 it), <I>though this body be destroyed, yet out of my flesh shall I see 
 God.</I> 

 [1.] Soul and body shall come together again. That body which must be 
 destroyed in the grave shall be raised again, a glorious body: <I>Yet 
 in my flesh I shall see God.</I> The separate soul has eyes wherewith 
 to see God, eyes of the mind; but Job speaks of seeing him with eyes of 
 flesh, <I>in my flesh, with my eyes;</I> the same body that died shall 
 rise again, a true body, but a glorified body, fit for the employments 
 and entertainments of that world, and therefore a <I>spiritual 
 body,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:44">1 Cor. xv. 44</A>.

 Let us <I>therefore</I> glorify God with our bodies because there is
 such a glory designed for them. 

 [2.] Job and God shall come together again: <I>In my flesh shall I see 
 God,</I> that is, the glorified Redeemer, who is God. <I>I shall see 
 God in my flesh</I> (so some read it), the Son of God clothed with a 
 body which will be visible even to eyes of flesh. Though the body, in 
 the grave, seem despicable and miserable, yet it shall be dignified and 
 made happy in the vision of God. Job now complained that he could not 
 get a sight of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:8,9"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 8, 9</A>),

 but hoped to see him shortly, never more to lose the sight of him, and
 that sight of him will be the more welcome after the present darkness 
 and distance. Note, It is the blessedness of the blessed that they 
 shall see God, shall see him as he is, see him face to face, and no 
 longer through a glass darkly. See with what pleasure holy Job enlarges 
 upon this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 "<I>Whom I shall see for myself,</I>" that is, "see and enjoy, see to 
 my own unspeakable comfort and satisfaction. I shall see him as mine, 
 as mine with an appropriating sight," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:3">Rev. xxi. 3</A>.

 <I>God himself shall be with them and be their God;</I> they shall be
 <I>like him, for they shall see him as he is,</I> that is seeing for 
 themselves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:2">1 John iii. 2</A>.

 <I>My eyes shall behold him, and not another.  First,</I> "He, and not
 another for him, shall be seen, not a type or figure of him, but he 
 himself." Glorified saints are perfectly sure that they are not imposed 
 upon; it is no <I>deceptio visus--illusion of the senses. Secondly,</I> 
 "I, and not another for me, shall see him.  Though my flesh and body be 
 consumed, yet I shall not need a proxy; I shall see him with my own 
 eyes." This was what Job hoped for, and what he earnestly desired, 
 which, some think, is the meaning of the last clause: <I>My reins are 
 spent in my bosom,</I> that is, "all my desires are summed up and 
 concluded in this; this will crown and complete them all; let me have 
 this, and I shall have nothing more to desire; it is enough; it is 
 all." With this the prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The application of this to his friends. His creed spoke comfort to 
 himself, but warning and terror to those that set themselves against 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It was a word of caution to them not to proceed and persist in their 
 unkind usage of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 He had reproved them for what they had said, and now tells them what 
 they should say for the reducing of themselves and one another to a 
 better temper.  "<I>Why persecute we him</I> thus? Why do we grieve him 
 and vex him, by censuring and condemning him, <I>seeing the root of the 
 matter,</I> or the root of the word, <I>is found in him?</I>" Let this 
 direct us,

 (1.) In our care concerning ourselves. We are all concerned to see to 
 it that the root of the matter be found in us. A living, quickening, 
 commanding, principle of grace in the heart, is the root of the matter, 
 as necessary to our religion as the root to the tree, to which it owes 
 both its fixedness and its fruitfulness. Love to God and our brethren, 
 faith in Christ, hatred of sin--these are the root of the matter; other 
 things are but leaves in comparison with these. Serious godliness is 
 the one thing needful. 

 (2.) In our conduct towards our brethren. We are to believe that many 
 have the root of the matter in them who are not in every thing of our 
 mind--who have their follies, and weaknesses, and mistakes--and to 
 conclude that it is at our peril if we persecute any such. Woe be to 
 him that offends one of those little ones! God will resent and revenge 
 it. Job and his friends differed in some notions concerning the methods 
 of Providence, but they agreed in the root of the matter, the belief of 
 another world, and therefore should not persecute one another for these 
 differences.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It was a word of terror to them. Christ's second coming will be very 
 dreadful to those that are found <I>smiting their fellow servants</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:49">Matt. xxiv. 49</A>),

 and therefore 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 "<I>Be you afraid of the sword,</I> the flaming sword of God's justice, 
 which turns every way; fear, lest you make yourselves obnoxious to it." 
 Good men need to be frightened from sin by the terrors of the Almighty, 
 particularly from the sin of rashly judging their brethren,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:1,Jam+3:1">Matt. vii. 1; Jam. iii. 1</A>.

 Those that are peevish and passionate with their brethren, censorious
 of them and malicious towards them, should know, not only that their 
 wrath, whatever it pretends, works not the righteousness of God, but 
 that, 

 (1.) They may expect to smart for it in this world: <I>It brings the 
 punishments of the sword.</I> Wrath leads to such crimes as expose men 
 to the sword of the magistrate. God himself often takes vengeance for 
 it, and those that showed no mercy shall find no mercy. 

 (2.) If they repent not, that will be an earnest of worse. By these you 
 may know there is a judgment, not only a present government, but a 
 future judgment, in which hard speeches must be accounted for.</P>
