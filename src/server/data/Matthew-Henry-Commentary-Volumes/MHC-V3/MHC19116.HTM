 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a thanksgiving psalm; it is not certain whether David penned it 
 upon any particular occasion or upon a general review of the many 
 gracious deliverances God had wrought for him, out of six troubles and 
 seven, which deliverances draw from him many very lively expressions of 
 devotion, love, and gratitude; and with similar pious affections our 
 souls should be lifted up to God in singing it. Observe, 

 I. The great distress and danger that the psalmist was in, which almost
 drove him to despair, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:3,10,11">ver. 3, 10, 11</A>.

 II. The application he made to God in that distress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:4">ver. 4</A>.

 III. The experience he had of God's goodness to him, in answer to
 prayer; God heard him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 pitied him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>),

 delivered him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:8">ver. 8</A>.

 IV His care respecting the acknowledgments he should make of the 
 goodness of God to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:12">ver. 12</A>.
 
 1. He will love God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:1">ver. 1</A>.

 2. He will continue to call upon him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:2,13,17">ver. 2, 13, 17</A>.

 3. He will rest in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:7">ver. 7</A>.
 
 4. He will walk before him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:9">ver. 9</A>.

 5. He will pay his vows of thanksgiving, in which he will own the
 tender regard God had to him, and this publicly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:13-15,17-19">ver. 13-15, 17-19</A>.

 Lastly, He will continue God's faithful servant to his life's end, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:16">ver. 16</A>.

 These are such breathings of a holy soul as bespeak it very happy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this part of the psalm we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A general account of David's experience, and his pious resolutions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>),

 which are as the contents of the whole psalm, and give an idea of it. 

 1. He had experienced God's goodness to him in answer to prayer: <I>He 
 has heard my voice and my supplications.</I> David, in straits, had 
 humbly and earnestly begged mercy of God, and God had heard him, that 
 is, had graciously accepted his prayer, taken cognizance of his case, 
 and granted him an answer of peace. <I>He has inclined his ear to 
 me.</I> This intimates his readiness and willingness to hear prayer; he 
 lays his ear, as it were, to the mouth of prayer, to hear it, though it 
 be but whispered <I>in groanings that cannot be uttered.</I> He 
 <I>hearkens and hears,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:6">Jer. viii. 6</A>.

 Yet it implies, also, that it is wonderful condescension in God to hear 
 prayer; it is bowing his ear. Lord, what is man, that God should thus 
 stoop to him!--

 2. He resolved, in consideration thereof, to devote himself entirely to
 God and to his honour.

 (1.) He will love God the better. He begins the psalm somewhat abruptly 
 with a profession of that which his heart was full of: <I>I love the 
 Lord</I> (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:1">Ps. xviii. 1</A>);

 and fitly does he begin with this, in compliance with the first and 
 great commandment and with God's end in all the gifts of his bounty to 
 us. "I love him only, and nothing besides him, but what I love for 
 him." God's love of compassion towards us justly requires our love of 
 complacency in him. 

 (2.) He will love prayer the better: <I>Therefore I will call upon 
 him.</I> The experiences we have had of God's goodness to us, in answer 
 to prayer, are great encouragements to us to continue praying; we have 
 sped well, notwithstanding our unworthiness and our infirmities in 
 prayer, and therefore why may we not? God answers prayer, to make us 
 love it, and expects this from us, in return for his favour. Why should 
 we glean in any other field when we have been so well treated in this?
 Nay, <I>I will call upon him as long as I live</I> (Heb., <I>In my 
 days</I>), every day, to the last day. Note, As long as we continue 
 living we must continue praying. This breath we must breathe till we 
 breathe our last, because then we shall take our leave of it, and till 
 then we have continual occasion for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A more particular narrative of God's gracious dealings with him and 
 the good impressions thereby made upon him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God, in his dealings with him, showed himself a good God, and 
 therefore he bears this testimony to him, and leaves it upon record 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>Gracious is the Lord, and righteous.</I> He is righteous, and did 
 me no wrong in afflicting me; he is gracious, and was very kind in 
 supporting and delivering me." Let us all speak of God as we have 
 found; and have we ever found him otherwise than just and good? No; 
 <I>our God is merciful,</I> merciful to us, and <I>it is of his mercies 
 that we are not consumed.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Let us review David's experiences. 

 [1.] He was in great distress and trouble

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>The sorrows of death compassed me,</I> that is, such sorrows as were 
 likely to be his death, such as were thought to be the very pangs of 
 death. Perhaps the extremity of bodily pain, or trouble of mind, is 
 called here <I>the pains of hell,</I> terror of conscience arising from 
 sense of guilt. Note, The sorrows of death are great sorrows, and the 
 pains of hell great pains. Let us <I>therefore</I> give diligence to 
 prepare for the former, that we may escape the latter. These 
 <I>compassed</I> him on every side; they arrested him, <I>got hold upon 
 him,</I> so that he could not escape. <I>Without were fightings,
 within were fears. "I found trouble and sorrow;</I> not only they found 
 me, but I found them." Those that are melancholy have a great deal of 
 sorrow of their own finding, a great deal of trouble which they create 
 to themselves, by indulging fancy and passion; this has sometimes been 
 the infirmity of good men. When God's providence makes our condition 
 bad let us not by our own imprudence make it worse. 

 [2.] In his trouble he had recourse to God by faithful and fervent 
 prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He tells us that he prayed: <I>Then called I upon the name of the 
 Lord;</I> then, when he was brought to the last extremity, then he made 
 use of this, not as the last remedy, but as the old and only remedy, 
 which he had found a salve for every sore. He tells us what his prayer 
 was; it was short, but to the purpose: "<I>O Lord! I beseech thee, 
 deliver my soul;</I> save me from death, and save me from sin, for that 
 is it that is killing to the soul." Both the humility and the fervency 
 of his prayer are intimated in these words, <I>O Lord! I beseech 
 thee.</I> When we come to the throne of grace we must come as beggars 
 for an alms, for necessary food. The following words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 
 <I>Gracious is the Lord,</I> may be taken as part of his prayer, as a
 plea to enforce his request and encourage his faith and hope: "Lord 
 <I>deliver my soul,</I> for thou art <I>gracious</I> and 
 <I>merciful,</I> and that only I depend upon for relief."

 [3.] God, in answer to his prayer, came in with seasonable and 
 effectual relief. He found by experience that God is gracious and 
 merciful, and in his compassion <I>preserves the simple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Because they are simple (that is, sincere, and upright, and without 
 guile) therefore God preserves them, as he preserved Paul, who had his 
 conversation in the world <I>not with fleshly wisdom, but in simplicity 
 and godly sincerity.</I> Though they are simple (that is, weak, and 
 helpless, and unable to shift for themselves, men of no depth, no 
 design) yet God preserves them, because they commit themselves to him 
 and have no confidence in their own sufficiency. Those who by faith put 
 themselves under God's protection shall be safe.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Let David speak his own experience. 

 [1.] God supported him under his troubles: "<I>I was brought low,</I> 
 was plunged into the depth of misery, and then <I>he helped me,</I> 
 helped me both to bear the worst and to hope the best, helped me to 
 pray, else desire had failed, helped me to wait, else faith had failed. 
 I was one of the simple ones whom God preserved, the poor man who 
 <I>cried and the Lord heard him,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:6">Ps. xxxiv. 6</A>.

 Note, God's people are never brought so low but that everlasting arms 
 are under them, and those cannot sink who are thus sustained. Nay, it 
 is in the time of need, at the dead lift, that God chooses to help, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:36">Deut. xxxii. 36</A>.

 [2.] God saved him out of his troubles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Thou hast delivered,</I> which means either the preventing of the 
 distress he was ready to fall into or the recovering of him from the 
 distress he was already in. God graciously delivered, <I>First,</I> His 
 <I>soul from death.</I> Note, It is God's great mercy to us that we are 
 alive; and the mercy is the more sensible if we have been at death's 
 door and yet have been spared and raised up, just turned to destruction 
 and yet ordered to return. That a life so often forfeited, and so often 
 exposed, should yet be lengthened out, is a miracle of mercy. The 
 deliverance of the soul from spiritual and eternal death is especially 
 to be acknowledged by all those who are now sanctified and shall be 
 shortly glorified. <I>Secondly,</I> His <I>eyes from tears,</I> that 
 is, his heart from inordinate grief. It is a great mercy to be kept 
 either from the occasions of sorrow, the evil that causes grief, or, at 
 least, from being swallowed up with over-much sorrow. When God comforts 
 those that are cast down, looses the mourners' sackcloth and girds them 
 with gladness, then he delivers <I>their eyes from tears,</I> which yet 
 will not be perfectly done till we come to that world where God shall 
 <I>wipe away all tears from our eyes. Thirdly,</I> His <I>feet from 
 falling,</I> from falling into sin and so into misery. It is a great 
 mercy, when our feet are almost gone, to have God <I>hold us by the 
 right hand</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:2,23">Ps. lxxii. 2, 23</A>),

 so that though we enter into temptation we are not overcome and 
 overthrown by the temptation. Or, "Thou <I>hast delivered my feet from 
 falling</I> into the grave, when I had one foot there already."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. David, in his returns of gratitude to God, showed himself a good 
 man. God had done all this for him, and therefore,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He will live a life of delight in God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Return unto thy rest, O my soul!</I> 

 [1.] "Repose thyself and be easy, and do not agitate thyself with 
 distrustful disquieting fears as thou hast sometimes done. Quiet 
 thyself, and then enjoy thyself. God has dealt kindly with thee, and 
 therefore thou needest not fear that ever he will deal hardly with 
 thee."

 [2.] "Repose thyself in God. Return to him as thy rest, and seek not
 for that rest in the creature which is to be had in him only." God is 
 the soul's rest; in him only it can <I>dwell at ease;</I> to him 
 therefore it must retire, and rejoice in him. He has <I>dealt 
 bountifully with us;</I> he has provided sufficiently for our comfort 
 and refreshment, and encouraged us to come to him for the benefit of 
 it, at all times, upon all occasions; let us therefore be satisfied 
 with that. Return to that rest which Christ gives to <I>the weary and 
 heavy-laden,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:28">Matt. xi. 28</A>.

 Return to thy Noah; his name signifies <I>rest,</I> as the dove, when 
 she found no rest, returned to the ark. I know no word more proper to 
 close our eyes with at night, when we go to sleep, nor to close them 
 with at death, that long sleep, than this, <I>Return to thy rest, O my 
 soul!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He will live a life of devotedness to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living,</I> that is, 
 in this world, as long as I continue to live in it. Note, 

 [1.] It is our great duty to <I>walk before the Lord,</I> to do all we 
 do as becomes us in his presence and under his eye, to approve 
 ourselves to him as a holy God by conformity to him as our sovereign 
 Lord, by subjection to his will, and, as a God all-sufficient, by a 
 cheerful confidence in him. <I>I am the almighty God; walk before 
 me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:1">Gen. xvii. 1</A>.

 <I>We must walk worthy of the Lord unto all well-pleasing.</I> 

 [2.] The consideration of this, that we are in the land of the living, 
 should engage and quicken us to do so. We are spared and continued in 
 the land of the living by the power, and patience, and tender mercy of 
 our God, and therefore must make conscience of our duty to him. The 
 <I>land of the living</I> is a land of mercy, which we ought to be 
 thankful for; it is a land of opportunity, which we should improve.
 Canaan is called the <I>land of the living</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:20">Ezek. xxvi. 20</A>),

 and those whose lot is cast in such a valley of vision are in a special 
 manner concerned to <I>set the Lord always before them.</I> If God has 
 delivered our soul from death, we must walk before him. A new life must 
 be a new life indeed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Septuagint and some other ancient versions make these verses a
 distinct psalm separate from the former; and some have called it the 
 <I>Martyr's psalm,</I> I suppose for the sake of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Three things David here makes confession of:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His faith 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>I believed, therefore have I spoken.</I> This is quoted by the 
 apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:13">2 Cor. iv. 13</A>)

 with application to himself and his fellow-ministers, who, though they 
 suffered for Christ, were not ashamed to own him. David believed the 
 being, providence, and promise of God, particularly the assurance God 
 had given him by Samuel that he should exchange his crook for a 
 sceptre: a great deal of hardship he went through in the belief of 
 this, and therefore he spoke, spoke to God by prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 by praise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Those that believe in God will address themselves to him. He spoke to 
 himself; because he believed, he said to his soul, <I>Return to thy 
 rest.</I> He spoke to others, told his friends what his hope was, and 
 what the ground of it, though it exasperated Saul against him and he 
 was greatly afflicted for it. Note, Those that believe with the heart 
 must confess with the mouth, for the glory of God, the encouragement of 
 others, and to evidence their own sincerity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:10,Ac+9:19,20">
 Rom. x. 10; Acts ix. 19, 20</A>.

 Those that live in hope of the kingdom of glory must neither be afraid 
 nor ashamed to own their obligation to him that purchased it for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:22">Matt. x. 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His fear 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>I was greatly afflicted,</I> and then <I>I said in my haste</I> 
 (somewhat rashly and inconsiderately--in my <I>amazement</I> (so some), 
 when I was in a consternation--<I>in my flight</I> (so others), when 
 Saul was in pursuit of me), <I>All men are liars,</I> all with whom he 
 had to do, Saul and all his courtiers; his friends, who he thought 
 would stand by him, deserted him and disowned him when he fell into 
 disgrace at court. And some think it is especially a reflection on 
 Samuel, who had promised him the kingdom, but deceived him; for, says 
 he, <I>I shall one day perish by the hand of Saul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+27:1">1 Sam. xxvii. 1</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. The faith of the best of saints is not perfect, nor always alike
 strong and active. David <I>believed</I> and <I>spoke well</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 but now, through unbelief, he spoke amiss. 

 2. When we are under great and sore afflictions, especially if they 
 continue long, we are apt to grow weary, to despond, and almost to 
 despair of a good issue. Let us not therefore be harsh in censuring 
 others, but carefully watch over ourselves when we are in trouble,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:1-3">Ps. xxxix. 1-3</A>.

 3. If good men speak amiss, it is in their haste, through the surprise 
 of a temptation, not deliberately and with premeditation, as the wicked 
 man, who <I>sits in the seat of the scornful</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:1">Ps. i. 1</A>),

 sits and <I>speaks against his brother,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:19,20">Ps. l. 19, 20</A>.

 4. What we speak amiss, in haste, we must by repentance unsay again (as 
 David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:22">Ps. xxxi. 22</A>),

 and then it shall not be laid to our charge. Some make this to be no 
 rash word of David's. He was greatly afflicted and forced to fly, but 
 he did not trust in man, nor make flesh his arm. No: he said, "<I>All 
 men are liars;</I> as <I>men of low degree are vanity,</I> so <I>men of 
 high degree are a lie,</I> and therefore my confidence was in God only, 
 and in him I cannot be disappointed." In this sense the apostle seems 
 to take it. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:4">Rom. iii. 4</A>,

 <I>Let God be true and every man a liar</I> in comparison with God. All 
 men are fickle and inconstant, and subject to change; and therefore let 
 us cease from man and cleave to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His gratitude, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>,

 &c. God had been better to him than his
 fears, and had graciously delivered him out of his distresses; and, in 
 consideration hereof,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He enquires what returns he shall make 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards 
 me?</I> Here he speaks, 

 (1.) As one sensible of many mercies received from God--<I>all his 
 benefits.</I> This psalm seems to have been penned upon occasion of 
 some one particular benefit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>),

 but in that one he saw many and that one brought many to mind, and 
 therefore now he thinks of all God's benefits towards him. Note, When 
 we speak of God's mercies we should magnify them and speak highly of 
 them. 

 (2.) As one solicitous and studious how to express his gratitude: 
 <I>What shall I render unto the Lord?</I> Not as if he thought he could 
 render any thing proportionable, or as a valuable consideration for 
 what he had received; we can no more pretend to give a recompense to 
 God than we can to merit any favour from him; but he desired to render 
 something acceptable, something that God would be pleased with as the 
 acknowledgment of a grateful mind. He asks God, <I>What shall I 
 render?</I> Asks the priest, asks his friends, or rather asks himself, 
 and communes with his own heart about it. Note, Having received many 
 benefits from God, we are concerned to enquire, <I>What shall we 
 render?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He resolves what returns he will make.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He will in the most devout and solemn manner offer up his praises 
 and prayers to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:13,17"><I>v.</I> 13, 17</A>.

 [1.] "<I>I will take the cup of salvation,</I> that is, I will offer
 the drink-offerings appointed by the law, in token of my thankfulness 
 to God, and rejoice with my friends in God's goodness to me;" this is 
 called <I>the cup of deliverance</I> because drunk in memory of his 
 deliverance. The pious Jews had sometimes a <I>cup of blessing,</I> at 
 their private meals, which the master of the family drank first of, 
 with thanksgiving to God, and all at his table drank with him. But some 
 understand it not of the cup that he would present to God, but of the 
 cup that God would put into his hand. <I>I will receive, First,</I> The 
 <I>cup of affliction.</I> Many good interpreters understand it of that 
 cup, that bitter cup, which is yet sanctified to the saints, so that to 
 them it is a cup of salvation.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:19">Phil. i. 19</A>,

 <I>This shall turn to my salvation;</I> it is a means of spiritual 
 health. David's sufferings were typical of Christ's, and we, in ours, 
 have communion with his, and his cup was indeed a cup of salvation. 
 "God, having bestowed so many benefits upon me, whatever cup he shall 
 put into my hands I will readily take it, and not dispute it; welcome 
 his holy will." Herein David spoke the language of the Son of David. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:11">John xviii. 11</A>,

 <I>The cup that my Father has given me, shall I not</I> take it and 
 <I>drink it? Secondly,</I> The cup of consolation: "I will receive the
 benefits God bestows upon me as from his hand, and taste his love in 
 them, as that which is <I>the portion</I> not only <I>of my 
 inheritance</I> in the other world, but <I>of my cup</I> in this." 

 [2.] <I>I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving,</I> the 
 thank-offerings which God required,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:11,12">Lev. vii. 11, 12</A>,

 &c. Note, Those whose hearts are truly thankful will express their
 gratitude in thank-offerings. We must first <I>give our ownselves</I> 
 to God as <I>living sacrifices</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1,2Co+8:5">Rom. xii. 1, 2 Cor. viii. 5</A>),

 and then lay out of what we have for his honour in works of piety and 
 charity. <I>Doing good</I> and <I>communicating</I> are
 <I>sacrifices</I> with which <I>God is well pleased</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:15,16">Heb. xiii. 15, 16</A>)

 and this must accompany our <I>giving thanks to his name.</I> If God 
 has been bountiful to us, the least we can do in return is to be 
 bountiful to the poor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:2,3">Ps. xvi. 2, 3</A>.

 Why should we offer that to God which costs us nothing? 

 [3.] <I>I will call upon the name of the Lord.</I> This he had promised 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 and here he repeats it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>
 
 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 If we have received kindness from a man like ourselves, we tell him 
 that we hope we shall never trouble him again; but God is pleased to 
 reckon the prayers of his people an honour to him, and a delight, and 
 no trouble; and therefore, in gratitude for former mercies, we must 
 seek to him for further mercies, and continue to <I>call upon 
 him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He will always entertain good thoughts of God, as very tender of 
 the lives and comforts of his people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints,</I> so 
 precious that he will not gratify Saul, nor Absalom, nor any of David's 
 enemies, with his death, how earnestly soever they desire it. This 
 truth David had comforted himself with in the depth of his distress and 
 danger; and, the event having confirmed it, he comforts others with it 
 who might be in like manner exposed. God has a people, even in this
 world, that are his saints, his merciful ones, or men of mercy, that 
 have received mercy from him and show mercy for his sake. The saints of 
 God are mortal and dying; nay, there are those that desire their death, 
 and labour all they can to hasten it, and sometimes prevail to be the 
 death of them; but it is <I>precious in the sight of the Lord; their 
 life</I> is so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+1:13">2 Kings i. 13</A>);
 
 their <I>blood</I> is so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:14">Ps. lxxii. 14</A>.

 God often wonderfully prevents the death of his saints when there is 
 but a step between them and it; he takes special care about their 
 death, to order it for the best in all the circumstances of it; and 
 whoever kills them, how light soever they may make of it, they shall be 
 made to pay dearly for it when inquisition is made for the blood of the 
 saints, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:35">Matt. xxiii. 35</A>.

 Though <I>no man lays it to heart</I> when <I>the righteous perish,</I> 
 God will make it to appear that he lays it to heart. This should make 
 us willing to die, to die for Christ, if we are called to it, that our 
 death shall be registered in heaven; and let that be precious to us 
 which is so to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He will oblige himself to be God's servant all his days. Having 
 asked, <I>What shall I render?</I> here he surrenders himself, which 
 was <I>more than all burnt-offerings and sacrifice</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>O Lord! truly I am thy servant.</I> Here is, 

 [1.] The relation in which David professes to stand to God: "<I>I am 
 thy servant;</I> I choose to be so; I resolve to be so; I will live and 
 die in thy service." He had called God's people, who are dear to him, 
 <I>his saints;</I> but, when he comes to apply it to himself, he does 
 not say, <I>Truly I am thy saint</I> (that looked too high a title for 
 himself), but, <I>I am thy servant.</I> David was a king, and yet he 
 glories in this, that he was God's servant. It is no disparagement, but 
 an honour, to the greatest kings on earth, to be the servants of the 
 God of heaven. David does not here compliment God, as it is common 
 among men to say, <I>I am your servant, Sir.</I> No; "Lord, I am 
 <I>truly thy servant; thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I am 
 so.</I>" And he repeats it, as that which he took pleasure in the 
 thoughts of and which he was resolved to abide by: "<I>I am thy 
 servant, I am thy servant.</I> Let others serve what master they will, 
 <I>truly I am</I> they <I>servant.</I>"

 [2.] The ground of that relation. Two ways men came to be 
 servants:--<I>First,</I> by birth. "Lord, I was born in thy house; I am 
 <I>the son of thy handmaid,</I> and therefore thine." It, is a great 
 mercy to be the children of godly parents, as it obliges us to duty and 
 is pleadable with God for mercy. <I>Secondly,</I> By redemption. He 
 that procured the release of a captive took him for his servant.
 "<I>Lord, thou hast loosed my bonds;</I> those sorrows of death that 
 compassed me, thou hast discharged me from them, and therefore <I>I am 
 thy servant,</I> and entitled to thy protection as well as obliged to 
 thy work." <I>The very bonds which thou hast loosed shall tie me faster 
 unto thee.</I> Patrick.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He will make conscience of paying his vows and making good what he 
 had promised, not only that he would offer the sacrifices of praise, 
 which he had vowed to bring, but perform all his other engagements to 
 God, which he had laid himself under in the day of his affliction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I will pay my vows;</I> and again, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),
 
 <I>now in the presence
 of all his people.</I> Note, Vows are debts that must be paid, for it 
 is better not to vow than to vow and not pay. He will pay his vows, 
 
 [1.] Presently; he will not, like sorry debtors, delay the payment of
 them, or beg a day; but, "<I>I will pay them now,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:4">Eccl. v. 4</A>.

 [2.] Publicly; he will not huddle up his praises in a corner, but what 
 service he has to do for God he will do it <I>in the presence of all 
 his people;</I> nor for ostentation, but to show that he was not 
 ashamed of the service of God, and that others might be invited to join 
 with him. He will pay his vows in the courts of the tabernacle, where 
 there was a crowd of Israelites attending, <I>in the midst of 
 Jerusalem,</I> that he might bring devotion into more reputation.</P>
