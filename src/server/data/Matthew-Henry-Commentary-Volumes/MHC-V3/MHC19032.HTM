 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm, though it speaks not of Christ, as many of the psalms we
 have hitherto met with have done, has yet a great deal of gospel in it.
 The apostle tells us that David, in this psalm, describes "the
 blessedness of the man unto whom God imputes righteousness without
 words," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:6">Rom. iv. 6</A>.

 We have here a summary, I. Of gospel grace in the pardon of sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 in divine protection

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:7">ver. 7</A>),

 and divine guidance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:8">ver. 8</A>.

 II. Of gospel duty. To confess sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>),
 
 to pray 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:6">ver. 6</A>),

 to govern ourselves well 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>),

 and to rejoice in God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:11">ver.  11</A>.

 The way to obtain these privileges is to make conscience of these 
 duties, which we ought to think of--of the former for our comfort, of 
 the latter for our quickening, when we sing this psalm. Grotius thinks 
 it was designed to be sung on the day of atonement.</P>

 <P>A psalm of David, Maschil.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Blessed <I>is he whose</I>
 transgression <I>is</I> forgiven, <I>whose</I> sin <I>is</I> covered.
 &nbsp; 2  Blessed <I>is</I> the man unto whom the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> imputeth not
 iniquity, and in whose spirit <I>there is</I> no guile.
 &nbsp; 3  When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring
 all the day long.
 &nbsp; 4  For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is
 turned into the drought of summer. Selah.
 &nbsp; 5  I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not
 hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and
 thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
 &nbsp; 6  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a
 time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great
 waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is entitled <I>Maschil,</I> which some take to be only the 
 name of the tune to which it was set and was to be sung. But others 
 think it is significant; our margin reads it, <I>A psalm of David 
 giving instruction,</I> and there is nothing in which we have more need 
 of instruction than in the nature of true blessedness, wherein it 
 consists and the way that leads to it--what we must do that we may be
 happy. There are several things in which these verses instruct us. In
 general, we are here taught that our happiness consists in the favour 
 of God, and not in the wealth of this world--in spiritual blessings, and
 not the good things of this world. When David says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:1">Ps. i. 1</A>),

 <I>Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly,</I> 
 and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:1">Ps. cxix. 1</A>),

 <I>Blessed are the undefiled in the way,</I> the meaning is, "This is
 the character of the blessed man; and he that has not this character 
 cannot expect to be happy:" but when it is here said, <I>Blessed is the 
 man whose iniquity is forgiven,</I> the meaning is, "This is the ground 
 of his blessedness: this is that fundamental privilege from which all 
 the other ingredients of his blessedness flow." In particular, we are 
 here instructed,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning the nature of the pardon of sin. This is that which we 
 all need and are undone without; we are therefore concerned to be very 
 solicitous and inquisitive about it. 

 1. It is the forgiving of transgression. <I>Sin is the transgression of 
 the law.</I> Upon our repentance, the transgression is forgiven; that 
 is, the obligation to punishment which we lay under, by virtue of the 
 sentence of the law, is vacated and cancelled; it is <I>lifted off</I> 
 (so some read it), that by the pardon of it we may be eased of a 
 burden, a heavy burden, like a load on the back, that makes us stoop, 
 or a load on the stomach, that makes us sick, or a load on the spirits, 
 that makes us sink. The remission of sins gives rest and relief to 
 those that were <I>weary and heavily laden,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:28">Matt. xi. 28</A>.

 2. It is the covering of sin, as nakedness is covered, that it may not
 appear to our shame, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:18">Rev. iii. 18</A>.

 One of the first symptoms of guilt in our first parents was blushing at
 their own nakedness. Sin makes us loathsome in the sight of God and 
 utterly unfit for communion with him, and, when conscience is awakened, 
 it makes us loathsome to ourselves too; but, when sin is pardoned, it 
 is covered with the robe of Christ's righteousness, like the coats of 
 skins wherewith God clothed Adam and Eve (an emblem of the remission of 
 sins), so that God is no longer displeased with us, but perfectly 
 reconciled. They are not covered from us (no; <I>My sin is ever before 
 me</I>) nor covered from God's omniscience, but from his vindictive 
 justice. When he pardons sin he <I>remembers it no more,</I> he 
 <I>casts it behind his back,</I> it <I>shall be sought for and not 
 found,</I> and the sinner, being thus reconciled to God, begins to be 
 reconciled to himself.

 3. It is the not imputing of iniquity, not laying it to the sinner's
 charge, not proceeding against him for it according to the strictness 
 of the law, not dealing with him as he deserves. The righteousness of 
 Christ being imputed to us, and we being made <I>the righteousness of 
 God in him,</I> our iniquity is not imputed, God having <I>laid upon 
 him the iniquity of us all</I> and made him <I>sin for us.</I> Observe, 
 Not to impute iniquity is God's act, for he is the Judge. <I>It is God 
 that justifies.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning the character of those whose sins are pardoned: <I>in 
 whose spirit there is no guile.</I> He does not say, "There is no 
 <I>guilt</I>" (for who is there that lives and sins not?), but no 
 <I>guile;</I> the pardoned sinner is one that does not dissemble with 
 God in his professions of repentance and faith, nor in his prayers for 
 peace or pardon, but in all these is sincere and means as he says--that
 does not repent with a purpose to sin again, and then sin with a 
 purpose to repent again, as a learned interpreter glosses upon it. 
 Those that design honestly, that are really what they profess to be, 
 are Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Concerning the happiness of a justified state: <I>Blessednesses 
 are to the man whose iniquity is forgiven,</I> all manner of blessings, 
 sufficient to make him completely blessed. That is taken away which 
 incurred the curse and obstructed the blessing; and then God will pour 
 out blessings till there be no room to receive them. The forgiveness of 
 sin is that article of the covenant which is the reason and ground of 
 all the rest. <I>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:12">Heb.  viii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Concerning the uncomfortable condition of an unhumbled sinner, that 
 sees his guilt, but is not yet brought to make a penitent confession of 
 it. This David describes very pathetically, from his own sad experience 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>):

 <I>While I kept silence my bones waxed old.</I> Those may be said to 
 keep silence who stifle their convictions, who, when they cannot but 
 see the evil of sin and their danger by reason of it, ease themselves 
 by not thinking of it and diverting their minds to something else, as 
 Cain to the building of a city,--who <I>cry not when God binds 
 them,</I>--who will not unburden their consciences by a penitent 
 confession, nor seek for peace, as they ought, by faithful and fervent 
 prayer,--and who choose rather to pine away in their iniquities than to 
 take the method which God has appointed of finding rest for their 
 souls. Let such expect that their smothered convictions will be a fire 
 in their bones, and the wounds of sin, not opened, will fester, and 
 grow intolerably painful. If conscience be seared, the case is so much 
 the more dangerous; but if it be startled and awake, it will be heard.  
 The hand of divine wrath will be felt lying heavily upon the soul, and 
 the anguish of the spirit will affect the body; to the degree David 
 experienced it, so that when he was young his bones waxed old; and even 
 his silence made him <I>roar all the day long,</I> as if he had been 
 under some grievous pain and distemper of body, when really the cause 
 of all his uneasiness was the struggle he felt in his own bosom between 
 his convictions and his corruptions. Note, <I>He that covers his sin 
 shall not prosper;</I> some inward trouble is required in repentance, 
 but there is much worse in impenitency.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Concerning the true and only way to peace of conscience. We are here 
 taught to confess our sins, that they may be forgiven, to declare them, 
 that we may be justified. This course David took: <I>I acknowledged my 
 sin unto thee,</I> and no longer <I>hid my iniquity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Note, Those that would have the comfort of the pardon of their sins 
 must take shame to themselves by a penitent confession of them. We must 
 confess the fact of sin, and be particular in it (<I>Thus and thus have 
 I done</I>), confess the fault of sin, aggravate it, and lay a load 
 upon ourselves for it (<I>I have done very wickedly</I>), confess the 
 justice of the punishment we have been under for it (<I>The Lord is 
 just in all that is brought upon us</I>), and that we deserve much 
 worse--<I>I am no more worthy to be called thy son.</I> We must confess 
 sin with shame and holy blushing, with fear and holy trembling.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Concerning God's readiness to pardon sin to those who truly repent 
 of it: "<I>I said, I will confess</I> (I sincerely resolved upon it, 
 hesitated no longer, but came to a point, that I would make a free and 
 ingenuous confession of my sins) <I>and</I> immediately <I>thou 
 forgavest the iniquity of my sin,</I> and gavest me the comfort of the 
 pardon in my own conscience; immediately I found rest to my soul." 
 Note, God is more ready to pardon sin, upon our repentance, than we are 
 to repent in order to the obtaining of pardon. It was with much ado 
 that David was here brought to confess his sins; he was put to the rack 
 before he was brought to do it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>),

 he held out long, and would not surrender till it came to the last 
 extremity; but, when he did offer to surrender, see how quickly, how 
 easily, he obtained good terms: "I did but say, <I>I will confess, and 
 thou forgavest.</I>" Thus the father of the prodigal saw his returning 
 son <I>when he was yet afar off,</I> and ran to meet him with the kiss 
 that sealed his pardon.  What an encouragement is this to poor 
 penitents, and what an assurance does it give us that, <I>if we confess 
 our sins,</I> we shall find God, not only <I>faithful and just,</I> but 
 gracious and kind, <I>to forgive us our sins!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Concerning the good use that we are to make of the experience 
 David had had of God's readiness to forgive his sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee.</I> Note,

 1. All godly people are praying people. As soon as ever Paul was 
 converted, <I>Behold, he prays,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:11">Acts ix. 11</A>.

 You may as soon find a living man without breath as a living Christian
 without prayer.

 2. The instructions given us concerning the happiness of those whose 
 sins are pardoned, and the easiness of obtaining the pardon, should 
 engage and encourage us to pray, and particularly to pray, <I>God be 
 merciful to us sinners.</I> For this shall every one that is well 
 inclined be earnest with God in prayer, and <I>come boldly to the 
 throne of grace,</I> with hopes to <I>obtain mercy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:16">Heb. iv. 16</A>.

 3.  Those that would speed in prayer must seek the Lord in <I>a time
 when he will be found.</I> When, by his providence, he calls them to 
 seek him, and by his Spirit stirs them up to seek him, they must <I>go 
 speedily to seek the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:21">Zech. viii. 21</A>)

 and lose no time, lest death cut them off, and then it will be too late
 to seek him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:6">Isa. lv. 6</A>.

 <I>Behold, now is the accepted time,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:2,4">2 Cor. vi. 2, 4</A>.

 Those that are sincere and abundant in prayer will find the benefit of
 it when they are in trouble: <I>Surely in the floods of great
 waters,</I> which are very threatening, <I>they shall not come nigh
 them,</I> to terrify them, or create them any uneasiness, much less
 shall they overwhelm them. Those that have God <I>nigh unto them in all
 that which they call upon him for,</I> as all upright, penitent,
 praying people have, are so guarded, so advanced, that no waters--no,
 not great waters--no, not floods of them, can come nigh them, to hurt
 them. As the temptations of the <I>wicked one touch them not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:18">1 John v. 18</A>),

 so neither do the troubles of this evil world; these fiery darts of
 both kinds, drop short of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Thou <I>art</I> my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from
 trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance.
 Selah.
 &nbsp; 8  I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou
 shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.
 &nbsp; 9  Be ye not as the horse, <I>or</I> as the mule, <I>which</I> have no
 understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle,
 lest they come near unto thee.
 &nbsp; 10  Many sorrows <I>shall be</I> to the wicked: but he that trusteth
 in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, mercy shall compass him about.
 &nbsp; 11  Be glad in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout
 for joy, all <I>ye that are</I> upright in heart.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David is here improving the experience he had had of the comfort of 
 pardoning mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He speaks to God, and professes his confidence in him and 
 expectation from him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Having tasted the sweetness of divine grace to a penitent sinner, he 
 cannot doubt of the continuance of that grace to a praying saint, and 
 that in that grace he should find both safety and joy.

 1. Safety: "<I>Thou art my hiding-place;</I> when by faith I have 
 recourse to thee I see all the reason in the world to be easy, and to 
 think myself out of the reach of any real evil. <I>Thou shalt preserve 
 me from trouble,</I> from the sting of it, and from the strokes of it 
 as far as is good for me. <I>Thou shalt preserve me from</I> such 
 trouble as I was in <I>while I kept silence,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 When God has pardoned our sins, if he leaves us to ourselves, we shall
 soon run as far in debt again as ever and plunge ourselves again into 
 the same gulf; and therefore, when we have received the comfort of our 
 remission, we must fly to the grace of God to be preserved from 
 returning to folly again, and having our hearts again hardened through 
 the deceitfulness of sin. God keeps his people from trouble by keeping 
 them from sin.

 2. Joy: "Thou shalt not only deliver me, but <I>compass me about with 
 songs of deliverance;</I> which way soever I look I shall see occasion 
 to rejoice and to praise God; and my friends also shall compass me 
 about in the great congregation, to join with me in songs of praise: 
 they shall join their songs of deliverance with mine. As <I>every one 
 that is godly shall pray with me,</I> so they shall give thanks with 
 me."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He turns his speech to the children of men. Being himself 
 converted, he does what he can to <I>strengthen his brethren</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:32">Luke xxii. 32</A>):

 <I>I will instruct thee,</I> whoever thou art that desirest
 instruction, <I>and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 This, in another of his penitential psalms, he resolves that when God 
 should have restored to him the joy of his salvation he would teach 
 transgressors his ways, and do what he could to convert sinners to God, 
 as well as to comfort those that were converted,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:12,13">Ps. li. 12, 13</A>.

 When Solomon became a penitent he immediately became a preacher, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:1">Eccl. i. 1</A>.

 Those are best able to teach others the grace of God who have
 themselves had the experience of it: and those who are themselves 
 taught of God ought to <I>tell others what he has done for their 
 souls</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:16">Ps. lxvi. 16</A>)

 and so teach them. <I>I will guide thee with my eye.</I> Some apply
 this to God's conduct and direction. He teaches us by his word and 
 guides us with his eye, by the secret intimations of his will in the 
 hints and turns of Providence, which he enables his people to 
 understand and take direction from, as a master makes a servant know 
 his mind by a wink of his eye. When Christ turned and looked upon Peter 
 he guided him with his eye.  But it is rather to be taken as David's 
 promise to those who sat under his instruction, his own children and 
 family especially: "<I>I will counsel thee; my eye shall be upon 
 thee</I>" (so the margin reads it); "I will give thee the best counsel 
 I can and then observe whether thou takest it or no." Those that are 
 taught in the word should be under the constant inspection of those 
 that teach them; spiritual guides must be overseers. In this 
 application of the foregoing doctrine concerning the blessedness of 
 those whose sins are pardoned we have a word to sinners and a word to 
 saints; and this is rightly dividing the word of truth and giving to 
 each their portion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Here is a word of caution to sinners, and a good reason is given for 
 it. 

 (1.) The caution is, not to be unruly and ungovernable: <I>Be you not 
 as the horse and the mule, which have no understanding,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 When the psalmist would reproach himself for the sins he repented of he 
 compared himself to a <I>beast before God</I> (<I>so foolish have I 
 been and ignorant,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:22">Ps. lxxiii. 22</A>)

 and therefore warns others not to be so. It is our honour and happiness
 that we have understanding, that we are capable of being governed by
 reason and of reasoning with ourselves. Let us therefore use the
 faculties we have, and act rationally. The horse and mule must be
 managed <I>with bit and bridle, lest they come near</I> us, to do us a
 mischief, or (as some read it) that they may come near to us, to do us
 service, that they <I>may obey us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:3">Jam. iii. 3</A>.

 Let us not be like them; let us not be hurried by appetite and passion,
 at any time, to go contrary to the dictate of right reason and to our
 true interest. If sinners would be governed and determined by these,
 they would soon become saints and would not go a step further in their 
 sinful courses; where there is renewing grace there is no need of the 
 bit and bridle of restraining grace. 

 (2.) The reason for this caution is because the way of sin which we
 would persuade you to forsake will certainly end in sorrow 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Many sorrows shall be to the wicked,</I> which will not only spoil
 their vain and carnal mirth, and put an end to it, but will make them
 pay dearly for it. Sin will have sorrow, if not repented of,
 everlasting sorrow. It was part of the sentence, <I>I will greatly
 multiply thy sorrows.</I> "Be wise for yourselves therefore, and turn
 from your wickedness, that you may prevent those sorrows, those many
 sorrows."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Here is a word of comfort to saints, and a good reason is given for
 that too.

 (1.) They are assured that if they will but trust in the Lord, and keep
 closely to him, <I>mercy shall compass them about</I> on every side
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 so that they shall not depart from God, for that mercy shall keep them 
 in, nor shall any real evil break in upon them, for that mercy shall 
 keep it out.

 (2.) They are therefore commanded to <I>be glad in the Lord, and</I> to 
 <I>rejoice</I> in him, to such a degree as even to <I>shout for 
 joy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Let them be so transported with this holy joy as not to be able to
 contain themselves; and let them affect others with it, that they also
 may see that a life of communion with God is the most pleasant and
 comfortable life we can live in this world. This is that present bliss
 which the upright in heart, and they are only, are entitled to and
 qualified for.</P>
