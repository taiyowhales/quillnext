 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The key of this psalm hangs at the door, for the title tells us upon
 what occasion it was penned--when the inhabitants of Ziph, men of Judah
 (types of Judas the traitor), betrayed David to Saul, by informing him
 where he was and putting him in a way how to seize him. This they did
 twice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:19,26:1">1 Sam. xxiii. 19; xxvi. 1</A>),

 and it is upon record to their everlasting infamy. The psalm is sweet;
 the former part of it, perhaps, was meditated when he was in his 
 distress and put into writing when the danger was over, with the 
 addition of the last two verses, which express his thankfulness for the 
 deliverance, which yet might be written in faith, even when he was in 
 the midst of his fright. Here, 

 I.  He complains to God of the malice of his enemies, and prays for
 help against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. He comforts himself with an assurance of the divine favour and
 protection, and that, in due time, his enemies should be confounded and 
 be delivered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>.

 What time we are in distress we may comfortably sing this psalm.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician on Neginoth, Maschil. <I>A psalm</I> of David,
 when <BR>the Ziphim came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself
 with us?</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me
 by thy strength.
 &nbsp; 2  Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
 &nbsp; 3  For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek
 after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may observe here, 

 1. The great distress that David was now in, which the title gives an
 account of. The Ziphim came of their own accord, and informed Saul 
 where David was, with a promise to deliver him into his hand. One would 
 have thought that when David had retired into the country he would not 
 be pursued, into a desert country he would not be discovered, and into 
 his own country he would not be betrayed; and yet it seems he was. 
 Never let a good man expect to be safe and easy till he comes to heaven.
 How treacherous, how officious, were these Ziphim! It is well that God 
 is faithful, for men are not to be trusted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:5">Mic. vii. 5</A>.

 2. His prayer to God for succour and deliverance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+54:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 He appeals to God's strength, by which he was able to help him, and to
 his name, by which he was engaged to help him, and begs he would save 
 him from his enemies and judge him, that is, plead his cause and judge 
 for him.  David has no other plea to depend upon than God's name, no 
 other power to depend upon than God's strength, and those he makes his 
 refuge and confidence.  This would be the effectual answer of his 
 prayers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+54:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 which even in his flight, when he had not opportunity for solemn
 address to God, he was ever and anon lifting up to heaven: <I>Hear my 
 prayer,</I> which comes from my heart, and <I>give ear to the words of 
 my mouth.</I> 

 3. His plea, which is taken from the character of his enemies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+54:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 (1.) They are <I>strangers;</I> such were the Ziphites, unworthy the
 name of Israelites. "They have used me more basely and barbarously than 
 the Philistines themselves would have done." The worst treatment may be 
 expected from those who, having broken through the bonds of relation 
 and alliance, make themselves strangers.

 (2.) They are <I>oppressors;</I> such was Saul, who, as a king, should
 have used his power for the protection of all his good subjects, but 
 abused it for their destruction. Nothing is so grievous as oppression 
 in <I>the seat of judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16">Eccl. iii. 16</A>.

 Paul's greatest perils were by his <I>own countrymen</I> and by
 <I>false brethren</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:26">2 Cor. xi. 26</A>),

 and so were David's.

 (3.) They were very formidable and threatening; they not only hated him
 and wished him ill, but they rose up against him in a body, joining
 their power to do him a mischief.

 (4.) They were very spiteful and malicious: <I>They seek after my
 soul;</I> they hunt for the precious life; no less will satisfy them.
 We may, in faith, pray that God would not by his providence give
 success, lest it should look like giving countenance, to such cruel
 bloody men.

 (5.) They were very profane and atheistical, and, for this reason, he
 thought God was concerned in honour to appear against them: <I>They 
 have not set God before them,</I> that is, they have quite cast off the 
 thoughts of God; they do not consider that his eye is upon them, that, 
 in fighting against his people, they fight against him, nor have they 
 any dread of the certain fatal consequences of such an unequal 
 engagement. Note, From those who do not set God before them no good is 
 to be expected; nay, what wickedness will not such men be guilty of?  
 What bonds of nature, or friendship, or gratitude, or covenant, will 
 hold those that have broken through the fear of God?  <I>Selah--Mark 
 this.</I> Let us all be sure to set God before us at all times; for, if 
 we do not we are in danger of becoming desperate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Behold, God <I>is</I> mine helper: the Lord <I>is</I> with them that
 uphold my soul.
 &nbsp; 5  He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy
 truth.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the lively actings of David's faith in his prayer, by 
 which he was assured that the issue would be comfortable, though the
 attempt upon him was formidable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He was sure that he had God on his side, that God took his part 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+54:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 he speaks it with an air of triumph and exultation, <I>Behold, God is
 my helper.</I> If we be for him, he is for us; and, if he be for us, we 
 shall have such help in him that we need not fear any power engaged 
 against us. Though men and devils aim to be our destroyers, they shall 
 not prevail while God is our helper: <I>The Lord is with those that 
 uphold my soul.</I> Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:7">Ps. cxviii. 7</A>,

 "<I>The Lord taketh my part with those that help me.</I> There are some
 that uphold me, and God is one of them; he is the principal one; none 
 of them could help me if he did not help them." Every creature is that 
 to us (and no more) that God makes it to be. He means, "The Lord is he 
 that upholds my soul, and keeps me from tiring in my work and sinking 
 under my burdens." He that by his providence upholds all things by his 
 grace upholds the souls of his people. God, who will in due time save 
 his people, does, in the mean time, sustain them and bear them up, so 
 that the spirit he has made shall not fail before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. God taking part with him, he doubted not but his enemies should 
 both flee and fall before him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+54:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>He shall reward evil unto my enemies that observe me,</I> seeking
 an opportunity to do me a mischief. The evil they designed against me 
 the righteous God will return upon their own heads." David would not 
 render evil to them, but he knew God would: <I>I as a deaf man heard 
 not, for thou wilt hear.</I> The enemies we forgive, if they repent 
 not, God will judge; and for this reason we must not avenge ourselves, 
 because God has said, <I>Vengeance is mine.</I> But he prays, <I>Cut 
 them off in thy truth.</I> This is not a prayer of malice, but a prayer 
 of faith; for it has an eye to the word of God, and only desires the 
 performance of that. There is truth in God's threatenings as well as in 
 his promises, and sinners that repent not will find it so to their 
 cost.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He promises to give thanks to God for all the experiences he had 
 had of his goodness to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+54:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>I will sacrifice unto thee.</I> Though sacrifices were expensive,
 yet, when God required that his worshippers should in that way praise 
 him, David would not only offer them, but offer them freely and without 
 grudging. All our spiritual sacrifices must, in this sense, be 
 free-will-offerings; for God loves a cheerful giver. Yet he will not 
 only bring his sacrifice, which was but the shadow, the ceremony; he 
 will mind the substance: <I>I will praise thy name.</I> A thankful 
 heart, and the calves of our lips giving thanks to his name, are the 
 sacrifices God will accept: "<I>I will praise thy name, for it is 
 good.</I> Thy name is not only great but good, and therefore to be 
 praised. To praise thy name is not only what we are bound to, but it is 
 good, it is pleasant, it is profitable; it is good for us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:1">Ps. xcii. 1</A>);

 therefore <I>I will praise thy name.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He speaks of his deliverance as a thing done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+54:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 I will praise thy name, and say, "<I>He has delivered me;</I> this
 shall be my song then." That which he rejoices in is a complete 
 deliverance--<I>He has delivered me from all trouble;</I> and a 
 deliverance to his heart's content--<I>My eye has seen its desire upon 
 my enemies,</I> not seen them cut off and ruined, but forced to 
 retreat, tidings being brought to Saul that the Philistines were upon 
 him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:27,28">1 Sam. xxiii. 27, 28</A>.

 All David desired was to be himself safe; when he saw Saul draw off his
 forces he saw his desire. <I>He has delivered me from all trouble.</I> 
 Either, 

 1.  With this thought David comforted himself when he was in distress:
 "<I>He has delivered me from all trouble</I> hitherto, and many a time 
 I have gained my point, and seen my desire on my enemies; therefore he 
 will deliver me out of this trouble." We should thus, in our greatest 
 straits, encourage ourselves with our past experiences.  Or, 

 2. With this thought he magnified his present deliverance when the
 fright was over, that it was an earnest of further deliverance. He 
 speaks of the completing of his deliverance as a thing done, though he 
 had as yet many troubles before him, because, having God's promise for 
 it, he was as sure of it as if it had been done already. "He that has 
 begun to deliver me from all troubles, and will at length give me to 
 see my desire upon my enemies." This may perhaps point at Christ, of 
 whom David was a type; God would deliver him out of all the troubles of 
 his state of humiliation, and he was perfectly sure of it; and all 
 things are said to be put under his feet; for, though we see not yet 
 all things put under him, yet we are sure he shall reign till all his 
 enemies be made his footstool, and he shall see his desire upon them.  
 However, it is an encouragement to all believers to make that use of 
 their particular deliverances which St. Paul does (like David here),

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:17,18">2 Tim. iv. 17, 18</A>,

 <I>He that delivered me from the mouth of the lion shall deliver me
 from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly 
 kingdom.</I></P>
