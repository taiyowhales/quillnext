 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is entitled "a prayer of David;" probably it was not penned 
 upon any particular occasion, but was a prayer he often used himself, 
 and recommended to others for their use, especially in a day of 
 affliction. Many think that David penned this prayer as a type of 
 Christ, "who in the days of his flesh offered up strong cries," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>.

 David, in this prayer (according to the nature of that duty),

 I.  Gives glory to God,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:8-10,12,13">ver. 8-10, 12, 13</A>.

 II. Seeks for grace and favour from God, that God would hear his
 prayers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:1,6,7">
 ver. 1, 6, 7</A>),

 preserve and save him, and be merciful to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:2,3,16">
 ver.  2, 3, 16</A>),

 that he would give him joy, and grace, and strength, and put honour
 upon him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:4,11,17">ver. 4, 11, 17</A>.
 
 He pleads God's goodness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:5,15">
 ver. 5, 15</A>)

 and the malice of his enemies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:14">ver.  14</A>.

 In singing this we must, as David did, lift up our souls to God with 
 application.</P>

 <P>A Prayer of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Bow down thine ear, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, hear me:
 for I <I>am</I> poor and needy.
 &nbsp; 2  Preserve my soul; for I <I>am</I> holy: O thou my God, save thy
 servant that trusteth in thee.
 &nbsp; 3  Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
 &nbsp; 4  Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I
 lift up my soul.
 &nbsp; 5  For thou, Lord, <I>art</I> good, and ready to forgive; and
 plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
 &nbsp; 6  Give ear, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of
 my supplications.
 &nbsp; 7  In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt
 answer me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm was published under the title of <I>a prayer of David;</I> 
 not as if David sung all his prayers, but into some of his songs he 
 inserted prayers; for a psalm will admit the expressions of any pious 
 and devout affections. But it is observable how very plain the language 
 of this psalm is, and how little there is in it of poetic flights or 
 figures, in comparison with some other psalms; for the flourishes of 
 wit are not the proper ornaments of prayer. Now here we may 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The petitions he puts up to God. It is true, prayer accidentally may 
 preach, but it is most fit that (as it is in this prayer) every passage 
 should be directed to God, for such is the nature of prayer as it is 
 here described 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Unto thee, O Lord! do I lift up my soul,</I> as he had said 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:1">Ps. xxv. 1</A>.

 In all the parts of prayer the soul must ascend upon the wings of faith 
 and holy desire, and be lifted up to God, to meet the communications of 
 his grace, and in an expectation raised very high of great things from 
 him. 
 
 1. He begs that God would give a gracious audience to his prayers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Bow down thy ear, O Lord! hear me.</I> When God hears our prayers it
 is fitly said that he <I>bows down his ear</I> to them, for it is 
 admirable condescension in God that he is pleased to take notice of 
 such mean creatures as we are and such defective prayers as ours are. 
 He repeats this again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Give ear, O Lord! unto my prayer,</I> a favourable ear, though it 
 be whispered, though it be stammered; <I>attend to the voice of my 
 supplications.</I>" Not that God needs to have his affection stirred up 
 by any thing that we can say; but thus we must express our desire of 
 his favour. The Son of David spoke it with assurance and pleasure

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:41,42">John xi. 41, 42</A>),

 <I>Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me; and I know that thou
 hearest me always.</I> 

 2. He begs that God would take him under his special protection, and so
 be the author of his salvation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:2"><I>v.</I>  2</A>):
 
 <I>Preserve my soul; save thy servant.</I> It was David's soul that was 
 God's servant; for those only serve God acceptably that <I>serve him 
 with their spirits.</I> David's concern is about his soul; if we 
 understand it of his natural life, it teaches us that the best 
 self-preservation is to commit ourselves to God's keeping and by faith 
 and prayer to make our Creator our preserver. But it may be understood 
 of his spiritual life, the life of the soul as distinct from the body: 
 "Preserve my soul from that one evil and dangerous thing to souls, even 
 from sin; preserve my soul, and so save me." All those whom God will 
 save he preserves, and will preserve them to his heavenly kingdom. 

 3.  He begs that God would look upon him with an eye of pity and
 compassion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Be merciful to me, O Lord!</I> It is mercy in God to pardon our sins 
 and to help us out of our distresses; both these are included in this 
 prayer, <I>God be merciful to me.</I> "Men show no mercy; we ourselves 
 deserve no mercy, but, Lord, for mercy-sake, be <I>merciful unto
 me.</I>" 
 
 4. He begs that God would fill him with inward comfort

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Rejoice the soul of thy servant.</I> It is God only that can <I>put
 gladness into the heart and make the soul to rejoice,</I> and then, and 
 not till then, the joy is full; and, as it is the duty of those who are 
 God's servants to <I>serve him with gladness,</I> so it is their 
 privilege to be <I>filled with joy and peace in believing,</I> and they 
 may in faith pray, not only that God will preserve their souls, but 
 that he will rejoice their souls, and the <I>joy of the Lord</I> will 
 be <I>their strength.</I> Observe, When he prays, <I>Rejoice my 
 soul,</I> he adds, <I>For unto thee do I lift up my soul.</I> Then we 
 may expect comfort from God when we take care to keep up our communion 
 with God: prayer is the nurse of spiritual joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The pleas with which he enforces these petitions. 

 1. He pleads his relation to God and interest in him: "Thou art my God,
 to whom I have devoted myself, and on whom I depend, and I am thy 
 servant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 in subjection to thee, and therefore looking for protection from thee." 
 
 2.  He pleads his distress: "<I>Hear me, for I am poor and needy,</I> 
 therefore I want thy help, therefore none else will hear me." God is 
 the poor man's King, whose glory it is to <I>save the souls of the 
 needy;</I> those who are poor in spirit, who see themselves empty and 
 necessitous, are most welcome to the God of all grace. 

 3. He pleads God's good will towards all that seek him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "To thee do I <I>lift up my soul</I> in desire and expectation; <I>for 
 thou, Lord, art good;</I>" and whither should beggars go but to the 
 door of the good house-keeper? The goodness of God's nature is a great 
 encouragement to us in all our addresses to him. His goodness appears 
 in two things, giving and forgiving. 

 (1.) He is a sin-pardoning God; not only he can forgive, but he is 
 ready to forgive, more ready to forgive than we are to repent. <I>I 
 said, I will confess, and thou forgavest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:5">Ps. xxxii. 5</A>.

 (2.) He is a prayer-hearing God; he is plenteous in mercy, very full, 
 and very free, both rich and liberal unto <I>all those that call upon 
 him;</I> he has wherewithal to supply all their needs and is openhanded 
 in granting that supply. 

 4. He pleads God's good work in himself, by which he had qualified him
 for the tokens of his favour.  Three things were wrought in him by 
 divine grace, which he looked upon as earnests of all good:--

 (1.) A conformity to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I am holy,</I> therefore preserve my soul; for those whom the Spirit 
 sanctifies he will preserve. He does not say this in pride and vain 
 glory, but with humble thankfulness to God. <I>I am one whom thou 
 favourest</I> (so the margin reads it), whom thou hast <I>set apart for 
 thyself.</I> If God has begun a good work of grace in us, we must own 
 that <I>the time was a time of love.  Then was I in his eyes as one 
 that found favour,</I> and whom God hath taken into his favour he will 
 take under his protection.  <I>All his saints are in thy hand,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:3">Deut. xxxiii. 3</A>.

 Observe, <I>I am needy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 yet <I>I am holy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 holy and yet needy, <I>poor in the world, but rich in faith.</I> Those 
 who preserve their purity in their greatest poverty may assure 
 themselves that God will preserve their comforts, will preserve their 
 souls. 

 (2.) A confidence in God: <I>Save thy servant that trusteth in 
 thee.</I> Those that are holy must nevertheless not trust in 
 themselves, nor in their own righteousness, but only in God and his 
 grace. Those that trust in God may expect salvation from him. 

 (3.) A disposition to communion with God. He hopes God will answer his 
 prayers, because he had inclined him to pray. 

 [1.] To be constant in prayer: <I>I cry unto thee daily, and all the 
 day,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It is thus our duty to pray always, without ceasing, and to continue
 instant in prayer; and then we may hope to have our prayers heard which 
 we make in the time of trouble, if we have made conscience of the duty 
 at other times, at all times. It is comfortable if an affliction finds 
 the wheels of prayer a-going, and that they are not then to be set
 a-going.  

 [2.] To be inward with God in prayer, to <I>lift up his soul</I> to 
 him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Then we may hope that God will meet us with his mercies, when we in our
 prayers send forth our souls as it were to meet him.  

 [3.] To be in a special manner earnest with God in prayer when he was 
 in affliction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>In the day of my trouble,</I> whatever others do, <I>I will call 
 upon thee,</I> and commit my case to thee, for thou wilt hear and 
 answer me, and I shall not seek in vain, as those did who cried, <I>O 
 Baal! hear us; but there was no voice, nor any that regarded,</I>"

 &nbsp; 14  O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David is here going on in his prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He gives glory to God; for we ought in our prayers to praise him, 
 ascribing kingdom, power, and glory, to him, with the most humble and 
 reverent adorations. 

 1. As a being of unparalleled perfection, such a one that there is none
 like him nor any to be compared with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 <I>Among the gods,</I> the false gods, whom the heathens worshipped,
 the angels, the kings of the earth, among them all, <I>there is none 
 like unto thee, O Lord!</I> none so wise, so mighty, so good; 
 <I>neither are there any works like unto thy works,</I> which is an 
 undeniable proof that there is none like him; his own works praise him, 
 and the best way we have of praising him is by acknowledging that there 
 is none like him. 

 2. As the fountain of all being and the centre of all praise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast made all nations,</I> made them all of one blood; they 
 all derive their being from thee, and have a constant dependence on 
 thee, and therefore <I>they shall come and worship before thee and 
 glorify thy name.</I>" This was in part fulfilled in the multitude of 
 proselytes to the Jewish religion in the days of David and Solomon, but 
 was to have its full accomplishment in the days of the Messiah, when 
 some out of every kingdom and nation should be effectually brought in 
 to praise God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9">Rev. vii. 9</A>.

 It was by Christ that God made all nations, for without him was not any
 thing made that was made, and therefore through Christ, and by the 
 power of his gospel and grace, all nations shall be brought to 
 <I>worship before God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:23">Isa.  lxvi. 23</A>.

 3. As a being infinitely great

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "Therefore all nations shall worship before thee, because as King of 
 nations <I>thou art great,</I> thy sovereignty absolute and 
 incontestable, thy majesty terrible and insupportable, thy power 
 universal and irresistible, thy riches vast and inexhaustible, thy 
 dominion boundless and unquestionable; and, for the proof of this, 
 <I>thou doest wondrous things,</I> which all nations admire, and whence 
 they might easily infer that thou art God alone, not only none like 
 thee, but none besides thee." Let us always entertain great thoughts of 
 this great God, and be filled with holy admiration of this God who 
 doeth wonders; and let him alone have our hearts who is God alone. 

 4.  As a being infinitely good. Man is bad, very wicked and vile

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);
 
 no mercy is to be expected from him; <I>but thou, O Lord!  art a God 
 full of compassion, and gracious,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 This is that attribute by which he proclaims his name, and by which we
 are therefore to proclaim it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:6,7">Exod.  xxxiv. 6, 7</A>.

 It is his goodness that is over all his works, and therefore should
 fill all our praises; and this is our comfort, in reference to the 
 wickedness of the world we live in, that, however it be, God is good. 
 Men are barbarous, but God is gracious; men are false, but God is 
 faithful. God is not only compassionate, but full of compassion, and in 
 him <I>mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</I> He is long-suffering 
 towards us, though we forfeit his favour and provoke him to anger, and 
 he is <I>plenteous in mercy and truth,</I> as faithful in performing as 
 he was free in promising. 

 5. As a kind friend and bountiful benefactor to him. We ought to praise
 God as good in himself, but we do it most feelingly when we observe how 
 good he has been to us.  This therefore the psalmist dwells upon with 
 most pleasure,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.
 
 He had said
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:9"><I>v.</I>  9</A>),

 <I>All nations shall praise thee, O Lord! and glorify thy name.</I> It 
 is some satisfaction to a good man to think that others shall praise 
 and glorify God, but it is his greatest care and pleasure to do it 
 himself. "Whatever others do" (says David), "<I>I will praise thee, O 
 Lord my God!</I> not only as the Lord, but as my God; and I will do it 
 with all my heart; I will be ready to do it and cordial in it; I will 
 do it with cheerfulness and liveliness, with a sincere regard to thy 
 honour; for <I>I will glorify thy name,</I> not for a time, but for 
 evermore. I will do it as long as I live, and hope to be doing it to 
 eternity." With good reason does he resolve to be thus particular in 
 praising God, because God had shown him particular favours: <I>For 
 great is thy mercy towards me.</I> The fountain of mercy is 
 inexhaustibly full; the streams of mercy are inestimably rich.  When we 
 speak of God's mercy to us, it becomes us thus to magnify it: <I>Great 
 is thy mercy towards me.</I> Of the greatness of God's mercy he gives 
 this instance, <I>Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell,</I> 
 from death, from so great a death, as St. Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:10">2 Cor. i. 10</A>),

 from eternal death, so even some of the Jewish writers understand it.
 David knew he deserved to be cast off for ever into the lowest hell for 
 his sin in the matter of Uriah; but Nathan assured him that the Lord 
 had <I>taken away his sin,</I> and by that word he was delivered from 
 the lowest hell, and herein God's mercy was great towards him. Even the 
 best saints owe it, not to their own merit, but to the mercy of God, 
 that they are saved from the lowest hell; and the consideration of that 
 should greatly enlarge their hearts in praising the mercy of God, which 
 they are obliged to glorify for evermore. So glorious; so gracious, a 
 rescue from everlasting misery, justly requires the return of 
 everlasting praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He prays earnestly for mercy and grace from God. He complains of 
 the restless and implacable malice of his enemies against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):
 
 "Lord, be thou for me; for there are many against me." He then takes 
 notice of their character; they were <I>proud men</I> that looked with 
 disdain upon poor David. (Many are made persecutors by their pride.) 
 They were <I>violent men,</I> that would carry all before them by 
 force, right or wrong. They were <I>terrible formidable men</I> (so 
 some), that did what they could to frighten all about them. He notices 
 their number: There were <I>assemblies</I> of them; they were men in 
 authority and met in councils and courts, or men for conversation, and 
 met in clubs; but, being assembled, they were the more capable of doing 
 mischief. He notices their enmity to him: "They <I>rise up against 
 me</I> in open rebellion; they not only plot, but they put their plots 
 in execution as far as they can; and the design is not only to depose 
 me, but to destroy me: they seek after my life, to slay me; after my 
 soul, to damn me, if it lay in their power." And, <I>lastly,</I> He 
 notices their distance and estrangement from God, which were at the 
 bottom of their enmity to David: "<I>They have not set thee before 
 them;</I> and what good can be expected from those that have no fear of 
 God before their eyes? Lord, appear against them, for they are thy 
 enemies as well as mine." His petitions are,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. For the operations of God's grace in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 He prays that God would give him,

 (1.) An understanding heart, that he would inform and instruct him
 concerning his duty: "<I>Teach me thy way, O Lord!</I> the way that
 thou hast appointed me to walk in; when I am in doubt concerning it,
 make it plain to me what I should do; let me hear the voice saying,
 <I>This is the way,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:21">Isa. xxx. 21</A>.

 David was well taught in the things of God, and yet was sensible he
 needed further instruction, and many a time could not trust his own
 judgment: <I>Teach me thy way; I will walk in thy truth.</I> One would
 think it should be, <I>Teach me thy truth, and I will walk in thy
 way;</I> but it comes all to one; it is the way of truth that God 
 teaches and that we must choose to walk in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:30">Ps. cxix. 30</A>.

 Christ is the way and the truth, and we must both learn Christ and walk 
 in him. We cannot walk in God's way and truth unless he teach us; and, 
 if we expect he should teach us, we must resolve to be governed by his 
 teachings,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3">Isa. ii. 3</A>.

 (2.) An upright heart: "<I>Unite my heart to fear thy name.</I> Make me 
 sincere in religion. A hypocrite has a double heart; let mine be single 
 and entire for God, not divided between him and the world, not 
 straggling from him." Our hearts are apt to wander and hang loose; 
 their powers and faculties wander after a thousand foreign things; we 
 have therefore need of God's grace to unite them, that we may serve God 
 with all that is within us, and all little enough to be employed in his 
 service.  "Let my heart be fixed for God, and firm and faithful to him, 
 and fervent in serving him; that is a united heart."</P>

 2. For the tokens of God's favour to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+86:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 Three things he here prays for:--

 (1.) That God would speak peace and comfort to him: "<I>O turn unto 
 me,</I> as to one thou lovest and hast a kind and tender concern for. 
 My enemies turn against me, my friends turn from me; Lord, do thou turn 
 to me and have mercy upon me; it will be a comfort to me to know that 
 thou pitiest me." 

 (2.) That God would work deliverance for him, and set him in safety: 
 "Give me <I>thy strength;</I> put strength into me, that I may help 
 myself, and put forth thy strength for me, that I may be saved out of 
 the hands of those that seek my ruin." He pleads relation: "I am <I>thy 
 servant;</I> I am so by birth, as <I>the son of thy handmaid,</I> born 
 in thy house, and therefore thou art my rightful owner and proprietor, 
 from whom I may expect protection. <I>I am thine; save me.</I>" The 
 children of godly parents, who were betimes dedicated to the Lord, may 
 plead it with him; if they come under the discipline of his family, 
 they are entitled to the privileges of it. 

 (3.) That God would put a reputation on him: "<I>Show me a token for 
 good;</I> make it to appear to others as well as to myself that thou 
 art doing me good, and designing further good for me. Let me have some 
 unquestionable illustrious instances of thy favour to me, <I>that those 
 who hate me may see it, and be ashamed</I> of their enmity to me, as 
 they will have reason to be when they perceive that <I>thou, Lord, hast 
 helped me and comforted me,</I> and that therefore they have been 
 striving against God, opposing one whom he owns, and that they have 
 been striving in vain to ruin and vex one whom God himself has 
 undertaken to help and comfort." The joy of the saints shall be the 
 shame of their persecutors.</P>
