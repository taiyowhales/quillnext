 <HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=50>
 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David was a weeping prophet as well as Jeremiah, and this psalm is one 
 of his lamentations: either it was penned in a time, or at least 
 calculated for a time, of great trouble, both outward and inward. Is 
 any afflicted? Is any sick? Let him sing this psalm. The method of this 
 psalm is very observable, and what we shall often meet with. He begins 
 with doleful complaints, but ends with joyful praises; like Hannah, who 
 went to prayer with a sorrowful spirit, but, when she had prayed, went 
 her way, and her countenance was no more sad. Three things the psalmist 
 is here complaining of:--
 
 1. Sickness of body.

 2. Trouble of mind, arising from the sense of sin, the meritorious
 cause of pain and sickness. 

 3. The insults of his enemies upon occasion of both. Now here,

 I. He pours out his complaints before God, deprecates his wrath, and
 begs earnestly for the return of his favour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. He assures himself of an answer of peace, shortly, to his full
 satisfaction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.
 
 This psalm is like the book of Job.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten
 me in thy hot displeasure.
 &nbsp; 2  Have mercy upon me, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for I <I>am</I> weak: O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, heal me;
 for my bones are vexed.
 &nbsp; 3  My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, how long?
 &nbsp; 4  Return, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies'
 sake.
 &nbsp; 5  For in death <I>there is</I> no remembrance of thee: in the grave
 who shall give thee thanks?
 &nbsp; 6  I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to
 swim; I water my couch with my tears.
 &nbsp; 7  Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because
 of all mine enemies.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses speak the language of a heart truly humbled under humbling
 providences, of a broken and contrite spirit under great afflictions, 
 sent on purpose to awaken conscience and mortify corruption. Those heap 
 up wrath who cry not when God binds them; but those are getting ready 
 for mercy who, under God's rebukes, sow in tears, as David does here. 
 Let us observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The representation he makes to God of his grievances. He pours out 
 his complaint before him. Whither else should a child go with his 
 complaints, but to his father? 

 1. He complains of bodily pain and sickness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>My bones are vexed.</I> His bones and his flesh, like Job's, were
 touched. Though David was a king, yet he was sick and pained; his 
 imperial crown could not keep his head from aching. Great men are men, 
 and subject to the common calamities of human life. Though David was a 
 stout man, a man of war from his youth, yet this could not secure him 
 from distempers, which will soon make even the strong men to bow 
 themselves. Though David was a good man, yet neither could his goodness 
 keep him in health. <I>Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</I> 
 Let this help to reconcile us to pain and sickness, that it has been 
 the lot of some of the best saints, and that we are directed and 
 encouraged by their example to show before God our trouble in that 
 case, who <I>is for the body,</I> and takes cognizance of its ailments.

 2. He complains of inward trouble: <I>My soul is also sorely vexed;</I> 
 and that is much more grievous than the vexation of the bones. <I>The 
 spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity,</I> if that be in good 
 plight; but, if that be wounded, the grievance is intolerable. David's 
 sickness brought his sin to his remembrance, and he looked upon it as a 
 token of God's displeasure against him; that was the vexation of his 
 soul; that made him cry, <I>I am weak, heal me.</I> It is a sad thing 
 for a man to have his bones and his soul vexed at the same time; but 
 this has been sometimes the lot of God's own people: nay, and this 
 completed his complicated trouble, that it was continued upon him a 
 great while, which is here intimated in that expostulation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>Thou, O Lord! how long?</I> To the living God we must, at such a
 time, address ourselves, who is the only physician both of body and 
 mind, and not to the Assyrians, not to the god of Ekron.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The impression which his troubles made upon him. They lay very 
 heavily; he <I>groaned till he was weary,</I> wept till he <I>made his 
 bed to swim,</I> and <I>watered his couch</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 wept till he had almost wept his eyes out

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>My eye is consumed because of grief.</I> David had more courage and
 consideration than to mourn thus for any outward affliction; but, when 
 sin sat heavily upon his conscience and he was made to possess his 
 iniquities, when his soul was wounded with the sense of God's wrath and 
 his withdrawings from him, then he thus grieves and mourns in secret, 
 and even his soul refuses to be comforted. This not only kept his eyes 
 waking, but kept his eyes weeping. Note,

 1. It has often been the lot of the best of men to be men of sorrows;
 our Lord Jesus himself was so. Our way lies through a vale of tears, 
 and we must accommodate ourselves to the temper of the climate. 

 2. It well becomes the greatest spirits to be tender, and to relent, 
 under the tokens of God's displeasure. David, who could face Goliath
 himself and many another threatening enemy with an undaunted bravery, 
 yet melts into tears at the remembrance of sin and under the 
 apprehensions of divine wrath; and it was no diminution at all to his 
 character to do so. 

 3. True penitents weep in their retirements. The Pharisees disguised
 their faces, that they might <I>appear unto men to mourn;</I> but David 
 mourned in the night upon the bed where he lay communing with his own 
 heart, and no eye was a witness to his grief, but the eye of him who is 
 all eye. Peter went out, covered his face, and wept. 

 4. Sorrow for sin ought to be great sorrow; so David's was; he wept so
 bitterly, so abundantly, that he watered his couch. 

 5. The triumphs of wicked men in the sorrows of the saints add very
 much to their grief. David's eye waxed old because of his enemies, who
 rejoiced in his afflictions and put bad constructions upon his tears.
 In this great sorrow David was a type of Christ, who often wept, and 
 who cried out, <I>My soul is exceedingly sorrowful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The petitions which he offers up to God in this sorrowful and 
 distressed state. 

 1. That which he dreads as the greatest evil is the anger of God. This
 was the wormwood and the gall in the affliction and the misery; it was 
 the infusion of this that made it indeed a bitter cup; and therefore he 
 prays 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>O Lord! rebuke me not in thy anger,</I> though I have deserved it,
 <I>neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</I> He does not pray, 
 "Lord, rebuke me not; Lord, chasten me not;" for, <I>as many as God 
 loves he rebukes and chastens, as a father the son in whom he 
 delights.</I> He can bear the rebuke and chastening well enough if God, 
 at the same time, lift up the light of his countenance upon him and by 
 his Spirit make him to hear the joy and gladness of his 
 loving-kindness; the affliction of his body will be tolerable if he 
 have but comfort in his soul. No matter though sickness make his bones 
 ache, if God's wrath do not make his heart ache; therefore his prayer 
 is, "<I>Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath;</I> let me not lie under the 
 impressions of that, for that will sink me." Herein David was a type of 
 Christ, whose sorest complaint, in his sufferings, was of the trouble 
 of his soul and of the suspension of his Father's smiles. He never so 
 much as whispered a complaint of the rage of his enemies--"Why do they 
 crucify me?" or the unkindness of his friends--"Why do they desert me?" 
 But he <I>cried with a loud voice, My God, my God, why hast thou 
 forsaken me?</I> Let us thus deprecate the wrath of God more than any 
 outward trouble whatsoever and always beware of treasuring up wrath 
 against a day of affliction.

 2. That which he desires as the greatest good, and which would be to 
 him the restoration of all good, is the favour and friendship of God. 
 He prays,

 (1.) That God would pity him and look upon him with compassion. He 
 thinks himself very miserable, and misery is the proper object of 
 mercy. Hence he prays, "<I>Have mercy upon me, O Lord!</I> in wrath 
 remember mercy, and deal not with me in strict justice." 

 (2.) That God would pardon his sins; for that is the proper act of 
 mercy, and is often chiefly intended in that petition, <I>Have mercy 
 upon me.</I> 

 (3.) That God would put forth his power for his relief: "<I>Lord, heal 
 me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 <I>save me</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 speak the word, and I shall be whole, and all will be well."

 (4.) That he would be at peace with him: "<I>Return, O Lord!</I> 
 receive me into thy favour again, and be reconciled to me. Thou hast
 seemed to depart from me and neglect me, nay, to set thyself at a 
 distance, as one angry; but now, Lord, return and show thyself nigh to 
 me." 

 (5.) That he would especially preserve the inward man and the interests 
 of that, whatever might become of the body: "<I>O Lord! deliver my
 soul</I> from sinning, from sinking, from perishing for ever." It is an 
 unspeakable privilege that we have a God to go to in our afflictions, 
 and it is our duty to go to him, and thus to wrestle with him, and we 
 shall not seek in vain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The pleas with which he enforces his petitions, not to move God (he 
 knows our cause and the true merits of it better than we can state 
 them), but to move himself. 

 1. He pleads God's mercy; and thence we take some of our best
 encouragements in prayer: <I>Save me, for thy mercies' sake.</I> 

 3. He pleads God's glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>For in death there is no remembrance of thee.</I> Lord, if thou
 deliver me and comfort me, I will not only give thee thanks for my 
 deliverance, and stir up others to join with me in these thanksgivings, 
 but I will spend the new life thou shalt entrust me with in thy service 
 and to thy glory, and all the remainder of my days I will preserve a 
 grateful remembrance of thy favours to me, and be quickened thereby in 
 all instances of service to thee; but, if I die, I shall be cut short 
 of that opportunity of honouring thee and doing good to others, for 
 <I>in the grave who will give the thanks?</I>" Not but that separate 
 souls live and act, and the souls of the faithful joyfully remember God 
 and give thanks to him. But,

 (1.) In the second death (which perhaps David, being now troubled in 
 soul under the wrath of God, had some dreadful apprehensions of) there 
 is no pleasing remembrance of God; devils and damned spirits blaspheme 
 him and do not praise him. "Lord, let me not lie always under this 
 wrath, for that is <I>sheol,</I> it is <I>hell</I> itself, and lays me 
 under an everlasting disability to praise thee." Those that sincerely 
 seek God's glory, and desire and delight to praise him, may pray in 
 faith, "Lord, send me not to that dreadful place, where there is no 
 devout remembrance of thee, nor are any thanks given to thee." 

 (2.) Even the death of the body puts an end to our opportunity and 
 capacity of glorifying God in this world, and serving the interests of 
 his kingdom among men by opposing the powers of darkness and bringing 
 many on this earth to know God and devote themselves to him. Some have 
 maintained that the joys of the saints in heaven are more desirable, 
 infinitely more so, than the comforts of saints on earth; yet the 
 services of saints on earth, especially such eminent ones as David was, 
 are more laudable, and redound more to the glory of the divine grace, 
 than the services of the saints in heaven, who are not employed in 
 maintaining the war against sin and Satan, nor in edifying the body of 
 Christ. Courtiers in the royal presence are most happy, but soldiers in 
 the field are more useful; and therefore we may, with good reason, pray 
 that if it be the will of God, and he has any further work for us or 
 our friends to do in this world, he will yet spare us, or them, to 
 serve him. To depart and be with Christ is most happy for the saints 
 themselves; but for them to abide in the flesh is more profitable for 
 the church. This David had an eye to when he pleaded this, <I>In the
 grave who shall give thee thanks?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:9,88:10,115:17,Isa+38:18">Ps. xxx. 9; 
 lxxxviii. 10; cxv. 17; Isa. xxxviii. 18</A>.

 And this Christ had an eye to when he said, <I>I pray not that thou
 shouldst take them out of the world.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We should sing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:1-7">these verses</A>

 with a deep sense of the terrors of God's wrath, which we should
 therefore dread and deprecate above any thing; and with thankfulness if 
 this be not our condition, and compassion to those who are thus 
 afflicted: if we be thus troubled, let it comfort us that our case is 
 not without precedent, nor, if we humble ourselves and pray, as David 
 did, shall it be long without redress.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 heard the voice of my weeping.
 &nbsp; 9  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath heard my supplication; the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will receive my
 prayer.
 &nbsp; 10  Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them
 return <I>and</I> be ashamed suddenly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What a sudden change is here for the better! He that was groaning, and 
 weeping, and giving up all for gone 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>),

 here looks and speaks very pleasantly. Having made his requests known
 to God, and lodged his case with him, he is very confident the issue 
 will be good and his sorrow is turned into joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He distinguishes himself from the wicked and ungodly, and fortifies 
 himself against their insults 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.</I> When he was in the
 depth of his distress,

 1. He was afraid that God's wrath against him would give him his
 portion with the workers of iniquity; but now that this cloud of 
 melancholy had blown over he was assured that his soul would not be 
 gathered with sinners, for they are not his people. He began to suspect 
 himself to be one of them because of the heavy pressures of God's wrath 
 upon him; but now that all his fears were silenced he bade them depart, 
 knowing that his lot was among the chosen. 

 2. The workers of iniquity had teased him, and taunted him, and asked 
 him, "Where is thy God?" triumphing in his despondency and despair; but 
 now he had wherewith to answer those that reproached him, for God, who 
 was about to return in mercy to him, had now comforted his spirit and 
 would shortly complete his deliverance. 

 3. Perhaps they had tempted him to do as they did, to quit his religion
 and betake himself for ease to the pleasures of sin. But now,
 "<I>depart from me;</I> I will never lend an ear to your counsel; you 
 would have had me to curse God and die, but I will bless him and live." 
 This good use we should make of God's mercies to us, we should thereby 
 have our resolution strengthened never to have any thing more to do 
 with sin and sinners. David was a king, and he takes this occasion to 
 renew his purpose of using his power for the suppression of sin and the 
 reformation of manners,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:4,101:3">Ps. lxxv. 4; ci. 3</A>.

 When God has done great things for us, this should put us upon studying
 what we shall do for him. Our Lord Jesus seems to borrow these words 
 from the mouth of his father David, when, having all judgment committed 
 to him, he shall say, <I>Depart from me, all you workers of 
 iniquity</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:27">Luke xiii. 27</A>),

 and so teaches us to say so now, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:115">Ps. cxix. 115</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He assures himself that God was, and would be, propitious to him, 
 notwithstanding the present intimations of wrath which he was under. 

 1. He is confident of a gracious answer to this prayer which he is now
 making. While he is yet speaking, he is aware that God hears (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:24,Da+9:20">Isa. lxv. 24, Dan. ix. 20</A>),

 and therefore speaks of it as a thing done, and repeats it with an air
 of triumph, "<I>The Lord hath heard</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 "<I>The Lord hath heard.</I>" By the workings of God's grace upon his
 heart he knew his prayer was graciously accepted, and therefore did not 
 doubt but it would in due time be effectually answered. His tears had a 
 voice, a loud voice, in the ears of the God of mercy: <I>The Lord has 
 heard the voice of my weeping.</I> Silent tears are not speechless 
 ones. His prayers were cries to God: "<I>The Lord has heard the voice 
 of my supplication,</I> has put his <I>Fiat--Let it be done,</I> to my 
 petitions, and so it will appear shortly."

 2. Thence he infers the like favourable audience of all his other 
 prayers: "He <I>has heard the voice of my supplication,</I> and 
 therefore he <I>will receive my prayer;</I> for he gives, and does not 
 upbraid with former grants."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He either prays for the conversion or predicts the destruction of 
 his enemies and persecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 1. It may very well be taken as a prayer for their conversion: "Let
 them all be ashamed of the opposition they have given me and the 
 censures they have passed upon me. Let them be (as all true penitents 
 are) vexed at themselves for their own folly; let them return to a 
 better temper and disposition of mind, and let them be ashamed of what 
 they have done against me and take shame to themselves." 

 2. If they be not converted, it is a prediction of their confusion and 
 ruin. <I>They shall be ashamed and sorely vexed</I> (so it maybe read), 
 and that justly. They rejoiced that David was vexed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>),

 and therefore, as usually happens, the evil returns upon themselves;
 they also shall be sorely vexed. Those that will not give glory to God 
 shall have their faces filled with everlasting shame.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this, and praying over it, we must give glory to God, as a 
 God ready to hear prayer, must own his goodness to us in hearing our
 prayers, and must encourage ourselves to wait upon him and to trust in 
 him in the greatest straits and difficulties.</P>
