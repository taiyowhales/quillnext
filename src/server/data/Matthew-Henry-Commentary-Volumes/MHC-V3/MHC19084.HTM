 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Though David's name be not in the title of this psalm, yet we have
 reason to think he was the penman of it, because it breathes so much of
 his excellent spirit and is so much like the sixty-third psalm which
 was penned by him; it is supposed that David penned this psalm when he
 was forced by Absalom's rebellion to quit his city, which he lamented
 his absence from, not so much because it was the royal city as because
 it was the holy city, witness this psalm, which contains the pious
 breathings of a gracious soul after God and communion with him. Though
 it be not entitled, yet it may fitly be looked upon as a psalm or song
 for the sabbath day, the day of our solemn assemblies. The psalmist
 here with great devotion expresses his affection,

 I. To the ordinances of God; his value for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:1">ver. 1</A>),

 his desire towards them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>),

 his conviction of the happiness of those that did enjoy them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>),

 and his placing his own happiness so very much in the enjoyment of
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:10">ver. 10</A>.

 II. To the God of the ordinances; his desire towards him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:8,9">ver.  8, 9</A>),

 his faith in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:11">ver. 11</A>),

 and his conviction of the happiness of those that put their confidence
 in him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:12">ver. 12</A>.

 In singing this psalm we should have the same devout affections working 
 towards God that David had, and then the singing of it will be very 
 pleasant.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician upon Gittith. A psalm for the sons of Korah.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  How amiable <I>are</I> thy tabernacles, O
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts!
 &nbsp; 2  My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
 &nbsp; 3  Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest
 for herself, where she may lay her young, <I>even</I> thine altars, O
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of hosts, my King, and my God.
 &nbsp; 4  Blessed <I>are</I> they that dwell in thy house: they will be
 still praising thee. Selah.
 &nbsp; 5  Blessed <I>is</I> the man whose strength <I>is</I> in thee; in whose
 heart <I>are</I> the ways <I>of them.</I>
 &nbsp; 6  <I>Who</I> passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the
 rain also filleth the pools.
 &nbsp; 7  They go from strength to strength, <I>every one of them</I> in
 Zion appeareth before God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist here, being by force restrained from waiting upon God in 
 public ordinances, by the want of them is brought under a more sensible 
 conviction than ever of the worth of them.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The wonderful beauty he saw in holy institutions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!</I> Some think 
 that he here calls God the <I>Lord of hosts</I> (that is, in a special 
 manner of the angels, the heavenly hosts) because of the presence of 
 the angels in God's sanctuary; they attended the Shechinah, and were 
 (as some think) signified by the cherubim. God is the Lord of these 
 hosts, and his the tabernacle is: it is spoken of as more than one 
 (<I>thy tabernacles</I>) because there were several courts in which the 
 people attended, and because the tabernacle itself consisted of a holy 
 place and a most holy. How amiable are these! How lovely is the 
 sanctuary in the eyes of all that are truly sanctified! Gracious souls 
 see a wonderful, an inexpressible, beauty in holiness, and in holy 
 work. A tabernacle was a mean habitation, but the disadvantage of 
 external circumstances makes holy ordinances not at all the less 
 amiable; for the beauty of holiness is spiritual, and their glory is 
 within.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The longing desire he had to return to the enjoyment of public 
 ordinances, or rather of God in them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It was an entire desire; body, soul, and spirit concurred in it. He was 
 not conscious to himself of any rising thought to the contrary. It was 
 an intense desire; it was like the desire of the ambitious, or 
 covetous, or voluptuous. He longed, he fainted, he cried out, 
 importunate to be restored to his place in God's courts, and almost 
 impatient of delay. Yet it was not so much the courts of the Lord that 
 he coveted, but he cried out, in prayer, <I>for the living God</I> 
 himself. O that I might know him, and be again taken into communion 
 with him!

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:3">1 John i. 3</A>.

 Ordinances are empty things if we meet not with God in the
 ordinances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His grudging the happiness of the little birds that made their 
 nests in the buildings that were adjoining to God's altars, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This is an elegant and surprising expression of his affection to God's
 altars: <I>The sparrow has found a house and the swallow a nest for 
 herself.</I> These little birds, by the instinct and direction of 
 nature, provide habitations for themselves in houses, as other birds do 
 in the woods, both for their own repose and in which to lay their 
 young; some such David supposes there were in the buildings about the 
 courts of God's house, and wishes himself with them. He would rather 
 live in a bird's nest nigh God's altars than in a palace at a distance 
 from them. He sometimes wished for <I>the wings of a dove,</I> on which 
 to <I>fly into the wilderness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:6">Ps. lv. 6</A>);

 here for the wings of a sparrow, that he might fly undiscovered into
 God's courts; and, though to <I>watch as a sparrow alone upon the 
 house-top</I> is the description of a very melancholy state and spirit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:7">Ps.  cii. 7</A>),

 yet David would be glad to take it for his lot, provided he might be
 near God's altars. It is better to be serving God in solitude than 
 serving sin with a multitude. The word for a sparrow signifies any 
 little bird, and (if I may offer a conjecture) perhaps when, in David's 
 time, music was introduced so much into the sacred service, both vocal 
 and instrumental, to complete the harmony they had singing-birds in 
 cages hung about the courts of the tabernacle (for we find the singing 
 of birds taken notice of to the glory of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:12">Ps. civ. 12</A>),

 and David envies the happiness of these, and would gladly change places
 with them. Observe, David envies the happiness not of those birds that 
 flew over the altars, and had only a transient view of God's courts, 
 but of those that had nests for themselves there. David will not think 
 it enough to sojourn in God's house <I>as a way-faring man that turns 
 aside to tarry for a night;</I> but let this be his rest, his home; 
 here he will dwell. And he takes notice that these birds not only have 
 nests for themselves there, but that there they lay their young; for 
 those who have a place in God's courts themselves cannot but desire 
 that their children also may have in God's house, and within his walls, 
 a place and a name, that they may <I>feed their kids beside the 
 shepherds' tents.</I> Some give another sense of this verse: "Lord, by 
 thy providence thou hast furnished the birds with nests and 
 resting-places, agreeable to their nature, and to them they have free 
 recourse; but thy altar, which is my nest, my resting-place, which I am 
 as desirous of as ever the wandering bird was of her nest, I cannot 
 have access to. Lord, wilt thou provide better for thy birds than for 
 thy babes? <I>As a bird that wanders from her nest</I> so am I, now 
 that I wander from the place of God's altars, for that is my place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:8">Prov. xxvii. 8</A>);

 I shall never be easy till I return to my place again." Note, Those 
 whose souls are at home, at rest, in God, cannot but desire a 
 settlement near his ordinances.  There were two altars, one for 
 sacrifice, the other for incense, and David, in his desire of a place 
 in God's courts, has an eye to both, as we also must, in all our 
 attendance on God, have an eye both to the satisfaction and to the 
 intercession of Christ.  And, <I>lastly,</I> Observe how he eyes God in 
 this address: Thou art the <I>Lord of hosts, my King and my God.</I> 
 Where should a poor distressed subject seek for protection but with his 
 king? <I>And should not a people seek unto their God?</I> My King, my 
 God, is Lord of hosts; by him and his altars let me live and die.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His acknowledgment of the happiness both of the ministers and of 
 the people that had liberty of attendance on God's altars: "<I>Blessed 
 are they.</I> O when shall I return to the enjoyment of that 
 blessedness?" 

 1. Blessed are the ministers, the priests and Levites, who have their
 residence about the tabernacle and are in their courses employed in the 
 service of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Blessed are those that dwell in thy house,</I> that are at home 
 there, and whose business lies there. He is so far from pitying them, 
 as confined to a constant attendance and obliged to perpetual 
 seriousness, that he would sooner envy them than the greatest princes 
 in the world. There are those that bless the covetous, but he blesses 
 the religious. <I>Blessed are those that dwell in thy house</I> (not 
 because they have good wages, a part of every sacrifice for themselves, 
 which would enable them to keep a good table, but because they have 
 good work): <I>They will be still praising thee;</I> and, if there be a 
 heaven upon earth, it is in praising God, in continually praising him. 
 Apply this to his house above; blessed are those that dwell there, 
 angels and glorified saints, for they <I>rest not day nor night from 
 praising God.</I> Let us therefore spend as much of our time as may be 
 in that blessed work in which we hope to spend a joyful eternity. 

 2.  Blessed are the people, the inhabitants of the country, who, though 
 they do not constantly dwell in God's house as the priests do, yet have 
 liberty of access to it at the times appointed for their solemn feasts, 
 the three great feasts, at which all the males were obliged to give 
 their attendance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+16:16">Deut. xvi. 16</A>.

 David was so far from reckoning this an imposition, and a hardship put
 upon them, that he envies the happiness of those who might thus attend, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.

 Those whom he pronounces blessed are here described. 

 (1.) They are such as act in religion from a rooted principle of 
 dependence upon God and devotedness to him: <I>Blessed is the man whose 
 strength is in thee,</I> who makes thee his strength and strongly stays 
 himself upon thee, who makes thy name his strong tower into which he 
 runs for safety,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:10">Prov. xviii. 10</A>.

 <I>Happy is the man whose hope is in the Lord his God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:4,146:5">Ps. xl. 4; cxlvi. 5</A>.

 Those are truly happy who go forth, and go on, in the exercises of
 religion, not in their own strength (for then the work is sure to 
 miscarry), but in the strength of the grace of Jesus Christ, from whom 
 all our sufficiency is. David wished to return to God's tabernacles 
 again, that there he might strengthen himself in the Lord his God for 
 service and suffering. 

 (2.) They are such as have a love for holy ordinances: <I>In whose 
 heart are the ways of them,</I> that is, who, having placed their 
 happiness in God as their end, rejoice in all the ways that lead to 
 him, all those means by which their graces are strengthened and their 
 communion with him kept up.  They not only walk in these ways, but they 
 have them in their hearts, they lay them near their hearts; no care or 
 concern, no pleasure or delight, lies nearer than this. Note, Those who 
 have the new Jerusalem in their eye must have the ways that lead to it 
 in their heart, must mind them, their eyes must look straight forward 
 in them, must ponder the paths of them, must keep close to them, and be 
 afraid of turning aside to the right hand or to the left. If we make 
 God's promise our strength, we must make God's word our rule, and walk 
 by it.  

 (3.) They are such as will break through difficulties and 
 discouragements in waiting upon God in holy ordinances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 When they come up out of the country to worship at the feasts their way 
 lies through many a dry and sandy valley (so some), in which they are 
 ready to perish for thirst; but, to guard against that inconvenience, 
 they dig little pits to receive and keep the rain-water, which is ready 
 to them and others for their refreshment. When they make the pools the 
 ram of heaven fills them. If we be ready to receive the grace of God, 
 that grace shall not be wanting to us, but shall be sufficient for us 
 at all times. Their way lay through many a weeping valley, so Baca 
 signifies, that is (as others understand it), many watery valleys, 
 which in wet weather, when <I>the rain filled the pools,</I> either 
 through the rising of the waters or through the dirtiness of the way 
 were impassable; but, by draining and trenching them, they made a road 
 through them for the benefit of those who went up to Jerusalem. Care 
 should be taken to keep those roads in repair that lead to church, as 
 well as those that lead to market.  But all this is intended to show,

 [1.] That they had a good will to the journey. When they were to attend 
 the solemn feasts at Jerusalem, they would not be kept back by bad 
 weather, or bad ways, nor make those an excuse for staying at home.  
 Difficulties in the way of duty are designed to try our resolution; and 
 <I>he that observes the wind shall not sow.</I> 

 [2.] That they made the best of the way to Zion, contrived and took 
 pains to mend it where it was bad, and bore, as well as they could, the 
 inconveniences that could not be removed.  Our way to heaven lies 
 through a valley of Baca, but even that may be made a well if we make a 
 due improvement of the comforts God has provided for the pilgrims to 
 the heavenly city.

 (4.) They are such as are still pressing forward till they come to 
 their journey's end at length, and do not take up short of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):
 
 <I>They go from strength to strength;</I> their company increases by 
 the accession of more out of every town they pass through, till they 
 become very numerous. Those that were near staid till those that were 
 further off called on them, saying, <I>Come, and let us go to the house 
 of the Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:1,2">Ps. cxxii. 1, 2</A>),

 that they might go together in a body, in token of their mutual love.
 Or the particular persons, instead of being fatigued with the 
 tediousness of their journey and the difficulties they met with, the 
 nearer they came to Jerusalem the more lively and cheerful they were, 
 and so went on <I>stronger and stronger,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+17:9">Job xvii. 9</A>.

 Thus it is promised that those that <I>wait on the Lord shall renew
 their strength,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:31">Isa. xl. 31</A>.

 Even where they are weak, there they are strong. They go <I>from virtue 
 to virtue</I> (so some); it is the same word that is used for the 
 virtuous woman. Those that press forward in their Christian course 
 shall find God adding grace to their graces,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:16">John i. 16</A>.

 They shall be changed from glory to glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:18">2 Cor. iii. 18</A>),

 from one degree of glorious grace to another, till, at length, <I>every
 one of them appears before God in Zion,</I> to give glory to him and 
 receive blessings from him. Note, Those who grow in grace shall, at 
 last, be perfect in glory. The Chaldee reads it, <I>They go from the 
 house of the sanctuary to the house of doctrine; and the pains which 
 they have taken about the law shall appear before God, whose majesty 
 dwells in Zion.</I> We must go from one duty to another, from prayer to 
 the word, from practising what we have learned to learn more; and, if 
 we do this, the benefit of it will appear, to God's glory and our own 
 everlasting comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The psalmist prays for audience and acceptance with God, not 
 mentioning particularly what he desired God would do for him. He needed 
 to say no more when he had professed such an affectionate esteem for 
 the ordinances of God, which now he was restrained and banished from.  
 All his desire was, in that profession, plainly before God, and his 
 longing, his groaning, was not hidden from him; therefore he prays 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>)

 only that God would hear his prayer and give ear, that he would behold 
 his condition, behold his good affection, and look upon his face, which 
 way it was set, and how his countenance discovered the longing desire 
 he had towards God's courts. He calls himself (as many think) <I>God's 
 anointed,</I> for David was anointed by him and anointed for him. In 
 this petition, 

 1. He has an eye to God under several of his glorious titles--as <I>the
 Lord God of hosts,</I> who has all the creatures at his command, and 
 therefore has all power both in heaven and in earth,--as the <I>God of 
 Jacob,</I> a God in covenant with his own people, a God who never said 
 to the praying seed of Jacob, <I>Seek you me in vain,</I>--and as 
 <I>God our shield,</I> who takes his people under his special 
 protection, pursuant to his covenant with Abraham their father. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:1">Gen. xv. 1</A>,

 <I>Fear not, Abraham, I am thy shield.</I> When David could not be
 hidden in the secret of God's tabernacle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:5">Ps. xxvii. 5</A>),

 being at a distance from it, yet he hoped to find God his shield ready
 to him wherever he was. 

 2. He has an eye to the Mediator; for of him I rather understand those
 words, <I>Look upon the face of thy Messiah,</I> thy anointed one, for 
 of his anointing David spoke,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:7">Ps. xlv. 7</A>.

 In all our addresses to God we must desire that he would look upon the
 face of Christ, accept us for his sake, and be well-pleased with us in 
 him. We must look with an eye of faith, and then God will with an eye 
 of favour look <I>upon the face of the anointed,</I> who does show his 
 face when we without him dare not show ours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He pleads his love to God's ordinances and his dependence upon God 
 himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God's courts were his choice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 A very great regard he had for holy ordinances: he valued them above 
 any thing else, and he expresses his value for them,

 (1.) By preferring the time of God's worship before all other time: 
 <I>A day spent in thy courts,</I> in attending on the services of 
 religion, wholly abstracted from all secular affairs, <I>is better than 
 a thousand,</I> not than a thousand in thy courts, but any where else 
 in this world, though in the midst of all the delights of the children 
 of men. Better than a thousand, he does not say <I>days,</I> you may 
 supply it with years, with ages, if you will, and yet David will set 
 his hand to it. "A day in thy courts, a sabbath day, a holy day, a 
 feast-day, though but one day, would be very welcome to me; nay" (as 
 some of the rabbin paraphrase it), "though I were to die for it the 
 next day, yet that would be more sweet than years spent in the business 
 and pleasure of this world. One of these days shall with its pleasure 
 <I>chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight,</I> to shame, 
 as not worthy to be compared." 

 (2.) By preferring the place of worship before any other place: <I>I 
 would rather be a door-keeper,</I> rather be in the meanest place and 
 office, <I>in the house of my God, than dwell</I> in state, as master, 
 <I>in the tents of wickedness.</I> Observe, He calls even the 
 tabernacle a house, for the presence of God in it made even those 
 curtains more stately than a palace and more strong than a castle. It 
 is the house of my God; the covenant-interest he had in God as his God 
 was the sweet string on which he loved dearly to be harping; those, and 
 those only, who can, upon good ground, call God theirs, delight in the 
 courts of his house.  I would rather be a porter in God's house than a 
 prince in those tents where wickedness reigns, rather lie at the 
 threshold (so the word is); that was the beggar's place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+3:2">Acts iii. 2</A>):

 "no matter" (says David), "let that be my place rather than none." The
 Pharisees loved synagogues well enough, provided they might have the 
 uppermost seats there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:6">Matt. xxiii. 6</A>),

 that they might make a figure. Holy David is not solicitous about that; 
 if he may but be admitted to the threshold, he will say, <I>Master, it 
 is good to be here.</I> Some read it, <I>I would rather be fixed to a 
 post in the house of my God than live at liberty in the tents of 
 wickedness,</I> alluding to the law concerning servants, who, if they 
 would not go out free, were to have their ear bored to the door-post, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:5,6">Exod. xxi. 5, 6</A>.

 David loved his master and loved his work so well that he desired to be
 tied to this service for ever, to be more free to it, but never to go 
 out free from it, preferring bonds to duty far before the greatest 
 liberty to sin. Such a superlative delight have holy hearts in holy 
 duties; no satisfaction in their account comparable to that in 
 communion with God.</P>

 2. God himself was his hope, and joy, and all. <I>Therefore</I> he 
 loved the house of his God, because his expectation was from his God, 
 and there he used to communicate himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 See, 

 (1.) What God is, and will be, to his people: <I>The Lord God is a sun 
 and shield.</I> We are here in darkness, but, if God be our God, he 
 will be to us a sun, to enlighten and enliven us, to guide and direct 
 us. We are here in danger, but he will be to us a shield to secure us 
 from the fiery darts that fly thickly about us. <I>With his favour he 
 will compass us as with a shield.</I> Let us therefore always <I>walk 
 in the light of the Lord,</I> and never throw ourselves out of his 
 protection, and we shall find him a sun to supply us with all good and 
 a shield to shelter us from all evil. 

 (2.) What he does, and will, bestow upon them: <I>The Lord will give 
 grace and glory.</I> Grace signifies both the good-will of God towards 
 us and the good work of God in us; glory signifies both the honour 
 which he now puts upon us, in giving us the adoption of sons, and that 
 which he has prepared for us in the inheritance of sons.  God will give 
 them grace in this world as a preparation for glory, and glory in the 
 other world as the perfection of grace; both are God's gift, his free 
 gift. And as, on the one hand, wherever God gives grace he will give 
 glory (for grace is glory begun, and is an earnest of it), so, on the 
 other hand, he will give glory hereafter to none to whom he does not 
 give grace now, or who receive his grace in vain. And if God will give 
 grace and glory, which are the two great things that concur to make us 
 happy in both worlds, we may be sure that <I>no good thing will be 
 withheld from those that walk uprightly.</I> It is the character of all 
 good people that they walk uprightly, that they worship God in spirit 
 and in truth, and have their conversation in the world in simplicity 
 and godly sincerity; and such may be sure that God will withhold <I>no 
 good thing from them,</I> that is requisite to their comfortable 
 passage through this world. Make sure grace and glory, and <I>other 
 things shall be added.</I> This is a comprehensive promise, and is such 
 an assurance of the present comfort of the saints that, whatever they 
 desire, and think they need, they may be sure that either Infinite 
 Wisdom sees it is not good for them or Infinite Goodness will give it 
 to them in due time. Let it be our care to walk uprightly, and then let 
 us trust God to give us every thing that is good for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> He pronounces those blessed who put their confidence in 
 God, as he did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Those are blessed who have the liberty of ordinances and the privileges 
 of God's house. But, though we should be debarred from them, yet we are 
 not therefore debarred from blessedness if we trust in God. If we 
 cannot go to the house of the Lord, we may go by faith to the Lord of 
 the house, and in him we shall be happy and may be easy.</P>
