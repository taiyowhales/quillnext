 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a family-psalm, as divers before were state-poems and 
 church-poems. It is entitled (as we read it) "for Solomon," dedicated 
 to him by his father. He having a house to build, a city to keep, and 
 seed to raise up to his father, David directs him to look up to God, 
 and to depend upon his providence, without which all his wisdom, care, 
 and industry, would not serve. Some take it to have been penned by 
 Solomon himself, and it may as well be read, "a song of Solomon," who 
 wrote a great many; and they compare it with the Ecclesiastes, the 
 scope of both being the same, to show the vanity of worldly care and 
 how necessary it is that we keep in favour with God. On him we must 
 depend, 
 
 I. For wealth,

 II. For heirs to leave it to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.
 
 In singing this psalm we must have our eye up unto God for success in 
 all our undertakings and a blessing upon all our comforts and 
 enjoyments, because every creature is that to us which he makes it to 
 be and no more.</P>

 <P>A song of degrees for Solomon.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Except the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> build the
 house, they labour in vain that build it: except the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> keep
 the city, the watchman waketh <I>but</I> in vain.
 &nbsp; 2  <I>It is</I> vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat
 the bread of sorrows: <I>for</I> so he giveth his beloved sleep.
 &nbsp; 3  Lo, children <I>are</I> a heritage of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: <I>and</I> the fruit
 of the womb <I>is his</I> reward.
 &nbsp; 4  As arrows <I>are</I> in the hand of a mighty man; so <I>are</I>
 children of the youth.
 &nbsp; 5  Happy <I>is</I> the man that hath his quiver full of them: they
 shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in
 the gate.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here taught to have a continual regard to the divine Providence
 in all the concerns of this life. Solomon was cried up for a wise man,
 and would be apt to lean to his own understanding and forecast, and
 therefore his father teaches him to look higher, and to take God along
 with him in his undertakings. He was to be a man of business, and
 therefore David instructed him how to manage his business under the
 direction of his religion. Parents, in teaching their children, should
 suit their exhortations to their condition and occasions. We must have
 an eye to God,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In all the affairs and business of the family, even of the royal 
 family, for kings' houses are no longer safe than while God protects 
 them. We must depend upon God's blessing and not our own contrivance, 
 
 1. For the raising of a family: <I>Except the Lord build the house,</I>
 by his providence and blessing, <I>those labour in vain,</I> though 
 ever so ingenious, <I>that build it.</I> We may understand it of the 
 material house: except the Lord bless the building it is to no purpose 
 for men to build, any more than for the builders of Babel, who 
 attempted in defiance of heaven, or Hiel, who built Jericho under a 
 curse. If the model and design be laid in pride and vanity, or if the 
 foundations be laid in oppression and injustice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:11,12">Hab. ii. 11, 12</A>),

 God certainly does not build there; nay, if God be not acknowledged, we 
 have no reason to expect his blessing, and without his blessing all is 
 nothing. Or, rather, it is to be understood of the making of a family 
 considerable that was mean; men labour to do this by advantageous 
 matches, offices, employments, purchases; but all in vain, unless God 
 build up the family, and <I>raise the poor out of the dust.</I> The 
 best-laid project fails unless God crown it with success. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:4">Mal. i. 4</A>.
 
 2. For the securing of a family or a city (for this is what the 
 psalmist particularly mentions): if the guards of the city cannot 
 secure it without God, much less can the good man of the house save his 
 house from being broken up. <I>Except the Lord keep the city</I> from 
 fire, from enemies, <I>the watchmen,</I> who <I>go about the city,</I> 
 or patrol upon the walls of it, though they neither slumber nor sleep, 
 <I>wake but in vain,</I> for a raging fire may break out, the mischief 
 of which the timeliest discoveries may not be able to prevent. The 
 guards may be slain, or the city betrayed and lost, by a thousand 
 accidents, which the most watchful sentinel or most cautious governor 
 could not obviate. 

 3. For the enriching of a family; this is a work of time and thought,
 but cannot be effected without the favour of Providence any more than 
 that which is the product of one happy turn: "<I>It is vain for you to 
 rise up early and sit up late,</I> and so to deny yourselves your 
 bodily refreshments, in the eager pursuit of the wealth of the world." 
 Usually, those that rise early do not care for sitting up late, nor can 
 those that sit up late easily persuade themselves to rise early; but 
 there are some so hot upon the world that they will do both, will rob 
 their sleep to pay their cares. And they have as little comfort in 
 their meals as in their rest; they <I>eat the bread of sorrows.</I> It 
 is part of our sentence that we eat our bread in the sweat of our face; 
 but those go further: <I>all their days they eat in darkness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:17">Eccl. v. 17</A>.

 They are continually fell of care, which embitters their comforts, and 
 makes their lives a burden to them.  All this is to get money, and all 
 in vain except God prosper them, for <I>riches are</I> not always <I>to 
 men of understanding,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:11">Eccl. ix. 11</A>.

 Those that love God, and are beloved of him, have their minds easy and 
 live very comfortably without this ado. Solomon was called 
 <I>Jedidiah--Beloved of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:25">2 Sam. xii. 25</A>);

 to him the kingdom was promised, and then it was in vain for Absalom to 
 rise up early, to wheedle the people, and for Adonijah to make such a 
 stir, and to say, <I>I will be king.</I> Solomon sits still, and, being 
 <I>beloved of the Lord,</I> to him he gives sleep and the kingdom too. 
 Note, 

 (1.) Inordinate excessive care about the things of this world is a vain 
 and fruitless thing. We weary ourselves for vanity if we have it, and
 often weary ourselves in vain for it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+1:6,9">Hag. i. 6, 9</A>.

 (2.) Bodily sleep is God's gift to his beloved. We owe it to his 
 goodness that our sleep is safe 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:8">Ps. iv. 8</A>),

 that it is sweet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:25,26">Jer. xxxi. 25, 26</A>.

 God gives us sleep as he gives it to his beloved when with it he gives 
 us grace to lie down in his fear (our souls returning to him and 
 reposing in him as our rest), and when we awake to be still with him 
 and to use the refreshment we have by sleep in his service.  <I>He 
 gives his beloved sleep,</I> that is, quietness and contentment of 
 mind, and comfortable enjoyment of what is present and a comfortable 
 expectation of what is to come. Our care must be to <I>keep ourselves 
 in the love of God,</I> and then we may be easy whether we have little 
 or much of this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In the increase of the family. He shows, 

 1. That children are <I>God's gift,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:2"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 If children are withheld it is God that withholds them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:2">Gen. xxx. 2</A>);

 if they are given, it is God that gives them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+33:5">Gen. xxxiii. 5</A>);

 and they are to us what he makes them, comforts or crosses. Solomon 
 multiplied wives, contrary to the law, but we never read of more than 
 one son that he had; for those that desire children as a heritage from 
 the Lord must receive them in the way that he is pleased to give them, 
 by lawful marriage to one wife. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:15">Mal. ii. 15</A>,

 <I>therefore one, that he might seek a seed of God.</I> But <I>they 
 shall commit whoredom and shall not increase. Children are a 
 heritage,</I> and a <I>reward,</I> and are so to be accounted, 
 blessings and not burdens; for he that sends mouths will send meat if 
 we trust in him. Obed-edom had eight sons, for the Lord blessed him 
 because he had entertained the ark, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+26:5">1 Chron. xxvi. 5</A>.

 Children are a heritage for the Lord, as well as from him; they are 
 <I>my children</I> (says God) <I>which thou hast borne unto me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:20">Ezek. xvi. 20</A>);

 and they are most our honour and comfort when they are accounted to him 
 for a generation. 

 2. That they are a good gift, and a great support and defence to a 
 family: <I>As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man,</I> who knows how 
 to use them for his own safety and advantage, so are children of the 
 youth, that is, children born to their parents when they are young, 
 which are the strongest and most healthful children, and are grown up 
 to serve them by the time they need their service; or, rather, children 
 who are themselves young; they are instruments of much good to their 
 parents and families, which may fortify themselves with them against 
 their enemies. The family that has a large stock of children is like a 
 quiver full of arrows, of different sizes we may suppose, but all of 
 use one time or other; children of different capacities and 
 inclinations may be several ways serviceable to the family. He that has 
 a numerous issue may boldly <I>speak with his enemy in the gate</I> in 
 judgment; in battle he needs not fear, having so many good seconds, so 
 zealous, so faithful, and in the vigour of youth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:4,5">1 Sam. ii. 4, 5</A>.

 Observe here, <I>Children of the youth</I> are <I>arrows in the 
 hand,</I> which, with prudence, may be directed aright to the mark, 
 God's glory and the service of their generation; but afterwards, when 
 they have gone abroad into the world, they are arrows out of the hand; 
 it is too late to bend them then. But these arrows in the hand too 
 often prove arrows in the heart, a constant grief to their godly 
 parents, whose gray hairs they bring with sorrow to the grave.</P>
