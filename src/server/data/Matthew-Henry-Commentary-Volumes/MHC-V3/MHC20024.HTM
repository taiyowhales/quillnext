 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be

 Here, 

 1. The caution given is much the same with that which we had before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:17"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 17</A>),

 not to envy sinners, not to think them happy, nor to wish ourselves in
 their condition, though they prosper ever so much in this world, and 
 are ever so merry and ever so secure. "Let not such a thought ever come
 into thy mind, O that I could shake off the restraints of religion and 
 conscience, and take as great a liberty to indulge the sensual 
 appetite, as I see such and such do! No; <I>desire not to be with 
 them,</I> to do as they do and fare as they fare, and to <I>cast in thy 
 lot among</I> them." 

 2. Here is another reason given for this caution: "<I>Be not envious
 against</I> them, not only because their end will be had, but because 
 their way is so,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Do not think with them, <I>for their heart studies destruction</I> to
 others, but it will prove destruction to themselves. Do not speak like 
 them, for <I>their lips talk of their mischief.</I> All they say has an 
 ill tendency, to dishonour God, reproach religion, or wrong their 
 neighbour; but it will be mischief to themselves at last. It is 
 therefore thy wisdom to have nothing to do with them. Nor hast thou any 
 reason to look upon them with envy, but with pity rather, or a just 
 indignation at their wicked practices."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it
 is established:
 &nbsp; 4  And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all
 precious and pleasant riches.
 &nbsp; 5  A wise man <I>is</I> strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth
 strength.
 &nbsp; 6  For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude
 of counsellors <I>there is</I> safety.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are tempted to envy those that grow rich, and raise their estates 
 and families, by such unjust courses as our consciences will by no 
 means suffer us to use. But, to set aside that temptation, Solomon here 
 shows that a man, with prudent management, may raise his estate and 
 family by lawful and honest means, with a good conscience, and a good 
 name, and the blessing of God upon his industry; and, if the other be 
 raised a little sooner, yet these will last a great deal longer. 

 1.  That which is here recommended to us as having the best influence 
 upon our outward prosperity is <I>wisdom,</I> and <I>understanding,</I> 
 and <I>knowledge;</I> that is, both piety towards God (for that is true 
 wisdom) and prudence in the management of our outward affairs. We must 
 govern ourselves in every thing by the rules of religion first and then 
 of discretion. Some that are truly pious do not thrive in the world, 
 for want of prudence; and some that are prudent enough, yet do not 
 prosper, because they lean to their own understanding and do not 
 acknowledge God in their ways; therefore both must go together to 
 complete a wise man. 

 2. That which is here set before us as the advantage of true wisdom is
 that it will make men's outward affairs prosperous and successful.

 (1.) it will <I>build a house and establish it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Men may by unrighteous practices build their houses, but they cannot
 establish them, for the foundation is rotten 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:9,10">Hab. ii. 9, 10</A>);

 whereas what is honestly got will wear like steel and be an inheritance
 to children's children.

 (2.) It will enrich a house and furnish it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Those that manage their affairs with wisdom and equity, that are
 diligent in the use of lawful means for increasing what they have that 
 spare from luxury and spend in charity, are in a fair way to have their 
 shops, their warehouses, their <I>chambers, filled with all precious 
 and pleasant riches--precious</I> because got by honest labour, and 
 <I>the substance of a diligent man is precious--pleasant</I> because 
 enjoyed with holy cheerfulness. Some think this is to be understood 
 chiefly of spiritual riches. <I>By knowledge the chambers</I> of the 
 soul are filled with the graces and comforts of the Spirit, those 
 <I>precious and pleasant riches;</I> for the Spirit, by enlightening 
 the understanding, performs all his other operations on the soul.

 (3.) It will fortify a house and turn it into a castle: <I>Wisdom is
 better than weapons of war,</I> offensive or defensive. <I>A wise man 
 is in strength,</I> is in a strong-hold, <I>yea, a man of knowledge 
 strengthens might,</I> that is, increases it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 As we grow in knowledge we grow in all grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:18">2 Pet. iii. 18</A>.

 Those that <I>increase in wisdom</I> are <I>strengthened with all
 might,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+1:9,11">Col. i. 9, 11</A>.

 A wise man will compass that by his wisdom which a strong man cannot
 effect by force of arms. The spirit is strengthened both for the 
 spiritual work and the spiritual warfare by true wisdom. 

 (4.) It will govern a house and a kingdom too, and the affairs of both,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Wisdom will erect a college, or council of state. Wisdom will be of
 use,

 [1.] For the managing of the public quarrels, so as not to engage in
 them but for an honest cause and with some probability of success, and, 
 when they are engaged in, to manage them well, and so as to make either 
 an advantageous peace or an honourable retreat: <I>By wise counsel thou 
 shalt make war,</I> which is a thing that may prove of ill consequence 
 if not done by wise counsel. 

 [2.] For the securing of the public peace: <I>In the multitude of
 counsellors there is safety,</I> for one may foresee the danger, and 
 discern the advantages, which another cannot.  In our spiritual 
 conflicts we need wisdom, for our enemy is subtle.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Wisdom <I>is</I> too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in
 the gate.
 &nbsp; 8  He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous
 person.
 &nbsp; 9  The thought of foolishness <I>is</I> sin: and the scorner <I>is</I> an
 abomination to men.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is the description,

 1. Of a weak man: <I>Wisdom is too high</I> for him; he thinks it so, 
 and therefore, despairing to attain it, he will take no pains in the 
 pursuit of it, but sit down content without it. And really it is so; he 
 has not capacity for it, and therefore the advantages he has for 
 getting it are all in vain to him. It is no easy thing to get wisdom; 
 those that have natural parts good enough, yet if they be foolish, that 
 is, if they be slothful and will not take pains, if they be playful and 
 trifling, and given to their pleasures, if they be viciously inclined 
 and keep bad company, it <I>is too high</I> for them; they are not 
 likely to reach it. And, for want of it, they are unfit for the service 
 of their country: They <I>open not their mouth in the gate;</I> they 
 are not admitted into the council or magistracy, or, if they are, they 
 are dumb statues, and stand for cyphers; they say nothing, because they 
 have nothing to say, and they know that if they should offer any thing 
 it would not be heeded, nay, it would be hissed at. Let young men take 
 pains to get wisdom, that they may be qualified for public business, 
 and do it with reputation. 

 2. Of a wicked man, who is not only despised as a fool is, but
 detested. Two sorts of wicked men are so:--

 (1.) Such as are secretly malicious. Though they speak courteously and
 conduct themselves plausibly, they <I>devise to do evil,</I> are 
 contriving to do an ill turn to those they bear a grudge to, or have an 
 envious eye at. He that does so <I>shall be called a mischievous 
 person,</I> or <I>a master of mischief,</I> which perhaps was then a 
 common name of reproach; he shall be branded as an <I>inventor of evil 
 things</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:30">Rom. i. 30</A>),

 or if any mischief be done, he shall be suspected as the author of it,
 or at least accessory to it. This <I>devising evil is the thought of 
 foolishness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 It is made light of, and turned off with a jest, as only a foolish
 thing, but really it <I>is sin,</I> it is exceedingly sinful; you 
 cannot call it by a worse name than to call it <I>sin.</I> It is bad to 
 do evil, but it is worse to devise it; for that has in it the subtlety 
 and poison of the old serpent. But it may be taken more generally. We 
 contract guilt, not only by the act of foolishness, but by the thought 
 of it, though it go no further; the first risings of sin in the heart 
 are sin, offensive to God, and must be repented of or we are undone.  
 Not only malicious, unclean, proud thoughts, but even foolish thoughts, 
 are sinful thoughts. If <I>vain thoughts lodge in the heart,</I> they 
 defile it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+4:14">Jer. iv. 14</A>),

 which is a reason why we should <I>keep our hearts with all
 diligence,</I> and harbour no thoughts there which cannot give a good 
 account of themselves,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:5">Gen. vi. 5</A>.

 (2.) Such as are openly abusive: <I>The scorner,</I> who gives
 ill-language to every body, takes a pleasure in affronting people and 
 reflecting upon them, <I>is an abomination to men;</I> none that have 
 any sense of honour and virtue will care to keep company with him. 
 <I>The seat of the scornful</I> is the <I>pestilential chair</I> (as 
 the LXX. calls it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:1">Ps. i. 1</A>),

 which no wise man will come near, for fear of taking the infection.
 Those that strive to make others odious do but make themselves so.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr24_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  <I>If</I> thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength <I>is</I>
 small.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. In <I>the day of adversity</I> we are apt to <I>faint,</I> to droop
 and be discouraged, to desist from our work, and to despair of relief. 
 Our spirits sink, and then our hands hang down and our knees grow 
 feeble, and we become unfit for anything. And often those that are most 
 cheerful when they are well droop most, and are most dejected, when any 
 thing ails them. 

 2. This is an evidence that our <I>strength is small,</I> and is a
 means of weakening it more. "It is a sign that thou art not a man of 
 any resolution, any firmness of thought, any consideration, any faith 
 (for that is the strength of a soul), if thou canst not bear up under 
 an afflictive change of thy condition." Some are so feeble that they 
 can bear nothing; if a trouble does but <I>touch</I> them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:5">Job iv. 5</A>),
 
 nay, if it does but threaten them, they faint immediately and are ready
 to give up all for gone; and by this means they render themselves unfit 
 to grapple with their trouble and unable to help themselves. <I>Be of 
 good courage</I> therefore, <I>and God shall strengthen thy 
 heart.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 1. A great duty required of us, and that is to appear for the relief of
 oppressed innocency. If we see the lives or livelihoods of any in 
 danger of being taken away unjustly, we ought to bestir ourselves all 
 we can to save them, by disproving the false accusations on which they 
 are condemned and seeking out proofs of their innocency.  Though the 
 persons be not such as we are under any particular obligation to, we 
 must help them, out of a general zeal for justice. If any be set upon 
 by force and violence, and it be in our power to rescue them, we ought 
 to do it. Nay, if we see any through ignorance exposing themselves to 
 danger, or fallen in distress, as travellers upon the road, ships at 
 sea, or any the like, it is our duty, though it be with peril to 
 ourselves, to hasten with help to them and not <I>forbear to deliver 
 them,</I> not to be slack, or remiss, or indifferent, in such a case. 
 
 2. An answer to the excuse that is commonly made for the omission of
 this duty. Thou wilt say, "<I>Behold, we knew it not;</I> we were not 
 aware of the imminency of the danger the person was in; we could not be 
 sure that he was innocent, nor did we know how to prove his innocence, 
 nor which way to do any thing in favour of him, else we would have 
 helped him." Now, 

 (1.) It is easy to make such an excuse as this, sufficient to avoid the
 censures of men, for perhaps they cannot disprove us when we say, <I>We 
 knew it not,</I> or, <I>We forgot;</I> and the temptation to tell a lie 
 for the excusing of a fault is very strong when we know that it is 
 impossible to be disproved, the truth lying wholly in our own breast, 
 as when we say, <I>We thought so and so, and really designed it,</I> 
 which no one is conscious of but ourselves. 

 (2.) It is not so easy with such excuses to evade the judgment of God;
 and to the discovery of that we lie open and by the determination of 
 that we must abide. Now,

 [1.] God <I>ponders the heart and keeps the soul;</I> he keeps an eye
 upon it, observes all the motions of it; its most secret thoughts and 
 intents are all naked and open before him. It is his prerogative to do 
 so, and that in which he glories. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:10">Jer. xvii. 10</A>,

 <I>I the Lord search the heart.</I> He <I>keeps the soul,</I> holds it 
 in life. This is a good reason why we should be tender of the lives of 
 others, and do all we can to preserve them, because our lives have been 
 precious in the sight of God and he has graciously kept them.

 [2.] He knows and considers whether the excuse we make be true or no,
 whether it was because we did not know it or whether the true reason 
 was not because we did not love our neighbour as we ought, but were 
 selfish, and regardless both of God and man. Let this serve to silence 
 all our frivolous pleas, by which we think to stop the mouth of 
 conscience when it charges us with the omission of plain duty: <I>Does 
 not he that ponders the heart consider it?</I> 

 [3.] He will judge us accordingly. As his knowledge cannot be imposed
 upon, so his justice cannot be biassed, but he will <I>render to every 
 man according to his works,</I> not only the commission of evil works, 
 but the omission of good works.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  My son, eat thou honey, because <I>it is</I> good; and the
 honeycomb, <I>which is</I> sweet to thy taste:
 &nbsp; 14  So <I>shall</I> the knowledge of wisdom <I>be</I> unto thy soul: when
 thou hast found <I>it,</I> then there shall be a reward, and thy
 expectation shall not be cut off.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here quickened to the study of wisdom by the consideration both 
 of the pleasure and the profit of it. 

 1. It will be very pleasant. We <I>eat honey because it is sweet to the 
 taste,</I> and upon that account we call it <I>good,</I> especially 
 that which runs first from the <I>honey-comb.</I> Canaan was said to 
 flow with milk and honey, and honey was the common food of the country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:41,42">Luke xxiv. 41, 42</A>),
 
 even for children,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:15">Isa. vii. 15</A>.

 Thus should we feed upon wisdom, and relish the good instructions of
 it. Those that have tasted honey need no further proof that it is 
 sweet, nor can they by any argument be convinced of the contrary; so 
 those that have experienced the power of truth and godliness are 
 abundantly satisfied of the pleasure of both; they have tasted the 
 sweetness of them, and all the atheists in the world with their 
 sophistry, and the profane with their banter, cannot alter their 
 sentiments.

 2. It will be very profitable.  Honey may be <I>sweet to the taste</I>
 and yet not wholesome, but wisdom has a future recompence attending it, 
 as well as a present sweetness in it. "Thou art permitted to <I>eat 
 honey,</I> and the agreeableness of it to thy taste invites thee to it; 
 but thou hast much more reason to relish and digest the precepts <I>of 
 wisdom,</I> for <I>when thou hast found</I> that, <I>there shall be a 
 reward;</I> thou shalt be paid for thy pleasure, while the servants of 
 sin pay dearly for their pains. Wisdom does indeed set thee to work, 
 but <I>there shall be a reward;</I> it does indeed raise great 
 expectations in thee, but as thy labour, so thy hope, shall not be in 
 vain; <I>thy expectation shall not be cut off</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:18"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 18</A>),
 
 nay, it shall be infinitely outdone."</P>

 &nbsp; 16  For a just <I>man</I> falleth seven times, and riseth up again:
 but the wicked shall fall into mischief.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is spoken, not so much by way of counsel to wicked men (they will
 not receive instruction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:9"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 9</A>),

 but rather in defiance of them, for the encouragement of good people
 that are threatened by them. See here,

 1. The designs of the wicked against the righteous, and the success
 they promise themselves in those designs. The plot is laid deeply: They 
 <I>lay wait against the dwelling of the righteous,</I> thinking to 
 charge some iniquity upon it, or compass dome design against it; they 
 lie in wait at the door, to catch him when he stirs out, as David's 
 persecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:1">Ps. lix.</A>

 <I>title.</I> The hope is raised high; they doubt not but to <I>spoil
 his dwelling-place</I> because he is weak and cannot support it, 
 because his condition is low and distressed, and he is almost down 
 already. All this is a fruit of the old enmity in the seed of the 
 serpent against the seed of the woman. <I>The blood-thirsty hate the 
 upright.</I>

 2. The folly and frustration of these designs
 
 (1.) The righteous man, whose ruin was expected, recovers himself. He
 <I>falls seven times</I> into trouble, but, by the blessing of God upon 
 his wisdom and integrity, he <I>rises again,</I> sees through his 
 troubles and sees better times after them. The <I>just man falls,</I> 
 sometimes <I>falls seven times</I> perhaps, into sin, sins of 
 infirmity, through the surprise of temptation; but he <I>rises 
 again</I> by repentance, finds mercy with God, and regains his peace. 

 (2.) <I>The wicked</I> man, who expected to see his ruin and to help it
 forward, is undone. He <I>falls into mischief;</I> his sins and his 
 troubles are his utter destruction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine
 heart be glad when he stumbleth:
 &nbsp; 18  Lest the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> see <I>it,</I> and it displease him, and he turn
 away his wrath from him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. The pleasure we are apt to take in the troubles of an enemy is
 forbidden us. If any have done us an ill turn, or if we bear them 
 ill-will only because they stand in our light or in our way, when any 
 damage comes to them (suppose they fall), or any danger (suppose they 
 stumble), our corrupt hearts are too apt to conceive a secret delight 
 and satisfaction in it--<I>Aha! so would we have it; they are entangled;
 the wilderness has shut them in</I>--or, as Tyrus said concerning
 Jerusalem 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+26:2">Ezek. xxvi. 2</A>)

 <I>I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste.</I> "Men hope in the
 ruin of their enemies or rivals to wreak their revenge or to find their 
 account; but be not thou so inhuman; <I>rejoice not when</I> the worst 
 <I>enemy</I> thou hast <I>falls.</I>" There may be a holy joy in the 
 destruction of God's enemies, as it tends to the glory of God and the 
 welfare of the church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:10">Ps. lviii. 10</A>);
 
 but in the ruin of our enemies, as such, we must by no means rejoice;
 on the contrary, we must weep even with them when they weep (as David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:13,14">Ps. xxxv. 13, 14</A>),

 and that in sincerity, not so much as letting our hearts be secretly
 glad at their calamities.

 2. The provocation which that pleasure gives to God is assigned as the
 reason of that prohibition: <I>The Lord</I> will <I>see it,</I> though 
 it be hidden in the heart only, <I>and it</I> will <I>displease 
 him,</I> as it will displease a prudent father to see one child triumph 
 in the correction of another, which he ought to tremble at, and take 
 warning by, not knowing how soon it may be his own case, he having so 
 often deserved it. Solomon adds an argument <I>ad hominem--addressed to 
 the individual:</I> "Thou canst not do a greater kindness to <I>thy 
 enemy,</I> when he has fallen, than to rejoice in it; for them, to 
 cross thee and vex thee, God will <I>turn his wrath from him;</I> for, 
 as <I>the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God,</I> so the 
 righteousness of God was never intended to gratify the wrath of man, 
 and humour his foolish passions; rather than seem to do that he will

 Here, 

 1. He repeats the caution he had before given against envying the 
 pleasures and successes of wicked man in their wicked ways. This he 
 quotes from his father David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:1">Ps. xxxvii. 1</A>.

 We must not in any case <I>fret</I> ourselves, or make ourselves
 uneasy, whatever God does in his providence how disagreeable soever it 
 is to our sentiments, interests, and expectations, we must acquiesce in 
 it. Even that which grieves us must not <I>fret</I> us; nor must our 
 eye be evil against any because God is good. Are we more wise or just 
 than he? If wicked people prosper, we must not therefore incline to do 
 as they do. 

 2. He gives a reason for this caution, taken from the end of that way
 which wicked man walk in. Envy not their prosperity; for,

 (1.) There is no true happiness in it: <I>There shall be no reward to
 the evil man;</I> his prosperity only serves for his present 
 subsistence; these are all the good things he must ever expect: there 
 is none intended him in the world of retribution. <I>He has his 
 reward,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:2">Matt.  vi. 2</A>.

 He shall have none. Those are not to be envied that have their portion
 in this life and must out-live it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>.

 (2.) There is no continuance in it; their <I>candle</I> shines
 brightly, but it shall presently <I>be put out,</I> and a final period 
 put to all their comforts,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  My son, fear thou the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> and the king: <I>and</I> meddle not

 Note,

 1. Religion and loyalty must go together. As men, it is our duty to
 honour our Creator, to worship and reverence him, and to be always in 
 his fear; as members of a community, incorporated for mutual benefit, 
 it is our duty to be faithful and dutiful to the government God has set 
 over us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:1,2">Rom. xiii. 1, 2</A>.

 Those that are truly religious will be loyal, in conscience towards
 God; the godly in the land will be the <I>quiet in the land;</I> and
 those are not truly loyal, or will be so no longer than is for their 
 interest, that are not religious. How should he be true to his prince 
 that is false to his God? And, if they come in competition, it is an 
 adjudged case, we must <I>obey God rather than men.</I>

 2. Innovations in both are to be dreaded. Have nothing to do, he does
 not say, with those that <I>change,</I> for there may be cause to 
 change for the better, but <I>those that are given to change,</I> that 
 affect change for change-sake, out of a peevish discontent with that 
 which is and a fondness for novelty, or a desire to fish in troubled 
 waters: <I>Meddle not with those that are given to change</I> either in 
 religion or in a civil government; <I>come not into their secret;</I> 
 join not with them in their cabals, nor enter into the mystery of their 
 iniquity. 

 3. Those that are of restless, factious, turbulent spirits, commonly
 pull mischief upon their own heads ere they are aware: <I>Their 
 calamity shall rise suddenly.</I> Though they carry on their designs 
 with the utmost secresy, they will be discovered, and brought to 
 condign punishment, when they little think of it. <I>Who knows</I> the 
 time and manner of <I>the ruin</I> which both God and the king will 
 bring on their contemners, <I>both</I> on them and those that meddle 
 with them?</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  These <I>things</I> also <I>belong</I> to the wise. <I>It is</I> not good
 to have respect of persons in judgment.
 &nbsp; 24  He that saith unto the wicked, Thou <I>art</I> righteous; him
 shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:
 &nbsp; 25  But to them that rebuke <I>him</I> shall be delight, and a good

 Here are lessons for <I>wise</I> men, that is, judges and princes. As 
 subjects must do their duty, and be obedient to magistrates, so 
 magistrates must do their duty in administering justice to their 
 subjects, both in pleas of the crown and causes between party and 
 party. These are lessons for them. 

 1. They must always weigh the merits of a cause, and not be swayed by
 any regard, one way or other, to the parties concerned: <I>It is not 
 good</I> in itself, nor can it ever do well, <I>to have respect of 
 persons in judgment;</I> the consequences of it cannot but be the 
 perverting of justice and doing wrong under colour of law and equity. A 
 good judge will know the truth, not know faces, so as to countenance a 
 friend and help him out in a bad cause, or so much as omit any thing 
 that can be said or done in favour of a righteous cause, when it is the 
 cause of an enemy. 

 2. They must never connive at or encourage wicked people in their
 wicked practices.  Magistrates in their places, and ministers in 
 theirs, are to deal faithfully and the wicked man, though he be a great 
 man or a particular friend, to convict him of his wickedness, to show 
 him what will be in the end thereof, to discover him to others, that 
 they may avoid him.  But if those whose office it is thus to show 
 people their transgressions palliate them and connive at them, if they 
 excuse the wicked man, much more if they prefer him and associate with 
 him (which is, in effect, to say, <I>Thou art righteous</I>), they 
 shall justly be looked upon as enemies to the public peace and welfare, 
 which they ought to advance, and <I>the people shall curse them</I> and 
 cry out shame on them; and even those of other <I>nations shall abhor 
 them,</I> as base betrayers of their trust. 

 3. They must discountenance and give check to all fraud, violence,
 injustice, and immorality; and, though thereby they may disoblige a 
 particular person, yet they will recommend themselves to the favour of 
 God and man. Let magistrates and ministers, and private persons too 
 that are capable of doing it, <I>rebuke</I> the wicked, that they may 
 bring them to repentance or put them to shame, and they shall have the 
 comfort of it in their own bosoms: <I>To them shall be delight,</I> 
 when their consciences witness for them that they have been witnesses 
 for God; <I>and a good blessing shall come upon them,</I> the blessing 
 of God and good men; they shall be deemed religion's patrons and their 
 country's patriots. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:23"><I>ch.</I> xxviii. 23</A>.

 4. They must always give judgment according to equity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>);

 they must <I>give a right answer,</I> that is, give their opinion and
 pass sentence according to law and the true merits of the cause; and
 <I>every one shall kiss his lips that</I> does so, that is, shall love 
 and honour him, and be subject to his orders, for there is a kiss of 
 allegiance as well as of affection. He that in common conversation 
 likewise speaks pertinently and with sincerity recommends himself to 
 his company and is beloved and respected by all.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the
 field; and afterwards build thine house.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a rule of prudence in the management of household affairs; for 
 all good men should be good husbands, and manage with discretion, which 
 would prevent a great deal of sin, and trouble, and disgrace to their 
 profession. 

 1. We must prefer necessaries before conveniences, and not lay that out
 for show which should be expended for the support of the family. We 
 must be contented with a mean cottage for a habitation, rather than 
 want, or go in debt for, food convenient. 

 2. We must not think of building till we can afford it: "First apply
 thyself to <I>thy work without in the field;</I> let thy ground be put 
 into good order; look after thy husbandry, for it is that by which thou 
 must get; and, when thou hast got well by that, then, and not till 
 then, thou mayest think of rebuilding and beautifying <I>thy house,</I> 
 for that is it upon which, and in which, thou wilt have occasion to 
 spend." Many have ruined their estates and families by laying out money 
 on that which brings nothing in, beginning <I>to build</I> when they 
 were <I>not able to finish.</I> Some understand it as advice to young 
 men not to marry (for by that the house is built) till they have set up 
 in the world, and not wherewith to maintain a wife and children 
 comfortably. 

 3. When we have any great design on foot it is wisdom to take it before
 us, and make the necessary preparations, before we fall to work, that, 
 when it is begun, it may not stand still for want of materials. Solomon 
 observed this rule himself in building the house of God; all was made 
 ready <I>before it was brought to the ground,</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here forbidden to be in any thing injurious to our neighbour, 
 particularly in and by the forms of law, either, 

 1. As <I>a witness:</I> "Never bear a testimony against any man
 <I>without cause,</I> unless what thou sayest thou knowest to be 
 punctually true and thou hast a clear call to testify it. Never bear a 
 false testimony against any one;" for it follows, "<I>Deceive not with 
 thy lips;</I> deceive not the judge and jury, deceive not those whom 
 thou conversest with, into an ill opinion of thy neighbour. When thou 
 speakest of thy neighbour do not only speak that which is true, but 
 take heed lest, in the manner of thy speaking, thou insinuate any thing 
 that is otherwise and so shouldst deceive by innuendos or hyperboles." 
 Or, 

 2. As a plaintiff or prosecutor. If there be occasion to bring an
 action or information against thy neighbour, let it not be from a 
 spirit of revenge. "<I>Say not,</I> I am resolved I will be even with 
 him: <I>I will do so to him as he had done to me.</I>" Even a righteous 
 cause becomes unrighteous when it is thus prosecuted with malice.  
 <I>Say not, I will render to the man according to his work,</I> and 
 make him pay dearly for it; for it is God's prerogative to do so, and 
 we must leave it to him, and not step into his throne, or take his work 
 out of his hands. If we will needs be our own carvers, and judges in 
 our own cause, we forfeit the benefit of an appeal to God's tribunal; 
 therefore we must not avenge ourselves, because he has said, 
 <I>Vengeance is mine.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>30  I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of
 the man void of understanding;
 &nbsp; 31  And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, <I>and</I> nettles
 had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was
 broken down.
 &nbsp; 32  Then I saw, <I>and</I> considered <I>it</I> well: I looked upon <I>it,
 and</I> received instruction.
 &nbsp; 33  <I>Yet</I> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of
 the hands to sleep:
 &nbsp; 34  So shall thy poverty come <I>as</I> one that travelleth; and thy
 want as an armed man.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 1. The view which Solomon took of <I>the field and vineyard of the 
 slothful</I> man. He did not go on purpose to see it, but, as he passed 
 by, observing the fruitfulness of the ground, as it is very proper for 
 travellers to do, and his subjects' management of their land, as it is 
 very proper for magistrates to do, he cast his eye upon a <I>field</I> 
 and a <I>vineyard</I> unlike all the rest; for, though the soil was 
 good, yet there was nothing growing in them but <I>thorns and 
 nettles,</I> not here and there one, but they were all overrun with 
 weeds; and, if there had been any fruit, it would have been eaten up by 
 the beasts, for there was no fence: <I>The stone-wall was broken 
 down.</I> See the effects of that curse upon the ground
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:18">Gen.  iii. 18</A>),
 
 "<I>Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth unto thee,</I> and nothing
 else unless thou take pains with it." See what a blessing to the world 
 the husbandman's calling is, and what a wilderness this earth, even 
 Canaan itself, would be without it.  <I>The king himself is served of 
 the field,</I> but he would be ill served if God did not teach the 
 husbandman discretion and diligence to clear the ground, plant it, sow 
 it, and fence it. See what a great difference there is between some and 
 others in the management even of their worldly affairs, and how little 
 some consult their reputation, not caring though they proclaim their 
 slothfulness, in the manifest effects of it, to all that pass by, 
 shamed by their neighbour's diligence. 

 2. The reflections which he made upon it. He paused a little <I>and
 considered it, looked</I> again <I>upon it, and received 
 instruction.</I> He did not break out into any passionate censures of 
 the owner, did not call him any ill names, but he endeavoured himself 
 to get good by the observation and to be quickened by it to diligence. 
 Note, Those that are to give instruction to others must receive 
 instruction themselves, and instruction may be received, not only from 
 what we read and hear, but from what we see, not only from what we see 
 of the works of God, but from what we see of the manners of man, not 
 only from men's good manners, but from their evil manners. Plutarch 
 relates a saying of Cato Major, "That wise men profit more by fools 
 than fools by wise men; for wise men will avoid the faults of fools, 
 but fools will not imitate the virtues of wise men." Solomon reckoned 
 that he <I>received instruction</I> by this sight, though it did not 
 suggest to him any new notion or lesson, but only put him in mind of an 
 observation he himself had formerly made, both of the ridiculous folly 
 of the sluggard (who, when he has needful work to do, lies dozing in 
 bed and cries, <I>Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,</I> and still 
 it will be a little more, till he has slept his eyes out, and, instead 
 of being fitted by sleep for business, as wise men are, he is dulled, 
 and stupefied, and made good for nothing) and of certain misery that 
 attends him: his <I>poverty comes as one that travels;</I> it is 
 constantly coming nearer and nearer to him, and will be upon him 
 speedily, and want seizes him as irresistibly <I>as an armed man,</I> a 
 highwayman that will strip him of all he has.  Now this is applicable, 
 not only to our worldly business, to show what a scandalous thing 
 slothfulness in that is, and how injurious to the family, but to the 
 affairs of our souls. Note,

 (1.) Our souls are our fields and vineyards, which we are every one of
 us to take care of, to dress, and to keep. They are capable of being 
 improved with good husbandry; that may be got out of them which will be 
 fruit abounding to our account. We are charged with them, to occupy 
 them till our Lord come; and a great deal of care and pains it is 
 requisite that we should take about them. 

 (2.) These fields and vineyards are often in a very bad state, not only
 no fruit brought forth, but all overgrown with <I>thorns</I> and 
 <I>nettles</I> (scratching, stinging, inordinate lusts and passions, 
 pride, covetousness, sensuality, malice, those are the thorns and 
 nettles, the wild grapes, which the unsanctified heart produces), no 
 guard kept against the enemy, but the <I>stone-wall broken down,</I> 
 and all lies in common, all exposed. 

 (3.) Where it is thus it is owing to the sinner's own slothfulness and
 folly. He is a sluggard, loves sleep, hates labour; and he is void of 
 understanding, understands neither his business nor his interest; he is 
 perfectly besotted. 

 (4.) The issue of it will certainly be the ruin of the soul and all its
 welfare. It is everlasting want that thus comes upon it as an armed 
 man. We know the place assigned to the wicked and slothful servant.</P>
