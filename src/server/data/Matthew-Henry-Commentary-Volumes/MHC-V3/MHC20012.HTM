 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth
 reproof <I>is</I> brutish.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here taught to try whether we have grace or no by enquiring how 
 we stand affected to the means of grace. 

 1. Those that have grace and love it will delight in all the 
 instructions that are given them by way of counsel; admonition, or 
 reproof, by the word or providence of God; they will value a good 
 education, and think it not a hardship, but a happiness, to be under a 
 strict and prudent discipline. Those that love a faithful ministry, 
 that value it, and sit under it with pleasure, make it to appear that 
 they <I>love knowledge.</I> 

 2. Those show themselves not only void of grace, but void of common 
 sense, that take it as an affront to be told of their faults, and an 
 imposition upon their liberty to be put in mind of their duty: <I>He 
 that hates reproof is</I> not only foolish, but <I>brutish,</I> like 
 the horse and the mule that have no understanding, or the ox that kicks 
 against the goad. Those that desire to live in loose families and
 societies, where they may be under no check, that stifle the 
 convictions of their own consciences, and count those their enemies 
 that tell them the truth, are the <I>brutish</I> here meant.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr12_2"> </A>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  A good <I>man</I> obtaineth favour of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: but a man of
 wicked devices will he condemn.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. We are really as we are with God. Those are happy, truly happy, for 
 ever happy, that <I>obtain favour of the Lord,</I> though the world 
 frown upon them, and they find little favour with men; for in God's 
 favour is life, and that is the fountain of all good. On the other hand 
 those are miserable whom <I>he condemns,</I> however men may applaud 
 them, and cry them up; whom he condemns he condemns to the second 
 death. 

 2. We are with God as we are with men, as we have our conversation in 
 this world. Our Father judges of his children very much by their 
 conduct one to another; and therefore <I>a good man,</I> that is 
 merciful, and charitable, and does good, <I>draws out favour from the 
 Lord</I> by his prayers; but a malicious man, that devises wickedness 
 against his neighbours, <I>he will condemn,</I> as unworthy of a place 
 in his kingdom.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr12_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of
 the righteous shall not be moved.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Though men may advance themselves by sinful arts, they cannot by 
 such arts settle and secure themselves; though they may get large 
 estates they cannot get such as will abide: <I>A man shall not be 
 established by wickedness;</I> it may set him in high places, but they 
 are slippery places,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:18">Ps. lxxiii. 18</A>.

 That prosperity which is raised by sin is built on the sand, and so it
 will soon appear. 

 2. Though good men may have but little of the world, yet that little 
 will last, and what is honestly got will wear well: <I>The root of the 
 righteous shall not be moved,</I> though their branches may be shaken. 
 Those that by faith are rooted in Christ are firmly fixed; in him their 
 comfort and happiness are so rooted as never to be rooted up.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr12_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  A virtuous woman <I>is</I> a crown to her husband: but she that
 maketh ashamed <I>is</I> as rottenness in his bones.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. He that is blessed with a good wife is as happy as if he were upon 
 the throne, for she is no less than <I>a crown</I> to him. <I>A 
 virtuous woman,</I> that is pious and prudent, ingenious and 
 industrious, that is active for the good of her family and looks well 
 to the ways of her household, that makes conscience of her duty in 
 every relation, a woman of spirit, that can bear crosses without 
 disturbance, such a one owns her husband for her head, and therefore 
 she <I>is a crown</I> to him, not only a credit and honour to him, as 
 <I>a crown</I> is an ornament, but supports and keeps up his authority 
 in his family, as <I>a crown</I> is an ensign of power. She is 
 submissive and faithful to him and by her example teaches his children 
 and servants to be so too. 

 2. He that is plagued with a bad wife is as miserable as if he were 
 upon the dunghill; for she is no better than <I>rottenness in his 
 bones,</I> an incurable disease, besides that <I>she makes him 
 ashamed.</I> She that is silly and slothful, wasteful and wanton, 
 passionate and ill-tongued, ruins both the credit and comfort of her 
 husband. If he go abroad, his head is hung down, for his wife's faults 
 turn to his reproach. If he retire into himself, his heart is sunk; he 
 is continually uneasy; it is an affliction that preys much upon the 
 spirits.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr12_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  The thoughts of the righteous <I>are</I> right: <I>but</I> the counsels
 of the wicked <I>are</I> deceit.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. The word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the 
 heart, and judges them. We mistake if we imagine that thoughts are 
 free. No, they are under the divine cognizance, and therefore under the 
 divine command. 

 2. We ought to be observers of the thoughts and intents of our own 
 hearts, and to judge of ourselves by them; for they are the first-born 
 of the soul, that have most of its image undisguised. Right thoughts 
 are a righteous man's best evidences, as nothing more certainly proves 
 a man wicked than wicked contrivances and designs. A good man may have 
 in his mind bad suggestions, but he does not indulge them and harbour 
 them till they are ripened into bad projects and resolutions. 

 3. It is a man's honour to mean honestly, and to have his thoughts 
 right, though a word or action may be misplaced, or mistimed, or at 
 least misinterpreted. But it is a man's shame to lie always at catch, 
 to act with deceit, with trick and design, not only with a long reach, 
 but with an overreach.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr12_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  The words of the wicked <I>are</I> to lie in wait for blood: but
 the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the foregoing verse the <I>thoughts</I> of the wicked and righteous
 were compared; here their <I>words,</I> and those are as the abundance 
 of the heart is. 

 1. Wicked people speak mischief to their neighbours; and wicked indeed 
 those are whose <I>words</I> are to <I>lie in wait for blood;</I> their
 tongues are swords to those that stand in their way, to good men whom
 they hate and persecute. See an instance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:20,21">Luke xx. 20, 21</A>.

 2. Good men speak help to their neighbours: The <I>mouth of the
 upright</I> is ready to be opened in the cause of those that are
 oppressed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:8"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 8</A>),

 to plead for them, to witness for them, and so to <I>deliver them,</I>
 particularly those whom the wicked <I>lie in wait</I> for. A man may 
 sometimes do a very good work with one good word.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr12_7"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  The wicked are overthrown, and <I>are</I> not: but the house of
 the righteous shall stand.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here taught as before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+12:3,Pr+10:25,30"><I>v.</I> 3
 and <I>ch.</I> x. 25, 30</A>),

 1. That the <I>triumphing of the wicked is short.</I> They may be
 exalted for a while, but in a little time they are <I>overthrown and 
 are not;</I> their trouble proves their overthrow, and those who made a 
 great show disappear, and their place knows them no more. <I>Turn the 
 wicked, and they are not;</I> they stand in such a slippery place that 
 the least touch of trouble brings them down, like the apples of Sodom, 
 which look fair, but touch them and they go to dust. 

 2. That the prosperity of the righteous has a good bottom and will 
 endure. Death will remove them, but their <I>house</I> shall 
 <I>stand,</I> their families shall be kept up, and the generation of 
 the upright shall be blessed.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr12_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that
 is of a perverse heart shall be despised.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told whence to expect a good name. Reputation is what most 
 have a high regard to and stand much upon. Now it is certain, 

 1. The best reputation is that which attends virtue and serious piety, 
 and the prudent conduct of life: <I>A man shall be commended</I> by all 
 that are wise and good, in conformity to the judgment of God himself, 
 which we are sure is <I>according to truth,</I> not according to his 
 riches or preferments, his craft and subtlety, but <I>according to his 
 wisdom,</I> the honesty of his designs and the prudent choice of means 
 to compass them. 

 2. The worst reproach is that which follows wickedness and an 
 opposition to that which is good: <I>He that is of a perverse 
 heart,</I> that turns aside to crooked ways, and goes on frowardly in 
 them, <I>shall be despised.</I> Providence will bring him to poverty 
 and contempt, and all that have a true sense of honour will despise him 
 as unworthy to be dealt with and unfit to be trusted, as a blemish and 
 scandal to mankind.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr12_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  <I>He that is</I> despised, and hath a servant, <I>is</I> better than
 he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is the folly of some that they covet to make a great figure 
 abroad, take place, and take state, as persons of quality, and yet want 
 necessaries at home, and, if their debts were paid, would not be worth 
 a morsel of bread, nay, perhaps, pinch their bellies to put it on their 
 backs, that they may appear very gay, because fine feathers make fine 
 birds. 

 2. The condition and character of those is every way better who content 
 themselves in a lower sphere, where they are despised for the plainness 
 of their dress and the meanness of their post, that they may be able to 
 afford themselves, not only necessaries, but conveniences, in their own 
 houses, not only bread, but a servant to attend them and take some of 
 their work off their hands. Those that contrive to live plentifully and 
 comfortably at home are to be preferred before those that affect 
 nothing so much as to appear splendid abroad, though they have not 
 wherewithal to maintain their appearance, whose hearts are unhumbled 
 when their condition is low.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr12_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  A righteous <I>man</I> regardeth the life of his beast: but the
 tender mercies of the wicked <I>are</I> cruel.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. To how great a degree a good man will be merciful; he has not only a 
 compassion for the human nature under its greatest abasements, but he 
 regards even <I>the life of his beast,</I> not only because it is his 
 servant, but because it is God's creature, and in conformity to 
 Providence, which <I>preserves man and beast.</I> The beasts that are 
 under our care must be provided for, must have convenient food and 
 rest, must in no case be abused or tyrannised over. Balaam was checked
 for beating his ass. The law took care for oxen. Those therefore are
 unrighteous men that are not just to the brute-creatures; those that 
 are furious and barbarous to them evidence, and confirm in themselves, 
 a habit of barbarity, and help to make the creation groan,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:22">Rom. viii. 22</A>.

 2. To how great a degree a wicked man will be unmerciful; even his 
 <I>tender mercies</I> are <I>cruel;</I> that natural compassion which 
 is in him, as a man, is lost, and, by the power of corruption, is 
 turned into hard-heartedness; even that which they will have to pass 
 for compassion is really cruel, as Pilate's resolution concerning 
 Christ the innocent, <I>I will chastise him and let him go.</I> Their 
 pretended kindnesses are only a cover for purposed cruelties.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but
 he that followeth vain <I>persons is</I> void of understanding.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is men's wisdom to mind their business and follow an honest 
 calling, for that is the way, by the blessing of God, to get a 
 livelihood: <I>He that tills his land,</I> of which he is either the 
 owner or the occupant, that keeps to his word and is willing to take 
 pains, if he do not raise an estate by it (what need is there of 
 that?), yet he <I>shall be satisfied with bread,</I> shall have food 
 convenient for himself and his family, enough to bear his charges 
 comfortably through the world. Even the sentence of wrath has this
 mercy in it, Thou shalt <I>eat bread,</I> though it be <I>in the sweat 
 of thy face.</I> Cain was denied this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:12">Gen. iv. 12</A>.

 Be busy, and that is the true way to be easy. Keep thy shop and thy 
 shop will keep thee. <I>Thou shalt eat the labour of thy hands.</I>

 2. It is men's folly to neglect their business. Those are <I>void of
 understanding</I> that do so, for then they fall in with idle 
 companions and follow them in their evil courses, and so come to want 
 bread, at least bread of their own, and make themselves burdensome to 
 others, eating the bread out of other people's mouths.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  The wicked desireth the net of evil <I>men:</I> but the root of
 the righteous yieldeth <I>fruit.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here,

 1. What is the care and aim of a wicked man; he would do mischief: He 
 <I>desires the net of evil men.</I> "Oh that I were but as cunning as 
 such a man, to make a hand of those I deal with, that I had but his art 
 of over-reaching, that I could but take my revenge on one I have spite 
 to as effectually as he can!" He desires the <I>strong-hold, or 
 fortress,</I> of evil men (so some read it), to act securely in doing 
 mischief, that it may not turn upon him. 

 2. What is the care and aim of a good man: His <I>root yields 
 fruit,</I> and is his strength and stability, and that is it that he 
 desires, to do good and to be fixed and confirmed in doing good. The 
 wicked desires only a net wherewith to fish for himself; the righteous 
 desires to yield fruit for the benefit of others and God's glory,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. The wicked entangling themselves in trouble by their folly, when God 
 in justice leaves them to themselves. They are often <I>snared by the 
 transgression of their lips</I> and their throats are cut with their 
 own tongues. By <I>speaking evil of dignities</I> they expose 
 themselves to public justice; by giving ill language they become 
 obnoxious to private resentments, are sued for defamation, and actions 
 on the case for words are brought against them. Many a man has paid 
 dearly in this world for the transgression of his lips, and has felt 
 the lash on his back for want of a bridle upon his tongue,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:8">Ps. lxiv. 8</A>.

 2. The righteous extricating themselves out of trouble by their own
 wisdom, when God in mercy comes in for their succour: <I>The just shall 
 come out</I> of such troubles as the wicked throw themselves headlong 
 into. It is intimated that the just may perhaps come into trouble; but, 
 <I>though they fall, they shall not be utterly cast down,</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here assured, for our quickening to every good word and work, 

 1. That even good words will turn to a good account

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>A man shall be satisfied with good</I> (that is, he shall gain 
 present comfort, that inward pleasure which is truly satisfying) <I>by 
 the fruit of his mouth,</I> by the good he does with his pious 
 discourse and prudent advice. While we are teaching others we may 
 ourselves learn, and feed on the bread of life we break to others. 

 2. That good works, much more, will be abundantly rewarded: The
 <I>recompence of a man's hands</I> for all his work and labour of love, 
 all he has done for the glory of God and the good of his generation, 
 <I>shall be rendered unto him,</I> and he shall reap as he has sown. Or 
 it may be understood of the general rule of justice; God will <I>render

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  The way of a fool <I>is</I> right in his own eyes: but he that
 hearkeneth unto counsel <I>is</I> wise.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. What it is that keeps a fool from being wise: <I>His way is right in 
 his own eyes;</I> he thinks he is in the right in every thing he does, 
 and <I>therefore</I> asks no advice, because he does not apprehend he 
 needs it; he is confident he knows the way, and cannot miss it, and 
 therefore never enquires the way. The rule he goes by is to do that 
 which is <I>right in his own eyes,</I> to walk in the way of his heart. 
 <I>Quicquid libet, licet--He makes his will his law.</I> He is a fool 
 that is governed by his eye, and not by his conscience. 

 2. What it is that keeps a wise man from being a fool; he is willing
 to be advised, desires to have counsel given him, and <I>hearkens to 
 counsel,</I> being diffident of his own judgment and having a value for 
 the direction of those that are wise and good. He is wise (it is a sign 
 he is so, and he is likely to continue so) whose ear is always open to 
 good advice.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr12_16"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent <I>man</I>
 covereth shame.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Passion is folly: <I>A fool is known by his anger</I> (so some read 
 it); not but that a wise man may be angry when there is just cause for 
 it, but then he has his anger under check and direction, is <I>lord of 
 his anger,</I> whereas a fool's anger lords it over him. He that, when 
 he is provoked, breaks out into indecent expressions, in words or 
 behaviour, whose passion alters his countenance, makes him outrageous, 
 and leads him to forget himself, <I>Nabal</I> certainly is his name and 
 <I>folly is with him. A fool's indignation is known in the day;</I> he 
 proclaims it openly, whatever company he is in. Or it is known in the 
 day he is provoked; he cannot defer showing his resentments. Those that 
 are soon angry, that are quickly put into a flame by the least spark, 
 have not that rule which they ought to have over their own spirits. 

 2. Meekness is wisdom: <I>A prudent man covers shame.</I>

 (1.) He covers the passion that is in his own breast; when his 
 <I>spirit is stirred,</I> and his <I>heart hot within him,</I> he keeps 
 his mouth as with a bridle, and suppresses his resentments, by 
 smothering and stifling them. Anger is shame, and, though a wise man be 
 not perfectly free from it, yet he is ashamed of it, rebukes it, and 
 suffers not the evil spirit to speak. 

 (2.) He covers the provocation that is given him, the indignity that is 
 done him, winks at it, covers it as much as may be from himself, that 
 he may not carry his resentments of it too far. It is a kindness to
 ourselves, and contributes to the repose of our own minds, to extenuate 
 and excuse the injuries and affronts that we receive, instead of 
 aggravating them and making the worst of them, as we are apt to do.</P>

 Here is, 

 1. A faithful witness commended for an honest man. <I>He that</I> makes 
 conscience of <I>speaking truth,</I> and representing every thing 
 fairly, to the best of his knowledge, whether in judgment or in common 
 conversation, whether he be upon his oath or no, he <I>shows forth 
 righteousness;</I> he makes it to appear that he is governed and 
 actuated by the principles and laws of righteousness, and he promotes 
 justice by doing honour to it and serving the administration of it. 

 2. A false witness condemned for a cheat; he <I>shows forth
 deceit,</I> not only how little conscience he makes of deceiving those 
 he deals with, but how much pleasure he takes in it, and that he is 
 possessed by a lying spirit,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:3-5">Jer. ix. 3-5</A>.

 We are all concerned to possess ourselves with a dread and detestation 
 of the sin of lying

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The tongue is death or life, poison or medicine, as it is used. 

 1. There are words that are cutting and killing, that are <I>like the
 piercings of a sword.</I> Opprobrious words grieve the spirits of those 
 to whom they are spoken, and cut them to the heart. Slanders, like a 
 sword, wound the reputation of those of whom they are uttered, and 
 perhaps incurably. Whisperings and evil surmises, like a sword, divide 
 and cut asunder the bounds of love and friendship, and separate those 
 that have been dearest to each other. 

 2. There are words that are curing and healing: <I>The tongue of the 
 wise is health,</I> closing up those wounds which the backbiting tongue 
 had given, making all whole again, restoring peace, and accommodating 
 matters in variance and persuading to reconciliation. Wisdom will find 
 out proper remedies against the mischiefs that are made by detraction 
 and evil-speaking.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr12_19"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying
 tongue <I>is</I> but for a moment.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Be it observed, to the honour of truth, that sacred thing, 

 1. That, if truth be spoken, it will hold good, and, whoever may be 
 disobliged by it and angry at it, yet it will keep its ground. Great is 
 the truth and will prevail. What is true will be always true; we may 
 abide by it, and need not fear being disproved and put to shame. 

 2. That, if truth be denied, yet in time it will transpire. A <I>lying
 tongue,</I> that puts false colours upon things, <I>is but for a 
 moment.</I> The lie will be disproved. The liar, when he comes to be
 examined, will be found in several stories, and not consistent with 
 himself as he is that speaks truth; and, when he is found in a lie, he 
 cannot gain his point, nor will he afterwards be credited. Truth may be 
 eclipsed, but it will come to light. Those therefore that make a lie 
 their refuge will find it a refuge of lies.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  Deceit <I>is</I> in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to
 the counsellors of peace <I>is</I> joy.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Those that devise mischief contrive, for the accomplishing of it, 
 how to impose upon others; but it will prove, in the end, that they 
 deceive themselves. Those that <I>imagine evil,</I> under colour of 
 friendship, have their hearts full of this and the other advantage and 
 satisfaction which they shall gain by it, but it is all a cheat. Let 
 them imagine it ever so artfully, deceivers will be deceived. 

 2. Those that consult the good of their neighbours, that study the 
 things which make for peace and give peaceable advice, promote healing 
 attempts and contrive healing methods, and, according as their sphere 
 is, further the public welfare, will have not only the credit, but the 
 comfort of it. They will have joy and success, perhaps beyond their 
 expectation. <I>Blessed are the peace-makers.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall
 be filled with mischief.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Piety is a sure protection. If men be sincerely righteous, the 
 righteous God has engaged that no evil shall happen to them. He will, 
 by the power of his grace in them, that principle of justice, keep them 
 from the evil of sin; so that, though they be tempted, yet they shall 
 not be overcome by the temptation, and though they may come into 
 trouble, into many troubles, yet to them those troubles shall have no 
 evil in them, whatever they have to others

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:10">Ps. xci. 10</A>),

 for they shall be overruled to work for their good. 

 2. Wickedness is as sure a destruction. Those that live in contempt of 
 God and man, that are set on mischief, with mischief they <I>shall be 
 filled.</I> They shall be more mischievous, shall be <I>filled with all 
 unrighteousness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:29">Rom. i. 29</A>.

 Or they shall be made miserable with the mischiefs that shall come upon 
 them. Those that delight in mischief shall have enough of it. Some
 read the whole verse thus, <I>There shall no evil happen to the just, 
 though the wicked be filled with mischief</I> and spite against them. 
 They shall be safe under the protection of Heaven, though hell itself 
 break loose upon them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  Lying lips <I>are</I> abomination to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: but they that deal
 truly <I>are</I> his delight.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here taught, 

 1. To hate lying, and to keep at the utmost distance from it, because 
 it is an abomination to the Lord, and renders those abominable in his 
 sight that allow themselves in it, not only because it is a breach of 
 his law, but because it is destructive to human society. 

 2. To make conscience of truth, not only in our words, but in all our 
 actions, because those that <I>deal truly</I> and sincerely in all 
 their dealings are <I>his delight,</I> and he is well pleased with 
 them. We delight to converse with, and make use of, those that are 
 honest and that we may put a confidence in; such therefore let us be, 
 that we may recommend ourselves to the favour both of God and man.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools
 proclaimeth foolishness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. He that is wise does not affect to proclaim his wisdom, and it is 
 his honour that he does not. He communicates his knowledge when it may 
 turn to the edification of others, but he conceals it when the showing 
 of it would only tend to his own commendation. Knowing men, if they be 
 prudent men, will carefully avoid every thing that savours of 
 ostentation, and not take all occasions to show their learning and 
 reading, but only to use it for good purposes, and then let <I>their 
 own works praise them. Ars est celare artem--The perfection of art is 
 to conceal it.</I> 

 2. He that is foolish cannot avoid proclaiming his folly, and it is his 
 shame that he cannot: <I>The heart of fools,</I> by their foolish words 
 and actions, <I>proclaims foolishness;</I> either they do not desire to 
 hide it, so little sense have they of good and evil, honour and 
 dishonour, or they know not how to hide it, so little discretion have 
 they in the management of themselves,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful
 shall be under tribute.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Industry is the way to preferment. Solomon advanced Jeroboam because 
 he saw that he was an industrious young man, and minded his business,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:28">1 Kings xi. 28</A>.

 Men that take pains in study and serviceableness will thereby gain such 
 an interest and reputation as will give them a dominion over all about 
 them, by which means many have risen strangely. He that has been
 <I>faithful in a few things</I> shall be made <I>ruler over many 
 things.</I> The elders, that <I>labour in the word and doctrine,</I> 
 are <I>worthy of double honour;</I> and those that are diligent when 
 they are young will get that which will enable them to rule, and so to 
 rest, when they are old. 

 2. Knavery is the way to slavery: <I>The slothful</I> and careless, or 
 rather the <I>deceitful</I> (for so the word signifies), <I>shall be 
 under tribute.</I> Those that, because they will not take pains in an 
 honest calling, live by their shifts and arts of dishonesty, are paltry 
 and beggarly, and will be kept under. Those that are diligent and
 honest when they are apprentices will come to be masters; but those 
 that are otherwise are the fools who, all their days, must be 
 <I>servants to the wise in heart.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>25  Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good
 word maketh it glad.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The cause and consequence of melancholy. It is <I>heaviness in the 
 heart;</I> it is a load of care, and fear, and sorrow, upon the 
 spirits, depressing them, and disabling them to exert themselves with 
 any vigour on what is to be done or fortitude in what is to borne; it 
 makes them stoop, prostrates and sinks them. Those that are thus 
 oppressed can neither do the duty nor take the comfort of any relation, 
 condition, or conversation. Those therefore that are inclined to it 
 should watch and pray against it. 

 2. The cure of it: <I>A good word</I> from God, applied by faith, 
 <I>makes it glad;</I> such a word is that (says one of the rabbin), 
 <I>Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee;</I> the 
 good word of God, particularly the gospel, is designed to make the 
 hearts glad that are weary and heavy-laden,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>26  The righteous <I>is</I> more excellent than his neighbour: but
 the way of the wicked seduceth them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. That good men do well for themselves; for they have in themselves an 
 excellent character, and they secure to themselves an excellent 
 portion, and in both they excel other people: <I>The righteous is more 
 abundant than his neighbour</I> (so the margin); he is richer, though 
 not in this world's goods, yet in the graces and comforts of the 
 Spirit, which are the true riches. There is a true excellency in 
 religion; it ennobles men, inspires them with generous principles, 
 makes them substantial; it is an excellency which is, in the sight of 
 God, of great price, who is the true Judge of excellency. His
 neighbour may make a greater figure in the world, may be more 
 applauded, but the righteous man has the intrinsic worth. 

 2. That wicked men do ill for themselves; they walk in a way which 
 <I>seduces them.</I> It seems to them to be not only a pleasant way, 
 but the right way; it is so agreeable to flesh and blood that they 
 therefore flatter themselves with an opinion that it cannot be amiss, 
 but they will not gain the point they aim at, nor enjoy the good they 
 hope for. It is all a cheat; and therefore the righteous is wiser and 
 happier than his neighbour, that yet despise him and trample upon 
 him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  The slothful <I>man</I> roasteth not that which he took in
 hunting: but the substance of a diligent man <I>is</I> precious.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. That which may make us hate slothfulness and deceit, for the word 
 here, as before, signifies both: <I>The slothful</I> deceitful 
 <I>man</I> has roast meat, but that which he roasts is not what he 
 himself <I>took in hunting,</I> no, it is what others took pains for, 
 and he lives upon the fruit of their labours, like the drones in the 
 hive. Or, if slothful deceitful men have taken any thing by hunting (as 
 sportsmen are seldom men of business), yet they do not roast it when 
 they have taken it; they have no comfort in the enjoyment of it; 
 perhaps God in his providence cuts them short of it. 

 2. That which may make us in love with industry and honesty, that the 
 <I>substance of a diligent man,</I> though it be not great perhaps, 
 <I>is</I> yet <I>precious.</I> It comes from the blessing of God; he 
 has comfort in it; it does him good, and his family. It is his own 
 daily bread, not bread out of other people's mouths, and therefore he 
 sees God gives it to him in answer to his prayer.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  In the way of righteousness <I>is</I> life; and <I>in</I> the pathway
 <I>thereof there is</I> no death.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The way of religion is here recommended to us,

 1. As a straight, plain, easy way; it is <I>the way of
 righteousness.</I> God's commands (the rule we are to walk by) are all
 holy, just, and good. Religion has right reason and equity on its side;
 it is a <I>path-way,</I> a way which God has cast up for us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:8">Isa. xxxv. 8</A>);

 it is a highway, the king's highway, the King of kings' highway, a way 
 which is tracked before us by all the saints, the good old way, full of 
 the footsteps of the flock. 
 
 2. As a safe, pleasant, comfortable way.
 
 (1.) There is not only life at the end, but there is life in the way; 
 all true comfort and satisfaction. The favour of God, which is better 
 than life; the Spirit, who is life. 

 (2.) There is not only life in it, but so as that in it <I>there is no 
 death,</I> none of that sorrow of the world which works death and is an 
 allay to our present joy and life. There is no end of that life that is 
 in the way of righteousness. Here there is life, but there is death
 too. <I>In the way of righteousness</I> there <I>is life, and no 
 death,</I> life and immortality.</P>
