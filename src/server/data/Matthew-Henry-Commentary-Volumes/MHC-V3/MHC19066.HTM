 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a thanksgiving-psalm, and it is of such a general use and 
 application that we need not suppose it penned upon any particular 
 occasion. All people are here called upon to praise God, 

 I. For the general instances of his sovereign dominion and power in the
 whole creation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. For the special tokens of his favour to the church, his peculiar
 people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:8-12">ver. 8-12</A>.
 
 And then,

 III. The psalmist praises God for his own experiences of his goodness
 to him in particular, especially in answering his prayers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:13-20">ver. 13-20</A>.
 
 If we have learned in every thing to give thanks for ancient and modern 
 mercies, public and personal mercies, we shall know how to sing this 
 psalm with grace and understanding.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. A song <I>or</I> psalm.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Make a joyful
 noise unto God, all ye lands:
 &nbsp; 2  Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.
 &nbsp; 3  Say unto God, How terrible <I>art thou in</I> thy works! through
 the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves
 unto thee.
 &nbsp; 4  All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee;
 they shall sing <I>to</I> thy name. Selah.
 &nbsp; 5  Come and see the works of God: <I>he is</I> terrible <I>in his</I>
 doing toward the children of men.
 &nbsp; 6  He turned the sea into dry <I>land:</I> they went through the
 flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.
 &nbsp; 7  He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations:
 let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In these verses the psalmist calls upon all people to praise God, 
 <I>all lands, all the earth,</I> all the inhabitants of the world that 
 are capable of praising God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 1. This speaks the glory of God, that he is worthy to be praised by 
 all, for he is good to all and furnishes every nation with matter for 
 praise. 

 2. The duty of man, that all are obliged to praise God; it is part of
 the law of creation, and therefore is required of every creature. 

 3. A prediction of the conversion of the Gentiles to the faith of
 Christ; the time should come when all lands should praise God, and this 
 incense should in every place be offered to him. 

 4. A hearty good-will which the psalmist had to this good work of 
 praising God. He will abound in it himself, and wishes that God might 
 have his tribute paid him by all the nations of the earth and not by 
 the land of Israel only.  He excites all lands,

 (1.) To <I>make a joyful noise to God.</I> Holy joy is that devout
 affection which should animate all our praises; and, though it is not 
 making a noise in religion that God will accept of (hypocrites are said 
 to <I>cause their voice to be heard on high,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:4">Isa. lviii. 4</A>),

 yet, in praising God, 

 [1.] We must be hearty and zealous, and must do what we do with all our 
 might, with all that is within us.

 [2.] We must be open and public, as those that are not ashamed of our 
 Master. And both these are implied in making a noise, a joyful noise.

 (2.) To sing with pleasure, and to <I>sing forth,</I> for the 
 edification of others, <I>the honour of his name,</I> that is, of all 
 that whereby he has made himself known, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 That which is the honour of God's name ought to be the matter of our
 praise.

 (3.) To <I>make his praise glorious</I> as far as we can. In praising 
 God we must do it so as to glorify him, and that must be the scope and 
 drift of all our praises. <I>Reckon it your greatest glory to praise 
 God,</I> so some.  It is the highest honour the creature is capable of 
 to be to the Creator for a name and a praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He had called upon all lands to praise God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 and he foretels
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 that they shall do so: <I>All the earth shall worship thee;</I> some in
 all parts of the earth, even the remotest regions, for <I>the
 everlasting gospel shall be preached to every nation and kindred;</I>
 and this is the purport of it, <I>Worship him that made heaven and
 earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:6,7">Rev. xiv. 6, 7</A>.

 Being thus sent forth, it shall not return void, but shall bring all
 the earth, more or less, to worship God, and sing unto him. In gospel 
 times God shall be worshipped by the singing of Psalms. They shall 
 <I>sing to God,</I> that is, <I>sing to his name,</I> for it is only to 
 his declarative glory, that by which he has made himself known, not to 
 his essential glory, that we can contribute any thing by our 
 praises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That we may be furnished with matter for praise, we are here 
 called upon <I>to come and see the works of God;</I> for <I>his own 
 works praise him,</I> whether we do or no; and the reason why we do not 
 praise him more and better is because we do not duly and attentively 
 observe them. Let us therefore see God's works and observe the 
 instances of his wisdom, power, and faithfulness in them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 and then speak of them, and speak of them to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works, terrible in thy 
 doings!</I>

 1.  God's works are wonderful in themselves, and such as, when duly 
 considered, may justly fill us with amazement. God <I>is terrible</I> 
 (that is, admirable) in his works, through the greatness of his power, 
 which is such, and shines so brightly, so strongly, in all he does, 
 that it may be truly said there are <I>not any works like unto his 
 works.</I> Hence he is said to be <I>fearful in praises,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:11">Exod. xv. 11</A>.

 In all his doings towards the children of men he is terrible, and to be 
 eyed with a holy awe. Much of religion lies in a reverence for the 
 divine Providence. 

 2. They are formidable to his enemies, and have many a time forced and
 frightened them into a feigned submission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Through the greatness of thy power,</I> before which none can stand, 
 <I>shall thy enemies submit themselves unto thee; they shall lie unto 
 thee</I> (so the word is), that is, they shall be compelled, sorely 
 against their wills, to make their peace with thee upon any terms.  
 Subjection extorted by fear is seldom sincere, and therefore force is 
 no proper means of propagating religion, nor can there be much joy of 
 such proselytes to the church as will in the end be found liars unto 
 it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:29">Deut. xxxiii. 29</A>.
 
 3. They are comfortable and beneficial to his people,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 When Israel came out of Egypt, <I>he turned the sea into dry land</I>
 before them, which encouraged them to follow God's guidance through the 
 wilderness; and, when they were to enter Canaan, for their 
 encouragement in their wars Jordan was divided before them, and <I>they 
 went through that flood on foot;</I> and such foot, so signally owned 
 by heaven, might well pass for cavalry, rather than infantry, in the 
 wars of the Lord. There did the enemies tremble before them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:14,15,Jos+5:1">Exod. xv. 14, 15; Josh. v. 1</A>),

 but <I>there did we rejoice in him,</I> both trust his power (for
 relying on God is often expressed by rejoicing in him) and sing his
 praise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:12">Ps. cvi. 12</A>.

 There did we rejoice; that is, our ancestors did, and we in their
 loins. The joys of our fathers were our joys, and we ought to look upon 
 ourselves as sharers in them. 

 4. They are commanding to all. God by his works keeps up his dominion 
 in the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>He rules by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations.</I>

 (1.) God has a commanding eye; from the height of heaven his eye 
 commands all the inhabitants of the world, and he has a clear and full 
 view of them all.  <I>His eyes run to and fro through the earth;</I> 
 the most remote and obscure nations are under his inspection. 

 (2.) He has a commanding arm; his power rules, rules for ever, and is 
 never weakened, never obstructed. <I>Strong is his hand, and high is 
 his right hand.</I> Hence he infers, <I>Let not the rebellious exalt 
 themselves;</I> let not those that have revolting and rebellious hearts 
 dare to rise up in any overt acts of rebellion against God, as Adonijah 
 exalted himself, saying, <I>I will be king.</I> Let not those that are 
 in rebellion against God exalt themselves as if there were any 
 probability that they should gain their point. No; let them be still, 
 for God hath said, <I>I will be exalted,</I> and man cannot gainsay 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise
 to be heard:
 &nbsp; 9  Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to
 be moved.
 &nbsp; 10  For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as
 silver is tried.
 &nbsp; 11  Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon
 our loins.
 &nbsp; 12  Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through
 fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy
 <I>place.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the psalmist calls upon God's people in a special
 manner to praise him. Let all lands do it, but Israel's land 
 particularly. Bless our God; bless him as ours, a God in covenant with 
 us, and that takes care of us as his own. Let them <I>make the voice of 
 his praise to be heard</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 for from whom should it be heard but from those who are his peculiar 
 favourites and select attendants? Two things we have reason to bless 
 God for:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Common protection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>He holdeth our soul in life,</I> that it may not drop away of 
 itself; for, being continually in our hands, it is apt to slip through 
 our fingers. We must own that it is the good providence of God that 
 keeps life and soul together and his visitation that preserves our 
 spirit. <I>He puts our soul in life,</I> so the word is. He that gave 
 us our being, by a constant renewed act upholds us in our being, and 
 his providence is a continued creation. When we are ready to faint and 
 perish he restores our soul, and so puts it, as it were, into a new 
 life, giving new comforts. <I>Non est vivere, sed valere, vita--It is 
 not existence, but happiness, that deserves the name of life.</I> But 
 we are apt to stumble and fall, and are exposed to many destructive 
 accidents, killing disasters as well as killing diseases, and therefore 
 as to these also we are guarded by the divine power. He <I>suffers not 
 our feet to be moved,</I> preventing many unforeseen evils, which we 
 ourselves were not aware of our danger from.  To him we owe it that we 
 have not, long ere this, fallen into endless ruin. <I>He will keep the 
 feet of his saints.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Special deliverance from great distress.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How grievous the distress and danger were, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 What particular trouble of the church this refers to does not appear;
 it might be the trouble of some private persons or families only. But, 
 whatever it was, they were surprised with it as a bird with a snare, 
 enclosed and entangled in it as a fish in a net; they were pressed down 
 with it, and kept under as with a load <I>upon their loins,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 But they owned the hand of God in it. We are never in the net but God
 brings us into it, never under affliction but God lays it upon us. Is 
 any thing more dangerous than fire and water? <I>We went through 
 both,</I> that is, afflictions of different kinds; the end of one 
 trouble was the beginning of another; when we had got clear of one sort 
 of dangers we found ourselves involved in dangers of another sort. Such 
 may be the troubles of the best of God's saints, but he has promised, 
 <I>When thou passest through the waters, through the fire, I will be 
 with thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:1">Isa. xliii. 1</A>.

 Yet proud and cruel men may be as dangerous as fire and water, and more
 so. <I>Beware of men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:17">Matt. x. 17</A>.

 When men rose up against us, that was fire and water, and all that is
 threatening 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+124:2,3,4">Ps. cxxiv. 2, 3, 4</A>),

 and that was the case here: "<I>Thou hast caused men to ride over our 
 heads,</I> to trample upon us and insult over us, to hector and abuse 
 us, nay, and to make perfect slaves of us; they have said to our souls, 
 <I>Bow down, that we may go over,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:23">Isa. li. 23</A>.

 While it is the pleasure of good princes to rule in the hearts of their
 subjects it is the pride of tyrants to ride over their heads; yet the 
 afflicted church in this also owns the hand of God: "Thou hast caused 
 them thus to abuse us;" for the most furious oppressor has no power but 
 what is given him from above.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How gracious God's design was in bringing them into this distress 
 and danger. See what the meaning of it is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Thou, O God! hast proved us, and tried us.</I> Then we are likely to 
 get good by our afflictions, when we look upon them under this notion, 
 for then we may see God's grace and love at the bottom of them and our 
 own honour and benefit in the end of them. By afflictions we are proved 
 as silver in the fire.

 (1.) That our graces, by being tried, may be made more evident and so
 we may be approved, as silver, when it is touched and marked sterling, 
 and this will be <I>to our praise at the appearing of Jesus Christ</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:7">1 Pet. i. 7</A>)

 and perhaps in this world. Job's integrity and constancy were
 manifested by his afflictions. 

 (2.) That our graces, by being exercised, may be made more strong and 
 active, and so we may be improved, as silver when it is refined by the 
 fire and made more clear from its dross; and this will be to our 
 unspeakable advantage, for thus we are made partakers of God's 
 holiness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:10">Heb. xii. 10</A>.

 Public troubles are for the purifying of the church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:35,Re+2:10,De+8:2">Dan. xi. 35; 
 Rev. ii. 10; Deut. viii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How glorious the issue was at last. The troubles of the church will
 certainly end well; these do so, for 

 (1.) The outlet of the trouble is happy. They are in fire and water, 
 but they get through them: "<I>We went through fire and water,</I> and 
 did not perish in the flames or floods." Whatever the troubles of the 
 saints are, blessed be God, there is a way through them. 

 (2.) The inlet to a better state is much more happy: <I>Thou broughtest 
 us out into a wealthy place,</I> into a <I>well-watered</I> place (so 
 the word is), <I>like the gardens of the Lord,</I> and therefore 
 fruitful. God brings his people into trouble that their comforts 
 afterwards may be the sweeter and that their affliction may thus yield 
 the peaceable fruit of righteousness, which will make the poorest place 
 in the world a wealthy place.</P>

 thee my vows,
 &nbsp; 14  Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I
 was in trouble.

 the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.
 &nbsp; 16  Come <I>and</I> hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare

 &nbsp; 20  Blessed <I>be</I> God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor
 his mercy from me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist, having before stirred up all people, and all God's people 
 in particular, to bless the Lord, here stirs up himself and engages 
 himself to do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In his devotions to his God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:13-15"><I>v.</I> 13-15</A>.

 He had called upon others to sing God's praises and to make a joyful
 noise with them; but, for himself, his resolutions go further, and he 
 will praise God,

 1. By costly sacrifices, which, under the law, were offered to the 
 honour of God. All people had not wherewithal to offer these 
 sacrifices, or wanted zeal to be at such an expense in praising God; 
 but David, for his part, being able, is as willing, in this chargeable 
 way to pay his homage to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>I will go into thy house with burnt-offerings.</I> His sacrifices 
 should be public, in the place which God had chosen: "I will go into 
 thy house with them." Christ is our temple, to whom we must bring our 
 spiritual gifts, and by whom they are sanctified.  They should be the 
 best of the king--<I>burnt-sacrifices,</I> which were wholly consumed 
 upon the altar, to the honour of God, and of which the offerer had no 
 share; and burnt-sacrifices <I>of fatlings,</I> not the lame or the 
 lean, but the best fed, and such as would be most acceptable at his own 
 table. God, who is the best, must be served with the best we have. The 
 feast God makes for us is a <I>feast of fat things, full of marrow</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:6">Isa. xxv. 6</A>),

 and such sacrifices should we bring to him. He will <I>offer bullocks
 with goats,</I> so liberal will he be in his return of praise, and not 
 strait-handed: he would not offer that which cost him nothing, but that 
 which cost him a great deal. And this <I>with the incense of rams,</I> 
 that is, with the fat of rams, which being burnt upon the altar, the 
 smoke of it would ascend like the smoke of incense. Or <I>rams with 
 incense.</I> The incense typifies Christ's intercession, without which 
 the fattest of our sacrifices will not be accepted. 

 2. By a conscientious performance of his vows. We do not acceptably
 praise God for our deliverance out of trouble unless we make conscience 
 of paying the vows we made when we were in trouble. This was the 
 psalmist's resolution 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>),

 <I>I will pay thee my vows, which my lips have uttered when I was in 
 trouble.</I> Note,

 (1.) It is very common, and very commendable, when we are under the 
 pressure of any affliction, or in the pursuit of any mercy, to make 
 vows, and solemnly to speak them before the Lord, to bind ourselves out 
 from sin and bind ourselves more closely to our duty; not as if this 
 were an equivalent, or valuable consideration, for the favour of God, 
 but a qualification for receiving the tokens of that favour. 

 (2.) The vows which we made when we were in trouble must not be 
 forgotten when the trouble is over, but be carefully performed, for 
 better it is not to vow than to vow and not pay.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In his declarations to his friends, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He calls together a congregation of good people to hear his thankful
 narrative of God's favours to him: "<I>Come and hear, all you that fear 
 God,</I> for,

 1.  You will join with me in my praises and help me in giving thanks." 
 And we should be as desirous of the assistance of those that fear God 
 in returning thanks for the mercies we have received as in praying for 
 those we want. 

 2. "You will be edified and encouraged by that which I have to say.
 <I>The humble shall hear of it and be glad,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:2">Ps. xxxiv. 2</A>.
 
 <I>Those that fear thee will be glad when they see me</I>

 and therefore let me have their company, and I will declare to them, 
 not to vain carnal people that will banter it and make a jest of it" 
 (pearls are not to be cast before swine); "but to those that fear God, 
 and will make a good use of it, I will declare what God has done for my 
 soul," not in pride and vain-glory, that he might be thought more a 
 favourite of heaven than other people, but for the honour of God, to 
 which we owe this as a just debt, and for the edification of others. 
 Note, God's people should communicate their experiences to each other. 
 We should take all occasions to tell one another of the great and kind 
 things which God has done for us, especially which he has done for our 
 souls, the spiritual blessings with which he has blessed us in heavenly 
 things; these we should be most affected with ourselves, and therefore 
 with these we should be desirous to affect others. Now what was it that 
 God had done for his soul? 

 (1.) He had wrought in him a love to the duty of prayer, and had by his 
 grace enlarged his heart in that duty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>I cried unto him with my mouth.</I> But if God, among other things 
 done for our souls, had not given us the Spirit of adoption, teaching 
 and enabling us to cry, <I>Abba, Father,</I> we should never have done 
 it. That God has given us leave to pray, a command to pray, 
 encouragements to pray, and (to crown all) a heart to pray, is what we 
 have reason to mention with thankfulness to his praise; and the more 
 if, when we cried to him with our mouth, <I>he was extolled with our 
 tongue,</I> that is, if we were enabled by faith and hope to give glory 
 to him when we were seeking for mercy and grace from him, and to praise 
 him for mercy in prospect though not yet in possession. By crying to 
 him we do indeed extol him.  He is pleased to reckon himself honoured 
 by the humble believing prayers of the upright, and this is a great 
 thing which he has done for our souls, that he has been pleased so far 
 to unite interests with us that, in seeking our own welfare, we seek 
 his glory. <I>His exaltation was under my tongue</I> (so it may be 
 read); that is, I was considering in my mind how I might exalt and 
 magnify his name. When prayers are in our mouths praises must be in our 
 hearts.

 (2.) He had wrought in him a dread of sin as an enemy to prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>If I regard iniquity in my heart,</I> I know very well <I>the Lord 
 will not hear me.</I> The Jewish writers, some of them that have the 
 leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy, put a very corrupt gloss 
 upon these words: <I>If I regard iniquity in my heart,</I> that is (say 
 they), If I allow myself only in heart-sins, and iniquity does not 
 break out in my words and actions, <I>God will not hear me,</I> that 
 is, he will not be offended with me, will take no notice of it, so as 
 to lay it to my charge; as if heart-sins were no sins in God's account. 
 The falsehood of this our Saviour has shown in his spiritual exposition 
 of the law,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:7-48">Matt. v.</A>

 But the sense of this place is plain: <I>If I regard iniquity in my
 heart,</I> that is, "If I have favourable thoughts of it, if I love it, 
 indulge it, and allow myself in it, if I treat it as a friend and bid 
 it welcome, make provision for it and am loth to part with it, if I 
 roll it under my tongue as a sweet morsel, though it be but a heart sin 
 that is thus countenanced and made much of, if I delight in it after 
 the inward man, God will not hear my prayer, will not accept it, nor be 
 pleased with it, nor can I expect an answer of peace to it." Note, 
 Iniquity, regarded in the heart, will certainly spoil the comfort and 
 success of prayer; for <I>the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination 
 to the Lord.</I> Those that continue in love and league with sin have 
 no interest either in the promise or in the Mediator, and therefore 
 cannot expect to speed in prayer. 

 (3.) He had graciously granted him an answer of peace to his prayers
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 "<I>But verily God has heard me;</I> though, being conscious to myself
 of much amiss in me, I began to fear that my prayers would be rejected, 
 yet, to my comfort, I found that God was pleased to regard them." This 
 God did for his soul, by answering his prayer, he gave him a token of 
 his favour and an evidence that he had wrought a good work in him. And 
 therefore he concludes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:20"><I>v.</I>  20</A>),
 
 <I>Blessed be God.</I> The

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:18,19">two foregoing verses</A>

 are the major and minor propositions of a syllogism: <I>If I regard
 iniquity in my heart, God will not hear my prayer;</I> that is the 
 proposition: <I>but verily God has heard me;</I> that is the 
 assumption, from which he might have rationally inferred, "Therefore I 
 do not regard iniquity in my heart;" but, instead of taking the comfort 
 to himself, he gives the praise to God: <I>Blessed be God.</I> Whatever 
 are the premises, God's glory must always be the conclusion. <I>God has 
 heard me,</I> and therefore <I>blessed be God.</I> Note, What we win by 
 prayer we must wear with praise. Mercies in answer to prayer do, in a 
 special manner, oblige us to be thankful.  He has <I>not turned away my 
 prayer, nor his mercy.</I> Lest it should be thought that the 
 deliverance was granted for the sake of some worthiness in his prayer, 
 he ascribes it to God's mercy. This he adds by way of correction: "It 
 was not my prayer that fetched the deliverance, but his mercy that sent 
 it." <I>Therefore</I> God does not turn away our prayer, because he 
 does not turn away his own mercy, for that is the foundation of our 
 hopes and the fountain of our comforts, and therefore ought to be the 
 matter of our praises.</P>
