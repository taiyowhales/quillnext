 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David penned this psalm when he was in affliction; and in it,

 I. He complains of the great distress and trouble he was in and
 earnestly begs of God to relieve and succour him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:1-21">ver. 1-21</A>.

 II. He imprecates the judgments of God upon his persecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:22-29">ver. 22-29</A>.

 III. He concludes with the voice of joy and praise, in an assurance
 that God would help and succour him, and would do well for the church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:30-36">ver. 30-36</A>.

 Now, in this, David was a type of Christ, and divers passages in this
 psalm are applied to Christ in the new Testament and are said to have
 their accomplishment in him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:4,9,21">ver. 4, 9, 21</A>),

 and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:22">ver. 22</A>

 refers to the enemies of Christ. So that (like the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:1-31">twenty-second psalm</A>)
 
 it begins with the humiliation and ends with the exaltation of Christ,
 one branch of which was the destruction of the Jewish nation for
 persecuting him, which the imprecations here are predictions of. In
 singing this psalm we must have an eye to the sufferings of Christ, and
 the glory that followed, not forgetting the sufferings of Christians 
 too, and the glory that shall follow them; for it may lead us to think 
 of the ruin reserved for the persecutors and the rest reserved for the 
 persecuted.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician upon Shoshannim. <I>A psalm</I> of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto <I>my</I>
 soul.
 &nbsp; 2  I sink in deep mire, where <I>there is</I> no standing: I am come
 into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
 &nbsp; 3  I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail
 while I wait for my God.
 &nbsp; 4  They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of
 mine head: they that would destroy me, <I>being</I> mine enemies
 wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored <I>that</I> which I took not
 away.
 &nbsp; 5  O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid
 from thee.
 &nbsp; 6  Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT> of hosts, be
 ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded
 for my sake, O God of Israel.
 &nbsp; 7  Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath
 covered my face.
 &nbsp; 8  I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my
 mother's children.
 &nbsp; 9  For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the
 reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
 &nbsp; 10  When I wept, <I>and chastened</I> my soul with fasting, that was
 to my reproach.
 &nbsp; 11  I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to
 them.
 &nbsp; 12  They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I <I>was</I> the
 song of the drunkards.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses David complains of his troubles, intermixing with those 
 complaints some requests for relief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His complaints are very sad, and he pours them out before the Lord, 
 as one that hoped thus to ease himself of a burden that lay very heavy
 upon him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He complains of the deep impressions that his troubles made upon his 
 spirit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>):

 "The <I>waters of affliction,</I> those bitter waters, <I>have come 
 unto my soul,</I> not only threaten my life, but disquiet my mind; they 
 fill my head with perplexing cares and my heart with oppressive grief, 
 so that I cannot enjoy God and myself as I used to do." We shall bear 
 up under our troubles if we can but keep them from our hearts; but, 
 when they put us out of the possession of our own souls, our case is 
 bad. <I>The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity;</I> but what 
 shall we do when the spirit is wounded? That was David's case here. His 
 thoughts sought for something to confide in, and with which to support 
 his hope, but he found nothing: He sunk <I>in keep mire, where there 
 was no standing,</I> no firm footing; the considerations that used to 
 support and encourage him now failed him, or were out of the way, and 
 he was ready to give himself up for gone. He sought for something to
 comfort himself with, but found himself <I>in deep waters</I> that 
 <I>overflowed</I> him, overwhelmed him; he was like a sinking drowning 
 man, in such confusion and consternation. This points at Christ's
 sufferings in his soul, and the inward agony he was in when he said, 
 <I>Now is my soul troubled;</I> and, <I>My soul is exceedingly 
 sorrowful;</I> for it was his soul that he made an offering for sin. 
 And it instructs us, when we are in affliction, to commit the keeping 
 of our souls to God, that we may be neither soured with discontent nor 
 sink into despair.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He complains of the long continuance of his troubles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>I am weary of my crying.</I> Though he could not keep his head above 
 water, yet he cried to his God, and the more death was in his view the 
 more life was in his prayers; yet he had not immediately an answer of 
 peace given in, no, nor so much of that support and comfort in praying 
 which God's people used to have; so that he was almost weary of crying, 
 grew hoarse, and his <I>throat</I> so <I>dried</I> that he could cry no 
 more. Nor had he his wonted satisfaction in believing, hoping, and 
 expecting relief: <I>My eyes fail while I wait for my God;</I> he had 
 almost looked his eyes out, in expectation of deliverance. Yet his 
 pleading this with God is an indication that he is resolved not to give 
 up believing and praying. His throat is dried, but his heart is not; 
 his eyes fail, but his faith does not. Thus our Lord Jesus, on the 
 cross, cried out, <I>Why hast thou forsaken me?</I> yet, at the same 
 time, he kept hold of his relation to him: <I>My God, my God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He complains of the malice and multitude of his enemies, their 
 injustice and cruelty, and the hardships they put upon him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They hated him, they would destroy him, for hatred aims at the
 destruction of the person hated; but what was his iniquity, what was 
 his sin, what provocation had he given them, that they were so spiteful 
 towards him? None at all: "<I>They hate me without a cause;</I> I
 never did them the least injury, that they should bear me such 
 ill-will." Our Saviour applies this to himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:25">John xv. 25</A>):

 <I>They hated me without a cause.</I> We are apt to use this in
 justification of our passion against those that hate us, that we never 
 gave them cause to hate us. But it is rather an argument why we should
 bear it patiently, because then we suffer as Christ did, and may then 
 expect that God will give us redress. "They are <I>my enemies 
 wrongfully,</I> for I have been no enemy to them." In a world where 
 unrighteousness reigns so much we must not wonder if we meet with those 
 that are our enemies wrongfully. Let us take care that we never do 
 wrong and then we may the better bear it if we receive wrong. These 
 enemies were not to be despised, but were very formidable both for 
 their number--<I>They are more than the hairs of my head</I> (Christ's 
 enemies were numerous; those that came to seize him were a great 
 multitude; how were those increased that troubled him!) and for their 
 strength--They <I>are mighty</I> in authority and power. We are weak, 
 but our enemies are strong; for <I>we wrestle against principalities 
 and powers. Then I restored that which I took not away.</I> Applying 
 this to David, it was what his enemies compelled him to (they made him 
 suffer for that offence which he had never been guilty of); and it was 
 what he consented to, that, if possible, he might pacify them and make 
 them to be at peace with him. He might have insisted upon the laws of
 justice and honour, the former not requiring and the latter commonly 
 thought to forbid the restoring of that which we took not away, for 
 that is to wrong ourselves both in our wealth and in our reputation. 
 Yet the case may be such sometimes that it may become our duty. Blessed 
 Paul, though free from all men, yet, for the honour of Christ and the 
 edification of the church, made himself a servant to all. But, applying 
 it to Christ, it is an observable description of the satisfaction which 
 he made to God for our sin by his blood: <I>Then he restored that which 
 he took not away;</I> he underwent the punishment that was due to us, 
 paid our debt, suffered for our offence. God's glory, in some instances 
 of it, was taken away by the sin of man; man's honour, and peace, and 
 happiness, were taken away; it was not he that took them away, and yet 
 by the merit of his death he restored them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He complains of the unkindness of his friends and relations, and 
 this is a grievance which with an ingenuous mind cuts as deeply as any 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>I have become a stranger to my brethren;</I> they make themselves 
 strange to me and use me as a stranger, are shy of conversing with me 
 and ashamed to own me." This was fulfilled in Christ, whose <I>brethren 
 did not believe on him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:5">John vii. 5</A>),

 who <I>came to his own and his own received him not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:11">John i. 11</A>),

 and who was forsaken by his disciples, whom he had been free with as
 his brethren.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He complains of the contempt that was put upon him and the reproach 
 with which he was continually loaded. And in this especially his 
 complaint points at Christ, who for our sakes submitted to the greatest 
 disgrace and made himself of no reputation. We having by sin injured
 God in his honour, Christ made him satisfaction, not only by divesting 
 himself of the honours due to an incarnate deity, but by submitting to 
 the greatest dishonours that could be done to any man. Two things David 
 here takes notice of as aggravations of the indignities done him:--

 (1.) The ground and matter of the reproach, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 They ridiculed him for that by which he both humbled himself and
 honoured God. When men lift up themselves in pride and vain glory they 
 are justly laughed at for their folly; but David chastened his soul, 
 and clothed himself with sackcloth, and from his abasing himself they 
 took occasion to trample upon him. When men dishonour God it is just 
 that their so doing should turn to their dishonour; but when David, 
 purely in devotion to God and to testify his respect to him, <I>wept, 
 and chastened his soul with fasting,</I> and <I>made sackcloth his 
 garment,</I> as humble penitents used to do, instead of commending his 
 devotion and recommending it as a great example of piety, they did all 
 they could both to discourage him in it and to prevent others from 
 following his good example; for <I>that was to his reproach.</I> They 
 laughed at him as a fool for mortifying himself thus; and even for this 
 he <I>became a proverb to them;</I> they made him the common subject of 
 their banter. We must not think it strange if we be ill spoken of for
 that which is well done, and in which we have reason to hope that we 
 are accepted of God. Our Lord Jesus was stoned for his good works

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:32">John x. 32</A>),

 and when he cried, <I>Eli, Eli--My God, my God,</I> was bantered, as if 
 he called for Elias. 

 (2.) The persons that reproached him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 [1.] Even the gravest and the most honourable, from whom better was
 expected: <I>Those that sit in the gate speak against me,</I> and their 
 reproaches pass for the dictates of senators and the decrees of judges, 
 and are credited accordingly. 

 [2.] The meanest, and the most despicable, the abjects

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:15">Ps. xxxv. 15</A>),

 and scum of the country, the <I>children of fools,</I> yea, the
 <I>children of base men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:8">Job xxx. 8</A>.

 Such drunkards as these make themselves vile, and he was the song of
 the drunkards; they made themselves and their companions merry with 
 him. See the bad consequences of the sin of drunkenness; it makes men 
 <I>despisers of those that are good,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:3">2 Tim. iii. 3</A>.

 When <I>the king was made sick with bottles of wine he stretched out
 his hand with scorners,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:5">Hos. vii. 5</A>.

 The bench of the drunkards is the seat of the scornful. See what is
 commonly the lot of the best of men: those that are the praise of the 
 wise are the song of fools. But it is easy to those that rightly judge 
 of things to despise being thus despised.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His confessions of sin are very serious 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>O God! thou knowest my foolishness,</I> what is and what is not; my 
 sins that I am guilty of are not hidden from thee, and therefore thou 
 knowest how innocent I am of those crimes which they charge upon me." 
 Note, Even when, as to men's unjust accusations, we plead <I>Not 
 guilty,</I> yet, before God, we must acknowledge ourselves to have 
 deserved all that is brought upon us, and much worse. This is the 
 genuine confession of a penitent, who knows that he cannot prosper in 
 covering his sin, and that <I>therefore</I> it is his wisdom to 
 acknowledge it, because it is naked and open before God.

 1. He knows the corruption of our nature: <I>Thou knowest the 
 foolishness</I> that is bound up in my heart. All our sins take rise
 from our foolishness. 

 2. He knows the transgressions of our lives; they are not hidden from
 him, no, not our heart-sins, no, not those that are committed most 
 secretly. They are all done in his sight, and are never cast behind his 
 back till they are repented of and pardoned. This may aptly be applied 
 to Christ, for he knew no sin, yet he was made sin for us; and God knew 
 it, nor was it hidden from him, when it pleased the Lord to bruise him 
 and put him to grief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His supplications are very earnest. 

 1. For himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>Save me, O God!</I> save me from sinking, from despairing." Thus 
 Christ was heard in that he feared, for he was saved from letting fall 
 his undertaking,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>.

 2. For his friends 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Let not those that wait on thee, O Lord God of hosts! and that seek 
 thee, O God of Israel!</I> (under these two characters we ought to seek 
 God, and in seeking him to wait on him, as the <I>God of hosts,</I> who 
 has all power to help, and as the <I>God of Israel</I> in covenant with 
 his people, whom therefore he is engaged in honour and truth to help) 
 <I>be ashamed and confounded for my sake.</I> This intimates his fear 
 that if God did not appear for him it would be a discouragement to all 
 other good people and would give their enemies occasion to triumph over 
 them, and his earnest desire that whatever became of him all that seek 
 God, and wait upon him, might be kept in heart and kept in countenance, 
 and might neither be discouraged in themselves nor exposed to contempt 
 from others. If Jesus Christ had not been owned and accepted of his 
 Father in his sufferings, all that seek God, and wait for him, would 
 have been ashamed and confounded; but they have confidence towards God, 
 and in his name come boldly to the throne of grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His plea is very powerful, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:7,9"><I>v.</I> 7, 9</A>.

 Reproach was one of the greatest of his burdens: "Lord, roll away the
 reproach, and plead my cause, for,

 1. It is for thee that I am reproached, for serving thee and trusting 
 in thee: <I>For thy sake I have borne reproach.</I>" Those that are 
 evil spoken of for well-doing may with a humble confidence leave it to 
 God to <I>bring forth their righteousness as the light.</I> 

 2. "It is with thee that I am reproached: <I>The zeal of thy house has
 eaten me up,</I> that is, has made me forget myself, and do that which 
 they wickedly turn to my reproach. Those that hate thee and thy house 
 for that reason hate me, because they know how zealously affected I am 
 to it. It is this that has made them ready to eat me up and has eaten 
 up all the love and respect I had among them." Those that blasphemed 
 God, and spoke ill of his word and ways, did therefore reproach David 
 for believing in his word and walking in his ways. Or it may be 
 construed as an instance of David's zeal for God's house, that he 
 resented all the indignities done to God's name as if they had been 
 done to his own name. He laid to heart all the dishonour done to God 
 and the contempt cast upon religion; these he laid nearer to his heart 
 than any outward troubles of his own. And <I>therefore</I> he had 
 reason to hope God would interest himself in the reproaches cast upon 
 him, because he had always interested himself in the reproaches cast 
 upon God. Both the parts of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:9">this verse</A>

 are applied to Christ. 

 (1.) It was an instance of his love to his Father that <I>the zeal of 
 his house did even eat him up</I> when he whipped the buyers and 
 sellers out of the temple, which reminded his disciples of this text,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+2:17">John ii. 17</A>.

 (2.) It was an instance of his self-denial, and that he pleased not
 himself, that the <I>reproaches of those that reproached God fell upon
 him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:3">Rom. xv. 3</A>),

 and therein he set us an example.</P>

 &nbsp; 21  They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they
 gave me vinegar to drink.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David had been speaking before of the spiteful reproaches which his 
 enemies cast upon him; here he adds, <I>But, as for me, my prayer is 
 unto thee.</I> They spoke ill of him for his fasting and praying, and 
 for that he was made the song of the drunkards; but, notwithstanding 
 that, he resolves to continue praying. Note, Though we may be jeered 
 for well-doing, we must never be jeered out of it. Those can bear but 
 little for God, and their confessing his name before men, that cannot 
 bear a scoff and a hard word rather than quit their duty. David's 
 enemies were very abusive to him, but this was his comfort, that he had 
 a God to go to, with whom he would lodge his cause. "They think to 
 carry their cause by insolence and calumny; but I use other methods.
 Whatever they do, <I>As for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Lord!</I>" 
 And it was in an acceptable time, not the less acceptable for being a 
 time of affliction. God will not drive us from him, though it is need 
 that drives us to him; nay, it is the more acceptable, because the 
 misery and distress of God's people make them so much the more the 
 objects of his pity: it is seasonable for him to help them when all 
 other helps fail, and they are undone, and feel that they are undone, 
 if he do not help them. We find this expression used concerning Christ. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:8">Isa. xlix. 8</A>,

 <I>In an acceptable time have I heard thee.</I> Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What his requests are. 

 1. That he might have a gracious audience given to his complaints, the 
 cry of his affliction, and the desire of his heart. <I>Hear me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and again, <I>Hear me, O Lord!</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 
 <I>Hear me speedily</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 not only hear what I say, but grant what I ask. Christ knew that
 <I>the Father heard him always,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:42">John xi. 42</A>.

 2. That he might be rescued out of his troubles, might be saved from
 sinking under the load of grief (<I>Deliver me out of the mire;</I> let
 me not stick in it, so some, but help me out, and <I>set my feet on a
 rock,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:2">Ps. xl. 2</A>),

 might be saved from his enemies, that they might not swallow him up,
 nor have their will against him: "<I>Let me be delivered from those
 that hate me,</I> as a lamb from the paw of a lion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Though I have come into keep waters

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 where I am ready to conclude that the floods will overflow me, yet let
 my fears be prevented and silenced; let not the waterflood, though it 
 flow upon me, overflow me,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Let me not fall into the gulf of despair; let not that deep swallow me
 up; let not that pit shut her mouth upon me, for then I am undone." He 
 gave himself up for lost in the beginning of the psalm; yet now he has 
 his head above water, and is not so weary of crying as he thought 
 himself. 

 3. That God would turn to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 that he would smile upon him, and not hide his face from him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.
 
 The tokens of God's favour to us, and the light of his countenance 
 shining upon us, are enough to keep our spirits from sinking in the 
 deepest mire of outward troubles, nor need we desire any more to make 
 us safe and easy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 "Draw nigh to my soul, to manifest thyself to it, and that shall redeem
 it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What his pleas are to enforce these petitions. 

 1. He pleads God's mercy and truth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>In the multitude of thy mercy hear me.</I> There is mercy in God, a 
 multitude of mercies, all kinds of mercy, inexhaustible mercy, mercy 
 enough for all, enough for each; and hence we must take our 
 encouragement in praying. The truth also of his salvation (the truth of 
 all those promises of salvation which he has made to those that trust 
 in him) is a further encouragement. He repeats his argument taken from 
 the mercy of God: "<I>Hear me,</I> for <I>thy lovingkindness of 
 good.</I> It is so in itself; it is rich and plentiful and abundant. It 
 is so in the account of all the saints; it is very precious to them, it 
 is their life, their joy, their all. O let me have the benefit of it! 
 Turn to me, <I>according to the multitude of thy tender mercies,</I>" 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 See how highly he speaks of the goodness of God: in him there are
 mercies, tender mercies, and a multitude of them. If we think well of 
 God, and continue to do so under the greatest hardships, we need not 
 fear but God will do well for us; for <I>he takes pleasure in those 
 that hope in his mercy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:">Ps. cxlvii. 11</A>.

 2. He pleads his own distress and affliction: "<I>Hide not thy face</I>
 from me, <I>for I am in trouble</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 and therefore need thy favour; therefore it will come seasonably, and 
 therefore I shall know how to value it." He pleads particularly the 
 reproach he was under and the indignities that were done him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 <I>Thou hast known my reproach, my shame, and my dishonour.</I> See 
 what a stress is laid upon this; for, in the sufferings of Christ for 
 us, perhaps nothing contributed more to the satisfaction he made for 
 sin, which had been so injurious to God in his honour, than the 
 reproach, and shame, and dishonour he underwent, which God took notice 
 of, and accepted as more than an equivalent for the everlasting shame 
 and contempt which our sins had deserved, and therefore we must by 
 repentance take shame to ourselves and bear the reproach of our youth. 
 And if at any time we be called out to suffer reproach, and shame, and 
 dishonour, for his sake, this may be our comfort, that he knows it, 
 and, as he is before-hand with us, so he will not be behind-hand with 
 us. The Psalmist speaks the language of an ingenuous nature when he 
 says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Reproach has broken my heart; I am full of heaviness;</I> for it 
 bears hard upon one that knows the worth of a good name to be put under 
 a bad character; but when we consider what an honour it is to be 
 dishonoured for God, and what a favour to be counted worthy to suffer 
 shame for his name (as they deemed it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+5:41">Acts v. 41</A>),

 we shall see there is no reason at all why it should sit so heavily or
 be any heart-breaking to us.

 3. He pleads the insolence and cruelty of his enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 
 <I>Deliver me because of my enemies,</I> because they were such as he 
 had before described them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 "<I>My adversaries are all before thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 thou knowest what sort of men they are, what danger I am in from them, 
 what enemies they are to thee, and how much thou art reflected upon in 
 what they do and design against me." One instance of their barbarity is 
 given 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>They gave me gall for my meat</I> (the word signifies a bitter herb, 
 and is often joined with wormwood) <I>and in my thirst they gave me 
 vinegar to drink.</I> This was literally fulfilled in Christ, and did 
 so directly point to him that he would not say <I>It is finished</I> 
 till this was fulfilled; and, in order that his enemies might have 
 occasion to fulfil it, he said, <I>I thirst,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:28,29">John xix. 28, 29</A>.

 Some think that the hyssop which they put to his mouth with the vinegar
 was the bitter herb which they gave him with the vinegar for his meat. 
 See how particularly the sufferings of Christ were foretold, which 
 proves the scripture to be the word of God, and how exactly the 
 predictions were fulfilled in Jesus Christ, which proves him to be the 
 true Messiah. This is he that should come, and we are to look for no 
 other. 

 4. He pleads the unkindness of his friends and his disappointment in
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;</I> they all 
 failed him like the brooks in summer. This was fulfilled in Christ, for 
 in his sufferings all his disciples forsook him and fled. We cannot
 expect too little from men (miserable comforters are they all); nor can 
 we expect too much from God, for he is the Father of mercy and the God 
 of all comfort and consolation.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These imprecations are not David's prayers against his enemies, but 
 prophecies of the destruction of Christ's persecutors, especially the 
 Jewish nation, which our Lord himself foretold with tears, and which 
 was accomplished about forty years after the death of Christ. The first 
 two verses of this paragraph are expressly applied to the judgments of
 God upon the unbelieving Jews by the apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:22,23,Ro+11:9,10">Rom. xi. 9, 10</A>),

 and therefore the whole must look that way. The rejection of the Jews 
 for rejecting Christ, as it was a signal instance of God's justice and 
 an earnest of the vengeance which God will at last take on all that are 
 obstinate in their infidelity, so it was, and continues to be, a 
 convincing proof of the truth of the Christian religion. One great 
 objection against it, at first, was, that it set aside the ceremonial 
 law; but its doing so was effectually justified, and that objection 
 removed, when God so remarkably set it aside by the utter destruction 
 of the temple, and the sinking of those, with the Mosaic economy, that 
 obstinately adhered to it in opposition to the gospel of Christ. Let us 
 observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What the judgments are which should come upon the crucifiers of 
 Christ; not upon all of them, for there were those who had a hand in 
 his death and yet repented and found mercy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23,3:14,15">Acts ii. 23; iii. 14, 15</A>),

 but upon those of them and their successors who justified it by an
 obstinate infidelity and rejection of his gospel, and by an inveterate 
 enmity to his disciples and followers. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:15,16">1 Thess. ii. 15, 16</A>.

 It is here foretold,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That their sacrifices and offerings should be a mischief and 
 prejudice to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Let their table become a snare.</I> This may be understood of the 
 altar of the Lord, which is called <I>his table and theirs</I> because 
 in feasting upon the sacrifices they were partakers of the altar. This 
 should have been for their welfare or peace (for they were 
 peace-offerings), but it became a snare and a trap to them; for by 
 their affection and adherence to the altar they were held fast in their 
 infidelity and hardened in their prejudices against Christ, that altar 
 which those had no right to eat of who continued to serve the 
 tabernacle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:10">Heb. xiii. 10</A>.

 Or it may be understood of their common creature-comforts, even their
 necessary food; they had given Christ gall and vinegar, and therefore 
 justly shall their meat and drink be made gall and vinegar to them. 
 When the supports of life and delights of sense, through the corruption 
 of our nature, become an occasion of sin to us, and are made the food 
 and fuel of our sensuality, then our table is a snare, which is a good 
 reason why we should never feed ourselves without fear,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:12">Jude 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That they should never have the comfort either of that knowledge or 
 of that peace which believers are blessed with in the gospel of Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 that they should be given up,

 (1.) To a judicial blindness: <I>Let their eyes be darkened,</I> that 
 they see not the glory of God in the face of Christ. Their sin was that 
 they would not see, but shut their eyes against the light, loving 
 darkness rather; their punishment was that they should not see, but be 
 given up to their own hearts' lusts, which were hardening, and the god 
 of this world should be permitted to blind their minds,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:4">2 Cor. iv. 4</A>.

 This was foretold concerning them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+6:10">Isa. vi. 10</A>),
 
 and Christ ratified it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:14,15,Joh+12:40">Matt. xiii. 14, 15; John xii. 40</A>.

 (2.) To a judicial terror. There is a gracious terror, which opens the
 way to comfort, such as that of Paul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:6">Acts ix. 6</A>);

 he trembled and was astonished. But this is a terror that shall never 
 end in peace, but shall make their loins continually to shake, through 
 horror of conscience, as Belshazzar, when the joints of his loins were 
 loosed. "Let them be driven to despair, and filled with constant
 confusion." This was fulfilled in the desperate counsels of the Jews 
 when the Romans came upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That they should fall and lie under God's anger and fiery 
 indignation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Pour out thy indignation upon them.</I> Note, Those who reject God's 
 great salvation proffered to them may justly fear that his indignation 
 will be poured out upon them; for those that submit not to the Son of 
 his love will certainly be made the generation of his wrath. It is the 
 doom passed on those who believe not in Christ that the <I>wrath of God 
 abideth on them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:36">John iii. 36</A>);

 it takes hold of them, and will never let them go. Salvation itself
 will not save those that are not willing to be ruled by it. Behold the 
 goodness and severity of God!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That their place and nation should be utterly taken away, the very 
 thing they were afraid of, and to prevent which, as they pretended, 
 they persecuted Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:48">John xi. 48</A>):

 <I>Let their habitation be desolate</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 which was fulfilled when their country was laid waste by the Romans,
 and <I>Zion, for their sakes, was ploughed as a field,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:12">Mic. iii. 12</A>.

 The temple was the house which they were in a particular manner proud 
 of, but this was <I>left unto them desolate,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:38">Matt. xxiii. 38</A>.

 Yet that is not all; it ought to be some satisfaction to us, if we be 
 cut off from the enjoyment of our possessions, that others will have 
 the benefit of them when we are dislodged: but it is here added, <I>Let 
 none dwell in their tents,</I> which was remarkably fulfilled in Judah 
 and Jerusalem, for after the destruction of the Jews it was long ere 
 the country was inhabited to any purpose. But this is applied 
 particularly to Judas, by St. Peter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:20">Acts i. 20</A>.

 For, he being <I>felo de se--a suicide,</I> we may suppose his estate
 was confiscated, so that <I>his habitation was desolate and no man</I> 
 of his own kindred <I>dwelt therein.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That their way to ruin should be downhill, and nothing should stop 
 them, nor interpose to prevent it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 "Lord, leave them to themselves, to <I>add iniquity to iniquity.</I>" 
 Those that are bad, if they be given up to their own hearts' lusts, 
 will certainly be worse; they will add sin to sin, nay, they will 
 <I>add rebellion to their sin,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:37">Job xxxiv. 37</A>.

 It is said of the Jews that they <I>filled up their sin always,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:16">1 Thess. ii. 16</A>.

 <I>Add the punishment of iniquity to their iniquity</I> (so some read
 it), for the same word signifies both sin and punishment, so close is
 their connexion. If men will sin, God will reckon for it. But those
 that have multiplied to sin may yet find mercy, for God multiplies to
 pardon, through the righteousness of the Mediator; and therefore, that
 they might be precluded from all hopes of mercy, he adds, <I>Let them
 not come into thy righteousness,</I> to receive the benefit of the
 righteousness of God, which is by faith in a Mediator, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:9">Phil. iii. 9</A>.

 Not that God shuts out any from that righteousness, for the gospel
 excludes none that do not by their unbelief exclude themselves; but let 
 them be left to take their own course and they will never come into 
 this government; for being ignorant of the demands of God's 
 righteousness, and going about to establish the merit of their own, 
 they <I>have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:3">Rom. x. 3</A>.

 And those that are so proud and self-willed that they will not come
 into God's righteousness shall have their doom accordingly; they 
 themselves have decided it: they <I>shall not come into his 
 righteousness.</I> Let not those expect any benefit by it that are not 
 willing and glad to be beholden to it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. That they should be cut off from all hopes of happiness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):
 
 <I>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living;</I> let them not 
 be suffered to live any longer, since, the longer they live, the more 
 mischief they do. Multitudes of the unbelieving Jews fell by sword and 
 famine, and none of those who had embraced the Christian faith perished 
 among them; the nation, as a nation, was blotted out, and became not a 
 people. Many understand it of their rejection from God's covenant and 
 all the privileges of it; that is <I>the book of the living:</I> "Let 
 the commonwealth of Israel itself, Israel according to the flesh, now
 become alienated from that covenant of promise which hitherto it has 
 had the monopoly of. Let it appear that they were never written in the 
 Lamb's book of life, but reprobate silver let <I>men call them, because 
 the Lord has rejected them.</I> Let them <I>not be written with the 
 righteous;</I> that is, let them not have a place in the congregation 
 of the saints when they shall all be gathered in the general assembly 
 of those whose names are written in heaven," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:5">Ps. i. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the sin is for which these dreadful judgments should be 
 brought upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>They persecute him whom thou hast smitten, and talk to the grief of 
 thy wounded.</I>

 1. Christ was he whom God had smitten, for <I>it pleased the Lord to 
 bruise him,</I> and he was esteemed <I>stricken, smitten of God, and 
 afflicted,</I> and therefore men <I>hid their faces from him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:3,4,10">Isa. liii. 3, 4, 10</A>.

 They persecuted him with a rage reaching up to heaven; they cried,
 <I>Crucify him, crucify him.</I> Compare that of St. Peter with this, 
 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23">Acts ii. 23</A>.

 Though he was <I>delivered by the counsel and foreknowledge of God,</I>
 it was <I>with wicked hands that they crucified and slew him.</I> They 
 talked to the grief of the Lord Jesus when he was upon the cross, 
 saying, <I>He trusted in God, let him deliver him,</I> than which 
 nothing could be said more grieving.

 2. The suffering saints were God's wounded, wounded in his cause and
 for his sake, and them they persecuted, and <I>talked to their 
 grief.</I> For these things <I>wrath came upon them to the 
 uttermost,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+2:16">1 Thess. ii. 16</A>;
 
 and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:34-36">Matt. xxiii. 34</A>,

 &c. This may be understood more generally, and it teaches us that
 nothing is more provoking to God than to insult over those whom he has 
 smitten, and to add affliction to the afflicted, upon which it justly 
 follows here, <I>Add iniquity to iniquity;</I> see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:15">Zech. i. 15</A>.

 Those that are of a wounded spirit, under trouble and fear about their
 spiritual state, ought to be very tenderly dealt with, and care must be 
 taken not to <I>talk to their grief and not to make the heart of the 
 righteous sad.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. What the psalmist thinks of himself in the midst of all 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):
 
 "<I>But I am poor and sorrowful;</I> that is the worst of my case, 
 under outward afflictions, yet <I>written among the righteous,</I> and 
 not under God's indignation as they are." It is better to be poor and 
 sorrowful, with the blessing of God, than rich and jovial and under his 
 curse. For those who come into God's righteousness shall soon see an 
 end of their poverty and sorrow, and his salvation shall set them up on 
 high, which is the thing that David here prays for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:10">Isa. lxi. 10</A>.

 This may be applied to Christ. He was, in his humiliation, poor and 
 sorrowful, a man of sorrows, and that had not where to lay his head.
 But God highly exalted him; the salvation wrought for him, the 
 salvation wrought by him, <I>set him up on high, far above all 
 principalities and powers.</I></P>

 I. He resolves to praise God himself, not doubting but that therein he 
 should be accepted of him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>):

 "<I>I will praise the name of God,</I> not only with my heart, but with 
 my song, and <I>magnify him with thanksgiving;</I>" for he is pleased 
 to reckon himself magnified by the thankful praises of his people. It 
 is intimated that all Christians ought to glorify God with their 
 praises, <I>in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs.</I> And <I>this 
 shall please the Lord,</I> through Christ the Mediator of our praises 
 as well as of our prayers, better than the most valuable of the legal 
 sacrifices 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 <I>an ox or bullock.</I> This is a plain intimation that in the days of 
 the Messiah an end should be put, not only to the sacrifices of 
 atonement, but to those of praise and acknowledgment which were 
 instituted by the ceremonial law; and, instead of them, spiritual 
 sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving are accepted--the calves of our 
 lips, not the calves of the stall, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:15">Heb. xiii. 15</A>.

 It is a great comfort to us that humble and thankful praises are more
 pleasing to God than the most costly pompous sacrifices are or ever 
 were.</P>

 II. He encourages other good people to rejoice in God and continue 
 seeking him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:32,33"><I>v.</I> 32, 33</A>):

 <I>The humble shall see this and be glad.</I> They shall observe, to 
 their comfort,

 1. The experiences of the saints. They shall see how ready God is to
 hear the poor when they cry to him, and to give them that which they 
 call upon him for, how far he is from despising his prisoners; though 
 men despise them, he favours them with his gracious visits and will 
 find a time to enlarge them. <I>The humble shall see this and be 
 glad,</I> not only because when one member is honoured all the members 
 rejoice with it, but because it is an encouragement to them in their 
 straits and difficulties to trust in God. It shall revive the hearts of 
 those who seek God to see more seals and subscriptions to this truth, 
 that Jacob's God never said to Jacob's seed, <I>Seek you me in 
 vain.</I> 

 2. The exaltation of the Saviour, for of him the psalmist had been
 speaking, and of himself as a type of him. When his sorrows are over,
 and he enters into the joy that was set before him, when he is heard 
 and discharged from his imprisonment in the grave, the humble shall 
 look upon it and be glad, and those that seek God through Christ shall 
 live and be comforted, concluding that, if they suffer with him, they 
 shall also reign with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He calls upon all the creatures to praise God, the heaven, and 
 earth, and sea, and the inhabitants of each, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 Heaven and earth, and the hosts of both, were made by him, and
 therefore <I>let heaven and earth praise him.</I> Angels in heaven, and
 saints on earth, may each of them in their respective habitations 
 furnish themselves with matter enough for constant praise. Let the 
 fishes of the sea, though mute to a proverb, praise the Lord, for the 
 sea is his, and he made it. The praises of the world must be offered
 for God's favours to his church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:35,36"><I>v.</I> 35, 36</A>.

 For God will save Zion, the holy mountain, where his service was kept
 up. He will save all that are sanctified and set apart to him, all that 
 employ themselves in his worship, and all those over whom Christ 
 reigns; for he was King upon the holy hill of Zion. He has mercy in 
 store for the cities of Judah, of which tribe Christ was. God will do 
 great things for the gospel church, in which let all that wish well to 
 it rejoice. For,

 1. It shall be peopled and inhabited. There shall be added to it such 
 as shall be saved. <I>The cities of Judah shall be built,</I> 
 particular churches shall be formed and incorporated according to the 
 gospel model, that there may be a remnant to <I>dwell there</I> and to 
 <I>have it in possession,</I> to enjoy the privileges conferred upon it 
 and to pay the tributes and services required from it. Those that love 
 his name, that have a kindness for religion in general, shall embrace 
 the Christian religion, and take their place in the Christian church; 
 they shall dwell therein, as citizens, and of the household of God 

 2. It shall be perpetuated and inherited. Christianity was not to be
 <I>res unius &aelig;tatis--a transitory thing.</I> No: <I>The seed of
 his servants shall inherit it.</I> God will secure and raise up for 
 himself a seed to serve him, and they shall inherit the privileges of 
 their fathers; for the promise is to you and your children, as it was 
 of old. <I>I will be a God to thee, and thy seed after thee.</I> The 
 land of promise shall never be lost for want of heirs, for God <I>can 
 out of stones raise up children unto Abraham</I> and will do so rather 
 than the entail shall be cut off. David shall never want a man to
 stand before him. The Redeemer shall see his seed, and prolong his days 
 in them, till the mystery of God shall be finished and the mystical 
 body completed. And since the holy seed is the substance of the world, 
 and if that were all gathered in the world would be at an end quickly, 
 it is just that for this assurance of the preservation of it heaven and 
 earth should praise him.</P>
