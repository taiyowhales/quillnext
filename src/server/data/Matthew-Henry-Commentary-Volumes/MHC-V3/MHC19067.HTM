 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm relates to the church and is calculated for the public. Here 
 is, 

 I. A prayer for the prosperity of the church of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II.  A prayer for the conversion of the Gentiles and the bringing of
 them into the church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:2-5">ver. 2-5</A>.

 III. A prospect of happy and glorious times when God shall do this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 Thus was the psalmist carried out by the spirit of prophecy to foretel
 the glorious estate of the Christian church, in which Jews and Gentiles 
 should unite in one flock, the beginning of which blessed work ought to 
 be the matter of our joy and praise, and the completing of it of our 
 prayer and hope, in singing this psalm.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician on Neginoth. A psalm <I>or</I> song.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  God be merciful unto us, and bless us; <I>and</I>
 cause his face to shine upon us; Selah.
 &nbsp; 2  That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among
 all nations.
 &nbsp; 3  Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
 thee.
 &nbsp; 4  O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt
 judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth.
 Selah.
 &nbsp; 5  Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
 thee.
 &nbsp; 6  <I>Then</I> shall the earth yield her increase; <I>and</I> God, <I>even</I>
 our own God, shall bless us.
 &nbsp; 7  God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear
 him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The composition of this psalm is such as denotes the penman's 
 affections to have been very warm and lively, by which spirit of 
 devotion he was elevated to receive the spirit of prophecy concerning 
 the enlargement of God's kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He begins with a prayer for the welfare and prosperity of the church 
 then in being, in the happiness of which he should share, and think 
 himself happy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Our Saviour, in teaching us to say, <I>Our Father,</I> has intimated 
 that we ought to pray with and for others; so the psalmist here prays 
 not, <I>God be merciful to me, and bless me,</I> but to <I>us,</I> and 
 bless <I>us;</I> for we must make supplication for all saints, and be 
 willing and glad to take our lot with them. We are here taught, 

 1. That all our happiness comes from God's mercy and takes rise in 
 that; and therefore the first thing prayed for is, <I>God be merciful 
 to us,</I> to us sinners, and pardon our sins

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:13">Luke xviii. 13</A>),

 to us miserable sinners, and help us out of our miseries. 

 2.  That it is conveyed by God's blessing, and secured in that: <I>God 
 bless us;</I> that is, give us an interest in his promises, and confer 
 upon us all the good contained in them. God's speaking well to us 
 amounts to his doing well for us. <I>God bless us</I> is a 
 comprehensive prayer; it is a pity such excellent words should ever be 
 used slightly and carelessly, and as a byword. 

 3. That it is completed in the light of his countenance: <I>God cause
 his face to shine upon us;</I> that is, God by his grace qualify us for 
 his favour and then give us the tokens of his favour. We need desire no 
 more to make us happy than to have God's face shine upon us, to have 
 God love us, and let us know that he loves us: <I>To shine with us</I> 
 (so the margin reads it); <I>with us</I> doing our endeavour, and let 
 it crown that endeavour with success. If we by faith walk with God, we 
 may hope that his face will shine with us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He passes from this to a prayer for the conversion of the Gentiles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>That thy way may be known upon earth.</I> "Lord, I pray not only 
 that thou wilt be merciful to us and bless us, but that thou wilt be 
 merciful to all mankind, <I>that thy way may be known upon earth.</I>" 
 Thus public-spirited must we be in our prayers. <I>Father in heaven, 
 hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come.</I> We shall have never the 
 less of God's mercy, and blessing, and favour, for others coming in to 
 share with us. Or it may be taken thus: "<I>God be merciful to us Jews, 
 and bless us, that</I> thereby thy way may be known upon earth, that by 
 the peculiar distinguishing tokens of thy favour to us others may be 
 allured to come and join themselves to us, saying, <I>We will go with 
 you, for we have heard that God is with you,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23">Zech.  viii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. These verses, which point at the conversion of the Gentiles, may be 
 taken, 

 (1.) As a prayer; and so it speaks the desire of the Old-Testament 
 saints; so far were they from wishing to monopolize the privileges of 
 the church that they desired nothing more than the throwing down of the 
 enclosure and the laying open of the advantages.  See then how the 
 spirit of the Jews, in the days of Christ and his apostles, differed 
 from the spirit of their fathers. The Israelites indeed that were of 
 old desired that God's name might be known among the Gentiles; those 
 counterfeit Jews were enraged at the preaching of the gospel to the 
 Gentiles; nothing in Christianity exasperated them so much as that did. 
 
 (2.) As a prophecy that it shall be as he here prays.  Many
 scripture-prophecies and promises are wrapped up in prayers, to 
 intimate that the answer of the church's prayer is as sure as the 
 performance of God's promises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Three things are here prayed for, with reference to the 
 Gentiles:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That divine revelation might be sent among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Two things he desires might be known upon earth, even among all nations,
 and not to the nation of the Jews only:--

 [1.] God's way, the rule of duty: "Let them all know, as well as we do, 
 <I>what is good and what the Lord our God requires of them;</I> let 
 them be blessed and honoured with the same righteous statutes and 
 judgments which are so much the praise of our nation and the envy of 
 all its neighbours,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:8">Deut. iv. 8</A>.

 [2.] His saving health, or his salvation. The former is wrapped up in
 his law, this in his gospel. If God make known his way to us, and we
 walk in it, he will show us his saving health, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:23">Ps. l. 23</A>.

 Those that have themselves experimentally known the pleasantness of
 God's ways, and the comforts of his salvation, cannot but desire and 
 pray that they may be known to others, even among all nations. All upon 
 earth are bound to walk in God's way, all need his salvation, and there 
 is in it enough for all; and therefore we should pray that both the one 
 and the other may be made known to all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That divine worship may be set up among them, as it will be where 
 divine revelation is received and embraced 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Let the people praise thee, O God!</I> let them have matter for 
 praise, let them have hearts for praise; yea, let not only some, but 
 <I>all the people, praise thee,</I>" all nations in their national 
 capacity, some of all nations. It is again repeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 as that which the psalmist's heart was very much upon. Those that 
 delight in praising God themselves cannot but desire that others also 
 may be brought to praise him, that he may have the honour of it and 
 they may have the benefit of it. It is a prayer,

 [1.] That the gospel might be preached to them, and then they would 
 have cause enough to praise God, as for the day-spring after a long and 
 dark night. <I>Ortus est sol--The sun has risen.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+8:8">Acts viii. 8</A>.

 [2.] That they might be converted and brought into the church, and then 
 they would have a disposition to praise God, the living and true God, 
 and not the dumb and dunghill deities they had worshipped, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:4">Dan. v. 4</A>.

 Then their hard thoughts of God would be silenced, and they would see 
 him, in the gospel glass, to be love itself, and the proper object of 
 praise. 

 [3.] That they might be incorporated into solemn assemblies, and might 
 praise God in a body, that they might all together praise him with one 
 mind and one mouth. Thus a face of religion appears upon a land when 
 God is publicly owned and the ordinances of religious worship are duly 
 celebrated in religious assemblies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That the divine government may be acknowledged and cheerfully 
 submitted to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>O let the nations be glad, and sing for joy!</I> Holy joy, joy in 
 God and in his name, is the heart and soul of thankful praise. That 
 <I>all the people</I> may <I>praise thee, let the nations be glad.</I> 
 Those that <I>rejoice in the Lord always will in every thing give 
 thanks.</I> The joy he wishes to the nations is holy joy; for it is joy 
 in God's dominion, joy that <I>God has taken to himself his great power 
 and has reigned,</I> which the unconverted <I>nations are angry at,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:17,18">Rev. xi. 17, 18</A>.

 Let them be glad,

 [1.] That <I>the kingdom is the Lord's</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:28">Ps. xxii. 28</A>),

 that he, as an absolute sovereign, shall govern the nations upon earth,
 that by the kingdom of his providence he shall overrule the affairs of 
 kingdoms according to the counsel of his will, though they neither know 
 him nor own him, and that in due time he shall disciple all nations by 
 the preaching of his gospel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:19">Matt. xxviii. 19</A>)

 and set up the kingdom of his grace among them upon the ruin of the 
 devil's kingdom--that he shall make them a willing people in the day of 
 his power, and even <I>the kingdoms of this world shall become the 
 kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ.</I>

 [2.] That <I>every man's judgment proceeds from the Lord.</I> "Let them
 be glad that <I>thou shalt judge the people righteously,</I> that thou 
 shalt give a law and gospel which shall be a righteous rule of 
 judgment, and shalt pass an unerring sentence, according to that rule, 
 upon all the children of men, against which there will lie no 
 exception." Let us all be glad that we are not to be one another's 
 judges, but that he that judges us is the Lord, whose judgment we are 
 sure is according to truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He concludes with a joyful prospect of all good when God shall do 
 this, when the nations shall be converted and brought to praise 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The lower world shall smile upon them, and they shall have the 
 fruits of that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Then shall the earth yield her increase.</I> Not but that God gave 
 rain from heaven and fruitful seasons to the nations when they <I>sat 
 in darkness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+14:17">Acts xiv. 17</A>);

 but when they were converted the earth yielded its increase to God; the
 meat and the drink then became a <I>meat-offering and a drink-offering 
 to the Lord our God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:14">Joel ii. 14</A>);

 and then it was fruitful to some good purpose.  Then it yielded its
 increase more than before to the comfort of men, who through Christ 
 acquired a covenant-title to the fruits of it and had a sanctified use 
 of it. Note, The success of the gospel sometimes brings outward mercies 
 along with it; righteousness exalts a nation.  See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+4:2,62:9">Isa. iv. 2; lxii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The upper world shall smile upon them, and they shall have the 
 favours of that, which is much better: <I>God, even our own God, shall 
 bless us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 And again
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 <I>God shall bless us.</I> Note,
 
 (1.) There are a people in the world that can, upon good grounds, call 
 God their God. 

 (2.) Believers have reason to glory in their relation to God and the 
 interest they have in him. It is here spoken with an air of triumph. 
 <I>God, even our own God.</I> 

 (3.) Those who through grace call God their own may with a humble
 confidence expect a blessing from him. If he be our God, he will bless
 us with special blessings.

 (4.) The blessing of God, as ours in covenant, is that which sweetens
 all our creature-comforts to us, and makes them comforts indeed; then 
 we receive the increase of the earth as a mercy indeed when with it 
 God, even our own God, gives us his blessing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. All the world shall hereby be brought to do like them: <I>The ends 
 of the earth shall fear him,</I> that is, worship him, which is to be 
 done with a godly fear. The blessings God bestows upon us call upon us 
 not only to love him, but to fear him, to keep up high thoughts of him 
 and to be afraid of offending him. When the gospel begins to spread it
 shall get ground more and more, till it reach to the ends of the earth. 
 The leaven hidden in the meal shall diffuse itself, till the whole be 
 leavened.  And the many blessings which those will own themselves to 
 have received that are brought into the church invite others to join 
 themselves to them. It is good to cast in our lot with those that are 
 the blessed of the Lord.</P>
