 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is the first of those fifteen which are here put together
 under the title of "songs of degrees." It is well that it is not
 material what the meaning of that title should be, for nothing is
 offered towards the explication of it, no, not by the Jewish writers
 themselves, but what is conjectural. These psalms do not seem to be
 composed all by the same hand, much less all at the same time. Four of
 them are expressly ascribed to David, and one is said to be designed
 for Solomon, and perhaps penned by him; yet

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:1-6,129:1-8">cxxvi. and cxxix.</A>

 seem to be of a much later date. Some of them are calculated for the
 closet (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:1-7,130:1-8">cxx. and cxxx.</A>),

 some for the family (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:1-5,128:1-6">cxxvii. and cxxviii.</A>),

 some for the public assembly (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:1-9,134:1-3">cxxii. and cxxxiv.</A>),

 and some occasional, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+124:1-8,132:118">cxxiv., and cxxxii.</A> 

 So that it should seem, they had not this title from the author, but 
 from the publisher. Some conjecture that they are so called from their 
 singular excellency (as the song of songs, so the song of degrees, is a 
 most excellent song, in the highest degree), others from the tune they 
 were set to, or the musical instruments they were sung to, or the 
 raising of the voice in singing them. Some think they were sung on the 
 fifteen steps or stairs, by which they went up from the outward court 
 of the temple to the inner, others at so many stages of the people's 
 journey, when they returned out of captivity. I shall only observe,

 1. That they are all short psalms, all but one very short (three of
 them have but three verses apiece), and that they are placed next to

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:1-176">Ps. cxix.</A>,

 which is by much the longest of all. Now as that was one psalm divided
 into many parts, so these were many psalms, which, being short, were
 sometimes sung all together, and made, as it were, one psalm, observing 
 only a pause between each; as many steps make one pair of stairs. 

 2. That, in the composition of them, we frequently meet with the
 figure they call climax, or an ascent, the preceding word repeated, and 
 then rising to something further, as 120, "With him that hated peace. I 
 peace." 121, "Whence cometh my help; my help cometh." "He that keepeth 
 thee shall not slumber; he that keepeth Israel." 122, "Within thy 
 gates, O Jerusalem. Jerusalem is builded." 123, "Until that he have 
 mercy upon us. Have mercy upon us." And the like in most of them, if 
 not all. Perhaps for one of these reasons they are called songs of 
 degrees.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is supposed to have been penned by David upon occasion of 
 Doeg's accusing him and the priests to Saul, because it is like 52, 
 which was penned upon that occasion, and because the psalmist complains 
 of his being driven out of the congregation of the Lord and his being 
 forced among barbarous people. 

 I. He prays to God to deliver him from the mischief designed him by 
 false and malicious tongues, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. He threatens the judgments of God against such,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III. He complains of his wicked neighbours that were quarrelsome and 
 vexatious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 In singing this psalm we may comfort ourselves in reference to the 
 scourge of the tongue, when at any time we fall unjustly under the lash 
 of it, that better than we have smarted from it.</P>

 and he heard me.
 &nbsp; 2  Deliver my soul, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, from lying lips, <I>and</I> from a

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Deliverance from a false tongue obtained by prayer. David records
 his own experience of this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was brought into distress, into great distress, by <I>lying lips 
 and a deceitful tongue.</I> There were those that sought his ruin, and 
 had almost effected it, by lying. 

 (1.) By telling lies to him. They flattered him with professions and
 protestations of friendships, and promises of kindness and service to 
 him, that they might the more securely and without suspicion carry on 
 their designs against him, and might have an opportunity, by betraying 
 his counsels, to do him a mischief. They smiled in his face and kissed 
 him, even when they were aiming to smite him under the fifth rib. The 
 most dangerous enemies, and those which it is most hard to guard 
 against, are such as carry on their malicious designs under the colour 
 of friendship. The Lord deliver every good man from such lying lips.

 (2.) By telling lies of him. They forged false accusations against him 
 and <I>laid to his charge things that he knew not.</I> This has often 
 been the lot not only of the innocent, but of the excellent ones, of 
 the earth, who have been greatly distressed by lying lips, and have not 
 only had their names blackened and made odious by calumnies in 
 conversation, but their lives, and all that is dear to them in this 
 world, endangered by false-witness-bearing in judgment. David was
 herein a type of Christ, who was distressed by lying lips and deceitful 
 tongues.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In this distress he had recourse to God by faithful and fervent 
 prayer: <I>I cried unto the Lord.</I> Having no fence against false 
 tongues, he appealed to him who has all men's hearts in his hand, who 
 has power over the consciences of bad men, and can, when he pleases, 
 bridle their tongues. His prayer was, "<I>Deliver my soul, O Lord! from 
 lying lips,</I> that my enemies may not by these cursed methods work my 
 ruin." He that had prayed so earnestly to be kept from lying 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:29">Ps. cxix. 29</A>)

 and hated it so heartily in himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:163"><I>v.</I> 163</A>)

 might with the more confidence pray to be kept from being belied by 
 others, and from the ill consequences of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He obtained a gracious answer to this prayer. God heard him; so that 
 his enemies, though they carried their designs very far, were baffled 
 at last, and could not prevail to do him the mischief they intended. 
 The God of truth is, and will be, the protector of his people from 
 lying lips, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:6">Ps. xxxvii. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The doom of a false tongue foretold by faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 As God will preserve his people from this mischievous generation, so he 
 will reckon with their enemies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:3,7">Ps. xii. 3, 7</A>.

 The threatening is addressed to the sinner himself, for the awakening 
 of his conscience, if he have any left: "Consider <I>what shall be 
 given unto thee, and what shall be done unto thee,</I> by the righteous 
 Judge of heaven and earth, <I>thou false tongue.</I>" Surely sinners 
 durst not do as they do if they knew, and would be persuaded to think, 
 what will be in the end thereof. Let liars consider what shall be given 
 to them: <I>Sharp arrows of the Almighty, with coals of juniper,</I> 
 that is, they will fall and lie for ever under the wrath of God, and 
 will be made miserable by the tokens of his displeasure, which will fly 
 swiftly like arrows, and will strike the sinner ere he is aware and 
 when he sees not who hurts him. This is threatened against liars,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:7">Ps. lxiv. 7</A>.

 <I>God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be 
 wounded.</I> They set God at a distance from them, but from afar his 
 arrows can reach them. They are sharp arrows, and arrows of the mighty, 
 the Almighty; for they will pierce through the strongest armour and 
 strike deep into the hardest heart. The terrors of the Lord are his 
 arrows 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:4">Job vi. 4</A>),

 and his wrath is compared to burning coals of juniper, which do not 
 flame or crackle, like thorns under a pot, but have a vehement heat, 
 and keep fire very long (some say, a year round) even when they seem to 
 be gone out. This is the portion of the false tongue; for all that love 
 and make a lie shall have their portion in the lake that burns 
 eternally, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:15">Rev. xxii. 15</A>.</P>

 The psalmist here complains of the bad neighbourhood into which he was
 driven; and some apply the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:3,4">two foregoing verses</A>

 to this: "What shall the deceitful tongue give, what shall it do to
 those that lie open to it? What shall a man get by living among such 
 malicious deceitful men? Nothing but <I>sharp arrows</I> and <I>coals
 of juniper,</I>" all the mischiefs of a false and spiteful tongue, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:4">Ps. lvii. 4</A>.

 <I>Woe is me,</I> says David, that I am forced to dwell among such, 
 <I>that I sojourn in Mesech and Kedar.</I> Not that David dwelt in the 
 country of Mesech or Kedar; we never find him so far off from his own 
 native country; but he dwelt among rude and barbarous people, like the 
 inhabitants of Mesech and Kedar: as, when we would describe an ill 
 neighbourhood, we say, We dwell among Turks and heathens. This made him 
 cry out, <I>Woe is me!</I> 

 1. He was forced to live at a distance from the ordinances of God.
 While he was in banishment, he looked upon himself as a sojourner, 
 never at home but when he was near God's altars; and he cries out, 
 "<I>Woe is me</I> that my sojourning is prolonged, that I cannot get 
 home to my resting-place, but am still kept at a distance!" So some 
 read it. Note, A good man cannot think himself at home while he is 
 banished from God's ordinances and has not them within reach. And it is 
 a great grief to all that love God to be without the means of grace and 
 of communion with God: when they are under a force of that kind they 
 cannot but cry out, as David here, <I>Woe to me!</I> 

 2. He was forced to live among wicked people, who were, upon many
 accounts, troublesome to him. He <I>dwell in the tents of Kedar,</I> 
 where the shepherds were probably in an ill name for being litigious, 
 like the herdsmen of Abraham and Lot. It is a very grievous burden to a 
 good man to be cast into, and kept in, the company of those whom he 
 hopes to be for ever separated from (like Lot in Sodom;

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:8">2 Pet. ii. 8</A>);

 to dwell long with such is grievous indeed, for they are thorns, 
 vexing, and scratching, and tearing, and they will show the old enmity 
 that is in the <I>seed of the serpent</I> against the <I>seed of the 
 woman.</I> Those that David dwelt with were such as not only hated him, 
 but hated peace, and proclaimed war with it, who might write on their 
 weapons of war not <I>Sic sequimur pacem--Thus we aim at peace,</I> but 
 <I>Sic persequimur--Thus we persecute.</I> Perhaps Saul's court was the 
 Mesech and Kedar in which David dwelt, and Saul was the man he meant 
 that hated peace, whom David studied to oblige and could not, but the 
 more service he did him the more exasperated he was against him. See 
 here, 

 (1.) The character of a very good man in David, who could truly say, 
 though he was a man of war, <I>I am for peace;</I> for living peaceably 
 with all men and unpeaceably with none. <I>I peace</I> (so it is in the 
 original); "I love peace and pursue peace; my disposition is to peace 
 and my delight is in it. I pray for peace and strive for peace, will do 
 any thing, submit to any thing, part with any thing, in reason, for 
 peace. <I>I am for peace,</I> and have made it to appear that I am so." 
 <I>The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable.</I>

 (2.) The character of the worst of bad men in David's enemies, who 
 would pick quarrels with those that were most peaceably disposed: 
 "<I>When I speak they are for war;</I> and the more forward for war the 
 more they find me inclined to peace." He spoke with all the respect and 
 kindness that could be, proposed methods of accommodation, spoke 
 reason, spoke love; but they would not so much as hear him patiently, 
 but cried out, "To arms! to arms!" so fierce and implacable were they, 
 and so bent to mischief. Such were Christ's enemies: for his love they 
 were his adversaries, and for his good words, and good works, they 
 stoned him. If we meet with such enemies, we must not think it strange, 
 nor love peace the less for our seeking it in vain. <I>Be not overcome 
 of evil,</I> no, not of such evil as this, <I>but,</I> even when thus 
 tried, still try to <I>overcome evil with good.</I></P>
