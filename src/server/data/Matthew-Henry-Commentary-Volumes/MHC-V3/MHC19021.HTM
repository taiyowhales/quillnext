 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As the foregoing psalm was a prayer for the king that God would protect 
 and prosper him, so this is a thanksgiving for the success God had 
 blessed him with. Those whom we have prayed for we ought to give thanks 
 for, and particularly for kings, in whose prosperity we share. They are 
 here taught, 

 I. To congratulate him on his victories, and the honour he had achieved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. To confide in the power of God for the completing of the ruin of
 the enemies of his kingdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:7-13">ver. 7-13</A>.

 In this there is an eye to Messiah the Prince, and the glory of his
 kingdom; for to him divers passages in this psalm are more applicable
 than to David himself.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The king shall joy in thy strength, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
 &nbsp; 2  Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not
 withholden the request of his lips. Selah.
 &nbsp; 3  For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou
 settest a crown of pure gold on his head.
 &nbsp; 4  He asked life of thee, <I>and</I> thou gavest <I>it</I> him, <I>even</I>
 length of days for ever and ever.
 &nbsp; 5  His glory <I>is</I> great in thy salvation: honour and majesty
 hast thou laid upon him.
 &nbsp; 6  For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made
 him exceeding glad with thy countenance.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here speaks for himself in the first place, professing that his 
 joy was in God's strength and in his salvation, and not in the strength 
 or success of his armies. He also directs his subjects herein to 
 rejoice with him, and to give God all the glory of the victories he had 
 obtained; and all with an eye to Christ, of whose triumphs over the
 powers of darkness David's victories were but shadows.

 1. They here congratulate the king on his joys and concur with him in
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>The king rejoices,</I> he uses to rejoice <I>in thy strength,</I> 
 and so do we; what pleases the king pleases us,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+3:36">2 Sam. iii. 36</A>.

 Happy the people the character of whose king it is that he makes God's
 strength his confidence and God's salvation his joy, that is pleased 
 with all the advancements of God's kingdom and trusts God to bear him 
 out in all he does for the service of it. Our Lord Jesus, in his great 
 undertaking, relied upon help from heaven, and pleased himself with the 
 prospect of that great salvation which he was thereby to work out. 

 2. They gave God all the praise of those things which were the matter
 of their king's rejoicing.

 (1.) That God had heard his prayers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Thou hast given him his heart's desire</I> (and there is no prayer 
 accepted but what is the heart's desire), the very thing they begged of 
 God for him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:4">Ps. xx. 4</A>.

 Note, God's gracious returns of prayer do, in a special manner, require 
 our humble returns of praise. When God gives to Christ the heathen for 
 his inheritance, gives him to see his seed, and accepts his 
 intercession for all believers, he give him his heart's desire. 

 (2.) That God had surprised him with favours, and much outdone his 
 expectations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness.</I> All our 
 blessings are blessings of goodness, and are owing, not at all to any 
 merit of ours, but purely and only to God's goodness. But the psalmist 
 here reckons it in a special manner obliging that these blessings were 
 given in a preventing way; this fixed his eye, enlarged his soul, and 
 endeared his God, as one expresses it. When God's blessings come sooner 
 and prove richer than we imagine, when they are given before we prayed 
 for them, before we were ready for them, nay, when we feared the 
 contrary, then it may be truly said that he prevented us with them. 
 Nothing indeed prevented Christ, but to mankind never was any favour 
 more preventing than our redemption by Christ and all the blessed 
 fruits of his mediation.

 (3.) That God had advanced him to the highest honour and the most 
 extensive power: "<I>Thou hast set a crown of pure gold upon his 
 head</I> and kept it there, when his enemies attempted to throw it 
 off." Note, Crowns are at God's disposal; no head wears them but God 
 sets them there, whether in judgment to his land or for mercy the event 
 will show. On the head of Christ God never set a crown of gold, but of 
 thorns first, and then of glory. 

 (4.) That God had assured him of the perpetuity of his kingdom, and 
 therein had done more for him than he was able either to ask or think 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "When he went forth upon a perilous expedition <I>he asked</I> his 
 <I>life of thee,</I> which he then put into his hand, <I>and thou</I> 
 not only <I>gavest him that,</I> but withal gavest him <I>length of 
 days for ever and ever,</I> didst not only prolong his life far beyond 
 his expectation, but didst assure him of a blessed immortality in a 
 future state and of the continuance of his kingdom in the Messiah that 
 should come of his loins." See how God's grants often exceed our 
 petitions and hopes, and infer thence how rich he is in mercy to those 
 that call upon him. See also and rejoice in the length of the days of 
 Christ's kingdom. He was dead, indeed, that we might live through him; 
 but he is alive, and lives for evermore, and <I>of the increase of his 
 government and peace there shall be no end;</I> and because he thus 
 lives we shall thus live also.

 (5.) That God had advanced him to the highest honour and dignity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>His glory is great,</I> far transcending that of all the 
 neighbouring princes, in the salvation thou hast wrought for him and by 
 him." The glory which every good man is ambitious of is to see the 
 salvation of the Lord. <I>Honour and majesty hast thou laid upon
 him,</I> as a burden which he must bear, as a charge which he must 
 account for. Jesus Christ <I>received from God the Father honour and 
 glory</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:17">2 Pet. i. 17</A>),

 the glory which he had with him before the worlds were,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:5">John xvii. 5</A>.

 And on him is laid the charge of universal government and to him all
 power in heaven and earth is committed. 

 (6.) That God had given him the satisfaction of being the channel of 
 all bliss to mankind 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast set him to be blessings for ever</I>" (so the margin 
 reads it), "thou hast made him to be a universal blessing to the world, 
 in whom the families of the earth are, and shall be blessed; and so 
 thou hast made him exceedingly glad with the countenance thou hast 
 given to his undertaking and to him in the prosecution of it." See how 
 the spirit of prophecy gradually rises here to that which is peculiar 
 to Christ, for none besides is blessed for ever, much less a blessing 
 for ever to that eminency that the expression denotes: and of him it is 
 said that God made him full of joy with his countenance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this we should rejoice in his joy and triumph in his 
 exaltation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  For the king trusteth in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and through the mercy of
 the most High he shall not be moved.
 &nbsp; 8  Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand
 shall find out those that hate thee.
 &nbsp; 9  Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine
 anger: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire
 shall devour them.
 &nbsp; 10  Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their
 seed from among the children of men.
 &nbsp; 11  For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a
 mischievous device, <I>which</I> they are not able <I>to perform.</I>
 &nbsp; 12  Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, <I>when</I> thou
 shalt make ready <I>thine arrows</I> upon thy strings against the face
 of them.
 &nbsp; 13  Be thou exalted, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, in thine own strength: <I>so</I> will we
 sing and praise thy power.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist, having taught his people to look back with joy and praise 
 on what God had done for him and them, here teaches them to look 
 forward with faith, and hope, and prayer, upon what God would further 
 do for them: <I>The king rejoices in God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and therefore we will be thankful; <I>the king trusteth in God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 therefore will we be encouraged. The joy and confidence of Christ our 
 King is the ground of all our joy and confidence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They are confident of the stability of David's kingdom. <I>Through 
 the mercy of the Most High,</I> and not through his own merit or 
 strength, <I>he shall not be moved.</I> His prosperous state shall not 
 be disturbed; his faith and hope in God, which are the stay of his 
 spirit, shall not be shaken. The mercy of the Most High (the divine 
 goodness, power, and dominion) is enough to secure our happiness, and 
 therefore our trust in that mercy should be enough to silence all our 
 fears. God being at Christ's right hand in his sufferings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:8">Ps. xvi. 8</A>)

 and he being at God's right hand in his glory, we may be sure he shall 
 not, he cannot, be moved, but continues ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are confident of the destruction of all the impenitent 
 implacable enemies of David's kingdom. The success with which God had 
 blessed David's arms hitherto was an earnest of the rest which God 
 would give him from all his enemies round about, and a type of the 
 total overthrow of all Christ's enemies who would not have him to reign 
 over them. Observe, 

 1. The description of his enemies. They are such as hate him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 They hated David because God had set him apart for himself, hated
 Christ because they hated the light; but both were hated without any 
 just cause, and in both God was hated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:23,25">John xv. 23, 25</A>.

 2. The designs of his enemies
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>They intended evil against thee, and imagined a mischievous 
 device;</I> they pretended to fight against David only, but their 
 enmity was against God himself. Those that aimed to un-king David 
 aimed, in effect, to un-God Jehovah. What is devised and designed 
 against religion, and against the instruments God raises up to support 
 and advance it, is very evil and mischievous, and God takes it as 
 devised and designed against himself and will so reckon for it.

 (3.) The disappointment of them: "They devise what they are <I>not able 
 to perform,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Their malice is impotent, and they <I>imagine a vain thing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1">Ps. ii. 1</A>.
 
 (4.) The discovery of them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Thy hand shall find them out.</I> Though ever so artfully disguised 
 by the pretences and professions of friendship, though mingled with the 
 faithful subjects of this kingdom and hardly to be distinguished from 
 them, though flying from justice and absconding in their close places, 
 yet thy hand shall find them out wherever they are." There is no 
 escaping God's avenging eye, no going out of the reach of his hand; 
 rocks and mountains will be no better shelter at last than fig-leaves 
 were at first. 

 (5.) The destruction of them; it will be an utter destruction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:27">Luke xix. 27</A>);

 they shall be swallowed up and devoured, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Hell, the portion of all Christ's enemies, is the complete misery both
 of body and soul. <I>Their fruit and their seed shall be
 destroyed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The enemies of God's kingdom, in every age, shall fall under the same
 doom, and the whole generation of them will at last be rooted out, and 
 all opposing rule, principality, and power, shall be put down. The 
 arrows of God's wrath shall confound them and put them to flight, being 
 levelled at the face of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 That will be the lot of daring enemies that face God. The fire of God's 
 wrath will consume them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 they shall not only be cast into a furnace of fire

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:42">Matt. xiii. 42</A>),

 but he shall make them themselves as a fiery oven or furnace; they
 shall be their own tormentors; the reflections and terrors of their own 
 consciences will be their hell. Those that might have had Christ to
 rule and save them, but rejected him and fought against him, shall find 
 that even the remembrance of that will be enough to make them, to 
 eternity, a fiery oven to themselves: it is the worm that dies not.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. In this confidence they beg of God that he would still appear for 
 his anointed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 that he would act for him in his own strength, by the immediate 
 operations of his power as Lord of hosts and Father of spirits, making 
 little use of means and instruments. And,

 1. Hereby he would exalt himself and glorify his own name. "We have but 
 little strength, and are not so active for thee as we should be, which 
 is our shame; Lord, take the work into thy own hands, do it, without 
 us, and it will be thy glory." 

 2. Hereupon they would exalt him: "<I>So will we sing, and praise thy 
 power,</I> the more triumphantly." The less God has of our service when 
 a deliverance is in the working the more he must have of our praises 
 when it is wrought without us.</P>
