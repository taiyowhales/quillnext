 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm relates not to any temporal concern, either personal or 
 public, but it is wholly taken up with the affairs of the soul. It is 
 reckoned one of the seven penitential psalms, which have sometimes been 
 made use of by penitents, upon their admission into the church; and, in 
 singing it, we are all concerned to apply it to ourselves. The psalmist 
 here expresses, 

 I. His desire towards God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. His repentance before God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:3,4">ver.  3, 4</A>.

 III. His attendance upon God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 IV. His expectations from God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.

 And, as in water face answers to face, so does the heart of one humble
 penitent to another.</P>

 <P>A song of degrees.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Out of the depths have I cried unto
 thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 2  Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice
 of my supplications.
 &nbsp; 3  If thou, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
 stand?
 &nbsp; 4  But <I>there is</I> forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be
 feared.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we are taught,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Whatever condition we are in, though ever so deplorable, to continue 
 calling upon God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The best men may sometimes be in <I>the depths,</I> in great trouble
 and affliction, and utterly at a loss what to do, in the depths of 
 distress and almost in the depths of despair, the spirit low and dark, 
 sinking and drooping, cast down and disquieted. But, in the greatest 
 depths, it is our privilege that we may cry unto God and be heard. A 
 prayer may reach the heights of heaven, though not out of the depths of 
 hell, yet out of the depths of the greatest trouble we can be in in 
 this world, Jeremiah's out of the dungeon, Daniel's out of the den, and 
 Jonah's out of the fish's belly.  It is our duty and interest to cry 
 unto God, for that is the likeliest way both to prevent our sinking 
 lower and to recover us out of the <I>horrible pit and miry clay,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:1,2">Ps. xl. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. While we continue calling upon God to assure ourselves of an answer 
 of peace from him; for this is that which David in faith prays for 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Lord, hear my voice,</I> my complaint and prayer, and <I>let thy 
 ears be attentive</I> to the voice both of my afflictions and <I>of my 
 supplications.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We are taught to humble ourselves before the justice of God as 
 guilty in his sight, and unable to answer him for one of a thousand of 
 our offences 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>If thou, Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord! who shall 
 stand?</I> His calling God <I>Lord</I> twice, in so few words, 
 <I>Jah</I> and <I>Adonai,</I> is very emphatic, and intimates a very 
 awful sense of God's glorious majesty and a dread of his wrath.  Let us 
 learn here, 

 1. To acknowledge our iniquities, that we cannot justify ourselves 
 before God, or plead Not guilty. There is that which is remarkable in 
 our iniquities and is liable to be animadverted upon.  

 2.  To own the power and justice of God, which are such that, if he 
 were extreme to mark what we do amiss, there would be no hopes of 
 coming off. His eye can discover enough in the best man to ground a 
 condemnation upon; and, if he proceed against us, we have no way to 
 help ourselves, we cannot stand, but shall certainly be cast. If God 
 deal with us in strict justice, we are undone; if he make remarks upon 
 our iniquities, he will find them to be many and great, greatly 
 aggravated and very provoking; and then, if he should proceed 
 accordingly, he would shut us out from all hope of his favour and shut 
 us up under his wrath; and what could we do to help ourselves? We could 
 not make our escape, nor resist not bear up under his avenging hand. 

 3.  Let us admire God's patience and forbearance; we should be undone 
 if he were to mark iniquities, and he knows it, and therefore bears 
 with us.  <I>It is of his mercy that we are not consumed</I> by his 
 wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We are taught to cast ourselves upon the pardoning mercy of God, 
 and to comfort ourselves with that when we see ourselves obnoxious to 
 his justice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Here is, 

 1. God's grace discovered, and pleaded with him, by a penitent sinner:
 <I>But there is forgiveness with thee.</I> It is our unspeakable 
 comfort, in all our approaches to God, that there is forgiveness with 
 him, for that is what we need. He has put himself into a capacity to 
 pardon sin; he has declared himself gracious and merciful, and ready to 
 forgive,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:6,7">Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7</A>.

 He has promised to forgive the sins of those that do repent. Never any 
 that dealt with him found him implacable, but easy to be entreated, and 
 swift to show mercy. With us there is iniquity, and therefore it is 
 well for us that with him there is forgiveness. <I>There is a 
 propitiation with thee,</I> so some read it. Jesus Christ is the great 
 propitiation, the ransom which God has found; he is ever with him, as 
 advocate for us, and through him we hope to obtain forgiveness. 

 2.  Our duty designed in that discovery, and inferred from it: 
 "<I>There is forgiveness with thee,</I> not that thou mayest be made 
 bold with and presumed upon, but <I>that thou mayest be feared</I>--in 
 general, that thou mayest be worshipped and served by the children of 
 men, who, being sinners, could have no dealings with God, if he were 
 not a Master that could pass by a great many faults." But this 
 encourages us to come into his service that we shall not be turned off 
 for every misdemeanour; no, nor for any, if we truly repent. This does 
 in a special manner invite those who have sinned to repent, and return 
 to the fear of God, that he is gracious and merciful, and will receive 
 them upon their repentance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:13,Mt+3:2">Joel ii. 13; Matt. iii. 2</A>.

 And, particularly, we are to have a holy awe and reverence of God's 
 pardoning mercy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:5">Hos. iii. 5</A>,

 <I>They shall fear the Lord, and his goodness</I>); and <I>then</I> we 
 may expect the benefit of the forgiveness that is with God when we make 
 it the object of our holy fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  I wait for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I
 hope.
 &nbsp; 6  My soul <I>waiteth</I> for the Lord more than they that watch for
 the morning: <I>I say, more than</I> they that watch for the morning.
 &nbsp; 7  Let Israel hope in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: for with the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>there is</I>
 mercy, and with him <I>is</I> plenteous redemption.
 &nbsp; 8  And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, I. The psalmist engages himself to trust in God and to wait for 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. His dependence upon God, expressed in a climax, it being a a song of
 degrees, or ascents: "<I>I wait for the Lord;</I> from him I expect 
 relief and comfort, believing it will come, longing till it does come, 
 but patiently bearing the delay of it, and resolving to look for it 
 from no other hand. <I>My soul doth wait;</I> I wait for him in 
 sincerity, and not in profession only. I am an expectant, and it is 
 <I>for the Lord</I> that <I>my soul waits,</I> for the gifts of his 
 grace and the operations of his power." 

 2. The ground of that dependence: <I>In his word do I hope.</I> We must 
 hope for that only which he has promised in his word, and not for the 
 creatures of our own fancy and imagination; we must hope for it because 
 he has promised it, and not from any opinion of our own merit. 

 3. The degree of that dependence--"<I>more than those that watch for 
 the morning,</I> who are,

 (1.) Well-assured that the morning will come; and so am I that God will 
 return in mercy to me, according to his promise; for God's covenant is 
 more firm than the ordinances of day and night, for they shall come to 
 an end, but that is everlasting." 

 (2.) Very desirous that it would come.  Sentinels that keep guard upon 
 the walls, those that watch with sick people, and travellers that are 
 abroad upon their journey, long before day wish to see the dawning of 
 the day; but more earnestly does this good man long for the tokens of 
 God's favour and the visits of his grace, and more readily will he be 
 aware of his first appearances than they are of day. Dr. Hammond reads 
 it thus, <I>My soul hastens to the Lord, from the guards in the 
 morning, the guards in the morning,</I> and gives this sense of it, "To 
 thee I daily betake myself, early in the morning, addressing my 
 prayers, and my very soul, before thee, at the time that the priests 
 offer their morning sacrifice."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He encourages all the people of God in like manner to depend upon 
 him and trust in him: <I>Let Israel hope in the Lord</I> and <I>wait 
 for</I> him; not only the body of the people, but every good man, who 
 <I>surnames himself by the name of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:5">Isa. xliv. 5</A>.

 Let all that devote themselves to God cheerfully stay themselves upon 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>),
 
 for two reasons:--

 1. Because the light of nature discovers to us that <I>there is mercy 
 with him,</I> that the God of Israel is a merciful God and <I>the 
 Father of mercies. Mercy is with</I> him; not only inherent in his 
 nature, but it is his delight, it is his darling attribute; it is with 
 him in all his works, in all his counsels. 

 2.  Because the light of the gospel discovers to us that <I>there is 
 redemption with him,</I> contrived by him, and to be wrought out <I>in 
 the fulness of time;</I> it was in the beginning hidden in God. See 
 here,

 (1.) The nature of this redemption; it is redemption from sin, from all 
 sin, and therefore can be no other than that eternal redemption which 
 Jesus Christ became the author of; for it is he <I>that saves his 
 people from their sins</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+1:21">Matt. i. 21</A>),

 that <I>redeems them from all iniquity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:14">Tit. ii. 14</A>),

 and <I>turns away ungodliness from Jacob,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:26">Rom. xi. 26</A>.

 It is he that redeems us both from the condemning and from the 
 commanding power of sin. 

 (2.) The riches of this redemption; it <I>is plenteous redemption;</I> 
 there is an all-sufficient fulness of merit and grace in the Redeemer, 
 enough for all, enough for each; enough for me, says the believer. 
 Redemption from sin includes redemption from all other evils, and 
 therefore is a plenteous redemption. 

 (3.) The persons to whom the benefits of this redemption belong: <I>He
 shall redeem Israel,</I> Israel according to the spirit, all those who 
 are in covenant with God, as Israel was, and who are <I>Israelites 
 indeed, in whom is no guile.</I></P>
