 T<FONT SIZE=-1>HIS</FONT> book of Job stands by itself, is not 
 connected with any other, and is therefore to be considered alone. Many 
 copies of the Hebrew Bible place it after the book of Psalms, and some 
 after the Proverbs, which perhaps has given occasion to some learned 
 men to imagine it to have been written by Isaiah or some of the later 
 prophets. But, as the subject appears to have been much more ancient, 
 so we have no reason to think but that the composition of the book was, 
 and that therefore it is most fitly placed first in this collection of 
 divine morals: also, being doctrinal, it is proper to precede and 
 introduce the book of Psalms, which is devotional, and the book of 
 Proverbs, which is practical; for how shall we worship or obey a God 
 whom we know not? As to this book,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are sure that it is given by inspiration of God, though we are 
 not certain who was the penman of it. The Jews, though no friends to 
 Job, because he was a stranger to the commonwealth of Israel, yet, as 
 faithful conservators of <I>the oracles of God</I> committed to them, 
 always retained this book in their sacred canon. The history is 
 referred to by one apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:11">James v. 11</A>)

 and one passage
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:13"><I>ch.</I> v. 13</A>)

 is quoted by another apostle, with the usual form of quoting scripture,
 <I>It is written,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+3:19">1 Cor. iii. 19</A>.

 It is the opinion of many of the ancients that this history was written
 by Moses himself in Midian, and delivered to his suffering brethren in 
 Egypt, for their support and comfort under their burdens, and the 
 encouragement of their hope that God would in due time deliver and 
 enrich them, as he did this patient sufferer. Some conjecture that it 
 was written originally in Arabic, and afterwards translated into 
 Hebrew, for the use of the Jewish church, by Solomon (so Monsieur 
 Jurieu) or some other inspired writer. It seems most probable to me
 that Elihu was the penman of it, at least of the discourses, because

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:15,16"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 15, 16</A>)

 he mingles the words of a historian with those of a disputant: but
 Moses perhaps wrote the first two chapters and the last, to give light 
 to the discourses; for in them God is frequently called <I>Jehovah,</I> 
 but not once in all the discourses, except

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:9"><I>ch.</I> xii. 9</A>.

 That name was but little known to the patriarchs before Moses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+6:3">Exod. vi. 3</A>.

 If Job wrote it himself, some of the Jewish writers themselves own him
 a <I>prophet among the Gentiles;</I> if Elihu, we find he had a spirit 
 of prophecy which <I>filled him with matter and constrained him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:18"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are sure that it is, for the substance of it, a true history, 
 and not a romance, though the dialogues are poetical. No doubt there 
 was such a man as Job; the prophet Ezekiel names him with Noah and 
 Daniel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:14">Ezek. xiv. 14</A>.

 The narrative we have here of his prosperity and piety, his strange
 afflictions and exemplary patience, the substance of his conferences 
 with his friends, and God's discourse with him out of the whirlwind, 
 with his return at length to a very prosperous condition, no doubt is 
 exactly true, though the inspired penman is allowed the usual liberty 
 of putting the matter of which Job and his friends discoursed into his 
 own words.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We are sure that it is very ancient, though we cannot fix the 
 precise time either when Job lived or when the book was written. So 
 many, so evident, are its hoary hairs, the marks of its antiquity, that 
 we have reason to think it of equal date with the book of Genesis 
 itself, and that holy Job was contemporary with Isaac and Jacob; though 
 not coheir with them of the promise of the earthly Canaan, yet a 
 joint-expectant with them of the <I>better country,</I> that is, <I>the 
 heavenly.</I> Probably he was of the posterity of Nahor, Abraham's 
 brother, whose first-born was <I>Uz</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:21">Gen. xxii. 21</A>),

 and in whose family religion was for some ages kept up, as appears,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:53">Gen. xxxi. 53</A>,

 where God is called, not only <I>the God of Abraham,</I> but <I>the God
 of Nahor.</I> He lived before the age of man was shortened to seventy 
 or eighty, as it was in Moses's time, before sacrifices were confined 
 to one altar, before the general apostasy of the nations from the 
 knowledge and worship of the true God, and while yet there was no other 
 idolatry known than the worship of the sun and moon, and that punished 
 by the Judges,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31-26-28"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 26-28</A>.

 He lived while God was known by the name of <I>God Almighty</I> more
 than by the name of <I>Jehovah;</I> for he is called <I>Shaddai--the 
 Almighty,</I> above thirty times in this book. He lived while divine
 knowledge was conveyed, not by writing, but by tradition; for to that 
 appeals are here made,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:8,21:29,Job+15:18,Job+5:1"><I>ch.</I> viii. 8; 
 xxi. 29; xv. 18; v. 1</A>.

 And we have therefore reason to think that he lived before Moses,
 because here is no mention at all of the deliverance of Israel out of 
 Egypt, or the giving of the law. There is indeed one passage which 
 might be made to allude to the drowning of Pharaoh

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:12"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 12</A>):

 <I>He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he
 smiteth through Rahab,</I> which name Egypt is frequently called by in 
 scripture, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:4,89:10,Isa+51:9">Ps. lxxxvii. 4; 
 lxxxix. 10; Isa. li. 9</A>.

 But that may as well refer to the proud waves of the sea. We conclude
 therefore that we are here got back to the patriarchal age, and, 
 besides its authority, we receive this book with veneration for its 
 antiquity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We are sure that it is of great use to the church, and to every 
 good Christian, though there are many passages in it dark and hard to 
 be understood. We cannot perhaps be confident of the true meaning of 
 every Arabic word and phrase we meet with in it. It is a book that 
 finds a great deal of work for the critics; but enough is plain to make 
 the whole profitable, and it was all written for our learning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This noble poem presents to us, in very clear and lively characters, 
 these five things among others:--

 (1.) <I>A monument of primitive theology.</I> The first and great 
 principles of the light of nature, on which natural religion is 
 founded, are here, in a warm, and long, and learned dispute, not only 
 taken for granted on all sides and not the least doubt made of them, 
 but by common consent plainly laid down as eternal truths, illustrated 
 and urged as affecting commanding truths. Were ever the being of God,
 his glorious attributes and perfections, his unsearchable wisdom, his 
 irresistible power, his inconceivable glory, his inflexible justice, 
 and his incontestable sovereignty, discoursed of with more clearness, 
 fulness, reverence, and divine eloquence, than in this book? The 
 creation of the world, and the government of it, are here admirably 
 described, not as matters of nice speculation, but as laying most 
 powerful obligations upon us to fear and serve, to submit to and trust 
 in, our Creator, owner, Lord, and ruler. Moral good and evil, virtue 
 and vice, were never drawn more to the life (the beauty of the one and 
 the deformity of the other) than in this book; nor the inviolable rule 
 of God's judgment more plainly laid down, That <I>happy are the 
 righteous, it shall be well with them;</I> and <I>Woe to the wicked, it 
 shall be ill with them.</I> These are not questions of the schools to 
 keep the learned world in action, nor engines of state to keep the 
 unlearned world in awe; no, it appears by this book that they are 
 sacred truths of undoubted certainty, and which all the wise and sober 
 part of mankind have in every age subscribed and submitted to. 

 (2.) It presents us with <I>a specimen of Gentile piety.</I> This great 
 saint descended probably not from Abraham, but Nahor; or, if from 
 Abraham, not from Isaac, but from one of the sons of the concubines 
 that were sent into the east-country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:6">Gen. xxv. 6</A>);

 or, if from Isaac, yet not from Jacob, but Esau; so that he was out of
 the pale of the covenant of peculiarity, no Israelite, no proselyte, 
 and yet none like him for religion, nor such a favourite of heaven upon 
 this earth. It was a truth therefore, before St. Peter perceived it, 
 that <I>in every nation he that fears God and works righteousness is 
 accepted of him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:35">Acts x. 35</A>.

 There were <I>children of God scattered abroad</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:52">John xi. 52</A>)

 besides the incorporated <I>children of the kingdom,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:11,12">Matt. viii. 11, 12</A>.

 (3.) It presents us with <I>an exposition of the book of
 Providence,</I> and a clear and satisfactory solution of many of the 
 difficult and obscure passages of it. The prosperity of the wicked and 
 the afflictions of the righteous have always been reckoned two as hard 
 chapters as any in that book; but they are here expounded, and 
 reconciled with the divine wisdom, purity, and goodness, by the <I>end 
 of these things.</I> 

 (4.) It presents us with <I>a great example of patience</I> and close 
 adherence to God in the midst of the sorest calamities. Sir Richard 
 Blackmore's most ingenious pen, in his excellent preface to his 
 paraphrase on this book, makes Job a hero proper for an epic poem; for, 
 says he, "He appears brave in distress and valiant in affliction, 
 maintains his virtue, and with that his character, under the most 
 exasperating provocations that the malice of hell could invent, and 
 thereby gives a most noble example of passive fortitude, a character no 
 way inferior to that of the active hero," &c.

 (5.) It presents us with <I>an illustrious type of Christ,</I> the 
 particulars of which we shall endeavour to take notice of as we go 
 along. In general, Job was a great sufferer, was emptied and humbled, 
 but in order to his greater glory. So Christ abased himself, that we
 might be exalted. The learned bishop Patrick quotes St. Jerome more than
 once speaking of Job as a type of Christ, who <I>for the job that was 
 set before him endured the cross,</I> who was persecuted, for a time, 
 by men and devils, and seemed forsaken of God too, but was raised to be 
 an intercessor even for his friends and had added affliction to his 
 misery. When the apostle speaks of the <I>patience of Job</I> he 
 immediately takes notice of <I>the end of the Lord,</I> that is, of the 
 Lord Jesus (as some understand it), typified by Job, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:11">James v. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In this book we have, 

 (1.) The history of Job's sufferings, and his patience under them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:1-2:13"><I>ch.</I> i., ii.</A>,

 not without a mixture of human frailty,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:1-26"><I>ch.</I> iii.</A>

 (2.) A dispute between him and his friends upon them, in which, 

 [1.] The opponents were Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar.

 [2.] The respondent was Job.

 [3.] The moderators were, <I>First,</I> Elihu,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:1-37:24"><I>ch.</I> xxxii.-xxxvii.</A>

 <I>Secondly,</I> God himself,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:1-41:34"><I>ch.</I> xxxviii.-xli.</A>

 (3.) The issue of all in Job's honour and prosperity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:1-17"><I>ch.</I> xlii.</A>

 Upon the whole, we learn that <I>many are the afflictions of the
 righteous, but</I> that when the Lord <I>delivers them out of them 
 all</I> the <I>trial of their faith will be found to praise, and 
 honour, and glory.</I></P>
