 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 One would have thought that such an excellent confession of faith as 
 Job made, in the close of the foregoing chapter, would satisfy his 
 friends, or at least mollify them; but they do not seem to have taken 
 any notice of it, and therefore Zophar here takes his turn, enters the 
 lists with Job, and attacks him with as much vehemence as before. 

 I.  His preface is short, but hot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 II. His discourse is long, and all upon one subject, the very same that
 Bildad was large upon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:1-21"><I>ch.</I> xviii.</A>),

 the certain misery of wicked people and the ruin that awaits them.

 1.  He asserts, in general, that the prosperity of a wicked person is
 short, and his ruin sure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:4-9">ver. 4-9</A>.

 2. He proves the misery of his condition by many instances--that he
 should have a diseased body, a troubled conscience, a ruined estate, a
 beggared family, an infamous name and that he himself should perish
 under the weight of divine wrath: all this is most curiously described
 here in lofty expressions and lively similitudes; and it often proves
 true in this world, and always in another, without repentance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:10-29">ver. 10-29</A>.

 But the great mistake was, and (as bishop Patrick expresses it) all the 
 flaw in his discourse (which was common to him with the rest), that he 
 imagined God never varied from this method, and therefore Job was, 
 without doubt, a very bad man, though it did not appear that he was, 
 any other way than by his infelicity.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
 &nbsp; 2  Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for <I>this</I> I
 make haste.
 &nbsp; 3  I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my
 understanding causeth me to answer.
 &nbsp; 4  Knowest thou <I>not</I> this of old, since man was placed upon
 earth,
 &nbsp; 5  That the triumphing of the wicked <I>is</I> short, and the joy of
 the hypocrite <I>but</I> for a moment?
 &nbsp; 6  Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head
 reach unto the clouds;
 &nbsp; 7  <I>Yet</I> he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which
 have seen him shall say, Where <I>is</I> he?
 &nbsp; 8  He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he
 shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
 &nbsp; 9  The eye also <I>which</I> saw him shall <I>see him</I> no more; neither
 shall his place any more behold him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Zophar begins very passionately, and seems to be in a great heat at 
 what Job had said. Being resolved to condemn Job for a bad man, he was 
 much displeased that he talked so like a good man, and, as it should 
 seem, broke in upon him, and began abruptly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer.</I> He takes no notice 
 of what Job had said to move their pity, or to evidence his own 
 integrity, but fastens upon the reproof he gave them in the close of 
 his discourse, counts that a reproach, and thinks himself 
 <I>therefore</I> obliged to answer, because Job had bidden them be 
 afraid of the sword, that he might not seem to be frightened by his 
 menaces. The best counsel is too often ill taken from an antagonist, 
 and therefore usually may be well spared.  Zophar seemed more in haste 
 to speak than became a wise man; but he excuses his haste with two 
 things:--
 
 1. That Job had given him strong provocation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>I have heard the check of my reproach,</I> and cannot bear to hear 
 it any longer." Job's friends, I doubt, had spirits too high to deal 
 with a man in his low condition; and high spirits are impatient of 
 contradiction, and think themselves affronted if all about them do not 
 say as they say; they cannot bear a check but they call it <I>the check 
 of their reproach,</I> and then they are bound in honour to return it, 
 if not to draw upon him that gave it. 

 2. That his own heart gave him a strong instigation. His thoughts 
 caused him to answer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 for <I>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks;</I> but he 
 fathers the instigation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 upon <I>the spirit of his understanding:</I> that indeed should cause 
 us to answer; we should rightly apprehend a thing and duly consider it 
 before we speak of it; but whether it did so here or no is a question.  
 Men often mistake the dictates of their passion for the dictates of 
 their reason, and therefore think they do well to be angry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Zophar proceeds very plainly to show the ruin and destruction of 
 wicked people, insinuating that because Job was destroyed and ruined he 
 was certainly a wicked man and a hypocrite.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How this doctrine is introduced, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>,

 where he appeals,

 (1.) To Job's own knowledge and conviction: "<I>Knowest thou not 
 this?</I> Canst thou be ignorant of a truth so plain? Or canst thou 
 doubt of a truth which has been confirmed by the suffrages of all 
 mankind?" Those know little who do not know that the wages of sin is 
 death. 

 (2.) To the experience of all ages. It was known of old, since man was 
 placed upon the earth; that is, ever since man was made he has had this 
 truth written in his heart, that the sin of sinners will be their ruin; 
 and ever since there were instances of wickedness (which there were 
 soon after man was placed on the earth) there were instances of the 
 punishments of it, witness the exclusions of Adam and Cain. When sin 
 entered into the world death entered with it: all the world knows that 
 evil pursues sinners, whom <I>vengeance suffers not to live</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:4">Acts xxviii. 4</A>),

 and subscribes to that
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:11">Isa. iii. 11</A>),

 <I>Woe to the wicked; it shall be ill with him,</I> sooner or
 later.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How it is laid down 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>The triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite 
 but for a moment.</I> Observe,

 (1.) He asserts the misery, not only of those who are openly wicked and 
 profane, but of hypocrites, who secretly practice wickedness under a 
 show and profession of religion, because such a wicked man he looked 
 upon Job to be; and it is true that a form of godliness, if it be made 
 use of for a cloak of maliciousness, does but make bad worse.  
 Dissembled piety is double iniquity, and the ruin that attends it will 
 be accordingly. The hottest place in hell will be the portion of 
 hypocrites, as our Saviour intimates,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:51">Matt. xxiv. 51</A>.

 (2.) He grants that wicked men may for a time prosper, may be secure
 and easy, and very merry. You may see them in triumph and joy, 
 triumphing and rejoicing in their wealth and power, their grandeur and 
 success, triumphing and rejoicing over their poor honest neighbours 
 whom they vex and oppress: they feel no evil, they fear none. Job's 
 friends were loth to own, at first, that wicked people might prosper at 
 all

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:9"><I>ch.</I> iv. 9</A>),

 until Job proved it plainly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:24,12:6"><I>ch.</I> ix. 24, xii. 6</A>),

 and now Zophar yields it; but, 

 (3.) He lays it down for a certain truth that they will not prosper 
 long.  Their joy is but for a moment, and will quickly end in endless 
 sorrow.  Though he be ever so great, and rich, and jovial, the 
 hypocrite will be humbled, and mortified, and made miserable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. How it is illustrated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:6-9"><I>v.</I> 6-9</A>.

 (1.) He supposes his prosperity to be very high, as high as you can 
 imagine, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It is not his wisdom and virtue, but his worldly wealth or greatness, 
 that he accounts <I>his excellency,</I> and values himself upon.  We 
 will suppose that <I>to mount up to the heavens,</I> and, since his 
 spirit always rises with his condition, you may suppose that with it 
 <I>his head reaches to the clouds.</I> He is every way advanced; the 
 world has done the utmost it can for him. He looks down upon all about 
 him with disdain, while they look up to him with admiration, envy, or 
 fear. We will suppose him to bid fair for a universal monarchy. And, 
 though he cannot but have made himself many enemies before he arrived 
 to this pitch of prosperity, yet he thinks himself as much out of the 
 reach of their darts as if he were in the clouds.

 (2.) He is confident that his ruin will accordingly be very great, and 
 his fall the more dreadful for his having risen so high: <I>He shall 
 perish for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 His pride and security were the certain presages of his misery. This 
 will certainly be true of all impenitent sinners in the other world; 
 they shall be undone, for ever undone. But Zophar means his ruin in 
 this world; and indeed sometimes notorious sinners are remarkably cut 
 off by present judgments; they have reason enough to fear what Zophar 
 here threatens even the triumphant sinner with.

 [1.] A shameful destruction: <I>He shall perish like his own dung</I>
 or dunghill, so loathsome is he to God and all good men, and so willing 
 will the world be to part with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:119,Isa+66:24">Ps. cxix. 119; Isa. lxvi. 24</A>.

 [2.] A surprising destruction. He will be brought into desolation in a 
 moment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:19">Ps. lxxiii. 19</A>),

 so that those about him, that saw him but just now, will ask, "<I>Where
 is he?</I> Could he that made so great a figure vanish and expire so 
 suddenly?"

 [3.] A swift destruction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 <I>He shall fly away</I> upon the wings of his own terrors, and be 
 <I>chased away</I> by the just imprecations of all about him, who would 
 gladly get rid of him.

 [4.] An utter destruction.  It will be total; he shall go away <I>like 
 a dream,</I> or <I>vision of the night,</I> which was a mere phantasm, 
 and, whatever in it pleased the fancy, it is quite gone, and nothing of 
 it remains but what serves us to laugh at the folly of.  It will be 
 final

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>The eye that saw him,</I> and was ready to adore him, <I>shall see 
 him no more,</I> and the place he filled shall no more behold him, 
 having given him an eternal farewell when he went to his own place, as 
 Judas,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The instances here given of the miserable condition of the wicked man 
 in this world are expressed with great fulness and fluency of language, 
 and the same thing returned to again and repeated in other words. Let 
 us therefore reduce the particulars to their proper heads, and 
 observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What his wickedness is for which he is punished.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The lusts of the flesh, here called <I>the sins of his youth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 for those are the sins which, at that age, people are most tempted to. 
 The forbidden pleasures of sense are said to be <I>sweet in his 
 mouth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 he indulges himself in all the gratifications of the carnal appetite, 
 and takes an inordinate complacency in them, as yielding the most 
 agreeable delights. That is the satisfaction which <I>he hides under 
 his tongue,</I> and rolls there, as the most dainty delicate thing that 
 can be. <I>He keeps it still within his mouth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 let him have that, and he desires no more; he will never part with that 
 for the spiritual and divine pleasures of religion, which he has no 
 relish or nor affection for. His keeping it still in his mouth denotes 
 his obstinately persisting in his sin (<I>he spares it</I> when he 
 should kill and mortify it, <I>and forsakes it not,</I> but holds it 
 fast, and goes on frowardly in it), and also his re-acting of his sin 
 by revolving it and remembering it with pleasure, as that adulterous 
 woman

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:19">Ezek. xxiii. 19</A>)

 who <I>multiplied her whoredoms by calling to remembrance the days of
 her youth;</I> so does this wicked man here. Or his hiding it and 
 keeping it under his tongue denotes his industrious concealment of his 
 beloved lust. Being a hypocrite, his haunts of sin are secret, that he 
 may save the credit of his profession; but he who knows what is in the 
 heart knows what is under the tongue too, and will discover it 
 shortly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The love of the world and the wealth of it. It is in worldly wealth 
 that he places his happiness, and therefore he sets his heart upon it. 
 See here, 

 (1.) How greedy he is of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>He has swallowed down riches</I> as eagerly as ever a hungry man 
 swallowed down meat; and is still crying, "Give, give." It is that 
 which he desired 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 it was, in his eye, the best gift, and that which he coveted earnestly.

 (2.) What pains he takes for it: It is <I>that which he laboured 
 for</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 not by honest diligence in a lawful calling, but by an unwearied 
 prosecution of all ways and methods, <I>per fas, per nefas--right or 
 wrong,</I> to be rich. We must <I>labour,</I> not <I>to be rich</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:4">Prov. xxiii. 4</A>),

 but to be charitable, <I>that we may have to give</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:28">Eph. iv. 28</A>),

 not to spend.

 (3.) What great things he promises himself from it, intimated in <I>the 
 rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 his being disappointed of them supposes that he had flattered himself 
 with the hopes of them: he expected rivers of sensual delights.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Violence and oppression, and injustice in his poor neighbours, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 This was the sin of the giants of the old world, and a sin that, as 
 much as any, brings God's judgments upon nations and families. It is 
 charged upon this wicked man,

 (1.) That <I>he has forsaken the poor,</I> taken no care of them, shown 
 no kindness to them, nor made any provision for them. At first perhaps, 
 for a pretence, he gave alms like the Pharisees, to gain a reputation; 
 but, when he had served his turn by this practice, he left it off, and 
 forsook the poor, whom before he seemed to be concerned for. Those who 
 do good, but not from a good principle, though they may abound in it, 
 will not abide in it.  

 (2.) That he has <I>oppressed</I> them, crushed them, taken all 
 advantages against them to do them a mischief. To enrich himself, he 
 has robbed the spital, and made the poor poorer.  

 (3.) That he has <I>violently taken away their houses,</I> which he had 
 no right to, as Ahab took Naboth's vineyard, not by secret fraud, by 
 forgery, perjury, or some trick in law, but avowedly, and by open 
 violence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What his punishment is for this wickedness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He shall be disappointed in his expectations, and shall not find 
 that satisfaction in his worldly wealth which he vainly promised 
 himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>He shall never see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and 
 butter,</I> with which he hoped to glut himself.  The world is not that 
 to those who love it, and court it, and admire it, which they fancy it 
 will be. The enjoyment sinks far below the raised expectation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He shall be diseased and distempered in his body; and how little 
 comfort a man has in riches if he has not health! Sickness and pain, 
 especially it they be in extremity, embitter all his enjoyments. This 
 wicked man has all the delights of sense wound up to the height of 
 pleasurableness; but what real happiness can he enjoy when <I>his bones 
 are full of the sins of his youth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 that is, of the effects of those sins? By his drunkenness and gluttony, 
 his uncleanness and wantonness, when he was young, he contracted those 
 diseases which are painful to him long after, and perhaps make his life 
 very miserable, and, as Solomon speaks, consume his flesh and his body, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:11">Prov. v. 11</A>.

 Perhaps he was given to fight when he was young, and then made nothing
 of a cut or a bruise in a fray; but he feels it in his bones long 
 after. But can he get no ease, no relief? No, he is likely to carry his 
 pains and diseases with him to the grave, or rather they are likely to 
 carry him thither, and so the sins of his youth shall <I>lie down with 
 him in the dust;</I> the very putrefying of his body in the grave is to 
 him the effect of sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:19"><I>ch.</I> xxiv. 19</A>),

 so that his iniquity is upon his bones there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+32:27">Ezek. xxxii. 27</A>.

 The sin of sinners follows them to the other side death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He shall be disquieted and troubled in his mind: <I>Surely he shall 
 not feel quietness in his belly,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 He has not that ease in his own mind that people think he has, but is 
 in continual agitation. The ill-gotten wealth which he has swallowed 
 down makes him sick, and, like undigested meat, is always upbraiding 
 him. Let none expect to enjoy that comfortably which they have gotten 
 unjustly. The unquietness of his mind arises,

 (1.) From his conscience looking back, and filling him with the fear of 
 the wrath of God against him for his wickedness. Even that wickedness 
 which was sweet in the commission, and was rolled under the tongue as a 
 delicate morsel, becomes bitter in the reflection, and, when it is 
 reviewed, fills him with horror and vexation. <I>In his bowels it is 
 turned</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 like John's book, <I>in his mouth as sweet as honey,</I> but, <I>when 
 he had eaten it, his belly was bitter,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:10">Rev. x. 10</A>.

 Such a thing is sin; it is turned into <I>the gall of asps,</I> than
 which nothing is more bitter, <I>the poison of asps</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 than which nothing more fatal, and so it will be to him; what he sucked 
 so sweetly, and with so much pleasure, will prove to him the poison of 
 asps; so will all unlawful gains be. The fawning tongue will prove the 
 viper's tongue.  All the charming graces that are thought to be in sin 
 will, when conscience is awakened, turn into so many raging furies.

 (2.) From his cares, looking forward, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 <I>In the fulness of his sufficiency,</I> when he thinks himself most 
 happy, and most sure of the continuance of his happiness, <I>he shall 
 be in straits,</I> that is, he shall think himself so, through the 
 anxieties and perplexities of his own mind, as that rich man who, when 
 his ground brought forth plentifully, cried out, <I>What shall I 
 do?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:17">Luke xii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He shall be dispossessed of his estate; that shall sink and dwindle 
 away to nothing, so that <I>he shall not rejoice therein,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 He shall not only never rejoice truly, but not long rejoice at all.

 (1.) What he has unjustly swallowed he shall be compelled to disgorge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:15"><I>v.</I>  15</A>):

 <I>He swallowed down riches,</I> and then thought himself sure of them, 
 and that they were as much his own as the meat he had eaten; but he was 
 deceived: <I>he shall vomit them up again;</I> his own conscience 
 perhaps may make him so uneasy in the keeping of what he has gotten 
 that, for the quiet of his own mind, he shall make restitution, and 
 that not with the pleasure of a virtue, but the pain of a vomit, and 
 with the utmost reluctancy. Or, if he do not himself refund what he has 
 violently taken away, God will, by his providence, force him to it, and 
 bring it about, one way or other, that ill-gotten goods shall return to 
 the right owners: <I>God shall cast them out of his belly,</I> while 
 yet the love of the sin is not cast out of his heart.  So loud shall 
 the clamours of the poor, whom he has impoverished, be against him, 
 that he shall be forced to send his children to them to soothe them and 
 beg their pardon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>His children shall seek to please the poor,</I> while his own hands 
 shall restore them their goods with shame 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>That which he laboured for,</I> by all the arts of oppression, 
 <I>shall he restore,</I> and shall not so swallow it down as to digest 
 it; it shall not stay with him, but <I>according to his shame shall the 
 restitution be;</I> having gotten a great deal unjustly, he shall 
 restore a great deal, so that when every one has his own he will have 
 but little left for himself. To be made to restore what was unjustly 
 gotten, by the sanctifying grace of God, as Zaccheus was, is a great 
 mercy; he voluntarily and cheerfully restored four-fold, and yet had a 
 great deal left to <I>give to the poor,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:8">Luke xix. 8</A>.

 But to be forced to restore, as Judas was, merely by the horrors of a
 despairing conscience, has none of that benefit and comfort attending 
 it, for he <I>threw down the pieces of silver and went and hanged 
 himself.</I> 

 (2.) He shall be stripped of all he has and become a beggar. He that 
 spoiled others shall himself be spoiled 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:1">Isa. xxxiii. 1</A>);

 for <I>every hand of the wicked shall be upon him.</I> The innocent,
 whom he has wronged, sit down by their loss, saying, as David, 
 <I>Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked, but my hand shall not be upon 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:13">1 Sam. xxiv. 13</A>.

 But though they have forgiven him, though they will make no reprisals,
 divine justice will, and often makes the wicked to avenge the quarrel 
 of the righteous, and squeezes and crushes one bad man by the hand of 
 another upon him. Thus, when he is plucked on all sides, <I>he shall 
 not save of that which he desired</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:20"><I>v.</I>  20</A>),

 not only he shall not save it all, but he shall save nothing of it.  
 <I>There shall none of his meat</I> (which he coveted so much, and fed 
 upon with so much pleasure) <I>be left,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 All his neighbours and relations shall look upon him to be in such bad 
 circumstances that, when he is dead, no man shall look for his goods, 
 none of his kindred shall expect to be a penny the better for him, nor 
 be willing to take out letters of administration for what he leaves 
 behind him. In all this Zophar reflects upon Job, who had lost all and 
 was reduced to the last extremity.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Zophar, having described the many embarrassments and vexations which 
 commonly attend the wicked practices of oppressors and cruel men, here 
 comes to show their utter ruin at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Their ruin will take its rise from God's wrath and vengeance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 The hand of the wicked was upon him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 <I>every hand of the wicked.</I> His hand was against every one, and 
 therefore every man's hand will be against him. Yet, in grappling with 
 these, he might go near to make his part good; but his heart cannot 
 endure, nor his hands be strong, when <I>God shall deal with him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:14">Ezek. xxii. 14</A>),

 <I>when God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him and rain it upon
 him.</I> Every word here speaks terror. It is not only the justice of 
 God that is engaged against him, but his wrath, the deep resentment of 
 provocations given to himself; it is <I>the fury of his wrath,</I> 
 incensed to the highest degree; it is cast upon him with force and 
 fierceness; it is rained upon him in abundance; it comes on his head 
 like the fire and brimstone upon Sodom, to which the psalmist also 
 refers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:6">Ps. xi. 6</A>.

 <I>On the wicked God shall rain fire and brimstone.</I> There is no
 fence against this, but in Christ, who is the only covert from the 
 storm and tempest,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:2">Isa. xxxii. 2</A>.

 This wrath shall be cast upon him <I>when he is about to fill his
 belly,</I> just going to glut himself with what he has gotten and 
 promising himself abundant satisfaction in it. Then, when he is eating, 
 shall this tempest surprise him, when he is secure and easy, and in 
 apprehension of no danger; as the ruin of the old world and Sodom came 
 when they were in the depth of their security and the height of their 
 sensuality, as Christ observes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:26-31">Luke  xvii. 26</A>,

 &c. Perhaps Zophar here reflects on the
 death of Job's children when they were eating and drinking.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Their ruin will be inevitable, and there will be no possibility of 
 escaping it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>He shall flee from the iron weapon.</I> Flight argues guilt. He will 
 not humble himself under the judgments of God, nor seek means to make 
 his peace with him. All his care is to escape the vengeance that 
 pursues him, but in vain: if he escape the sword, yet <I>the bow of 
 steel shall strike him through.</I> God has weapons of all sorts; he 
 has both <I>whet his sword and bent his bow</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:12,13">Ps.  vii. 12, 13</A>);

 he can deal with his enemies <I>cominus vel eminus--at hand or afar
 off.</I> He has a sword for those that think to fight it out with him 
 by their strength, and a bow for those that think to avoid him by their 
 craft.  See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:17,18,Jer+48:43,44">Isa. xxiv. 17, 18; 
 Jer. xlviii. 43, 44</A>.

 He that is marked for ruin, though he may escape one judgment, will
 find another ready for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. It will be a total terrible ruin. When the dart that has struck 
 him through (for when God shoots he is sure to hit his mark, when he 
 strikes he strikes home) comes to be <I>drawn out of his body,</I> when 
 <I>the glittering sword</I> (the <I>lightning,</I> so the word is), the 
 flaming sword, the sword that is bathed in heaven 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:5">Isa. xxxiv. 5</A>),

 <I>comes out of his gall,</I> O what <I>terrors are upon him!</I> How
 strong are the convulsions, how violent are the dying agonies! How 
 terrible are the arrests of death to a wicked man!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Sometimes it is a ruin that comes upon him insensibly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 1.  The darkness he is wrapped up in is a hidden darkness: it is <I>all 
 darkness,</I> utter darkness, without the least mixture of light, and 
 it is <I>hid in his secret place,</I> whither he has retreated and 
 where he hopes to shelter himself; he never retires into his own 
 conscience but he finds himself in the dark and utterly at a loss. 

 2.  The fire he is consumed by is <I>a fire not blown,</I> kindled
 without noise, a consumption which every body sees the effect of, but 
 nobody sees the cause of. It is plain that the gourd is withered, but 
 the worm at the root, that causes it to wither, is out of sight. He is 
 wasted by a soft gentle fire--surely, but very slowly. When the fuel is 
 very combustible, the fire needs no blowing, and that is his case; he 
 is ripe for ruin. <I>The proud, and those that do wickedly, shall be 
 stubble,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:1">Mal. iv. 1</A>.

 <I>An unquenchable fire shall consume him</I> (so some read it), and
 that is certainly true of hell-fire.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. It is a ruin, not only to himself, but to his family: <I>It shall go 
 ill with him that is left in his tabernacle,</I> for the curse shall 
 reach him, and he shall be cut off perhaps by the same grievous 
 disease. There is an entail of wrath upon the family, which will 
 destroy both his heirs and his inheritance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 1. His posterity will be rooted out: <I>The increase of his house shall 
 depart,</I> shall either be cut off by untimely deaths or forced to run 
 their country. Numerous and growing families, if wicked and vile, are 
 soon reduced, dispersed, and extirpated, by the judgments of God. 

 2.  His estate will be sunk. <I>His goods shall flow away</I> from his
 family as fast as ever they flowed into it, when <I>the day of God's 
 wrath</I> comes, for which, all the while his estate was in the getting 
 by fraud and oppression, he was treasuring up wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. It is a ruin which will manifestly appear to be just and righteous, 
 and what he has brought upon himself by his own wickedness; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>)
 
 <I>the heaven shall reveal his iniquity,</I> that is, the God of 
 heaven, who sees all the secret wickedness of the wicked, will, by some 
 means or other, let all the world know what a base man he has been, 
 that they may own the justice of God in all that is brought upon him. 
 <I>The earth</I> also <I>shall rise up against him,</I> both to 
 discover his wickedness and to avenge it. <I>The earth shall disclose 
 her blood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:21">Isa. xxvi. 21</A>.

 <I>The earth will rise up against him</I> (as the stomach rises against
 that which is loathsome), and will no longer keep him. <I>The heaven 
 reveals his iniquity,</I> and therefore will not receive him. Whither 
 then must he go but to hell? If the God of heaven and earth be his 
 enemy, neither heaven nor earth will show him any kindness, but all the 
 hosts of both are and will be at war with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Zophar concludes like an orator 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>This is the portion of a wicked man from God;</I> it is allotted 
 him, it is designed him, as his portion. He will have it at last, as a 
 child has his portion, and he will have it for a perpetuity; it is what 
 he must abide by: <I>This is the heritage of his decree from God;</I> 
 it is the settled rule of his judgment, and fair warning is given of 
 it. <I>O wicked man! thou shalt surely die,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+33:8">Ezek. xxxiii. 8</A>.

 Though impenitent sinners do not always fall under such temporal
 judgments as are here described (therein Zophar was mistaken), yet the 
 wrath of God abides upon them, and they are made miserable by spiritual 
 judgments, which are much worse, their consciences being either, on the 
 one hand, a terror to them, and then they are in continual amazement, 
 or, on the other hand, seared and silenced, and then they are given up 
 to a reprobate sense and bound over to eternal ruin. Never was any 
 doctrine better explained, or worse applied, than this by Zophar, who 
 intended by all this to prove Job a hypocrite. Let us receive the good 
 explication, and make a better application, for warning to ourselves to 
 stand in awe and not to sin.</P>
