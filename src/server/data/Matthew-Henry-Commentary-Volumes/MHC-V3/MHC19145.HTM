 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The five foregoing psalms were all of a piece, all full of prayers; 
 this, and the five that follow it to the end of the book, are all of a 
 piece too, all full of praises; and though only this is entitled 
 David's psalm yet we have no reason to think but that they were all his 
 as well as all the foregoing prayers. And it is observable, 

 1. That after five psalms of prayer follow six psalms of praise; for
 those that are much in prayer shall not want matter for praise, and 
 those that have sped in prayer must abound in praise. Our thanksgivings 
 for mercy, when we have received it, should even exceed our 
 supplications for it when we were in pursuit of it. David, in the last 
 of his begging psalms, had promised to praise God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:9">Ps. cxlv. 9</A>),

 and here he performs his promise. 

 2. That the book of Psalms concludes with psalms of praise, all praise, 
 for praise, is the conclusion of the whole matter; it is that in which 
 all the psalms centre. And it intimates that God's people, towards the 
 end of their life, should abound much in praise, and the rather 
 because, at the end of their life, they hope to remove to the world of 
 everlasting praise, and the nearer they come to heaven the more they 
 should accustom themselves to the work of heaven. This is one of those 
 psalms which are composed alphabetically (as Ps. 25 and 34,

 &c.), that it might be the more easily committed to memory, and kept in 
 mind. The Jewish writers justly extol this psalm as a star of the first 
 magnitude in this bright constellation; and some of them have an 
 extravagant saying concerning it, not much unlike some of the popish 
 superstitions, That whosoever will sing this psalm constantly three 
 times a day shall certainly be happy in the world to come. In this 
 psalm, 

 I. David engages himself and others to praise God, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:1,2,4-7,10-12">ver. 1, 2, 4-7, 10-12</A>.

 II. He fastens upon those things that are proper matter for praise,
 God's greatness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:3">ver . 3</A>),
 
 his goodness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>),

 the proofs of both in the administration of his kingdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:13">ver. 13</A>),

 the kingdom of providence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:14-16">ver. 14-16</A>),
 
 the kingdom of grace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:17-20">ver. 17-20</A>),

 and then he concludes with a resolution to continue praising God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:21">ver. 21</A>)

 with which resolution our hearts must be filled, and in which they must 
 be fixed, in singing this psalm.</P>

 <P>David's <I>psalm</I> of praise.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I will extol thee, my God, O
 king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
 &nbsp; 2  Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for
 ever and ever.
 &nbsp; 3  Great <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and greatly to be praised; and his
 greatness <I>is</I> unsearchable.
 &nbsp; 4  One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall
 declare thy mighty acts.
 &nbsp; 5  I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of
 thy wondrous works.
 &nbsp; 6  And <I>men</I> shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and
 I will declare thy greatness.
 &nbsp; 7  They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness,
 and shall sing of thy righteousness.
 &nbsp; 8  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> gracious, and full of compassion; slow to
 anger, and of great mercy.
 &nbsp; 9  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> good to all: and his tender mercies <I>are</I> over
 all his works.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The entitling of this <I>David's psalm of praise</I> may intimate not 
 only that he was the penman of it, but that he took a particular 
 pleasure in it and sung it often; it was his companion wherever he 
 went. In this former part of the psalm God's glorious attributes are 
 praised, as, in the latter part of the psalm, his kingdom and the 
 administration of it. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Who shall be employed in giving glory to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Whatever others do, the psalmist will himself be much in praising 
 God. To this good work he here excites himself, engages himself, and 
 has his heart much enlarged in it. What he does, that he will do, 
 having more and more satisfaction in it. It was his duty; it was his 
 delight. Observe, 

 (1.) How he expresses the work itself: "<I>I will extol thee, and bless 
 thy name</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 I will speak well of thee, as thou hast made thyself known, and will 
 therein express my own high thoughts of thee and endeavour to raise the 
 like in others." When we speak honourably of God, this is graciously 
 interpreted and accepted as an extolling of him. Again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I will bless thee, I will praise thy name;</I> the repetition 
 intimates the fervency of his affection to this work, the fixedness of 
 his purpose to abound in it, and the frequency of his performances 
 therein. Again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>I will speak of thy honour,</I> and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 <I>I will declare thy greatness.</I> He would give glory to God, not 
 only in his solemn devotions, but in his common conversation. If the 
 heart be full of God, out of the abundance of that the mouth will speak 
 with reverence, to his praise, upon all occasions. What subject of 
 discourse can we find more noble, more copious, more pleasant, useful, 
 and unexceptionable, than the glory of God? 

 (2.) How he expresses his resolution to persevere in it.

 [1.] He will be constant to this work: <I>Every day will I bless 
 thee.</I> Praising God must be our daily work. No day must pass, though 
 ever so busy a day, though ever so sorrowful a day, without praising 
 God. We ought to reckon it the most needful of our daily employments, 
 and the most delightful of our daily comforts. God is every day 
 blessing us, doing well for us; there is therefore reason that we 
 should be every day blessing him, speaking well of him.

 [2.] He will continue in it: <I>I will bless</I> thee <I>for ever and 
 ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1 and again <I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 This intimates, <I>First,</I> That he resolved to continue in this work 
 to the end of his life, throughout <I>his ever</I> in this world.
 <I>Secondly,</I> That the psalms he penned should be made use of in 
 praising God by the church to the end of time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:30">2 Chron. xxix. 30</A>.

 <I>Thirdly,</I> That he hoped to be praising God to all eternity in the 
 other world. Those that make praise their constant work on earth shall 
 have it their everlasting bliss in heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He doubts not but others also would be forward to this work. 

 (1.) "They shall concur in it now; they shall join with me in it: When 
 <I>I declare thy greatness men shall speak of</I> it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 <I>they shall abundantly utter it</I>" 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 or <I>pour it out</I> (as the word is); they shall praise God with a
 gracious fluency, better than the most curious oratory. David's zeal 
 would provoke many, and it has done so.

 (2.) "They shall keep it up when I am gone, in an uninterrupted 
 succession

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>One generation shall praise thy works to another.</I>" The 
 generation that is going off shall tell them to that which is rising 
 up, shall tell what they have seen in their days and what they have 
 heard from their fathers; they <I>shall</I> fully and particularly 
 <I>declare thy mighty acts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:3">Ps. lxxviii. 3</A>);

 and the generation that is rising up shall follow the example of that 
 which is going off: so that the death of God's worshippers shall be no 
 diminution of his worship, for a new generation shall rise up in their 
 room to carry on that good work, more or less, to the end of time, when 
 it shall be left to that world to do it in which there is no succession 
 of generations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What we must give to God the glory of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Of his greatness and his great works. We must declare, <I>Great is 
 the Lord,</I> his presence infinite, his power irresistible, his 
 brightness insupportable, his majesty awful, his dominion boundless, 
 and his sovereignty incontestable; and therefore there is no dispute, 
 but <I>great is the Lord, and,</I> if great, then <I>greatly to be 
 praised,</I> with all that is within us, to the utmost of our power, 
 and with all the circumstances of solemnity imaginable. His greatness 
 indeed cannot be comprehended, for it is unsearchable; who can conceive 
 or express how great God is? But then it is so much the more to be 
 praised. When we cannot, by searching, find the bottom, we must sit 
 down at the brink, and adore the depth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:33">Rom. xi. 33</A>.

 God is great, for, 

 (1.) His majesty is glorious in the upper world, above the heavens, 
 where he has set his glory; and when we are declaring his greatness we 
 must not fail to <I>speak of the glorious honour of his majesty,</I> 
 the splendour of the glory of his majesty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 how brightly he shines in the upper world, so as to dazzle the eyes of 
 the angels themselves, and oblige them to cover their faces, as unable 
 to bear the lustre of it.

 (2.) His works are wondrous in this lower world. The preservation, 
 maintenance, and government of all the creatures, proclaim the Creator 
 very great. When therefore we declare his greatness we must observe the 
 unquestionable proofs of it, and must <I>declare his mighty acts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>speak of his wondrous works</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>the might of his terrible acts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 We must see God acting and working in all the affairs of this lower 
 world. Various instruments are used, but in all events God is the
 supreme director; it is he that performs all things. Much of his power
 is seen in the operations of his providence (they are <I>mighty 
 acts,</I> such as cannot be paralleled by the strength of any 
 creature), and much of his justice--they are <I>terrible acts,</I> 
 awful to saints, dreadful to sinners. These we should take all 
 occasions to speak of, observing the finger of God, his hand, his arm, 
 in all, that we may marvel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Of his goodness; this is his glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:19">Exod. xxxiii. 19</A>.
 
 It is what he glories in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:6,7">Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7</A>),

 and it is what we must give him the glory of: <I>They shall abundantly
 utter the memory of thy great goodness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 God's goodness is great goodness, the treasures of it can never be 
 exhausted, nay, they can never be lessened, for he ever will be as rich 
 in mercy as he ever was. It is memorable goodness; it is what we ought 
 always to lay before us, always to have in mind and preserve the 
 memorials of, for it is <I>worthy to be had in everlasting 
 remembrance;</I> and the remembrance we retain of God's goodness we 
 should utter, we should <I>abundantly utter,</I> as those who are full 
 of it, very full of it, and desire that others may be acquainted and 
 affected with it. But, whenever we utter God's great goodness, we must 
 not forget, at the same time, to <I>sing of his righteousness;</I> for, 
 as he is gracious in rewarding those that serve him faithfully, so he 
 is righteous in punishing those that rebel against him. Impartial and 
 inflexible justice is as surely in God as inexhaustible goodness; and 
 we must sing of both together, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:22">Rom. xi. 22</A>.

 (1.) There is a fountain of goodness in God's nature 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>The Lord is gracious</I> to those that serve him; he is <I>full of 
 compassion</I> to those that need him, <I>slow to anger</I> to those 
 that have offended him, <I>and of great mercy</I> to all that seek him 
 and sue to him. He is ready to give, and ready to forgive, more ready
 than we are to ask, than we are to repent.

 (2.) There are streams of goodness in all the dispensations of his 
 providence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 As he is good, so he does good; he <I>is good to all,</I> to all his 
 creatures, from the highest angel to the meanest worm, to all but 
 devils and damned sinners, that have shut themselves out from his 
 goodness. <I>His tender mercies are over all his works.</I>

 [1.] All his works, all his creatures, receive the fruits of his 
 merciful care and bounty. It is extended to them all; he hates nothing 
 that he has made.

 [2.] The works of his mercy out-shine all his other works, and declare 
 him more than any of them. In nothing will the glory of God be for ever 
 so illustrious as in the vessels of mercy ordained to glory. To the 
 divine goodness will the everlasting hallelujahs of all the saints be 
 sung.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  All thy works shall praise thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; and thy saints
 shall bless thee.
 &nbsp; 11  They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of
 thy power;
 &nbsp; 12  To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the
 glorious majesty of his kingdom.
 &nbsp; 13  Thy kingdom <I>is</I> an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion
 <I>endureth</I> throughout all generations.

 wicked will he destroy.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The greatness and goodness of him who is <I>optimus et 
 maximus</I>--<I>the best and greatest</I> of beings, were celebrated in
 the former part of the psalm; here, in these verses, we are taught to
 give him <I>the glory of his kingdom,</I> in the administration of 
 which his greatness and goodness shine so clearly, so very brightly. 
 Observe, as before,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. From whom the tribute of praise is expected 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>All</I> God's <I>works shall praise</I> him. They all minister to us 
 matter for praise, and so praise him according to their capacity; even 
 those that refuse to give him honour he will get himself honour upon. 
 But his <I>saints</I> do <I>bless</I> him, not only as they have 
 peculiar blessings from him, which other creatures have not, but as 
 they praise him actively, while his other works praise him only 
 objectively. They bless him, for they collect the rent or tribute of 
 praise from the inferior creatures, and pay it into the treasury above. 
 All God's works do praise him, as the beautiful building praises the 
 builder or the well-drawn picture praises the painter; but the saints 
 bless him as the children of prudent tender parents rise up and call 
 them blessed. Of all God's works, his saints, the workmanship of his 
 grace, the first-fruits of his creatures, have most reason to bless 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. For what this praise is to be given: <I>They shall speak of thy 
 kingdom.</I> The kingdom of God among men is a thing to be often 
 thought of and often spoken of. As, before, he had magnified God's 
 greatness and goodness in general, so here he magnifies them with 
 application to his kingdom. Consider then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The greatness of his kingdom. It is great indeed, for all the kings 
 and kingdoms of the earth are under his control. To show the greatness 
 of God's kingdom, he observes, 

 (1.) The pomp of it. Would we by faith look within the veil, we should 
 see, and, believing, we should <I>speak of the glory of his kingdom</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>the glorious majesty of</I> it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 for he has prepared his throne in the heavens, and it is high and 
 lifted up, and surrounded with an innumerable company of angels. The 
 courts of Solomon and Ahasuerus were magnificent; but, compared with 
 the glorious majesty of God's kingdom, they were but as glow-worms to 
 the sun. The consideration of this should strike an awe upon us in all 
 our approaches to God.

 (2.) The power of it: When <I>they speak of the glory of</I> God's 
 <I>kingdom</I> they must <I>talk of</I> his <I>power,</I> the extent of 
 it, the efficacy of it--his power, by which he can do any thing and 
 does every thing he pleases 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);

 and, as a proof of it, let them <I>make known his mighty acts</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 that <I>the sons of men</I> may be invited to yield themselves his 
 willing subjects and so put themselves under the protection of such a 
 mighty potentate.

 (3.) The perpetuity of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 The thrones of earthly princes totter, and the flowers of their crowns 
 wither, monarchies come to an end; but, Lord, <I>thy kingdom is an 
 everlasting kingdom.</I> God will govern the world to the end of time, 
 when the Mediator, who is now entrusted with the administration of his 
 kingdom, shall deliver it up to God, even the Father, that he may be 
 all in all to eternity. His <I>dominion endures throughout all 
 generations,</I> for he himself is eternal, and his counsels are 
 unchangeable and uniform; and Satan, who has set up a kingdom in 
 opposition to him, is conquered and in a chain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The goodness of his kingdom. His royal style and title are, <I>The 
 Lord God, gracious and merciful;</I> and his government answers to his 
 title. The goodness of God appears in what he does,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) For all the creatures in general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>):

 He <I>provides food for all flesh,</I> and therein appears his 
 everlasting mercy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:25">Ps. cxxxvi. 25</A>.

 All the creatures live upon God, and, as they had their being from him 
 at first, so from him they have all the supports of their being and on 
 him they depend for the continuance of it. 

 [1.] The eye of their expectation attends upon him: <I>The eyes of all 
 wait on thee.</I> The inferior creatures indeed have not the knowledge 
 of God, nor are capable of it, and yet they are said to <I>wait upon 
 God,</I> because they seek their food according to the instinct which 
 the God of nature has put into them (and <I>they sow not, neither do 
 they reap,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:26">Matt. vi. 26</A>),

 and because they take what the God of nature has provided for them, in 
 the time and way that he has appointed, and are content with it. 

 [2.] The hand of his bounty is stretched out to them: <I>Thou givest 
 them their meat in due season,</I> the meat proper for them, and in the 
 proper time, when they need it; so that none of the creatures 
 ordinarily perish for want of food, no, not in the winter. <I>Thou
 openest thy hand</I> freely and liberally, <I>and satisfiest the desire 
 of every living thing,</I> except some of the unreasonable children of 
 men, that will be satisfied with nothing, but are still complaining, 
 still crying, <I>Give, give.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) For the children of men in particular, whom he governs as 
 reasonable creatures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He does none of them any wrong, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 <I>the Lord is righteous in all his ways,</I> and not unrighteous in 
 any of them; he is <I>holy,</I> and acts like himself, with a perfect 
 rectitude <I>in all his works.</I> In all the acts of government he is 
 just, injurious to none, but administering justice to all. <I>The ways 
 of the lord are equal,</I> though ours are unequal. In giving laws, in 
 deciding controversies, in recompensing services, and punishing 
 offences, he is incontestably just, and we are bound to own that he is 
 so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He does all of them good, his own people in a special manner.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>First,</I> He supports those that are sinking, and it is his honour 
 to help the weak, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He <I>upholds all that fall,</I> in that, though they fall, they are 
 not utterly cast down. Many of the children of men are brought very low 
 by sickness and other distresses, and seem ready to drop into the 
 grave, and yet Providence wonderfully upholds them, raises them up, and 
 says, <I>Return,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:3">Ps. cx. 3</A>.

 If all had died who once seemed dying, the world would have been very 
 thin. Many of the children of God, who have been ready to fall into 
 sin, to fall into despair, have experienced his goodness in preventing 
 their falls, or recovering them speedily by his graces and comforts, so 
 that, though they fell, they were <I>not utterly cast down,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:24">Ps. xxxvii. 24</A>.

 If those who were <I>bowed down</I> by oppression and affliction are 
 <I>raised up,</I> it was God that raised them. And, with respect to all 
 those <I>that are heavy-laden</I> under the burden of sin, if they come 
 to Christ by faith, he will ease them, he will raise them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Secondly,</I> He is very ready to hear and answer the prayers of his 
 people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 In this appears the grace of his kingdom, that his subjects have not 
 only liberty of petitioning, but all the encouragement that can be to 
 petition. 

 1. The grant is very rich, that God will be <I>nigh to all that call
 upon him;</I> he will be always within call of their prayers, and they 
 shall always find themselves within reach of his help. If <I>a 
 neighbour that is near is better than a brother afar off</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:10">Prov. xxvii. 10</A>),

 much more a God that is near. Nay, he will not only be <I>nigh to
 them,</I> that they may have the satisfaction of being heard, but <I>he 
 will fulfil</I> their <I>desires;</I> they shall have what they ask and 
 find that they seek. It was said
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 that he <I>satisfies the desire of every living thing,</I> much more 
 <I>will he fulfil the desire of those that fear him;</I> for he that 
 feeds his birds will not starve his babes. <I>He will hear their call 
 and will save them;</I> that is hearing them to purpose, as he heard 
 David (that is, saved him) <I>from the horn of the unicorn,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:21">Ps. xxii. 21</A>.

 2. The proviso is very reasonable. He will hear and help us, 

 (1.) If we <I>fear him,</I> if we worship and serve him with a holy awe 
 of him; for otherwise how can we expect that he should accept us? 

 (2.) If we <I>call upon him in truth;</I> for he desires truth in the 
 inward part. We must be faithful to God, and sincere in our
 professions of dependence on him, and devotedness to him. In all 
 devotions inward impressions must be answerable to the outward 
 expressions, else they are not performed in truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Thirdly,</I> He takes those under his special protection who have a 
 confidence and complacency in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>The Lord preserves all those that love him;</I> they lie exposed in 
 this world, but he, by preserving them in their integrity, will 
 effectually secure them, that no real evil shall befal them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [3.] If any are destroyed they may thank themselves: <I>All the wicked 
 he will destroy,</I> but they have by their wickedness fitted 
 themselves for destruction. This magnifies his goodness in the
 protection of the righteous, that <I>with their eyes they shall see the 
 reward of the wicked</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:8">Ps. xci. 8</A>);

 and God will by this means preserve his people, even by destroying the 
 wicked that would do them a mischief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> The psalmist concludes, 

 1. With a resolution to give glory to God himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord.</I> When we have said 
 what we can, in praising God, still there is more to be said, and 
 therefore we must not only begin our thanksgivings with this purpose, 
 as he did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 but conclude them with it, as he does here, because we shall presently
 have occasion to begin again. As the end of one mercy is the beginning 
 of another, so should the end of one thanksgiving be. While I have 
 breath to draw, my mouth shall still speak God's praises. 

 2. With a call to others to do so too: <I>Let all flesh,</I> all
 mankind, <I>bless his holy name for ever and ever.</I> Some of mankind 
 shall be blessing God for ever; it is a pity but that they should be 
 all so engaged.</P>
