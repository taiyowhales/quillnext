 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David was in distress when he penned this psalm, pursued, it is most 
 likely, by Saul, that violent man. Is any distressed? Let him pray; 
 David did so, and had the comfort of it. 

 I. He prays for God's favourable acceptance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. For his powerful assistance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III. That others might be instrumental of good to his soul, as he hoped
 to be to the souls of others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 IV. That he and his friends being now brought to the last extremity God
 would graciously appear for their relief and rescue, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.

 The mercy and grace of God are as necessary to us as they were to him, 
 and therefore we should be humbly earnest for them in singing this 
 psalm.</P>

 <P>A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, I cry unto thee: make haste unto
 me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
 &nbsp; 2  Let my prayer be set forth before thee <I>as</I> incense; <I>and</I>
 the lifting up of my hands <I>as</I> the evening sacrifice.
 &nbsp; 3  Set a watch, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, before my mouth; keep the door of my
 lips.
 &nbsp; 4  Incline not my heart to <I>any</I> evil thing, to practise wicked
 works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their
 dainties.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Mercy to accept what we do well, and grace to keep us from doing ill, 
 are the two things which we are here taught by David's example to pray 
 to God for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David loved prayer, and he begs of God that his prayers might be 
 heard and answered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 <I>David cried unto God.</I> His crying denotes fervency in prayer; he 
 prayed as one in earnest. His crying to God denotes faith and fixedness 
 in prayer.  And what did he desire as the success of his prayer? 

 1.  That God would take cognizance of it: "<I>Give ear to my voice;</I>
 let me have a gracious audience." Those that cry in prayer may hope to 
 be heard in prayer, not for their loudness, but their liveliness. 

 2.  That he would visit him upon it: <I>Make haste unto me.</I> Those
 that know how to value God's gracious presence will be importunate for 
 it and humbly impatient of delays. He that believes does not make 
 haste, but he that prays may be earnest with God to make haste. 

 3. That he would be well pleased with him in it, well pleased with his
 <I>praying</I> and the <I>lifting up of his hands in prayer,</I> which 
 denotes both the elevation and enlargement of his desire and the 
 out-goings of his hope and expectation, the lifting up of the hand 
 signifying the lifting up of the heart, and being used instead of 
 lifting up the sacrifices which were heaved and waved before the Lord.  
 Prayer is a spiritual sacrifice; it is the offering up of the soul, and 
 its best affections, to God. Now he prays that this may be set forth 
 and directed before God <I>as the incense</I> which was daily burnt 
 upon the golden altar, and <I>as the evening sacrifice,</I> which he 
 mentions rather than the morning sacrifice, perhaps because this was an 
 evening prayer, or with an eye to Christ, who, in the evening of the 
 world and in the evening of the day, was to offer up himself a 
 sacrifice of atonement, and establish the spiritual sacrifices of 
 acknowledgement, having abolished all the carnal ordinances of the law.  
 Those that pray in faith may expect it will please God better than an 
 ox or bullock. David was now banished from God's court, and could not 
 attend the sacrifice and incense, and therefore begs that his prayer 
 might be instead of them.  Note, Prayer is of a sweet-smelling savour 
 to God, as incense, which yet has no savour without fire; nor has 
 prayer without the fire of holy love and fervour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David was in fear of sin, and he begs of God that he might be kept 
 from sin, knowing that his prayers would not be accepted unless he took 
 care to watch against sin. We must be as earnest for God's grace in us 
 as for his favour towards us. 

 1. He prays that he might not be surprised into any sinful words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Set a watch, O Lord! before my mouth,</I> and, nature having made 
 my lips to be a door to my words, let grace keep that door, that no 
 word may be suffered to go out which may in any way tend to the 
 dishonour of God or the hurt of others." Good men know the evil of 
 tongue-sins, and how prone they are to them (when enemies are provoking 
 we are in danger of carrying our resentment too far, and of speaking 
 unadvisedly, as Moses did, though the meekest of men), and therefore 
 they are earnest with God to prevent their speaking amiss, as knowing 
 that no watchfulness or resolution of their own is sufficient for the 
 governing of their tongues, much less of their hearts, without the 
 special grace of God. We must <I>keep our mouths as with a bridle;</I> 
 but that will not serve: we must pray to God to keep them. Nehemiah 
 prayed to the Lord when he set a watch, and so must we, for without him 
 the watchman waketh but in vain.

 2. That he might not be inclined to any sinful practices

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Incline not my heart to any evil thing;</I> whatever inclination 
 there is in me to sin, let it be not only restrained, but mortified, by 
 divine grace." The example of those about us, and the provocations of 
 those against us, are apt to stir up and draw out corrupt inclinations. 
 We are ready to do as others do, and to think that if we have received 
 injuries we may return them; and therefore we have need to pray that we 
 may never be left to ourselves to practise any wicked work, either in 
 confederacy with or in opposition to the <I>men that work iniquity.</I> 
 While we live in such an evil world, and carry about with us such evil 
 hearts, we have need to pray that we may neither be drawn in by any 
 allurement nor driven on by any provocation to do any sinful thing. 

 3.  That he might not be ensnared by any sinful pleasures: "<I>Let me
 not eat of their dainties.</I> Let me not join with them in their 
 feasts and sports, lest thereby I be inveigled into their sins." 
 <I>Better is a dinner of herbs,</I> out of the way of temptation, than 
 a <I>stalled ox</I> in it. Sinners pretend to find dainties in sin. 
 <I>Stolen waters are sweet;</I> forbidden fruit is pleasant to the eye. 
 But those that consider how soon the dainties of sin will turn into 
 wormwood and gall, how certainly it will, at last, <I>bite like a 
 serpent</I> and <I>sting like an adder,</I> will dread those dainties, 
 and pray to God by his providence to take them out of their sight, and 
 by his grace to turn them against them. Good men will pray even against 
 the sweets of sin.</P>

 Here, 

 I. David desires to be told of his faults. His enemies reproached him 
 with that which was false, which he could not but complain of; yet, at 
 the same time, he desired his friends would reprove him for that which 
 was really amiss in him, particularly if there was any thing that gave 
 the least colour to those reproaches

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness.</I> The 
 <I>righteous God</I> (so some); "I will welcome the rebukes of his 
 providence, and be so far from quarrelling with them that I will 
 receive them as tokens of love and improve them as means of grace, and 
 will pray for those that are the instruments of my trouble." But it is 
 commonly taken for the reproofs given by righteous men; and it best 
 becomes those that are themselves righteous to reprove the 
 unrighteousness of others, and from them reproof will be best taken. 
 But if the reproof be just, though the reprover be not so, we must make 
 a good use of it and learn obedience by it. We are here taught how to 
 receive the reproofs of the righteous and wise. 

 1. We must desire to be reproved for whatever is amiss in us, or is
 done amiss by us: "Lord, put it into the heart of the righteous to 
 smite me and reprove me. If my own heart does not <I>smite me,</I> as 
 it ought, let my friend do it; let me never fall under that dreadful 
 judgment of being let alone in sin." 

 2. We must account it a piece of friendship. We must not only bear it
 patiently, but take it as a kindness; for <I>reproofs of instruction 
 are the way of life</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:23">Prov. vi. 23</A>),

 are means of good to us, to bring us to repentance for the sins we have 
 committed, and to prevent relapses into sin. Though reproofs cut, it is 
 in order to a cure, and therefore they are much more desirable than the 
 kisses of an enemy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:6">Prov. xxvii. 6</A>)
 
 or the song of fools, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:5">Eccl. vii. 5</A>.

 David blessed God for Abigail's seasonable admonition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+25:32">1 Sam. xxv. 32</A>.

 3.  We must reckon ourselves helped and healed by it: It <I>shall be as
 an excellent oil</I> to a wound, to mollify it and close it up; <I>it 
 shall not break my head,</I> as some reckon it to do, who could as well 
 bear to have their heads broken as to be told of their faults; but, 
 says David, "I am not of that mind; it is my sin that has broken my 
 head, that has broken my bones, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:8">Ps. li. 8</A>.

 The reproof is an excellent oil, to cure the bruises sin has given me. 
 It shall not <I>break my head,</I> if it may but help to break my 
 heart." 

 4. We must requite the kindness of those that deal thus faithfully,
 thus friendly with us, at least by our <I>prayers for them in their 
 calamities,</I> and hereby we must show that we take it kindly. Dr.  
 Hammond gives quite another reading of this verse: "<I>Reproach will 
 bruise me that am righteous, and rebuke me; but that poisonous oil 
 shall not break my head</I> (shall not destroy me, shall not do me the 
 mischief intended), <I>for yet my prayer shall be in their 
 mischiefs,</I> that God would preserve me from them, and my prayer 
 shall not be in vain."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David hopes his persecutors will, some time or other, bear to be 
 told of their faults, as he was willing to be told of his 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 "<I>When their judges</I>" (Saul and his officers who judged and 
 condemned David, and would themselves be sole judges) "<I>are 
 overthrown in stony places,</I> among the rocks in the wilderness, then 
 <I>they shall hear my words, for they are sweet.</I>" Some think this 
 refers to the relentings that were in Saul's breast when he said, with 
 tears, <I>Is this thy voice, my son David?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:16,26:21">1 Sam. xxiv. 16; xxvi. 21</A>.

 Or we may take it more generally: even judges, great as they are, may
 come to be overthrown. Those that make the greatest figure in this 
 world do not always meet with level smooth ways through it. And those 
 that slighted the word of God before will relish it, and be glad of it, 
 when they are in affliction, for that opens the ear to instruction. 
 When the world is bitter the word is sweet. Oppressed innocency cannot 
 gain a hearing with those that live in pomp and pleasure, but when they 
 come to be overthrown themselves they will have more compassionate 
 thoughts of the afflicted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. David complains of the great extremity to which he and his friends 
 were reduced 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth,</I> out of which they 
 are thrown up, so long have we been dead, or into which they are ready 
 to be thrown, so near are we to the pit; and they are as little 
 regarded as chips among the hewers of wood, which are thrown in 
 neglected heaps: <I>As one that cuts and cleaves the earth</I> (so some 
 read it), alluding to the ploughman who tears the earth in pieces with 
 his plough-share, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+129:3">Ps. cxxix. 3</A>.
 
 <I>Can these dry bones live?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. David casts himself upon God, and depends upon him for deliverance: 
 "<I>But my eyes are unto thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 for, when the case is ever so deplorable, thou canst redress all the 
 grievances. From thee I expect relief, bad as things are, and in 
 <I>thee is my trust.</I>" Those that have their eye towards God may 
 have their hopes in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He prays that God would succour and relieve him as his necessity 
 required. 

 1. That he would comfort him: "<I>Leave not my soul desolate and
 destitute;</I> still let me see where my help is." 

 2. That he would prevent the designs of his enemies against him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Keep me from</I> being taken in <I>the snare they have laid for 
 me;</I> give me to discover it and to evade it." Be the gin placed with 
 ever so much subtlety, God can and will secure his people from being 
 taken in it. 

 3.  That God would, in justice, turn the designs of his enemies upon
 themselves, and, in mercy, deliver him from being ruined by them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:10"><I>v.</I>  10</A>):

 <I>let the wicked fall into their own net,</I> the net which, 
 intentionally, they procured for me, but which, meritoriously, they 
 prepared for themselves. <I>Nec lex est justioir ulla quam necis 
 artifices arte perire sua--No law can be more just than that the 
 architects of destruction should perish by their own contrivances.</I> 
 All that are bound over to God's justice are held in the cords of their 
 own iniquity. But let me at the same time obtain a discharge. The 
 entangling and ensnaring of the wicked sometimes prove the escape and 
 enlargement of the righteous.</P>
