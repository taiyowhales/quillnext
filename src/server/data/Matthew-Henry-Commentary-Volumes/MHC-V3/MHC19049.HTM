 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is a sermon, and so is the next. In most of the psalms we
 have the penman praying or praising; in these we have him preaching;
 and it is our duty, in singing psalms, to teach and admonish ourselves
 and one another. The scope and design of this discourse is to convince
 the men of this world of their sin and folly in setting their hearts
 upon the things of this world, and so to persuade them to seek the
 things of a better world; as also to comfort the people of God, in
 reference to their own troubles and the grief that arises from the
 prosperity of the wicked.

 I. In the preface he proposes to awaken worldly people out of their
 security

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>)

 and to comfort himself and other godly people in a day of distress,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 II. In the rest of the psalm, 

 1. He endeavours to convince sinners of their folly in doting upon the 
 wealth of this world, by showing them 

 (1.) That they cannot, with all their wealth, save their friends from 
 death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.
 
 (2.) They cannot save themselves from death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:10">ver. 10</A>.
 
 (3.) They cannot secure to themselves a happiness in this world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.
 
 Much less, 

 (4.) Can they secure to themselves a happiness in the other world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:14">ver. 14</A>.
 
 2. He endeavours to comfort himself and other good people,

 (1.) Against the fear of death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:15">ver. 15</A>.

 (2.) Against the fear of the prospering power of wicked people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:16-20">ver. 16-20</A>.

 In singing this psalm let us receive these instructions, and be 
 wise.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. A psalm for the sons of Korah.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Hear this, all <I>ye</I> people; give ear, all <I>ye</I> inhabitants of the
 world:
 &nbsp; 2 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
 &nbsp; 3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my
 heart <I>shall be</I> of understanding.
 &nbsp; 4 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark
 saying upon the harp.
 &nbsp; 5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, <I>when</I> the
 iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is the psalmist's preface to his discourse concerning the vanity 
 of the world and its insufficiency to make us happy; and we seldom meet 
 with an introduction more solemn than this is; for there is no truth of 
 more undoubted certainty, nor of greater weight and importance, and the 
 consideration of which will be of more advantage to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He demands the attention of others to that which he was about to say 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>):

 <I>Hear this, all you people;</I> hear it and heed it, hear it and
 consider it; what is spoken once, hear twice. <I>Hear and give ear,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:9,11">Ps. lxii. 9, 11</A>.

 Not only, "Hear, all you Israelites, and give ear all the inhabitants
 of Canaan," but, <I>Hear, all you people, and give ear, all you 
 inhabitants of the world;</I> for this doctrine is not peculiar to 
 those that are blessed with divine revelation, but even the light of 
 nature witnesses to it. All men may know, and therefore let all men 
 consider, that their riches will not profit them in the day of death. 
 <I>Both low and high,</I> both <I>rich and poor,</I> must come 
 together, to hear the word of God; let both therefore hear this with 
 application. Let those that are high and rich in the world hear of the 
 vanity of their worldly possessions and not be proud of them, nor 
 secure in the enjoyment of them, but lay them out in doing good, that 
 with them they may make to themselves friends; let those that are poor 
 and low hear this and be content with their little, and not envy those 
 that have abundance. Poor people are as much in danger from an 
 inordinate desire towards the wealth of the world as rich people from 
 an inordinate delight in it. He gives a good reason why his discourse 
 should be regarded 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>My mouth shall speak of wisdom;</I> what he had to say,

 1. Was true and good. It is wisdom and understanding; it will make
 those wise and intelligent that receive it and submit to it. It is not
 doubtful but certain, not trivial but weighty, not a matter of nice 
 speculation but of admirable use to guide us in the right way to our 
 great end. 

 2. It was what he had himself well digested. What his mouth spoke was 
 the <I>meditation of his heart</I> (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:14,45:1">Ps. xix. 14; xlv. 1</A>);

 it was what God put into his mind, what he had himself seriously
 considered, and was fully apprized of the meaning of and convinced of 
 the truth of. That which ministers speak from their own hearts is most 
 likely to reach the hearts of their hearers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He engages his own attention 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>I will incline my ear to a parable.</I> It is called a
 <I>parable,</I> not because it is figurative and obscure, but because 
 it is a wise discourse and very instructive. It is the same word that 
 is used concerning Solomon's proverbs. The psalmist will himself 
 incline his ear to it. This intimates,

 1. That he was taught it by the Spirit of God and did not speak of
 himself. Those that undertake to teach others must first learn 
 themselves. 

 2. That he thought himself nearly concerned in it, and was resolved not
 to venture his own soul upon that bottom which he dissuaded others from 
 venturing theirs upon. 

 3. That he would not expect others should attend to that which he
 himself did not attend to as a matter of the greatest importance. Where 
 God <I>gives the tongue of the learned</I> he first <I>wakens the ear 
 to hear as the learned,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:4">Isa. l. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He promises to make the matter as plain and as affecting as he 
 could: <I>I will open my dark saying upon the harp.</I> What he learned 
 for himself he would not conceal or confine to himself, but would 
 communicate, for the benefit of others. 

 1. Some understood it not, it was a riddle to them; tell them of the
 vanity of the things that are seen, and of the reality and weight of 
 invisible things, and they say, <I>Ah Lord God! doth he not speak 
 parables?</I> For the sake of such, he would open this dark saying, and 
 make it so plain that he that runs might read it. 

 2. Others understood it well enough, but they were not moved by it, it 
 never affected them, and for their sake he would open it upon the harp, 
 and try that expedient to work upon them, to win upon them. <I>A verse 
 may find him who a sermon flies.</I> Herbert.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He begins with the application of it to himself, and that is the 
 right method in which to treat of divine things. We must first preach 
 to ourselves before we undertake to admonish or instruct others. Before 
 he comes to set down the folly of carnal security 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 he here lays down, from his own experience, the benefit and comfort of
 a holy gracious security, which those enjoy who trust in God, and not 
 in their worldly wealth: <I>Wherefore should I fear?</I> he means, 
 <I>Wherefore should I fear their fear</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:12">Isa. viii. 12</A>),

 the fears of worldly people.

 1. "Wherefore should I be afraid of them? Wherefore should I fear in
 the days of trouble and persecution, <I>when the iniquity of my 
 heels,</I> or of my supplanters that endeavour to trip up my heels, 
 <I>shall compass me about,</I> and they shall surround me with their 
 mischievous attempts? Why should I be afraid of those all whose power 
 lies in their wealth, which will not enable them to redeem their 
 friends? I will not fear their power, for it cannot enable them to ruin 
 me." The great men of the world will not appear at all formidable when 
 we consider what little stead their wealth will stand them in. We need 
 not fear their casting us down from our excellency who cannot support 
 themselves in their own excellency. 

 2. "Wherefore should I be afraid like them?" The days of old age and
 death are the <I>days of evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:1">Eccl. xii. 1</A>.

 In the day of judgment <I>the iniquity of our heels</I> (or of our
 steps, our past sins) will compass us about, will be set in order 
 before us. <I>Every work will be brought into judgment, with every 
 secret thing;</I> and <I>every one of us must give account of 
 himself.</I> In these days worldly wicked people will be afraid; 
 nothing more dreadful to those that have set their hearts upon the 
 world than to think of leaving it; death to them is the king of 
 terrors, because, after death, comes the judgment, when their sins will 
 surround them as so many furies; but wherefore should a good man fear 
 death, who has God with him?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:4">
 Ps. 23:4</A>.

 When his iniquities compass him about, he sees them all pardoned, his
 conscience is purified and pacified, and then even in the judgment-day, 
 when the hearts of others fail them for fear, he can lift up his head 
 with joy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:26,28">Luke xxi. 26, 28</A>.

 Note, The children of God, though ever so poor, are in this truly
 happy, above the most prosperous of the children of this world, that 
 they are well guarded against the terrors of death and the judgment to 
 come.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
 multitude of their riches;
 &nbsp; 7 None <I>of them</I> can by any means redeem his brother, nor give
 to God a ransom for him:
 &nbsp; 8 (For the redemption of their soul <I>is</I> precious, and it
 ceaseth for ever:)
 &nbsp; 9 That he should still live for ever, <I>and</I> not see corruption.
 &nbsp; 10 For he seeth <I>that</I> wise men die, likewise the fool and the
 brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
 &nbsp; 11 Their inward thought <I>is, that</I> their houses <I>shall

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A description of the spirit and way of worldly people, whose portion 
 is in this life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>.

 It is taken for granted that they have wealth, and a multitude of
 riches 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 houses and lands of inheritance, which they call their own, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 God often gives abundance of the good things of this world to bad men 
 who live in contempt of him and rebellion against him, by which it 
 appears that they are not the best things in themselves (for then God 
 would give most of them to his best friends), and that they are not the 
 best things for us, for then those would not have so much of them who, 
 being marked for ruin, are to be ripened for it by their prosperity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:32">Prov. i. 32</A>.

 A man may have abundance of the wealth of this world and be made better
 by it, may thereby have his heart enlarged in love, and thankfulness, 
 and obedience, and may do that good with it which will be fruit 
 abounding to his account; and therefore it is not men's having riches 
 that denominates them worldly, but their setting their hearts upon them 
 as the best things; and so these worldly people are here described. 

 1. They repose a confidence in their riches: <I>They trust in their
 wealth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 they depend upon it as their portion and happiness, and expect that it
 will secure them from all evil and supply them with all good, and that
 they need nothing else, no, not God himself. Their gold is their hope
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:24">Job xxxi. 24</A>),

 and so it becomes their God. Thus our Saviour explains the difficulty
 of the salvation of rich people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+10:24">Mark x. 24</A>):

 <I>How hard is it for those that trust in riches to enter into the
 kingdom of God!</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:17">1 Tim. vi. 17</A>.

 2. They take a pride in their riches: <I>They boast themselves in the
 multitude of them,</I> as if they were sure tokens of God's favour and 
 certain proofs of their own ingenuity and industry (<I>my might, and 
 the power of my hand, have gotten me this wealth</I>), as if they made 
 them truly great and happy, and more really excellent than their 
 neighbours. They boast that they have all they would have 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:3">Ps. x. 3</A>)
 
 and can set all the world at defiance (<I>I sit as a queen, and shall
 be a lady for ever</I>); therefore <I>they call their lands after their 
 own names,</I> hoping thereby to perpetuate their memory; and, if their 
 lands do retain the names by which they called them, it is but a poor 
 honour; but they often change their names when they change their 
 owners. 

 3. They flatter themselves with an expectation of the perpetuity of
 their worldly possessions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Their inward thought is that their houses shall continue for
 ever,</I> and with this thought they please themselves. Are not all
 thoughts inward? Yes; but it intimates,

 (1.) That this thought is deeply rooted in their minds, is rolled and 
 revolved there, and carefully lodged in the innermost recesses of their 
 hearts. A godly man has thoughts of the world, but they are his outward 
 thoughts; his inward thought is reserved for God and heavenly things: 
 but a worldly man has only some floating foreign thoughts of the things 
 of God, while his fixed thought, his inward thought, is about the 
 world; that lies nearest his heart, and is upon the throne there. 

 (2.) There it is industriously concealed. They cannot, for shame, say 
 that they expect their houses to continue for ever, but inwardly they 
 think so. If they cannot persuade themselves that they shall continue
 for ever, yet they are so foolish as to think <I>their houses</I> 
 shall, and their dwelling-places; and suppose they should, what good 
 will that do them when they shall be no longer theirs? But they will 
 not; for the world passes away, and the fashion of it. All things are 
 devoured by the teeth of time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A demonstration of their folly herein. In general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <I>This their way is their folly.</I> Note, The way of worldliness is a
 very foolish way: those that lay up their treasure on earth, and set 
 their affections on things below, act contrary both to right reason and 
 to their true interest. God himself pronounced him <I>a fool</I> who 
 thought his goods were laid up for many years, and that they would be a 
 portion for his soul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:19,20">Luke xii. 19, 20</A>.

 And yet their posterity approve their sayings, agree with them in the
 same sentiments, say as they say and do as they do, and tread in the
 steps of their worldliness. Note, The love of the world is a disease 
 that runs in the blood; men have it by kind, till the grace of God 
 cures it. To prove the folly of carnal worldlings he shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That with all their wealth they cannot save the life of the dearest 
 friend they have in the world, nor purchase a reprieve for him when he 
 is under the arrest of death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>):

 <I>None of them can by any means redeem his brother,</I> his brother
 worldling, who would give counter-security out of his own estate, if he 
 would but be bail for him: and gladly he would, in hopes that he might 
 do the same kindness for him another time. But their words will not be 
 taken one for another, nor will one man's estate be the ransom of 
 another man's life. God does not value it; it is of no account with
 him; and the true value of things is as they stand in his books. His 
 justice will not accept it by way of commutation or equivalent. The 
 Lord of our brother's life is the Lord of our estate, and may take both 
 if he please, without either difficulty to himself or wrong to us; and 
 therefore one cannot be ransom for another. We cannot bribe death, that 
 our brother should still live, much less that he should live for ever, 
 in this world, nor bribe the grave, that he should not see corruption; 
 for we must needs die, and return to the dust, and there is no 
 discharge from that war. What folly is it to trust to that, and boast
 of that, which will not enable us so much as for one hour to respite 
 the execution of the sentence of death upon a parent, a child, or 
 friend that is to us as our own soul! It is certainly true that <I>the 
 redemption of the soul is precious and ceaseth for ever;</I> that is, 
 life, when it is going, cannot be arrested, and when it is gone it 
 cannot be recalled, by any human art, or worldly price. But this looks 
 further, to the eternal redemption which was to be wrought out by the 
 Messiah, whom the Old-testament saints had an eye to as the Redeemer.
 Everlasting life is a jewel of too great a value to be purchased by the 
 wealth of this world. We are <I>not redeemed with corruptible things, 
 such as silver and gold,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:18,19">1 Pet. i. 18, 19</A>.

 The learned Dr. Hammond applies the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:8,9">8th and 9th verses</A>

 expressly to Christ: "<I>The redemption of the soul shall be
 precious,</I> shall be high-prized, it shall cost very dear; but, being 
 once wrought, it shall cease for ever, it shall never need to be 
 repeated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:25,26,10:12">Heb. ix. 25, 26; x. 12</A>.

 And he (that is, the Redeemer) <I>shall yet live for ever, and shall
 not see corruption;</I> he shall rise again before he sees corruption, 
 and then shall live for evermore,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:18">Rev. i. 18</A>.

 Christ did that for us which all the riches of the world could not do;
 well therefore may he be dearer to us than any worldly things. Christ 
 did that for us which a brother, a friend, could not do for us, no, not 
 one of the best estate or interest; and therefore those that <I>love 
 father or brother more than him are not worthy of him.</I> This 
 likewise shows the folly of worldly people, who sell their souls for 
 that which would never buy them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That with all their wealth they cannot secure themselves from the 
 stroke of death. The worldling sees, and it vexes him to see it, that 
 <I>wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Therefore he cannot but expect that it will, at length, come to his own 
 turn; he cannot find any encouragement to hope that he himself shall 
 continue for ever, and therefore foolishly comforts himself with this, 
 that, though he shall not, his house shall. Some rich people are wise, 
 they are politicians, but they cannot out-wit death, nor evade his 
 stroke, with all their art and management; others are fools and brutish 
 (<I>Fortuna favet fatuis--Fools are Fortune's favourites</I>); these, 
 though they do no good, yet perhaps do no great hurt in the world: but 
 that shall not excuse them; they shall perish, and be taken away by 
 death, as well as the wise that did mischief with their craft. Or by
 the wise and the foolish we may understand the godly and the wicked; 
 the godly die, and their death is their deliverance; the wicked perish, 
 and their death is their destruction; but, however, they leave their 
 wealth to others.

 (1.) They cannot continue with it, nor will it serve to procure them a
 reprieve. That is a frivolous plea, though once it served a turn 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+41:8">Jer. xli. 8</A>),

 <I>Slay us not, for we have treasures in the field.</I> 

 (2.) They cannot carry it away with them, but must leave it behind 
 them.

 (3.) They cannot foresee who will enjoy it when they have left it; they 
 must leave it to others, but to whom they know not, perhaps to a fool

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:19">Eccl. ii. 19</A>),
 
 perhaps to an enemy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That, as their wealth will stand them in no stead in a dying hour, 
 so neither will their honour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Man, being in honour, abides not.</I> We will suppose a man advanced
 to the highest pinnacle of preferment, as great and happy as the world 
 can make him, man in splendour, man at his best estate, surrounded and 
 supported with all the advantages he can desire; yet then he abides 
 not. His honour does not continue; that is a fleeting shadow. He 
 himself does not, he tarries not all night; this world is an inn, in 
 which his stay is so short that he can scarcely be said to get a 
 night's lodging in it; so little rest is there in these things; he has 
 but a baiting time. <I>He is like the beasts that perish;</I> that is, 
 he must as certainly die as the beasts, and his death will be as final 
 a period to his state in this world as theirs is; his dead body 
 likewise will putrefy as theirs does; and (as Dr. Hammond observes) 
 frequently the greatest honours and wealth, unjustly gotten by the 
 parent, descend not to any one of his posterity (as the beasts, when 
 they die, leave nothing behind them to their young ones, but the wide 
 world to feed in), but fall into other hands immediately, for which he 
 never designed to gather them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That their condition on the other side of death will be very 
 miserable. The world they dote upon will not only not save them from 
 death, but will sink them so much the lower into hell 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>Like sheep they are laid in the grave.</I> Their prosperity did but
 feed them like sheep for the slaughter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:16">Hos. iv. 16</A>),

 and then death comes, and shuts them up in the grave like fat sheep in
 a fold, <I>to be brought forth to the day of wrath,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:30">Job xxi. 30</A>.
 
 Multitudes of them, like flocks of sheep dead of some disease, are
 thrown into the grave, and there death shall feed on them, the second
 death, <I>the worm that dies not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:20">Job xxiv. 20</A>.

 Their own guilty consciences, like so many vultures, shall be
 continually preying upon them, with, <I>Son, remember,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:25">Luke xvi. 25</A>.

 Death insults and triumphs over them, as it is represented in the fall
 of the king of Babylon, at which <I>hell from beneath is moved,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:9-23">Isa. xiv. 9</A>,

 &c. While a saint can ask proud Death, <I>Where is thy sting?</I> Death 
 will ask the proud sinner, <I>Where is thy wealth, thy pomp?</I> and 
 the more he was fattened with prosperity the more sweetly will death 
 feed on him. And in the morning of the resurrection, when all that 
 sleep in the dust shall awake 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+12:2">Dan. xii. 2</A>),

 <I>the upright shall have dominion over them,</I> shall not only be
 advanced to the highest dignity and honour when they are filled with 
 everlasting shame and contempt, elevated to the highest heavens when 
 they are sunk to the lowest hell, but they shall be assessors with 
 Christ in passing judgment upon them, and shall applaud the justice of 
 God in their ruin. When the rich man in hell begged that Lazarus might
 bring him a drop of water to cool his tongue he owned that that upright 
 man had dominion over him, as the foolish virgins also owned the 
 dominion of the wise, and that they lay much at their mercy, when the 
 begged, <I>Give us of your oil.</I> Let this comfort us in reference to 
 the oppressions which the upright are now often groaning under, and the 
 dominion which the wicked have over them. The day is coming when the 
 tables will be turned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Est+9:1">Esther ix. 1</A>)

 and the upright will have the dominion. Let us now judge of things as
 they will appear at that day. But what will become of all the beauty
 of the wicked? Alas! that shall all be <I>consumed in the grave from 
 their dwelling;</I> all that upon which they valued themselves, and for 
 which others caressed and admired them, was adventitious and borrowed; 
 it was paint and varnish, and they will rise in their own native 
 deformity. The beauty of holiness is that which the grave, that 
 consumes all other beauty, cannot touch, or do any damage to. Their 
 beauty shall consume, the grave (or hell) being a habitation to every 
 one of them; and what beauty can be there where there is nothing but 
 the blackness of darkness for ever?</P>

 his house is increased;

 praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Good reason is here given to good people,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Why they should not be afraid of death. There is no cause for that 
 fear if they have such a comfortable prospect as David here has of a 
 happy state on the other side death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 He had shown
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 how miserable the dead are that die in their sins, where he shows how
 blessed the dead are that die in the Lord. The distinction of men's 
 outward condition, how great a difference soever it makes in life, 
 makes none at death; rich and poor meet in the grave. But the 
 distinction of men's spiritual state, though, in this life, it makes a 
 small difference, where all things come alike to all, yet, at and after 
 death, it makes a very great one. <I>Now he is comforted, and thou art 
 tormented.</I> The righteous has hope in his death, so has David here 
 hope in God concerning his soul. Note, The believing hopes of the 
 soul's redemption from the grave, and reception to glory, are the great 
 support and joy of the children of God in a dying hour. They hope,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That God will redeem their souls from the power of the grave, which
 includes, 

 (1.) The preserving of the soul from going to the grave with the body.
 The grave has a power over the body, by virtue of the sentence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:19">Gen. iii. 19</A>),

 and it is cruel enough in executing that power 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:6">Cant. viii. 6</A>);

 but it has no such power over the soul. It has power to silence, and
 imprison, and consume the body; but the soul then moves, and acts, and 
 converses, more freely than ever

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:9,10">Rev. vi. 9, 10</A>);

 it is immaterial and immortal. When death breaks the dark lantern, yet
 it does not extinguish the candle that was pent up in it. 

 (2.) The reuniting of the soul and body at the resurrection. The soul 
 is often put for the life; that indeed falls under the power of the 
 grave for a time, but it shall, at length, be redeemed from it, when
 <I>mortality shall be swallowed up of life.</I> The God of life, that 
 was its Creator at first, can and will be its Redeemer at last. 

 (3.) The salvation of the soul from eternal ruin: "<I>God shall redeem 
 my soul from the sheol of hell</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 the wrath to come, that pit of destruction into which the wicked shall
 be cast," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It is a great comfort to dying saints that they shall not be hurt of
 the second death

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:11">Rev. ii. 11</A>),

 and therefore the first death has no sting and the grave no
 victory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he will receive them to himself. He redeems their souls, that 
 he may receive them. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:5">Ps. xxxi. 5</A>,

 <I>Into thy hands I commit my spirit, for thou has redeemed it.</I> He
 will receive them into his favour, will admit them into his kingdom, 
 into the mansions that he prepared for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:2,3">John xiv. 2, 3</A>),
 
 those everlasting habitations,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:9">Luke xvi. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Why they should not be afraid of the prosperity and power of wicked 
 people in this world, which, as it is their pride and joy, has often 
 been the envy, and grief, and terror of the righteous, which yet, all 
 things considered, there is no reason for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He supposes the temptation very strong to envy the prosperity of 
 sinners, and to be afraid that they will carry all before them with a 
 high hand, that with their wealth and interest they will run down 
 religion and religious people, and that they will be found the truly 
 happy people; for he supposes, 

 (1.) That they are made rich, and so are enabled to give law to all 
 about them and have every thing at command. <I>Pecuni&aelig; obediunt
 omnes et omnia--Every person and every thing obey the commanding 
 influence of money.</I> 

 (2.) That the glory of their house, from very small beginnings, is 
 increased greatly, which naturally makes men haughty, insolent, and 
 imperious,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+5:16">Ps. v. 16</A>.

 Thus they seem to be the favourites of heaven, and therefore
 formidable.

 (3.) That they are very easy and secure in themselves and in their own 
 minds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>In his life-time he blessed his soul;</I> that is, he thought
 himself a very happy man, such a one as he would be, and a very good 
 man, such a one as he should be, because he prospered in the world. He 
 blessed his soul, as that rich fool who said to his soul, "<I>Soul, 
 take thy ease,</I> and be not disturbed either with cares and fears 
 about the world or with the rebukes and admonitions of conscience. All 
 is well, and will be well for ever." Note, 

 [1.] It is of great consequence to consider what that is in which we 
 bless our souls, upon the score of which we think well of ourselves.
 Believers <I>bless themselves in the God of truth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:16">Isa. lxv. 16</A>)

 and think themselves happy if he be theirs; carnal people bless 
 themselves in the wealth of the world, and think themselves happy if 
 they have abundance of that. 

 [2.] There are many whose precious souls lie under God's curse, and yet 
 they do themselves bless them; they applaud that in themselves which 
 God condemns, and speak peace to themselves when God denounces war 
 against them. Yet this is not all.

 (4.) They are in good reputation among their neighbours: "<I>Men will
 praise thee,</I> and cry thee up, as having done well for thyself in 
 raising such an estate and family." This is the sentiment of all the 
 children of this world, that those do best for themselves that do most 
 for their bodies, by heaping up riches, though, at the same time, 
 nothing is done for the soul, nothing for eternity; and accordingly 
 they <I>bless the covetous, whom the Lord abhors,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:3">Ps. x. 3</A>.

 If men were to be our judges, it were our wisdom thus to recommend
 ourselves to their good opinion: but what will it avail us to be 
 approved of men if God condemn us? Dr. Hammond understands this of the
 good man here spoken to, for it is the second person, not of the wicked 
 man spoken of: "<I>He, in his life-time, blessed his soul, but thou 
 shalt be praised for doing well unto thyself.</I> The worldling 
 magnified himself; but thou that dost not, like him, speak well of 
 thyself, but do well for thyself, in securing thy eternal welfare, thou 
 shalt be praised, if not of men, yet of God, which will be thy 
 everlasting honour."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He suggests that which is sufficient to take off the strength of the 
 temptation, by directing us to look forward to the end of prosperous 
 sinners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:17">Ps. lxxiii. 17</A>):

 "Think what they will be in the other world, and you will see no cause
 to envy them what they are and have in this world."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In the other world they will be never the better for all the 
 wealth and prosperity they are now so fond of. It is a miserable 
 portion, which will not last so long as they must 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>When he dies</I> it is taken for granted that he goes into another
 world himself, but <I>he shall carry nothing away with him</I> of all 
 that which he has been so long heaping up. The greatest and wealthiest 
 cannot therefore be the happiest, because they are never the better for 
 their living in this world; as they came naked into it, they shall go 
 naked out of it. But those have something to show in the other world 
 for their living in this world who can say, through grace, that though 
 they came corrupt, and sinful, and spiritually naked, into it, they go 
 renewed, and sanctified, and well clothed with the righteousness of 
 Christ, out of it. Those that are rich in the graces and comforts of 
 the Spirit have something which, when they die, they shall carry away 
 with them, something which death cannot strip them of, nay, which death 
 will be the improvement of; but, as for worldly possessions, as we 
 <I>brought nothing into the world</I> (what we have we had from 
 others), so it is certain that we shall carry nothing out, but leave it 
 to others, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:7">1 Tim. vi. 7</A>.

 They shall descend, but <I>their glory,</I> that which they called and
 counted their glory, and gloried in, <I>shall not descend after 
 them</I> to lessen the disgrace of death and the grave, to bring them 
 off in the judgment, or abate the torments of hell. Grace is glory that 
 will ascend with us, but no earthly glory will descend after us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In the other world they will be infinitely the worse for all their 
 abuses of the wealth and prosperity they enjoyed in this world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 <I>The soul shall go to the generation of his fathers,</I> his worldly
 wicked fathers, whose sayings he approved and whose steps he trod in, 
 his fathers who would not hearken to the word of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:4">Zech. i. 4</A>.

 He shall go to be there where they are that shall never see light,
 shall never have the least glimpse of comfort and joy, being condemned 
 to utter darkness. Be not afraid then of the pomp and power of wicked
 people; for the end of the man that is in honour, if he be not wise and 
 good, will be miserable; if he understand not, he is to be pitied 
 rather than envied. A fool, a wicked man, in honour, is really as 
 despicable an animal as any under the sun; he is <I>like the beasts 
 that perish</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 nay, it is better to be a beast than to be a man that makes himself
 like a beast. Men in honour that understand, that know and do their 
 duty and make conscience of it, are as gods, and children of the Most 
 High. But men in honour that understand not, that are proud, and 
 sensual, and oppressive, are as beasts, and they shall perish, like the 
 beasts, ingloriously as to this world, though not, like the beasts, 
 indemnified as to another world. Let prosperous sinners therefore be 
 afraid for themselves, but let not even suffering saints be afraid of 
 them.</P>
