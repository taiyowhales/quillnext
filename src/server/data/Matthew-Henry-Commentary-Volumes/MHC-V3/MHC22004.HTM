 In this chapter, 
 
 I. Jesus Christ, having espoused his church to himself
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:11"><I>ch.</I> iii. 11</A>),

 highly commends her beauty in the several expressions of it, concluding
 her fair, all fair, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>

 and again,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:7">ver. 7</A>.

 II. He retires himself, and invites her with him, from the mountains of
 terror to those of delight, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:6,8">ver. 6, 8</A>.

 III. He professes his love to her and his delight in her affection to
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:9-14">ver. 9-14</A>.

 IV. She ascribes all she had that was valuable in her to him, and 
 depends upon the continued influence of his grace to make her more and
 more acceptable to him,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Behold, thou <I>art</I> fair, my love; behold, thou <I>art</I> fair;
 thou <I>hast</I> doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair <I>is</I> as a
 flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.
 &nbsp; 2  Thy teeth <I>are</I> like a flock <I>of sheep that are even</I> shorn,
 which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and
 none <I>is</I> barren among them.
 &nbsp; 3  Thy lips <I>are</I> like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech <I>is</I>
 comely: thy temples <I>are</I> like a piece of a pomegranate within
 thy locks.
 &nbsp; 4  Thy neck <I>is</I> like the tower of David builded for an armoury,
 whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty
 men.
 &nbsp; 5  Thy two breasts <I>are</I> like two young roes that are twins,
 which feed among the lilies.
 &nbsp; 6  Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me
 to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
 &nbsp; 7  Thou <I>art</I> all fair, my love; <I>there is</I> no spot in thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A large and particular account of the beauties of the church, and of 
 gracious souls on whom the image of God is renewed, consisting <I>in 
 the beauty of holiness.</I> In general, he that is a competent judge of 
 beauty, whose <I>judgment,</I> we are sure, <I>is according to 
 truth,</I> and what all must subscribe to, he has said, <I>Behold, thou 
 art fair.</I> She had commended him, and called all about her to take 
 notice of his glories; and hereby she recommends herself to him, gains 
 his favour, and, in return for her respects, he calls to all about him 
 to take notice of her graces. Those that honour Christ he will honour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:30">1 Sam. ii. 30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He does not flatter her, nor design hereby either to make her proud 
 of herself or to court her praises of him; but, 

 (1.) It is to encourage her under her present dejections. Whatever 
 others thought of her, she was amiable in his eyes. 

 (2.) It is to teach her what to value herself upon, not any external 
 advantages (which would add nothing to her, and the want of which would 
 deprive her of nothing that was really excellent), but upon the 
 comeliness of grace which he had put upon her.

 (3.) It is to invite others to think well of her too, and to join 
 themselves to her: "Thou art <I>my love,</I> thou lovest me and art 
 beloved of me, and therefore <I>thou art fair.</I>" All the beauty of 
 the saints is derived from him, and they shine by reflecting his light; 
 it is <I>the beauty of the Lord our God</I> that is <I>upon us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:17">Ps. xc. 17</A>.

 She was espoused to him, and that made her beautiful. <I>Uxor fulget
 radiis mariti</I>--<I>The spouse shines in her husband's rays.</I> It 
 it repeated, <I>Thou art fair,</I> and again, <I>Thou art fair,</I> 
 denoting not only the certainty of it, but the pleasure he took in 
 speaking of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As to the representation here made of the beauty of the church, the 
 images are certainly very bright, the shades are strong, and the 
 comparisons bold, not proper indeed to represent any external beauty, 
 for they were not designed to do so, but <I>the beauty of holiness, the 
 new man, the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not 
 corruptible.</I> Seven particulars are specified, a number of 
 perfection, for the church is enriched with manifold graces by <I>the 
 seven spirits</I> that <I>are before the throne,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+1:4,1Co+1:5,7">Rev. i. 4; 1 Cor. i. 5, 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Her <I>eyes.</I> A good eye contributes much to a beauty: <I>Thou 
 hast doves' eyes,</I> clear and chaste, and often cast up towards 
 heaven. It is not the eagle's eye, that can face the sun, but the 
 <I>dove's eye,</I> a humble, modest, mournful eye, that is the praise 
 of those whom Christ loves. Ministers are the church's eyes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:8">Isa. lii. 8</A>,

 <I>thy watchmen shall see eye to eye</I>); they must be like <I>doves' 
 eyes,</I> harmless and inoffensive 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:16">Matt. x. 16</A>),

 having their <I>conversation in the world in simplicity and godly
 sincerity.</I> Wisdom and knowledge are the eyes of the new man; they 
 must be clear, but not haughty, <I>not exercised in things too high for 
 us.</I> When our aims and intentions are sincere and honest, then we 
 have <I>doves' eyes,</I> when we look not unto <I>idols</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+18:6">Ezek. xviii. 6</A>),

 but have <I>our eyes ever towards the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:15">Ps. xxv. 15</A>.

 The <I>doves' eyes are within the locks,</I> which area as a shade upon
 them, so that,

 [1.] They cannot fully see. As long as we are here in this world we
 <I>know but in part,</I> for a hair hangs in our eyes; <I>we cannot 
 order our speech by reason of darkness;</I> death will shortly cut 
 those locks, and then we shall see all things clearly. 

 [2.] They cannot be fully seen, but as the stars through the thin 
 clouds. Some make it to intimate the bashfulness of her looks; she 
 suffers not her eyes to wander, but limits them with her locks.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Her <I>hair;</I> it is compared to <I>a flock of goats,</I> which 
 looked white, and were, on the top of the mountains, like a fine head 
 of hair; and the sight was more pleasant to the spectator because the 
 goats have not only gravity from their beards, but they are <I>comely 
 in going</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:29">Prov. xxx. 29</A>),

 but it was most pleasant of all to the owner, much of whose riches
 consisted in his flocks. Christ puts a value upon that in the church, 
 and in believers, which others make no more account of than of their 
 hair. He told his disciples that <I>the very hairs of their head were 
 all numbered,</I> as carefully as men number their flocks

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:30">Matt. x. 30</A>),

 and that <I>not a hair of their head should perish,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:18">Luke xxi. 18</A>.

 Some by the <I>hair</I> here understand the outward conversation of a
 believer, which ought to be comely, and decent, and agreeable to the 
 holiness of the heart. The apostle opposes good works, such as become 
 the professors of godliness, to <I>the plaiting of the hair,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:9,10">1 Tim. ii. 9, 10</A>.

 Mary Magdalen's hair was beautiful when she wiped the feet of Christ
 with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) Her <I>teeth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Ministers are the church's teeth; like nurses, they chew the meat for 
 the babes of Christ. The Chaldee paraphrase applies it to the priests 
 and Levites, who fed upon the sacrifices as the representatives of the 
 people. Faith, by which we feed upon Christ, meditation, by which we
 ruminate on the word and chew the cud upon what we have heard, in order 
 to the digesting of it, are the teeth of the new man. These are here 
 compared to <I>a flock of sheep.</I> Christ called his disciples and 
 ministers a <I>little flock.</I> It is the praise of teeth to be 
 <I>even,</I> to be white, and kept clean, <I>like sheep from the 
 washing,</I> and to be firm and well fixed in the gums, and not like 
 sheep that cast their young; for so the word signifies which we 
 translate <I>barren.</I> It is the praise of ministers to be even in 
 mutual love and concord, to be pure and clean from all moral 
 pollutions, and to be fruitful, bringing forth souls to Christ, and 
 nursing his lambs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) Her <I>lips;</I> these are compared to <I>a thread of scarlet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Red lips are comely, and a sign of health, as the paleness of the lips
 is a sign of faintness and weakness; her <I>lips</I> were the colour 
 <I>of scarlet,</I> but thin <I>lips, like a thread of scarlet.</I> The 
 next words explain it: <I>Thy speech is comely,</I> always with grace, 
 <I>good,</I> and <I>to the use of edifying,</I> which adds much to the 
 beauty of a Christian. When we praise God with <I>our lips, and with 
 the mouth make confession</I> of him <I>to salvation,</I> then they are 
 as a <I>thread of scarlet.</I> All our good works and good words must 
 be <I>washed in the blood of Christ,</I> dyed like the <I>scarlet 
 thread,</I> and then, and not till then, they are acceptable to God. 
 The Chaldee applies it to the chief priest, and his prayers for Israel 
 on the day of atonement.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) Her <I>temples,</I> or cheeks, which are here compared to <I>a
 piece of a pomegranate,</I> a fruit which, when cut in two, has rich 
 veins or specks in it, like a blush in the face. Humility and modesty, 
 blushing to lift up our faces before God, blushing at the remembrance 
 of sin and in a sense of our unworthiness of the honour put upon us, 
 will beautify us very much in the eyes of Christ. The blushes of 
 Christ's bride are <I>within her locks,</I> which intimates (says Mr. 
 Durham) that she blushes when no other sees, and for that which none 
 sees but God and conscience; also that she seeks not to proclaim her 
 humility, but modestly covers that too; yet the evidences of all these, 
 in a tender walk, appear and are comely.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (6.) Her <I>neck;</I> this is here compared to <I>the tower of 
 David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 This is generally applied to the grace of faith, by which we are united 
 to Christ, as the body is united to the head by the neck; this <I>is 
 like the tower of David,</I> furnishing us with weapons of war, 
 especially <I>bucklers</I> and <I>shields,</I> as the soldiers were 
 supplied with them out of that tower, for <I>faith</I> is our 
 <I>shield</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:16">Eph. vi. 16</A>):

 those that have it never want a <I>buckler,</I> for God will compass
 them <I>with his favour as with a shield.</I> When this <I>neck is like 
 a tower,</I> straight, and stately, and strong, a Christian goes on in
 his way, and works with courage and magnanimity, and does not hang a
 drooping head, and he does when faith fails. Some make the <I>shields
 of the mighty men,</I> that are here said to hang up in <I>the tower of
 David,</I> to be the monuments of the valour of David's worthies. Their
 shields were preserved, to keep in remembrance them and their heroic
 acts, intimating that it is a great encouragement to the saints to hold
 up their heads, to see what great things the saints in all ages have
 accomplished and won by faith. In 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:1-40">Heb. xi.</A>

 we have the <I>shields of</I> the <I>mighty men</I> hung up, the
 exploits of believers and the trophies of their victories.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (7.) Her <I>breasts;</I> these are <I>like two young roes that are
 twins,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The church's breasts are both for ornament 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:7">Ezek. xvi. 7</A>)

 and for use; they are the <I>breasts of her consolation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:11">
 Isa. lxvi. 11</A>),

 as she is said to <I>suck the breasts of kings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:16">Isa. lx. 16</A>.

 Some apply these to the two Testaments; others to the two sacraments,
 the seals of the covenant of grace; others to ministers, who are to be 
 spiritual nurses to the children of God and to give out to them the 
 <I>sincere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby,</I> and, in 
 order to that, are themselves to <I>feed among the lilies</I> where 
 Christ feeds

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:16"><I>ch.</I> ii. 16</A>),

 that they may be to the babes of the church as full breasts. Or the
 breasts of a believer are his love to Christ, which he is pleased with, 
 as a tender husband is with the affections of his wife, who is 
 therefore said to be to him <I>as the loving hind and the pleasant 
 roe,</I> because <I>her breasts satisfy him at all times,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:19">Prov. v. 19</A>.

 This includes also his edifying others and communicating grace to them,
 which adds much to a Christian's beauty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The bridegroom's resolution hereupon to retire <I>to the mountain 
 of myrrh</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 and there to make his residence. This <I>mountain of myrrh</I> is
 supposed to signify Mount Moriah, on which the temple was built, where 
 incense was daily burnt to the honour of God. Christ was so pleased 
 with the beauty of his church that he chose this to be his rest for 
 ever; here he will dwell <I>till the day break and the shadows flee 
 away.</I> Christ's parting promise to his disciples, as the 
 representatives of the church, answer to this: <I>Lo, I am with you 
 always, even to the end of the world.</I> Where the ordinances of God 
 are duly administered there Christ will be, and there we must meet him 
 at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. Some make these to be the 
 words of the spouse, either modestly ashamed of the praises given her, 
 and willing to get out of the hearing of them, or desirous to be 
 constant to the holy hill, not doubting but there to find suitable and 
 sufficient succour and relief in all her straits, and there to cast 
 anchor, and wish for the day, which, at the time appointed, would 
 <I>break and the shadows flee away.</I> The holy hill (as some observe) 
 is here called both a <I>mountain of myrrh,</I> which is bitter, and a 
 <I>hill of frankincense,</I> which is sweet, for there we have occasion 
 both to mourn and rejoice; repentance is a bitter sweet. But in heaven 
 it will be all frankincense, and no myrrh. Prayer is compared to 
 incense, and Christ will meet his praying people and will bless 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His repeated commendation of the beauty of the spouse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):
 
 <I>Thou art all fair, my love.</I> He had said
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>Thou art fair;</I> but here he goes further, and, in review of the
 particulars, as of those of the creation, he pronounces <I>all very 
 good:</I> "<I>Thou art all fair, my love;</I> thou art all over 
 beautiful, and there is nothing amiss in thee, and thou hast all 
 beauties in thee; thou art <I>sanctified wholly</I> in every part; 
 <I>all things have become new</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:17">2 Cor. v. 17</A>);

 there is not only a new face and a new name, but a new man, a new
 nature; <I>there is no spot in thee,</I> as far as thou art renewed." 
 The spiritual sacrifices must be without blemish. <I>There is no 
 spot</I> but such as is often the spot of God's children, none of the 
 leopard's spots. The church, when Christ shall present it to himself a 
 glorious church, will be altogether <I>without spot or wrinkle,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:27">Eph. v. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Come with me from Lebanon, <I>my</I> spouse, with me from Lebanon:
 look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon,
 from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
 &nbsp; 9  Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, <I>my</I> spouse; thou
 hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of
 thy neck.
 &nbsp; 10  How fair is thy love, my sister, <I>my</I> spouse! how much
 better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments
 than all spices!
 &nbsp; 11  Thy lips, O <I>my</I> spouse, drop <I>as</I> the honeycomb: honey and
 milk <I>are</I> under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments <I>is</I>
 like the smell of Lebanon.
 &nbsp; 12  A garden inclosed <I>is</I> my sister, <I>my</I> spouse; a spring shut
 up, a fountain sealed.
 &nbsp; 13  Thy plants <I>are</I> an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant
 fruits; camphire, with spikenard,
 &nbsp; 14  Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees
 of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These are still the words of Christ to his church, expressing his great 
 esteem of her and affection to her, the opinion he had of her beauty 
 and excellency, the desire he had of, and the delight he had in, her 
 converse and society. And so ought men to love their wives as Christ 
 loves the church, and takes pleasure in it as if it were spotless and 
 had no fault, when yet it is compassed with infirmity. Now, observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The endearing names and titles by which he calls her, to express his 
 love to her, to assure her of it, and to engage and excite her love to 
 him. Twice here he calls her <I>My spouse</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:8,11"><I>v.</I> 8, 11</A>)

 and three times <I>My sister, my spouse,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:9,10,12"><I>v.</I> 9, 10, 12</A>.

 Mention was made

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:11"><I>ch.</I> iii. 11</A>)

 of <I>the day of his espousals,</I> and, after that, she is called his
 <I>spouse,</I> not before. Note, There is a marriage-covenant between 
 Christ and his church, between Christ and every true believer. Christ 
 calls his church his <I>spouse,</I> and his calling her so makes her 
 so. "I have betrothed thee unto me for ever; and, as the bridegroom 
 rejoices over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee." He is not 
 ashamed to own the relation, but, as becomes a kind and tender husband, 
 he speaks affectionately to her, and calls her his <I>spouse,</I> which 
 cannot but strongly engage her to be faithful to him. Nay, because no 
 one relation among men is sufficient to set forth Christ's love to his 
 church, and to show that all this must be understood spiritually, he 
 owns her in two relations, which among men are incompatible, <I>My 
 sister, my spouse.</I> Abraham's saying of Sarah, <I>She is my 
 sister,</I> was interpreted as a denying of her to be his wife; but 
 Christ's church is to him both a <I>sister</I> and a <I>spouse,</I> as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:50">Matt. xii. 50</A>,

 a <I>sister and mother.</I> His calling her <I>sister</I> is grounded
 upon his taking our nature upon him in his incarnation, and his making 
 us partakers of his nature in our sanctification. He clothed himself 
 with a <I>body</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:14">Heb. ii. 14</A>),

 and he clothes believers with his <I>Spirit</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:17">1 Cor. vi. 17</A>),

 and so they become his <I>sisters.</I> They are children of God his
 Father

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+6:18">2 Cor. vi. 18</A>)

 and so they become his <I>sisters;</I> he that sanctifies, and those
 that are sanctified, are all of one

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:11">Heb. ii. 11</A>);

 and he owns them, and loves them, as his sisters.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The gracious call he gives her to come along with him as a faithful 
 bride, that must forget her own people and her father's house, and 
 leave all to cleave to him. <I>Ubi tu Caius, ibi ego Caia</I>--<I>Where
 thou Caius art, I Caia will be. Come with me from Lebanon,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is a precept; so we take it, like that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:10,13"><I>ch.</I> ii. 10, 13</A>),

 <I>Rise up, and come away.</I> All that have by faith come to Christ
 must come with Christ, in holy obedience to him and compliance with 
 him. Being joined to him, we must walk with him. This is his command to 
 us daily: "<I>Come with me, my spouse;</I> come with me to God as a 
 Father; come with me onward, heavenward; come forward with me; come up 
 with me; <I>come with me from Lebanon, from the top of Amana, from the 
 lions' dens.</I>" These mountains are to be considered, 

 (1.) As seemingly delightful places. Lebanon is called <I>that goodly 
 mountain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:25">Deut. iii. 25</A>.
 
 We read of the <I>glory of Lebanon</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:2">Isa. xxxv. 2</A>)
 
 and its goodly smell, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:6">Hos. xiv. 6</A>.

 We read of the pleasant <I>dew of Hermon</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+133:3">Ps. cxxxiii. 3</A>)
 
 and the <I>joy of Hermon</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:12">Ps. lxxxix. 12</A>);
 
 and we may suppose the other mountains here mentioned to be pleasant
 ones, and so this is Christ's call to his spouse to come off from the 
 world, all its products, all its pleasures, to sit loose to all the 
 delights of sense. All those must do so that would come with Christ;
 they must take their affections off from all present things; yea, 
 though they be placed at the upper end of the world, on <I>the top of 
 Amana</I> and <I>the top of Shenir,</I> though they enjoy the highest 
 satisfactions the creature can propose to give, yet they must <I>come 
 away</I> from them all, and live above the tops of the highest hills on 
 earth, that they may have <I>their conversation in heaven. Come 
 from</I> those mountains, to go along with Christ to the holy mountain, 
 the <I>mountain of myrrh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Even while we have our residence on these mountains, yet we must look 
 for them, look above them. Shall we <I>lift up our eyes to the 
 hills?</I> No; <I>our help comes from the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+121:1,2">Ps. cxxi. 1, 2</A>.

 We must look beyond them, to <I>the things that are not seen</I> (as 
 these high hills are), that <I>are eternal.</I> <I>From the tops of 
 Shenir and Hermon,</I> which were on the other side Jordan, as from 
 Pisgah, they could see the land of Canaan; from this world we must look 
 forward to the better country.

 (2.) They are to be considered as really dangerous. These hills indeed 
 are pleasant enough, but there are in them <I>lions' dens;</I> they are 
 <I>mountains of the leopards,</I> mountains of prey, though they seem 
 <I>glorious and excellent,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:4">Ps. lxxvi. 4</A>.

 Satan, that <I>roaring lion,</I> in the <I>prince of this world;</I> in
 the things of it he lies in wait to devour. On the tops of these 
 mountains there are many dangerous temptations to those who would take 
 up their residence in them; and therefore <I>come with me from</I> 
 them; let us not set our hearts upon the things of this world, and then 
 they can do us no hurt. <I>Come with me from</I> the temples of
 idolaters, and the societies of wicked people (so some understand it); 
 <I>come out from among them, and be you separate. Come from</I> under 
 the dominion of your own lusts, which are as <I>lions</I> and 
 <I>leopards,</I> fierce upon us, and making us fierce.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It may be taken as a promise: Thou shalt <I>come with me from 
 Lebanon, from the lions' dens;</I> that is, 

 (1.) "Many shall be brought home to me, as living members of the 
 church, from every point, from Lebanon in the north, Amana in the west, 
 Hermon in the east, Shenir in the south, from all parts, to <I>sit down 
 with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+8:11">Matt. viii. 11</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:11,12">Isa. xlix. 11, 12</A>.

 Some <I>from the tops of</I> these mountains, some of the great men of
 this world, shall give themselves to Christ.

 (2.) The church shall be delivered from her persecutors, in due time; 
 though now she <I>dwells among lions</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:4">Ps. lvii. 4</A>),

 Christ will take her with himself from among their dens.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The great delight Christ takes in his church and in all believers. 
 He delights in them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As in an agreeable bride, <I>adorned for her husband</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:2">Rev. xxi. 2</A>),

 who <I>greatly desires her beauty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:11">Ps. xlv. 11</A>.

 No expressions of love can be more passionate than these here, in which
 Christ manifests his affection to his church; and yet that great proof 
 of his love, his dying for it, that he might present it to himself a 
 glorious church, goes far beyond them all. A spouse so dearly bought 
 and paid for could not but be dearly loved. Such a price being given 
 for her, a high value must needs be put upon her accordingly; and both 
 together may well set us a wondering at <I>the height and depth, and 
 length and breadth, of the love of Christ, which surpasses 
 knowledge,</I> that love in which he <I>gave himself for us</I> and 
 gives himself to us. Observe,

 (1.) How he is affected towards his spouse: <I>Thou hast ravished my 
 heart;</I> the word is used only here. <I>Thou hast hearted me,</I> or 
 <I>Thou has unhearted me.</I> New words are coined to express the 
 inexpressibleness of Christ's surprising love to his church; and the 
 strength of that love is set forth by that which is a weakness in men, 
 the being so much in love with one object as to be heartless to every 
 thing else. This may refer to that love which Christ had to the chosen 
 remnant, before the worlds were, when <I>his delights were with the 
 sons of men</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:31">Prov. viii. 31</A>),

 that first love, which brought him from heaven to earth, to <I>seek and
 save</I> them at such vast expense, yet including the complacency he 
 takes in them when he has brought them to himself. Note, Christ's heart 
 is upon his church; so it has appeared all along. His treasure is in 
 it; it is his <I>peculiar treasure</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:5">Exod. xix. 5</A>);

 and therefore there his heart is also. "Never was love like unto the
 love of Christ, which made him even mindless of himself, when he 
 emptied himself of his glory, and despised all shame and pain, for our 
 sakes. The wound of love towards us, which he had from eternity in 
 himself, made him neglect all the wounds and reproaches of the cross;" 
 so Bishop Reynolds. Thus let us love him.

 (2.) What it is that thus affects him with delight.

 [1.] The regard she has to him: <I>Thou hast ravished my heart with one 
 of thy eyes,</I> those <I>doves' eyes,</I> clear and chaste (which were 
 commended, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 with one glance of those eyes. Christ is wonderfully pleased with those 
 that look unto him as their Saviour, and through the eye of faith dart 
 their affections to him, above any rival whatsoever, and whose <I>eyes 
 are ever towards him;</I> he is soon aware of the first look of a soul 
 towards him and meets it with his favours.

 [2.] The ornaments she has from him, that is, the obedience she yields 
 to him, for that is the <I>chain of her neck,</I> the graces that 
 enrich her soul, which are connected as links in chain, the exercise of 
 these graces in a conversation which adorns both herself and the 
 doctrine of Jesus Christ, which she professes to believe (as a gold 
 chain is an ornament to persons of quality), and an entire submission 
 to the commanding power of his love. Having shaken off the <I>bands of 
 our neck,</I> by which we were tied to this world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:2">Isa. lii. 2</A>),

 and <I>the yoke of our transgressions,</I> we are bound with the
 <I>cords of love,</I> as <I>chains of gold,</I> to Jesus Christ, and 
 our necks are brought under his sweet and easy yoke, to draw in it.
 This recommends us to Jesus Christ, for this is that true wisdom which, 
 in his account, is <I>an ornament of grace unto the head and chains 
 about the neck,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:9">Prov. i. 9</A>.

 [3.] The affection she has for him: <I>How fair is thy love!</I> how 
 beautiful is it! Not only thy love itself, but all the fruits and 
 products of it, its working in the heart, its works in the life. How 
 well does it become a believer thus to love Christ, and what a pleasure 
 does Christ take in it! Nothing recommends us to Christ as this does.
 <I>How much better is thy love than wine,</I> than all the wine that 
 was poured out to the Lord in the drink-offerings! Hence the fruit of 
 the vine is said to <I>cheer God and man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:13">Judges ix. 13</A>.

 She had said of Christ's love, <I>It is better than wine</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:2"><I>ch.</I> i. 2</A>),

 and now Christ says so of hers; there is nothing lost by praising
 Christ, nor will he be behindhand with his friends in kindness.

 [4.] The ointments, the odours wherewith she is perfumed, the gifts and 
 graces of the Spirit, her good works, which are <I>an odour of a sweet 
 smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:18">Phil. iv. 18</A>.
 
 <I>The smell of thy ointment</I> is better <I>than all spices,</I> such
 as the queen of Sheba presented to Solomon, camel-loads of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+10:2">1 Kings x. 2</A>),

 or, rather, than all the spices that were used in compounding the holy
 incense which was burned daily on the golden altar. Love and obedience 
 to God are more pleasing to Christ than sacrifice or incense. <I>The
 smell of her garments</I> too, the visible profession she makes of 
 religion, and relation to Christ, before men, and wherein she appears 
 to the world, this is very grateful to Christ, as <I>the smell of 
 Lebanon.</I> Christ having put upon his spouse the <I>white raiment</I> 
 of his own righteousness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:18">Rev. iii. 18</A>),

 and <I>the righteousness of saints</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:8">Rev. xix. 8</A>),

 and this perfumed with holy joy and comfort, he is well pleased with
 it.

 [5.] Her words, both in her devotion to God and her discourses with men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Thy lips O my spouse! drop as the honeycomb,</I> drop that which is
 very sweet, and drop it freely and plentifully. If what God speaks to 
 us be <I>sweeter</I> to us <I>than the honey and the honeycomb</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:10">Ps. xix. 10</A>),

 what we say to him in prayer and praise shall also be pleasing to him:
 <I>Sweet is thy voice.</I> And if <I>out of a good treasure</I> in the 
 <I>heart</I> we <I>bring forth good things,</I> if our <I>speech be 
 always with grace,</I> if our <I>lips use knowledge aright,</I> if they 
 <I>disperse knowledge,</I> they then, in Christ's account, even <I>drop 
 the honeycomb,</I> out-drop it. <I>Honey and milk</I> (the two staple
 commodities of Canaan) <I>are under thy tongue;</I> that is, in thy 
 heart, not only reserved there for thy own use as a sweet morsel for 
 thyself, but ready there for the use of others. In the word of God 
 there is sweet and wholesome nourishment, milk for babes, honey for 
 those that are grown up. Christ is well-pleased with those that are 
 full of his word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As in a pleasant garden. And well may a very great delight be 
 compared to the delight taken in a garden, when the happiness of Adam 
 in innocency was represented by the putting of him into a garden, a 
 garden of pleasure. This comparison is pursued, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:12-14"><I>v.</I> 12-14</A>.

 The church is fitly compared to a <I>garden,</I> to a garden which, as 
 was usual, had <I>a fountain</I> in it. Where Solomon made himself 
 <I>gardens</I> and <I>orchards</I> he made himself <I>pools of 
 water</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:5,6">Eccl. ii. 5, 6</A>),

 not only for curiosity and diversion, in water-works, but for use, to
 <I>water the gardens.</I> Eden was <I>well watered,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:10,13:10">Gen. ii. 10; xiii. 10</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) The peculiarity of this garden: It is <I>a garden enclosed,</I> a 
 paradise separated from the common earth. It is appropriated to God; he 
 has <I>set it apart for himself;</I> Israel is God's portion, the lot 
 of his inheritance. It is enclosed for secresy; the saints are God's 
 hidden ones, therefore <I>the world knows them not;</I> Christ walks in 
 his garden unseen. It is enclosed for safety; a hedge of protection is 
 made about it, which all the powers of darkness cannot either find or 
 make a gap in. God's vineyard is <I>fenced</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:2">Isa. v. 2</A>);

 there is a wall about it, a wall of fire. It has a spring in it, and a
 fountain, but it is <I>a spring shut up</I> and <I>a fountain 
 sealed,</I> which sends its streams <I>abroad</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:16">Prov. v. 16</A>),

 but is itself carefully locked up, that it may not by any injurious
 hand be muddied or polluted. The souls of believers are as <I>gardens 
 enclosed;</I> grace in them is as <I>a spring shut up</I> there in 
 <I>the hidden man of the heart,</I> where the water that Christ gives 
 is <I>a well of living water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:14,7:38">John iv. 14; vii. 38</A>.

 The Old-Testament church was <I>a garden enclosed</I> by the partition
 wall of the ceremonial law. The Bible was then a <I>spring shut up</I> 
 and <I>a fountain sealed;</I> it was confined to one nation; but now 
 the wall of separation is removed, the gospel preached to every nation, 
 and <I>in Jesus Christ there is neither Greek nor Jew.</I>

 (2.) The products of this garden. It is as the garden of Eden, where 
 <I>the Lord God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight 
 and good for food,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:9">Gen. ii. 9</A>.

 <I>Thy plants,</I> or plantations, <I>are an orchard of pomegranates
 with pleasant fruits,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 It is not like <I>the vineyard of the man void of understanding,</I> 
 that was <I>all grown over with thorns and nettles;</I> but here are 
 <I>fruits, pleasant fruits, all trees of frankincense,</I> and <I>all 
 the chief spices,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Here is a great plenty of fruits and great variety, nothing wanting 
 which might either beautify or enrich this garden, might make it either 
 delightful or serviceable to its great Lord. Every thing here is the 
 best of the kind. Their <I>chief spices</I> were much more valuable,
 because much more durable, than the choicest of our flowers. Solomon 
 was a great master in botany as well as other parts of natural 
 philosophy; he treated largely of trees 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:33">1 Kings iv. 33</A>),

 and perhaps had reference to some specific qualities of the fruits here
 specified, which made them very fit for the purpose for which he 
 alludes to them; but we must be content to observe, in general, the 
 saints in the church, and graces in the saints, are very fitly compared 
 to these <I>fruits and spices;</I> for,

 [1.] They are planted, and do not grow of themselves; <I>the trees of 
 righteousness</I> are the <I>planting of the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:3">Isa. lxi. 3</A>);
 
 grace springs from an incorruptible seed.

 [2.] They are precious and of high value; hence we read of the 
 <I>precious sons of Zion</I> and their <I>precious faith;</I> they are 
 <I>plants of renown.</I> 

 [3.] They are pleasant, and of a sweet savour to God and man, and, as 
 strong aromatics, diffuse their fragrancy. 

 [4.] They are profitable and of great use. Saints are the blessings of 
 this earth, and their graces are their riches, with which they trade as 
 the merchants of the east with their spices. 

 [5.] They are permanent, and will be preserved to good purpose, when 
 flowers are withered and good for nothing. Grace, ripened into glory, 
 will last for ever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These seem to be the words of the spouse, the church, in answer to the 
 commendations which Christ, the bridegroom, had given of her as a 
 pleasant fruitful garden. Is she a garden?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. She owns her dependence upon Christ himself to make this garden 
 fruitful. To him she has an eye 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 as the <I>fountain of gardens,</I> not only the founder of them, by
 whom they are planted and to whom they owe their being, but the 
 fountain of them, by which they are watered and to which they own their 
 continuance and well-being, and without whose constant supplies they 
 would soon become like the dry and barren wilderness. To him she gives 
 all the glory of her fruitfulness, as being nothing with out him: <I>O 
 fountain of gardens!</I> fountain of all good, of all grace, do not 
 thou fail me. Does a believer say to the church, <I>All my springs are 
 in thee,</I> in thee, O Zion? 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:7">Ps. lxxxvii. 7</A>),

 the church transmits the praise to Christ, and says to him, <I>All my
 springs are in thee;</I> thou art <I>the well of living waters</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:13">Jer. ii. 13</A>),

 out of which flow the <I>streams of Lebanon,</I> the river Jordan,
 which had its rise at the foot of Mount Lebanon, and the waters of the 
 sanctuary, which issued out <I>from under the threshold of the 
 house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+47:1">Ezek. xlvii. 1</A>.

 Those that are gardens to Christ must acknowledge him a fountain to
 them, from whose fulness they receive and to whom it is owing that 
 their souls are as <I>a watered garden,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:12">Jer. xxxi. 12</A>.

 <I>The city of God</I> on earth is made <I>glad</I> with the
 <I>river</I> that flows from this fountain

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:4">Ps. xlvi. 4</A>),

 and the new Jerusalem has its <I>pure river of water of life proceeding
 out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:1">Rev. xxii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. She implores the influences of the blessed Spirit to make this 
 garden fragrant 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Awake, O north wind! and come, thou south.</I> This is a prayer,

 1. For the church in general, that there may be a plentiful effusion of
 the Spirit upon it, in order to its flourishing estate. Ministers' 
 gifts are <I>the spices;</I> when the Spirit is poured out these flow 
 forth, and then <I>the wilderness becomes a fruitful field,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:15">Isa. xxxii. 15</A>.

 This prayer was answered in the pouring out of the Spirit on <I>the day
 of pentecost</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:1">Acts ii. 1</A>),

 ushered in by a <I>mighty wind;</I> then the apostles, who were bound
 up before, flowed forth, and were <I>a sweet savour to God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:15">2 Cor. ii. 15</A>.

 2. For particular believers. Note,

 (1.) Sanctified souls are as gardens, gardens of the Lord, enclosed for 
 him. 

 (2.) Graces in the soul are as spices in these gardens, that in them 
 which is valuable and useful. 

 (3.) It is very desirable that the spices of grace should flow forth 
 both in pious and devout affections and in holy gracious actions, that 
 with them we may honour God, adorn our profession, and do that which 
 will be grateful to good men. 

 (4.) The blessed Spirit, in his operations upon the soul, is as the 
 <I>north and the south wind,</I> which <I>blows where it listeth,</I> 
 and from several points, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:8">John iii. 8</A>.

 There is the north wind of convictions, and the south wind of comforts;
 but all, like the wind, brought <I>out of God's treasuries</I> and 
 <I>fulfilling his word.</I>

 (5.) The flowing forth of the spices of grace depends upon the gales of 
 the Spirit; he stirs up good affections, and works in us both to will 
 and to do that which is good; it is he that makes manifest the savour 
 of his knowledge by us. 

 (6.) We ought therefore to wait upon the Spirit of grace for his 
 quickening influences, to pray for them, and to lay our souls under 
 them. God has promised to give us his Spirit, but he will for this be 
 enquired of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. She invites Christ to the best entertainment the garden affords: 
 "<I>Let my beloved</I> then <I>come into his garden and eat his 
 pleasant fruits;</I> let him have the honour of all the products of the 
 garden (it is fit he should), and let me have the comfort of his 
 acceptance of them, for that is the best account they can be made to 
 turn to." Observe, 

 1. She calls it <I>his</I> garden; for those that are espoused to
 Christ call nothing their own, but what they have devoted to him and 
 desire to be used for him. When the spices flow forth then it is fit to 
 be called his garden, and not till then. The fruits of the garden are 
 his pleasant fruits, for he planted them, watered them, and gave the 
 increase. What can we pretend to merit at Christ's hands when we can 
 invite him to nothing but what is his own already? 

 2. She begs he would visit it, and accept of what it produced. The
 believer can take little pleasure in his garden, unless Christ, the 
 beloved of his soul, come to him, nor have any joy of the fruits of it, 
 unless they redound some way or other to the glory of Christ, and he 
 will think all he has well bestowed upon him.</P>
