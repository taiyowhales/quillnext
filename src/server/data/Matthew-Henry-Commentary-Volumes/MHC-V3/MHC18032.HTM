 The stage is clear, for Job and his three friends have sat down, and 
 neither he nor they have any thing more to say; it is therefore very 
 seasonable for a moderator to interpose, and Elihu is the man. In this 
 chapter we have, 

 I. Some account of him, his parentage, his presence at this dispute,
 and his sentiments concerning it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. The apology he made for his bold undertaking to speak to a question
 which had been so largely and learnedly argued by his seniors. He 
 pleads, 

 1. That, though he had not the experience of an old man, yet he had
 the understanding of a man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:6-10">ver. 6-10</A>.

 2. That he had patiently heard all they had to say, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>.

 3. That he had something new to offer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:14-17">ver. 14-17</A>.

 4. That his mind was full of this matter, and it would be a refreshment
 to him to give it vent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>.

 5. That he was resolved to speak impartially, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:21,22">ver. 21, 22</A>.

 And he did speak so well to this matter that Job made no reply to him,
 and God gave him no rebuke when he checked both Job himself and his 
 other three friends.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he <I>was</I>
 righteous in his own eyes.
 &nbsp; 2  Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the
 Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled,
 because he justified himself rather than God.
 &nbsp; 3  Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because
 they had found no answer, and <I>yet</I> had condemned Job.
 &nbsp; 4  Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they <I>were</I>
 elder than he.
 &nbsp; 5  When Elihu saw that <I>there was</I> no answer in the mouth of
 <I>these</I> three men, then his wrath was kindled.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Usually young men are the disputants and old men the moderators; but 
 here, when old men were the disputants, as a rebuke to them for their 
 unbecoming heat, a young man is raised up to be the moderator. Divers 
 of Job's friends were present, that came to visit him and to receive 
 instruction. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The reason why his three friends were now silent. They <I>ceased to 
 answer him,</I> and let him have his saying, <I>because he was 
 righteous in his own eyes.</I> This was the reason they gave why they 
 said no more, because it was to no purpose to argue with a man that was 
 so opinionative, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Those that are self-conceited are indeed hard to be wrought upon; there 
 is more hope of a fool (a fool of God's making) than of those who are 
 fools of their own making, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+26:12">Prov. xxvi. 12</A>.

 But they did not judge fairly concerning Job: he was really righteous
 before God, and not righteous in his own eyes only; so that it was only 
 to save their own credit that they made this the reason of their 
 silence, as peevish disputants commonly do when they find themselves 
 run a-ground and are not willing to own themselves unable to make their 
 part good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reasons why Elihu, the fourth, now spoke. His name <I>Elihu</I> 
 signifies <I>My God is he.</I> They had all tried in vain to convince 
 Job, but <I>my God is he</I> that can and will do it, and did it at 
 last: he only can open the understanding. He is said to be a
 <I>Buzite,</I> from Buz, Nahor's second son 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:21">Gen. xxii. 21</A>),

 and <I>of the kindred of Ram,</I> that is, <I>Aram</I> (so some),
 whence the Syrians or Aramites descended and were denominated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+22:21">Gen. xxii. 21</A>.

 <I>Of the kindred of Abram;</I> so the Chaldee-paraphrase, supposing
 him to be first called <I>Ram--high,</I> then <I>Abram--a high 
 father,</I> and lastly <I>Abraham--the high father of a multitude.</I> 
 Elihu was not so well known as the rest, and therefore is more 
 particularly described thus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Elihu spoke because he was angry and thought he had good cause to be 
 so. When he had made his observations upon the dispute he did not go 
 away and calumniate the disputants, striking them secretly with a 
 malicious censorious tongue, but what he had to say he would say before 
 their faces, that they might vindicate themselves if they could. 

 (1.) He was angry at Job, because he thought he did not speak so 
 reverently of God as he ought to have done; and that was too true 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>He justified himself more than God,</I> that is, took more care and 
 pains to clear himself from the imputation of unrighteousness in being 
 thus afflicted than to clear God from the imputation of unrighteousness 
 in afflicting him, as if he were more concerned for his own honour than 
 for God's; whereas he should, in the first place, have justified God 
 and cleared his glory, and then he might well enough have left his own 
 reputation to shift for itself. Note, A gracious heart is jealous for 
 the honour of God, and cannot but be angry when that is neglected or 
 postponed, or when any injury is done it. Nor is it any breach of the 
 law of meekness to be angry at our friends when they are offensive to 
 God. <I>Get thee behind me, Satan,</I> says Christ to Simon. Elihu 
 owned Job to be a good man, and yet would not say as he said when he 
 thought he said amiss: it is too great a compliment to our friends not 
 to tell them of their faults.

 (2.) He was angry at his friends because he thought they had not 
 conducted themselves so charitably towards Job as they ought to have 
 done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>They had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</I> They had 
 adjudged him to be a hypocrite, a wicked man, and would not recede from 
 that sentence concerning him; and yet they could not prove him so, nor 
 disprove the evidences he produced of his integrity. They could not 
 make good the premises, and yet held fast the conclusion. They had no 
 reply to make to his arguments, and yet they would not yield, but, 
 right or wrong, would run him down; and this was not fair. Seldom is a 
 quarrel begun, and more seldom is a quarrel carried on to the length 
 that this was, in which there is not a fault on both sides. Elihu, as 
 became a moderator, took part with neither, but was equally displeased 
 with the mistakes and mismanagement of both. Those that in good
 earnest seek for truth must thus be impartial in their judgments 
 concerning the contenders, and not reject what is true and good on 
 either side for the sake of what is amiss, nor approve or defend what 
 is amiss for the sake of what is true and good, but must learn to 
 separate between the precious and the vile.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Elihu spoke because he thought that it was time to speak, and that 
 now, at length, it had come to his turn, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 (1.) He had waited on Job's speeches, had patiently heard him out, 
 until the words of Job were ended. 

 (2.) He had waited on his friends' silence, so that, as he would not 
 interrupt him, so he would not prevent them, not because they were 
 wiser than he, but because they were older than he, and therefore it 
 was expected by the company that they should speak first; and Elihu was 
 very modest, and would by no means offer to abridge them of their 
 privilege. Some certain rules of precedency must be observed, for the 
 keeping of order. Though inward real honour will attend true wisdom and 
 worth, yet, since every man will think himself or his friend the wisest 
 and worthiest, this can afford no certain rule for the outward 
 ceremonial honour, which therefore must attend seniority either of age 
 or office; and this respect the seniors may the better require because 
 they paid it when they were juniors, and the juniors may the better pay 
 because they shall have it when they come to be seniors.</P>

 durst not show you mine opinion.

 teach wisdom.

 Almighty giveth them understanding.

 opinion.

 whilst ye searched out what to say.
 &nbsp; 12  Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, <I>there was</I> none of
 you that convinced Job, <I>or</I> that answered his words:
 &nbsp; 13  Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth
 him down, not man.

 will I answer him with your speeches.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Elihu here appears to have been,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A man of great modesty and humility. Though a young man, and a man 
 of abilities, yet not pert, and confident, and assuming: his face 
 shone, and, like Moses, he did not know it, which made it shine so much 
 the brighter. Let it be observed by all, especially by young people, as 
 worthy their imitation, 

 1. What a diffidence he had of himself and of his own judgment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>I am young, and therefore I was afraid, and durst not show you my 
 opinion,</I> for fear I should either prove mistaken or do that which 
 was unbecoming me." He was so observant of all that passed, and applied 
 his mind so closely to what he heard, that he had formed in himself a 
 judgment of it. He neither neglected it as foreign, nor declined it as 
 intricate; but, how clear soever the matter was to himself, he was 
 afraid to deliver his mind upon it, because he differed in his 
 sentiments from those that were older than he. Note, It becomes us to 
 be suspicious of our own judgment in matters of doubtful disputation, 
 to be swift to hear the sentiments of others and slow to speak our own, 
 especially when we go contrary to the judgment of those for whom, upon 
 the score of their learning and piety, we justly have a veneration. 

 2. What a deference he paid to his seniors, and what great
 expectations he had from them,

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>I said, Days should speak.</I> Note, Age and experience give a man 
 great advantage in judging of things, both as they furnish a man with 
 so much the more matter for his thoughts to work upon and as they ripen 
 and improve the facilities he is to work with, which is a good reason 
 why old people should take pains both to learn themselves and to teach 
 others (else the advantages of their age are a reproach to them), and 
 why young people should attend on their instructions. It is a good 
 <I>lodging with an old disciple,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:16,Tit+2:4">Acts xxi. 16; Tit. ii. 4</A>.

 Elihu's modesty appeared in the patient attention he gave to what his
 seniors said,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 He waited for their words as one that expected much from them, 
 agreeably to the opinion he had of these grave men. He gave ear to 
 their reasons, that he might take their meaning, and fully understand 
 what was the drift of their discourse and what the force of their 
 arguments. He attended to them with diligence and care, and this,

 (1.) Though they were slow, and took up a great deal of time in 
 searching out what to say. Though they had often to seek for matter and 
 words, paused and hesitated, and were unready at their work, yet he 
 overlooked that, and <I>gave ear to their reasons,</I> which, if really 
 convincing, he would not think the less so for the disadvantages of the 
 delivery of them. 

 (2.) Though they trifled and made nothing of it, though none of them 
 answered Job's words nor said what was proper to convince him, yet he 
 attended to them, in hopes they would bring it to some head at last. We 
 must often be willing to hear what we do not like, else we cannot prove 
 all things. His patient attendance on their discourses he pleads,

 [1.] As that which entitled him to a liberty of speech in his turn and 
 empowered him to require their attention. <I>Hanc veniam petimusque
 damusque vicissim--This liberty we mutually allow and ask.</I> Those 
 that have heard may speak, and those that have learned may teach.

 [2.] As that which enabled him to pass a judgment upon what they had
 said. He had observed what they aimed at, and therefore knew what to 
 say to it. Let us be thoroughly apprized of the sentiments of our 
 brethren before we censure them; for <I>he that answers a matter before 
 he hears it,</I> or when he has heard it only by halves, <I>it is folly 
 and shame to him,</I> and bespeaks him both impertinent and 
 imperious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A man of great sense and courage, and one that knew as well when 
 and how to speak as when and how to keep silence. Though he had so much 
 respect to his friends as not to interrupt them with his speaking, yet 
 he had so much regard to truth and justice (his better friends) as not 
 to betray them by his silence. He boldly pleads,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That man is a rational creature, and therefore that every man has 
 for himself a judgment of discretion and ought to be allowed a liberty 
 of speech in his turn. He means the same that Job did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:2"><I>ch.</I> xii. 3</A>,

 <I>But I have understanding as well as you</I>) when he says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),
 
 <I>But there is a spirit in man;</I> only he expresses it a little more 
 modestly, that one man has understanding as well as another, and no man 
 can pretend to have the monopoly of reason or to engross all the trade 
 of it. Had he meant <I>I have revelation as well as you</I> (as some 
 understand it), he must have proved it; but, if he meant only <I>I have 
 reason as well as you,</I> they cannot deny it, for it is every man's 
 honour, and it is no presumption to claim it, nor could they gainsay 
 his inference from it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Therefore hearken to me.</I> Learn here,

 (1.) That the soul is a spirit, neither material itself nor dependent 
 upon matter, but capable of conversing with things spiritual, which are 
 not the objects of sense. 

 (2.) It is an understanding spirit. It is able to discover and receive
 truth, to discourse and reason upon it, and to direct and rule 
 accordingly. 

 (3.) This understanding spirit is in every man; it is the light <I>that 
 lighteth every man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:9">John i. 9</A>.

 (4.) It is the inspiration of the Almighty that gives us this
 understanding spirit; for he is the Father of spirits and fountain of 
 understanding. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:7,Ec+12:7,Zec+12:1">Gen. ii. 7; 
 Eccl. xii. 7; Zech. xii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That those who are advanced above others in grandeur and gravity do 
 not always proportionably go beyond them in knowledge and wisdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Great men are not always wise;</I> it is a pity but they were, for 
 then they would never do hurt with their greatness and would do so much 
 the more good with their wisdom. Men should be preferred for their 
 wisdom, and those that are in honour and power have most need of wisdom 
 and have the greatest opportunity of improving in it; and yet it does 
 not follow that great men are always wise, and therefore it is folly to 
 subscribe to the dictates of any with an implicit faith. The aged do 
 not always understand judgment; even <I>they</I> may be mistaken, and 
 therefore must not expect to bring every thought into obedience to 
 them: nay, <I>therefore</I> they must not take it as an affront to be 
 contradicted, but rather take it as a kindness to be instructed, by 
 their juniors: <I>Therefore I said, hearken to me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 We must be willing to hear reason from those that are every way 
 inferior to us, and to yield to it. He that has a good eye can see 
 further upon level ground than he that is purblind can from the top of 
 the highest mountain. <I>Better is a poor and wise child than an old
 and foolish king,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:13">Eccl. iv. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That it was requisite for something to be said, for the setting of 
 this controversy in a true light, which, by all that had hitherto been 
 said, was but rendered more intricate and perplexed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "I must speak, <I>lest you should say, We have found out wisdom,</I> 
 lest you should think your argument against Job conclusive and 
 irrefragable, and that Job cannot be convinced and humbled by any other 
 argument than this of yours, <I>That God casteth him down and not 
 man,</I> that it appears by his extraordinary afflictions that God is 
 his enemy, and therefore he is certainly a wicked man. I must show you 
 that this is a false hypothesis and that Job may be convinced without 
 maintaining it." Or, "Lest you should think you have found out the 
 wisest way, to reason no more with him, but leave it to God to thrust 
 him down." It is time to speak when we hear errors advanced and 
 disputed for, especially under pretence of supporting the cause of God 
 with them. It is time to speak when God's judgments are vouched for the 
 patronizing of men's pride and passion and their unjust uncharitable 
 censures of their brethren; then we must speak on God's behalf.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That he had something new to offer, and would endeavour to manage 
 the dispute in a better manner than it had hitherto been managed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 He thinks he may expect a favourable hearing; for,

 (1.) He will not reply to Job's protestations of his integrity, but 
 allows the truth of them, and therefore does not interpose as his 
 enemy: "<I>He hath not directed his words against me.</I> I have 
 nothing to say against the main scope of his discourse, nor do I differ 
 from his principles. I have only a gentle reproof to give him for his 
 passionate expressions." 

 (2.) He will not repeat their arguments, nor go upon their principles: 
 "<I>Neither will I answer him with your speeches</I>--not with the same 
 matter, for should I only say what has been said I might justly be 
 silenced as impertinent,--nor in the same manner; I will not be guilty 
 of that peevishness towards him myself which I dislike in you." The 
 controversy that has already been fully handled a wise man will let 
 alone, unless he can amend and improve what has been done; why should 
 he <I>actum agere--do that which has been done already?</I></P>

 speaking.
 &nbsp; 16  When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still,
 <I>and</I> answered no more;)
 &nbsp; 17  <I>I said,</I> I will answer also my part, I also will show mine
 opinion.
 &nbsp; 18  For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth
 me.
 &nbsp; 19  Behold, my belly <I>is</I> as wine <I>which</I> hath no vent; it is
 ready to burst like new bottles.
 &nbsp; 20  I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips
 and answer.
 &nbsp; 21  Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let
 me give flattering titles unto man.
 &nbsp; 22  For I know not to give flattering titles; <I>in so doing</I> my
 maker would soon take me away.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three things here apologize for Elihu's interposing as he does in this 
 controversy which had already been canvassed by such acute and learned 
 disputants:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That the stage was clear, and he did not break in upon any of the 
 managers on either side: <I>They were amazed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 <I>they stood still, and answered no more,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 They not only left off speaking themselves, but they stood still, to 
 hear if any of the company would speak their minds, so that (as we say) 
 he had room and fair play given him. They seemed not fully satisfied 
 themselves with what they had said, else they would have adjourned the 
 court, and not have stood still, expecting what might further be 
 offered. And therefore <I>I said</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 "<I>I will answer also my part.</I> I cannot pretend to give a 
 definitive sentence; no, the judgment is the Lord's, and by him it must 
 be determined who is in the right and who is in the wrong; but, since 
 you have each of you shown your opinion, I also will show mine, and let 
 it take its fate with the rest." When what is offered, even by the 
 meanest, is offered thus modestly, it is a pity but it should be fairly 
 heard and considered. I see no inconvenience in supposing that Elihu 
 here discovers himself to be the penman of this book, and that he here 
 writes as an historian, relating the matter of fact, that, after he had 
 bespoken their attention in the foregoing verses, they were amazed, 
 they left off whispering among themselves, did not gainsay the liberty 
 of speech he desired, but stood still to hear what he would say, being 
 much surprised at the admirable mixture of boldness and modesty that 
 appeared in his preface.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he was uneasy, and even in pain, to be delivered of his 
 thoughts upon this matter. They must give him leave to speak, for he 
 cannot forbear; while he is <I>musing the fire burns</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:3">Ps. xxxix. 3</A>),
 
 <I>shut up in his bones,</I> as the prophet speaks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:9">Jer. xx. 9</A>.

 Never did nurse, when her breasts were gorged, so long to have them
 drawn as Elihu did to deliver his mind concerning Job's case,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:18-20"><I>v.</I> 18-20</A>.

 If any of the disputants had hit that which he thought was the right 
 joint, he would contentedly have been silent; but, when he thought they 
 all missed it, he was eager to be trying his hand at it. He pleads,

 (1.) That he had a great deal to say: "<I>I am full of matter,</I> 
 having carefully attended to all that has hitherto been said, and made 
 my own reflections upon it." When aged men are drawn dry, and have 
 spent their stock, in discoursing of the divine Providence, God can 
 raise up others, even young men, and fill them with matter for the 
 edifying of his church; for it is a subject that can never be 
 exhausted, though those that speak upon it may. 

 (2.) That he was under a necessity of saying it: "<I>The spirit within 
 me</I> not only instructs me what to say, but puts me on to say it; so 
 that if I have not vent (such a ferment are my thoughts in) I shall 
 <I>burst like bottles of new wine</I> when it is working," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 See what a great grief it is to a good minister to be silenced and 
 thrust into a corner; he is full of matter, full of Christ, full of 
 heaven, and would speak of these things for the good of others, but he 
 may not.

 (3.) That it would be an ease and satisfaction to himself to deliver 
 his mind 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>I will speak, that I may be refreshed,</I> not only that I may be 
 eased of the pain of stifling my thoughts, but that I may have the 
 pleasure of endeavouring, according to my place and capacity, to do 
 good. It is a great refreshment to a good man to have liberty to speak 
 for the glory of God and the edification of others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he was resolved to speak, with all possible freedom and 
 sincerity, what he thought was true, not what he thought would please 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>):

 "<I>Let me not accept any man's person,</I> as partial judges do, that 
 aim to enrich themselves, not to do justice. I am resolved to flatter 
 no man." He would not speak otherwise than he thought, either,

 (1.) In compassion to Job, because he was poor and in affliction, would 
 not make his case better than he really took it to be, for fear of 
 increasing his grief; "but, let him bear it as he can, he shall be told 
 the truth." Those that are in affliction must not be flattered, but 
 dealt faithfully with. When trouble is upon any it is foolish pity to 
 suffer sin upon them too 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:17">Lev. xix. 17</A>),

 for that is the worst addition that can be to their trouble. Thou shalt
 not countenance, any more than discountenance, <I>a poor man in his 
 cause</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:3">Exod. xxiii. 3</A>),

 nor regard a sad look any more than a big look, so as, for the sake of
 it, to pervert justice, for that is accepting persons. Or, 

 (2.) In compliment to Job's friends, because they were in prosperity 
 and reputation. Let them not expect that he should say as they said, 
 any further than he was convinced that they say right, nor applaud 
 their dictates for the sake of their dignities. No, though Elihu is a 
 young man, and upon his preferment, he will not dissemble truth to 
 court the favour of great men. It is a good resolution he has taken 
 up--"<I>I know not to give flattering titles to men;</I> I never used 
 myself to flattering language;" and it is a good reason he gives for 
 that resolution--<I>in so doing my Maker would soon take my away.</I> 
 It is good to keep ourselves in awe with a holy fear of God's 
 judgments. He that made us will take us away in his wrath if we do not
 conduct ourselves as we should. He hates all dissimulation and 
 flattery, and will soon <I>put lying lips to silence</I> and <I>cut off 
 flattering lips,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:3">Ps. xii. 3</A>.

 The more closely we eye the majesty of God as our Maker, and the more
 we dread his wrath and justice, the less danger shall we be in of a 
 sinful fearing or flattering of men.</P>
