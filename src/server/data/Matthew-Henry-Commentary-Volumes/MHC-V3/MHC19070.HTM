 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is adapted to a state of affliction; it is copied almost
 word for word from the fortieth, and, some think for that reason, is
 entitled, "a psalm to bring to remembrance;" for it may be of use
 sometimes to pray over the prayers we have formerly made to God upon
 similar occasions, which may be done with new affections. David here
 prays that God would send, 

 I. Help to himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+70:1,5">ver. 1, 5</A>.

 II. Shame to his enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+70:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.
 
 III. Joy to his friends,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+70:4">ver. 4</A>.
 
 These five verses were the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:13-17,70:1-5">last five verses of Ps. xl.</A>

 He seems to have intended this short prayer to be both for himself and
 us a salve for every sore, and therefore to be always in mind; and in
 singing we may apply it to our particular troubles, whatever they
 are.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. <I>A psalm</I> of David, to bring to remembrance.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  <I>Make haste,</I> O God, to deliver me; make haste to
 help me, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 2  Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul:
 let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my
 hurt.
 &nbsp; 3  Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say,
 Aha, aha.
 &nbsp; 4  Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and
 let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be
 magnified.
 &nbsp; 5  But I <I>am</I> poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou
 <I>art</I> my help and my deliverer; O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, make no tarrying.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The title tells us that this psalm was designed to bring to 
 remembrance; that is, to put God in remembrance of his mercy and 
 promises (for so we are said to do when we pray to him and plead with 
 him. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:26">Isa. xliii. 26</A>,

 <I>Put me in remembrance</I>)--not that the Eternal Mind needs a
 remembrancer, but this honour he is pleased to put upon the prayer of 
 faith. Or, rather, to put himself and others in remembrance of former 
 afflictions, that we may never be secure, but always in expectation of 
 troubles, and of former devotions, that when the clouds return after 
 the rain we may have recourse to the same means which we have formerly 
 found effectual for fetching in comfort and relief. We may in prayer 
 use the words we have often used before: our Saviour in his agony 
 prayed thrice, saying the same words; so David here uses the words he 
 had used before, yet not without some alterations, to show that he did 
 not design to tie himself or others to them as a form. God looks at the 
 heart, not at the words.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David here prays that God would make haste to relieve and succour 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+70:1,5"><I>v.</I> 1, 5</A>):

 <I>I am poor and needy,</I> in want and distress, and much at a loss 
 within myself. Poverty and necessity are very good pleas in prayer to a 
 God of infinite mercy, who despises not the sighing of a contrite 
 heart, who has pronounced a blessing upon the poor in spirit, and who 
 fills the hungry with good things. He prays, 

 1. That God would appear for him to deliver him from his troubles in
 due time. 

 2. That in the mean time he would come in to his aid, to help him under 
 his troubles, that he might not sink and faint. 

 3. That he would do this quickly: <I>Make haste</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+70:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+70:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>Make haste, make no tarrying.</I> Sometimes God seems to delay 
 helping his own people, that he may excite such earnest desires as 
 these. <I>He that believes does not make haste,</I> so as to anticipate 
 or outrun the divine counsels, so as to force a way of escape or to 
 take any unlawful methods of relief; but he may make haste by going 
 forth to meet God in humble prayer that he would hasten the desired 
 succour. "<I>Make haste unto me,</I> for the longing desire of my soul 
 is towards thee; I shall perish if I be not speedily helped. I have no 
 other to expect relief from: <I>Thou art my help and my deliverer.</I>
 Thou hast engaged to be so to all that seek thee; I depend upon thee to 
 be so to me; I have often found thee so; and thou art sufficient, 
 all-sufficient, to be so; therefore make haste to me."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He prays that God would fill the faces of his enemies with shame, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+70:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.
 
 Observe, 

 1. How he describes them; they sought after his soul--his life, to
 destroy that--his mind, to disturb that, to draw him from God to sin 
 and to despair. They desired his hurt, his ruin; when any calamity 
 befel him or threatened him they said, "<I>Aha, aha! so would we have 
 it;</I> we shall gain our point now, and see him ruined." Thus 
 spiteful, thus insolent, were they. 

 2. What his prayer is against them: "<I>Let them be ashamed;</I> let 
 them be brought to repentance, so filled with shame as that they may 
 seek thy name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:16">Ps. lxxxiii. 16</A>);

 let them see their fault and folly in fighting against those whom thou
 dost protect, and be <I>ashamed of their envy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:11">Isa. xxvi. 11</A>.

 However, let their designs against me be frustrated and their measures 
 broken; let them be turned back from their malicious pursuits, and then 
 they will be ashamed and confounded, and, like the enemies of the Jews, 
 <I>much cast down in their own eyes,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:16">Neh. vi. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He prays that God would fill the hearts of his friends with joy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+70:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that all those who seek God and love his salvation, who desire it, 
 delight in it, and depend upon it, may have continual matter for joy 
 and praise and hearts for both; and then he doubts not but that he 
 should put in for a share of the blessing he prays for; and so may we 
 if we answer the character. 

 1. Let us make the service of God our great business and the favour of
 God our great delight and pleasure, for that is seeking him and loving 
 his salvation. Let the pursuit of a happiness in God be our great care 
 and the enjoyment of it our great satisfaction. A heart to love the 
 salvation of the Lord, and to prefer it before any secular advantages 
 whatsoever, so as cheerfully to quit all rather than hazard our 
 salvation, is a good evidence of our interest in it and title to it. 

 2. Let us then be assured that, if it be not our own fault, the joy of
 the Lord shall fill our minds and the high praises of the Lord shall 
 fill our mouths. Those that seek God, if they seek him early and seek 
 him diligently, shall rejoice and be glad in him, for their seeking him 
 is an evidence of his good-will to them and an earnest of their finding 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:3">Ps. cv. 3</A>.

 There is pleasure and joy even in seeking God, for it is one of the
 fundamental principles of religion that God is the <I>rewarder of all
 those that diligently seek him.</I> Those that love God's salvation
 shall say with pleasure, with constant pleasure (for praising God, if
 we make it our continual work, will be our continual feast), <I>Let God
 be magnified,</I> as he will be, to eternity, in the salvation of his
 people. All who wish well to the comfort of the saints, and to the
 glory of God, cannot but say a hearty <I>amen</I> to this prayer, that
 those who love God's salvation may say continually, <I>Let God be
 magnified.</I></P>
