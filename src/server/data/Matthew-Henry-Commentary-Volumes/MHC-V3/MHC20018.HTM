 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh <I>and</I>
 intermeddleth with all wisdom.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The original here is difficult, and differently understood. 

 1. Some take it as a rebuke to an affected singularity. When men take a 
 pride in <I>separating themselves</I> from the sentiments and society 
 of others, in contradicting all that has been said before them and 
 advancing new notions of their own, which, though ever so absurd, they 
 are wedded to, it is to gratify a desire or lust of vain-glory, and 
 they are seekers and meddlers with that which does not belong to them.
 He <I>seeks according to his desire, and intermeddles with every 
 business,</I> pretends to pass a judgment upon every man's matter. He 
 is morose and supercilious. Those generally are so that are 
 opinionative and conceited, and they thus make themselves ridiculous, 
 and are vexatious to others. 

 2. Our translation seems to take it as an excitement to diligence in 
 the pursuit of wisdom. If we would get knowledge or grace, we must 
 desire it, as that which we need and which will be of great advantage 
 to us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:31">1 Cor. xii. 31</A>.

 We must <I>separate ourselves</I> from all those things which would 
 divert us from or retard us in the pursuit, retire out of the noise of 
 this world's vanities, and then <I>seek and intermeddle with all</I> 
 the means and instructions of <I>wisdom,</I> be willing to take pains 
 and try all the methods of improving ourselves, be acquainted with a 
 variety of opinions, that we may prove all things and hold fast that 
 which is good.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart
 may discover itself.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A fool may pretend to understanding, and to seek and intermeddle with 
 the means of it, but, 

 1. He has no true delight in it; it is only to please his friends or 
 save his credit; he does not love his book, nor his business, nor his 
 Bible, nor his prayers; he would rather be playing the fool with his 
 sports. Those who take no pleasure in learning or religion will make 
 nothing to purpose of either. No progress is made in them if they are a 
 task and a drudgery. 

 2. He has no good design in it, only <I>that his heart may discover 
 itself,</I> that he may have something to make a show with, something 
 wherewith to varnish his folly, that that may pass off the better, 
 because he loves to hear himself talk.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr18_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  When the wicked cometh, <I>then</I> cometh also contempt, and with
 ignominy reproach.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This may include a double sense:--

 1. That wicked people are scornful people, and put <I>contempt</I> upon 
 others. <I>When the wicked comes</I> into any company, comes into the 
 schools of wisdom or into the assemblies for religious worship, <I>then 
 comes contempt</I> of God, of his people and ministers, and of every 
 thing that is said and done. You can expect no other from those that 
 are profane than that they will be scoffers; they will be an 
 <I>ignominy</I> and <I>reproach;</I> they will flout and jeer every 
 thing that is serious and grave. But let not wise and good men regard 
 it, for the proverb of the ancients says, such <I>wickedness proceeds 
 from the wicked.</I> 

 2. That wicked people are shameful people, and bring <I>contempt</I>
 upon themselves, for God has said that those <I>who despise him shall 
 be lightly esteemed.</I> As soon as ever sin entered shame followed it, 
 and sinners make themselves despicable. Nor do they only draw contempt 
 upon themselves, but they bring <I>ignominy</I> and <I>reproach</I> 
 upon their families, their friends, their ministers, and all that are 
 in any way related to them. Those therefore who would secure their 
 honour must retain their virtue.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  The words of a man's mouth <I>are as</I> deep waters, <I>and</I> the
 wellspring of wisdom <I>as</I> a flowing brook.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The similitudes here seem to be elegantly transposed. 

 1. The <I>well-spring of wisdom</I> is <I>as deep waters.</I> An 
 intelligent knowing man has in him a good treasure of useful things, 
 which furnishes him with something to say upon all occasions that is 
 pertinent and profitable. This is as <I>deep waters,</I> which make no 
 noise, but never run dry. 

 2. The words of such <I>a man's mouth are as a flowing brook.</I> What 
 he sees cause to speak flows naturally from him and with a great deal 
 of ease, and freedom, and natural fluency; it is clean and fresh, it is 
 cleansing and refreshing; from his <I>deep waters</I> there flows what 
 there is occasion for, to water those about him, as the brooks do the 
 low grounds.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  <I>It is</I> not good to accept the person of the wicked, to
 overthrow the righteous in judgment.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This justly condemns those who, being employed in the administration of 
 justice, pervert judgment, 

 1. By conniving at men's crimes, and protecting and countenancing them 
 in oppression and violence, because of their dignity, or wealth, or 
 some personal kindness they have for them. Whatever excuses men may 
 make for it, certainly <I>it is not good</I> thus to <I>accept the 
 person of the wicked;</I> it is an offence to God, an affront to 
 justice, a wrong to mankind, and a real service done to the kingdom of 
 sin and Satan. The merits of the cause must be regarded, not the 
 person. 

 2. By giving a cause against justice and equity, because the person is 
 poor and low in the world, or not of the same party or persuasion, or a 
 stranger of another country. This is <I>overthrowing the righteous in 
 judgment,</I> who ought to be supported, and whom God will make to 
 stand.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth
 for strokes.
 &nbsp; 7  A fool's mouth <I>is</I> his destruction, and his lips <I>are</I> the
 snare of his soul.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon has often shown what mischief bad men do to others with their 
 ungoverned tongues; here he shows what mischief they do to themselves. 
 
 1. They embroil themselves in quarrels: <I>A fool's lips,</I> without
 any cause or call, <I>enter into contention,</I> by advancing foolish 
 notions which others find themselves obliged to oppose, and so a 
 quarrel is begun, or by giving provoking language, which will be 
 resented, and satisfaction demanded, or by setting men at defiance, and 
 bidding them <I>do if they dare.</I> Proud, and passionate men, and 
 drunkards, are fools, whose lips <I>enter into contention.</I> A wise 
 man may, against his will, be drawn into a quarrel, but he is a fool 
 that of choice enters into it when he might avoid it, and he will 
 repent it when it is too late. 

 2. They expose themselves to correction: The <I>fool's mouth</I> does, 
 in effect, <I>call for strokes;</I> he has said that which deserves to 
 be punished with strokes, and is still saying that which needs to be 
 checked, and restrained with strokes, as Ananias unjustly commanded 
 that Paul should be <I>smitten on the mouth.</I> 

 3. They involve themselves in ruin: A <I>fool's mouth,</I> which has
 been, or would have been, the destruction of others, proves at length 
 <I>his own destruction,</I> perhaps from men. Shimei's mouth was his 
 own destruction, and Adonijah's, who spoke against his own head. And 
 when a fool, by his foolish speaking, has run himself into a premunire, 
 and thinks to bring himself off by justifying or excusing what he has 
 said, his defence proves his offence, and his lips are still the snare 
 of his soul, entangling him yet more and more. However, when men by 
 their evil words shall be condemned at God's bar their mouths will be 
 their destruction, and it will be such an aggravation of their ruin as 
 will not admit one drop of water, one drop of comfort, to <I>cool their 
 tongue,</I> which is their snare and will be their tormentor.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  The words of a talebearer <I>are</I> as wounds, and they go down
 into the innermost parts of the belly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Tale-bearers are those who secretly carry stories from house to house, 
 which perhaps have some truth in them, but are secrets not fit to be 
 told, or are basely misrepresented, and false colours put upon them, 
 and are all told with design to blast men's reputation, to break their 
 friendship, to make mischief between relations and neighbours, and set 
 them at variance. Now the words of such are here said to be, 

 1. <I>Like as when men are wounded</I> (so the margin reads it); they 
 pretend to be very much affected with the miscarriages of such and 
 such, and to be in pain for them, and pretend that it is with the 
 greatest grief and reluctance imaginable that they speak of them. They 
 look as if they themselves were wounded by it, whereas really they 
 <I>rejoice in iniquity,</I> are fond of the story, and tell it with 
 pride and pleasure. Thus their words seem; but they <I>go down as 
 poison into the innermost parts of the belly,</I> the pill being thus 
 gilded, thus sugared. 

 2. <I>As wounds</I> (so the text reads it), as deep wounds, deadly 
 wounds, <I>wounds in the innermost parts of the belly;</I> the 
 <I>venter medius vel infimus--the middle or lower belly,</I> the 
 <I>thorax</I> or the <I>abdomen,</I> in either of which wounds are 
 mortal. The words of the tale-bearer wound him of whom they are spoken, 
 his credit and interest, and him to whom they are spoken, his love and 
 charity. They occasion sin to him, which is a wound to the conscience.
 Perhaps he seems to slight them, but they would insensibly, by 
 alienating his affections from one he ought to love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Prodigality is very bad husbandry. Those are not only justly branded 
 as fools among men, but will give an uncomfortable account to God of 
 the talents they are entrusted with, who are wasters of their estates, 
 who live above what they have, spend and give more than they can 
 afford, and so, in effect, throw away what they have, and suffer it to 
 run to waste. 

 2. Idleness is no better. He that is remiss in his work, whose <I>hands 
 hang down</I> (so the word signifies), that stands, as we may, with his 
 thumbs in his mouth, that neglects his business, does it not at all, or 
 as if he did it not, he is own brother to him that is a prodigal, that 
 is, he is as much a fool and in as sure and ready a way to poverty; one 
 scatters what he has, the other lets it run through his fingers. The 
 observation is too true in the affairs of religion; he that is trifling 
 and careless in praying and hearing is brother to him that does not 
 pray or hear at all; and omissions of duty and in duty are as fatal to 
 the soul as commissions of sin.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. God's sufficiency for the saints: His <I>name is a strong tower</I> 
 for them, in which they may take rest when they are weary and take 
 sanctuary when they are pursued, where they may be lifted up above 
 their enemies and fortified against them. There is enough in God, and 
 in the discoveries which he has made of himself to us, to make us easy 
 at all times. The wealth laid up in this tower is enough to enrich 
 them, to be a continual feast and a continuing treasure to them. The 
 strength of this tower is enough to protect them; <I>the name of the 
 Lord</I> is all that whereby he has made himself known as God, and our 
 God, not only his titles and attributes, but his covenant and all the 
 promises of it; these make up a tower, a strong tower, impenetrable, 
 impregnable, for all God's people. 

 2. The saints' security in God. It is a strong tower to those who know 
 how to make use of it as such. <I>The righteous,</I> by faith and
 prayer, devotion towards God and dependence on him, <I>run into it,</I> 
 as their city of refuge. Having made sure their interest in God's name, 
 they take the comfort and benefit of it; they go out of themselves, 
 retire from the world, live above, dwell in God and God in them, and so 
 they are safe, they think themselves so, and they shall find themselves 
 so.</P>

 Having described the firm and faithful defence of the righteous man 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 Solomon here shows what is the false and deceitful defence of the rich
 man, that has his portion and treasure in the things of this world, and 
 sets his heart upon them. His wealth is as much his confidence, and he 
 expects as much from it, as a godly man from his God. See,

 1. How he supports himself. He makes his <I>wealth his city,</I> where 
 he dwells, where he rules, with a great deal of self-complacency, as if 
 he had a whole city under his command. It <I>is his strong city,</I> in 
 which he intrenches himself, and then sets danger at defiance, as if 
 nothing could hurt him. <I>His scales are his pride;</I> his wealth is 
 his wall in which he encloses himself, and he thinks it a <I>high 
 wall,</I> which cannot be scaled or got over, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:24,Re+18:7">Job xxxi. 24; Rev. xviii. 7</A>.

 2. How herein he cheats himself. It is a <I>strong city,</I> and a
 <I>high wall,</I> but it is so only <I>in his own conceit;</I> it will 
 not prove to be really so, but like the house built on the sand, which 
 will fail the builder when he most needs it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before
 honour <I>is</I> humility.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Pride is the presage of ruin, and ruin will at last be the 
 punishment of pride; for <I>before destruction</I> men are commonly so 
 infatuated by the just judgment of God that they are more haughty than 
 ever, that their ruin may be the sorer and the more surprising. Of, if 
 that do not always hold, yet after the heart has been lifted up with 
 pride, a fall comes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:18"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 18</A>.

 2. Humility is the presage of honour and prepares men for it, and
 honour shall at length be the reward of humility, as he had said 
 before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:33"><I>ch.</I> xv. 33</A>.

 That has need to be often said which men are so loth to believe.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  He that answereth a matter before he heareth <I>it,</I> it <I>is</I>
 folly and shame unto him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here how men often expose themselves by that very thing by which 
 they hope to gain applause. 

 1. Some take a pride in being quick. They <I>answer a matter before 
 they hear it,</I> hear it out, nay, as soon as they but hear of it. 
 They think it is their honour to take up a cause suddenly; and, when 
 they have heard one side, they think the matter so plain that they need 
 not trouble themselves to hear the other; they are already apprized of 
 it, and masters of all the merits of the cause. Whereas, though a ready 
 wit is an agreeable thing to play with, it is solid judgment and sound 
 wisdom that do business. 

 2. Those that take a pride in being quick commonly fall under the just 
 reproach of being impertinent. It is folly for a man to go about to 
 speak to a thing which he does not understand, or to pass sentence upon 
 a matter which he is not truly and fully informed of, and has not 
 patience to make a strict enquiry into; and, if it be folly, it is and 
 will be shame.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a
 wounded spirit who can bear?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Outward grievances are tolerable as long as the mind enjoys itself 
 and is at ease. Many infirmities, many calamities, we are liable to in 
 this world, in body, name, and estate, which a man may bear, and bear 
 up under, if he have but good conduct and courage, and be able to act 
 with reason and resolution, especially if he have a good conscience, 
 and the testimony of that be for him; and, if the <I>spirit of a 
 man</I> will <I>sustain the infirmity,</I> much more will the spirit of 
 a Christian, or rather the Spirit of God witnessing and working with 
 our spirits in a day of trouble. 

 2. The grievances of the spirit are of all others most heavy, and 
 hardly to be borne; these make sore the shoulders which should sustain 
 the other infirmities. If the spirit be wounded by the disturbance of 
 the reason, dejection under the trouble, whatever it is, and despair of 
 relief, if the spirit be wounded by the amazing apprehensions of God's 
 wrath for sin, and the fearful expectations of judgment and fiery 
 indignation, <I>who can bear</I> this? Wounded spirits cannot help 
 themselves, nor do others know how to help them. It is therefore wisdom 
 to keep conscience void of offence.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of
 the wise seeketh knowledge.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Those that are prudent will seek knowledge, and apply their ear and 
 heart to the pursuit of it, their ear to attend to the means of 
 knowledge and their heart to mix faith with what they hear and make a 
 good improvement of it. Those that are prudent do not think they have 
 prudence enough, but still see they have need of more; and the more 
 prudent a man is the more inquisitive will he be after knowledge, the 
 knowledge of God and his duty, and the way to heaven, for that is the 
 best knowledge.

 2. Those that prudently seek knowledge shall certainly get knowledge, 
 for God never said to such, <I>Seek in vain,</I> but, <I>Seek and you 
 shall find.</I> If the ear seeks it, the heart gets it, and keeps it, 
 and is enriched by it. We must get knowledge, not only into our heads, 
 but into our hearts, get the savour and relish of it, apply what we 
 know to ourselves and experience the power and influence of it.</P>

 Of what great force gifts (that is, bribes) are he had intimated 
 before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:8,23"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 8, 23</A>.

 Here he shows the power of gifts, that is, presents made even by
 inferiors to those that are above them and have much more than they 
 have. A good present will go far, 

 1. Towards a man's liberty: <I>A man's gift,</I> if he be in prison, 
 may procure his enlargement; there are courtiers, who, if they use 
 their interest even for oppressed innocency, expect to receive a 
 gratuity for it. Or, if a mean man know not how to get access to a 
 great man, he may do it by a fee to his servants or a present to 
 himself; those will make room for him. 

 2. Towards his preferment. It will bring him to sit among <I>great
 men,</I> in honour and power. See how corrupt the world is when men's 
 gifts will not do, though ever so great; nay, will gain that for them 
 which they are unworthy of and unfit for; and no wonder that those take 
 bribes in their offices who gave bribes for them. <I>Vendere jura

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This shows that one tale is good till another is told. 

 1. He that speaks first will be sure to tell a straight story, and 
 relate that only which makes for him, and put the best colour he can 
 upon it, so that his cause shall appear good, whether it really be so 
 or no. 

 2. The plaintiff having done his evidence, it is fit that the defendant 
 should be heard, should have leave to confront the witnesses and 
 cross-examine them, and show the falsehood and fallacy of what has been 
 alleged, which perhaps may make the matter appear quite otherwise than 
 it did. We must therefore remember that we have two ears, to hear both
 sides before we give judgment.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between
 the mighty.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Contentions commonly happen among the mighty, that are jealous for 
 their honour and right and stand upon the punctilios of both, that are 
 confident of their being able to make their part good and therefore 
 will hardly condescend to the necessary terms of an accommodation; 
 whereas those that are poor are forced to be peaceable, and sit down 
 losers. 

 2. Even the contentions of the mighty may be ended by lot if they 
 cannot otherwise be compromised, and sometimes better so than by 
 arguments which are endless, or concessions which they are loth to 
 stoop to, whereas it is no disparagement to a man to acquiesce in the 
 determination of the lot when once it is referred to that. To prevent 
 quarrels Canaan was divided by lot; and, if lusory lots had not 
 profaned this way of appeal to Providence, perhaps it might be very 
 well used now for the deciding of many controversies, both to the 
 honour of God and the satisfaction of the parties, provided it were 
 done with prayer and due solemnity, this and some other scriptures 
 seeming to direct to it, especially 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:26">Acts i. 26</A>.

 If the law be a lottery (as some have called it), it were as well that 
 a lottery were the law.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  A brother offended <I>is harder to be won</I> than a strong city:
 and <I>their</I> contentions <I>are</I> like the bars of a castle.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Great care must be taken to prevent quarrels among relations, and 
 those that are under special obligation to each other, not only because 
 they are most unnatural and unbecoming, but because between such things 
 are commonly taken most unkindly, and resentments are apt to be carried 
 too far. Wisdom and grace would indeed make it most easy to us to 
 forgive our relations and friends if they offend us, but corruption 
 makes it most difficult to forgive them; let us therefore take heed of 
 disobliging a brother, or one that has been as a brother; ingratitude 
 is very provoking. 

 2. Great pains must be taken to compromise matters in variance between 
 relations, with all speed, because it is a work of so much difficulty, 
 and consequently the more honourable if it be done. Esau was a
 <I>brother offended,</I> and seemed <I>harder to be won than a strong 
 city,</I> yet by a work of God upon his heart, in answer to Jacob's 
 prayer, he was won.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his
 mouth; <I>and</I> with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Our comfort depends very much upon the testimony of our own 
 consciences, for us or against us. The <I>belly</I> is here put for the 
 conscience, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:27"><I>ch.</I> xx. 27</A>.

 Now it is of great consequence to us whether that be satisfied, and
 what that is filled with, for, accordingly, will our satisfaction be 
 and our inward peace. 

 2. The testimony of our consciences will be for us, or against us, 
 according as we have or have not governed our tongues well. According 
 as <I>the fruit of the mouth</I> is good or bad, unto iniquity or unto 
 righteousness, so the character of the man is, and consequently the 
 testimony of his conscience concerning him. "We ought to take as great
 care about the words we speak as we do about the fruit of our trees or 
 the increase of the earth, which we are to eat; for, according as they 
 are wholesome or unwholesome, so will the pleasure or the pain be 
 wherewith we shall be filled." So bishop Patrick.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Death and life <I>are</I> in the power of the tongue: and they
 that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. A man may do a great deal of good, or a great deal of hurt, both to 
 others and to himself, according to the use he makes of his tongue. 
 Many a one has been his own death by a foul tongue, or the death of 
 others by a false tongue; and, on the contrary, many a one has saved 
 his own life, or procured the comfort of it, by a prudent gentle 
 tongue, and saved the lives of others by a seasonable testimony or 
 intercession for them. And, if by our words we must be justified or 
 condemned, <I>death and life are,</I> no doubt, <I>in the power of the 
 tongue.</I> Tongues were &AElig;sop's best meat, and his worst. 

 2. Men's words will be judged of by the affections with which they 
 speak; he that not only speaks aright (which a bad man may do to save 
 his credit or please his company), but loves to speak so, speaks well 
 of choice, and with delight, to him it will be life; and he that not 
 only speaks amiss (which a good man may do through inadvertency), but 
 loves to speak so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:4">Ps. lii. 4</A>),

 to him it will be death. As men <I>love it</I> they shall <I>eat the 
 fruit of it.</I></P>

 favour of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. A good wife is a great blessing to a man. He that <I>finds a 
 wife</I> (that is, a wife indeed; a bad wife does not deserve to be 
 called by a name of so much honour), that finds a help meet for him 
 (that is a wife in the original acceptation of the word), that sought 
 such a one with care and prayer and has found what he sought, he has 
 found a <I>good thing,</I> a jewel of great value, a rare jewel; he has 
 found that which will not only contribute more than any thing to his 
 comfort in this life, but will forward him in the way to heaven. 

 2. God is to be acknowledged in it with thankfulness; it is a token of 
 his favour, and a happy pledge of further favours; it is a sign that 
 God delights in a man to do him good and has mercy in store for him; 
 for this, therefore, God must be sought unto.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Poverty, though many inconveniences to the body attend it, has often 
 a good effect upon the spirit, for it makes men humble and submissive, 
 and mortifies their pride. It teaches them to <I>use entreaties.</I> 
 When necessity forces men to beg it tells them they must not prescribe 
 or demand, but take what is given them and be thankful. At the throne 
 of God's grace we are all poor, and must use entreaties, not answer, 
 but make application, must sue <I>sub forma pauperis--as a pauper.</I> 
 
 2. A prosperous condition, though it has many advantages, has often
 this mischief attending it, that it makes men proud, haughty, and 
 imperious: <I>The rich answers the entreaties of the poor roughly,</I> 
 as Nabal answered David's messengers with railing. It is a very foolish 
 humour of some rich men, especially those who have risen from little, 
 that they think their riches will warrant them to give hard words, and, 
 even where they not design any rough dealing, that it becomes them to 
 answer roughly, whereas gentlemen ought to be gentle,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  A man <I>that hath</I> friends must shew himself friendly: and
 there is a friend <I>that</I> sticketh closer than a brother.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon here recommends friendship to us, and shows, 

 1. What we must do that we may contract and cultivate friendship; we 
 must <I>show ourselves friendly.</I> Would we have friends and keep 
 them, we must not only not affront them, or quarrel with them, but we 
 must love them, and make it appear that we do so by all expressions 
 that are endearing, by being free with them, pleasing to them, visiting 
 them and bidding them welcome, and especially by doing all the good 
 offices we can and serving them in every thing that lies in our power; 
 that is <I>showing ourselves friendly.</I></P>

 2. That it is worth while to do so, for we may promise ourselves a 
 great deal of comfort in a true friend. A <I>brother</I> indeed <I>is 
 born for adversity,</I> as he had said, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+17:17"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 17</A>.

 In our troubles we expect comfort and relief from our relations, but
 sometimes <I>there is a friend,</I> that is nothing akin to us, the 
 bonds of whose esteem and love prove stronger than those of nature, 
 and, when it comes to the trial, will do more for us than a brother 
 will. Christ is a friend to all believers that <I>sticks closer than a 
 brother;</I> to him therefore let them show themselves friendly.</P>
