 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm was penned upon a particular occasion, as appears by the 
 title, and yet there is little in it peculiar to that occasion, but 
 that which is general, both by way of thanksgiving to God an 
 instruction to us. 

 I. He praises God for the experience which he and others had had of his
 goodness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. He encourages all good people to trust in God and to seek to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.

 III. He gives good counsel to us all, as unto children, to take heed of
 sin, and to make conscience of our duty both to God and man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>.

 IV. To enforce this good counsel he shows God's favour to the righteous
 and his displeasure against the wicked, in which he sets before us good
 and evil, the blessing and the curse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:15-22">ver. 15-22</A>.

 So that, in singing this psalm, we are both to give glory to God and to 
 teach and admonish ourselves and one another.</P>

 <P>A psalm of David when he changed his behaviour 
 <BR>before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I will bless the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> at all times:
 his praise <I>shall</I> continually <I>be</I> in my mouth.
 &nbsp; 2  My soul shall make her boast in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: the humble shall
 hear <I>thereof,</I> and be glad.
 &nbsp; 3  O magnify the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with me, and let us exalt his name
 together.
 &nbsp; 4  I sought the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and he heard me, and delivered me from all
 my fears.
 &nbsp; 5  They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces
 were not ashamed.
 &nbsp; 6  This poor man cried, and the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> heard <I>him,</I> and saved him
 out of all his troubles.
 &nbsp; 7  The angel of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> encampeth round about them that fear
 him, and delivereth them.
 &nbsp; 8  O taste and see that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> good: blessed <I>is</I> the man
 <I>that</I> trusteth in him.
 &nbsp; 9  O fear the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, ye his saints: for <I>there is</I> no want to
 them that fear him.
 &nbsp; 10  The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that
 seek the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall not want any good <I>thing.</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The title of this psalm tells us both who penned it and upon what 
 occasion it was penned. David, being forced to flee from his country, 
 which was made too hot for him by the rage of Saul, sought shelter as 
 near it as he could, in the land of the Philistines. There it was soon 
 discovered who he was, and he was brought before the king, who, in the 
 narrative, is called <I>Achish</I> (his proper name), here 
 <I>Abimelech</I> (his title); and lest he should be treated as a spy, 
 or one that came thither upon design, he feigned himself to be a madman 
 (such there have been in every age, that even by idiots men might be 
 taught to give God thanks for the use of their reason), that Achish 
 might dismiss him as a contemptible man, rather than take cognizance of 
 him as a dangerous man. And it had the effect he desired; by this 
 stratagem he escaped the hand that otherwise would have handled him 
 roughly. Now, 

 1. We cannot justify David in this dissimulation. It ill became an
 honest man to feign himself to be what he was not, and a man of honour 
 to feign himself to be a fool and a mad-man. If, in sport, we mimic 
 those who have not so good an understanding as we think we have, we 
 forget that God might have made their case ours. 

 2. Yet we cannot but wonder at the composure of his spirit, and how far 
 he was from any change of that, when he changed his behaviour. Even 
 when he was in that fright, or rather in that danger only, his heart 
 was so fixed, trusting in God, that even then he penned this excellent 
 psalm, which has as much in it of the marks of a calm sedate spirit as 
 any psalm in all the book; and there is something curious too in the 
 composition, for it is what is called an alphabetical psalm, that is, a 
 psalm in which every verse begins with each letter in its order as it 
 stands in the Hebrew alphabet. Happy are those who can thus keep their 
 temper, and keep their graces in exercise, even when they are tempted 
 to change their behaviour. In this former part of the psalm,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David engages and excites himself to praise God. Though it was his 
 fault that he changed his behaviour, yet it was God's mercy that he 
 escaped, and the mercy was so much the greater in that God did not deal 
 with him according to the desert of his dissimulation, and we must in 
 every thing give thanks. He resolves, 

 1. That he will praise God constantly: <I>I will bless the Lord at all
 times,</I> upon all occasions. He resolves to keep up stated times for 
 this duty, to lay hold of all opportunities for it, and to renew his 
 praises upon every fresh occurrence that furnished him with matter. If 
 we hope to spend our eternity in praising God, it is fit that we should 
 spend as much as may be of our time in this work. 

 2. That he will praise him openly: <I>His praise shall continually be
 in my mouth.</I> Thus he would show how forward he was to own his
 obligations to the mercy of God and how desirous to make others also
 sensible of theirs.

 3. That he will praise him heartily: "<I>My soul shall make her boast 
 in the Lord,</I> in my relation to him, my interest in him, and 
 expectations from him." It is not vainglory to glory in the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He calls upon others to join with him herein. He expects they will 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>The humble shall hear thereof,</I> both of my deliverance and of my
 thankfulness, <I>and be glad</I> that a good man has so much favour 
 shown him and a good God so much honour done him." Those have most 
 comfort in God's mercies, both to others and to themselves, that are 
 humble, and have the least confidence in their own merit and 
 sufficiency. It pleased David to think that God's favours to him would 
 rejoice the heart of every Israelite. Three things he would have us all 
 to concur with him in:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In great and high thoughts of God, which we should express in 
 magnifying him and exalting his name, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 We cannot make God greater or higher than he is; but if we adore him as
 infinitely great, and higher than the highest, he is pleased to reckon 
 this magnifying and exalting him. This we must do together. God's 
 praises sound best in concert, for so we praise him as the angels do in 
 heaven. Those that share in God's favour, as all the saints do, should 
 concur in his praises; and we should be as desirous of the assistance 
 of our friends in returning thanks for mercies as in praying for them. 
 We have reason to join in thanksgiving to God,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) For his readiness to hear prayer, which all the saints have had 
 the comfort of; for he never said to any of them, <I>Seek you me in 
 vain.</I> 

 [1.] David, for his part, will give it under his hand that he has found 
 him a prayer-hearing God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>I sought the Lord,</I> in my distress, entreated his favour, begged
 his help, <I>and he heard me,</I> answered my request immediately, 
 <I>and delivered me from all my fears,</I> both from the death I feared 
 and from the disquietude and disturbance produced by fear of it." The 
 former he does by his providence working for us, the latter by his 
 grace working in us, to silence our fears and still the tumult of the 
 spirits; this latter is the greater mercy of the two, because the thing 
 we fear is our trouble only, but our unbelieving distrustful fear of it 
 is our sin; nay, it is often more our torment too than the thing itself 
 would be, which perhaps would only touch the bone and the flesh, while 
 the fear would prey upon the spirits and put us out of the possession 
 of our own soul. David's prayers helped to silence his fears; having
 sought the Lord, and left his case with him, he could wait the event 
 with great composure. "But David was a great and eminent man, we may 
 not expect to be favoured as he was; have any others ever experienced 
 the like benefit by prayer?" Yes,

 [2.] Many besides him have <I>looked unto God</I> by faith and prayer, 
 <I>and have been lightened by it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 It has wonderfully revived and comforted them; witness Hannah, who,
 when she had prayed, <I>went her way, and did eat, and her countenance 
 was no more sad.</I> When we look to the world we are darkened, we are 
 perplexed, and at a loss; but, when we look to God, from him we have 
 the light both of direction and joy, and our way is made both plain and 
 pleasant. These here spoken of, that looked unto God, had their 
 expectations raised, and the event did not frustrate them: <I>Their 
 faces were not ashamed</I> of their confidence. "But perhaps these also 
 were persons of great eminence, like David himself, and upon that 
 account were highly favoured, or their numbers made them considerable;" 
 nay,

 [3.] <I>This poor man cried,</I> a single person, mean and 
 inconsiderable, whom no man looked upon with any respect or looked 
 after with any concern; yet he was as welcome to the throne of grace as 
 David or any of his worthies: <I>The Lord heard him,</I> took 
 cognizance of his case and of his prayers, <I>and saved him out of all 
 his troubles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 God will <I>regard the prayer of the destitute,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:17">Ps. cii. 17</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:15">Isa. lvii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) For the ministration of the good angels about us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>The angel of the Lord,</I> a guard of angels (so some), but as
 unanimous in their service as if they were but one, or a guardian 
 angel, <I>encamps round about those that fear God,</I> as the 
 life-guard about the prince, <I>and delivers them.</I> God makes use of 
 the attendance of the good spirits for the protection of his people 
 from the malice and power of evil spirits; and the holy angels do us 
 more good offices every day than we are aware of. Though in dignity and 
 in capacity of nature they are very much superior to us,--though they 
 retain their primitive rectitude, which we have lost;--though they have 
 constant employment in the upper world, the employment of praising God, 
 and are entitled to a constant rest and bliss there,--yet in obedience 
 to their Maker, and in love to those that bear his image, they 
 condescend to minister to the saints, and stand up for them against the 
 powers of darkness; they not only visit them, but encamp round about 
 them, acting for their good as really, though not as sensibly, as for 
 Jacob's

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:1">Gen. xxxii. 1</A>),

 and Elisha's,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:17">2 Kings vi. 17</A>.

 All the glory be to the God of the angels.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He would have us to join with him in kind and good thoughts of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>O taste and see that the Lord is good!</I> The goodness of God
 includes both the beauty and amiableness of his being and the bounty 
 and beneficence of his providence and grace; and accordingly,

 (1.) We must taste that he is a bountiful benefactor, relish the 
 goodness of God in all his gifts to us, and reckon that the savour and 
 sweetness of them. Let God's goodness be rolled under the tongue as a 
 sweet morsel. 

 (2.) We must see that he is a beautiful being, and delight in the 
 contemplation of his infinite perfections. By taste and sight we both 
 make discoveries and take complacency. Taste and see God's goodness, 
 that is, take notice of it and take the comfort of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:3">1 Pet. ii. 3</A>.

 He is good, for he makes all those that trust in him truly blessed; let
 us therefore be so convinced of his goodness as thereby to be 
 encouraged in the worst of times to trust in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He would have us join with him in a resolution to seek God and serve 
 him, and continue in his fear 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>O fear the Lord! you his saints.</I> When we taste and see that he
 is good we must not forget that he is great and greatly to be feared; 
 nay, even his goodness is the proper object of a filial reverence and 
 awe. <I>They shall fear the Lord and his goodness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:5">Hos. iii. 5</A>.
 
 <I>Fear the Lord;</I> that is, worship him, and make conscience of your
 duty to him in every thing, not fear him and shun him, but fear him and 
 seek him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>)

 as a people seek unto their God; address yourselves to him and portion
 yourselves in him. To encourage us to fear God and seek him, it is here 
 promised that those that do so, even in this wanting world, <I>shall 
 want no good thing</I> (Heb. <I>They shall not want all good 
 things</I>); they shall so have all good things that they shall have no 
 reason to complain of the want of any. As to the things of the other 
 world, they shall have grace sufficient for the support of the 
 spiritual life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:9,Ps+84:11">2 Cor. xii. 9; Ps. lxxxiv. 11</A>);

 and, as to this life, they shall have what is necessary to the support
 of it from the hand of God: as a Father, he will feed them with food 
 convenient. What further comforts they desire they shall have, as far 
 as Infinite Wisdom sees good, and what they want in one thing shall be 
 made up in another. What God denies them he will give them grace to be 
 content without and then they do not want it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+3:26">Deut. iii. 26</A>.

 Paul had all and abounded, because he was content, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:11,18">Phil. iv. 11, 18</A>.
 
 Those that live by faith in God's all-sufficiency want nothing; for in
 him they have enough. <I>The young lions</I> often <I>lack and suffer
 hunger</I>--those that live upon common providence, as the lions do, 
 shall want that satisfaction which those have that live by faith in the 
 promise; those that trust to themselves, and think their own hands 
 sufficient for them, shall want (for <I>bread is not always to the 
 wise</I>)--but verily those shall be fed that trust in God and desire 
 to be at his finding. Those that are ravenous, and prey upon all about 
 them, shall want; but <I>the meek shall inherit the earth.</I> Those 
 shall not want who with quietness work and mind their own business; 
 plain-hearted Jacob has pottage enough, when Esau, the cunning hunter, 
 is ready to perish for hunger.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, in this latter part of the psalm, undertakes to teach children. 
 Though a man of war, and anointed to be king, he did not think it below 
 him; though now he had his head so full of cares and his hands of 
 business, yet he could find heart and time to give good counsel to 
 young people, from his own experience. It does not appear that he had 
 now any children of his own, at least any that were grown up to a 
 capacity of being taught; but, by divine inspiration, he instructs the 
 children of his people. Those that were in years would not be taught
 by him, though he had offered them his service 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:8">Ps. xxxii. 8</A>);

 but he had hopes that the tender branches will be more easily bent and
 that children and young people will be more tractable, and therefore he 
 calls together a congregation of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>Come, you children,</I> that are now in your learning age, and are
 now to lay up a stock of knowledge which you must live upon all your 
 days, you children that are foolish and ignorant, and need to be 
 taught." Perhaps he intends especially those children whose parents 
 neglected to instruct and catechise them; and it is as great a piece of 
 charity to put those children to school whose parents are not in a 
 capacity to teach them as to feed those children whose parents have not 
 bread for them. Observe,

 1. What he expects from them: "<I>Hearken unto me,</I> leave your play,
 lay by your toys, and hear what I have to say to you; not only give me 
 the hearing, but observe and obey me." 

 2. What he undertakes to teach them--<I>the fear of the Lord,</I> 
 inclusive of all the duties of religion. David was a famous musician, a 
 statesman, a soldier; but he does not say to the children, "I will 
 teach you to play on the harp, or to handle the sword or spear, or to 
 draw the bow, or I will teach you the maxims of state policy;" but I 
 will teach you <I>the fear of the Lord,</I> which is better than all 
 arts and sciences, better than all burnt-offerings and sacrifices. That 
 is it which we should be solicitous both to learn ourselves and to 
 teach our children.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He supposes that we all aim to be happy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>What man is he that desireth life?</I> that is, as it follows, not
 only to see many days, but to see good comfortable days. <I>Non est 
 vivere, sed valere, vita--It is not being, but well being, that 
 constitutes life.</I> It is asked, "Who wishes to live a long and 
 pleasant life?" and it is easily answered, <I>Who does not?</I> Surely 
 this must look further than time and this present world; for man's life 
 on earth at best consists but of few days and those full of trouble. 
 What man is he that would be eternally happy, that would see many days, 
 as many as the days of heaven, that would see good in that world where 
 all bliss is in perfection, without the least alloy? Who would see the 
 good before him now, by faith and hope, and enjoy it shortly? Who 
 would? Alas! very few have that in their thoughts. Most ask, <I>Who 
 will show us any good?</I> But few ask, <I>What shall we do to inherit 
 eternal life?</I> This question implies that there are some such.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He prescribes the true and only way to happiness both in this world 
 and that to come, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 Would we pass comfortably through this world, and out of the world, our 
 constant care must be to keep a good conscience; and, in order to that,

 1. We must learn to bridle our tongues, and be careful what we say,
 that we never speak amiss, to God's dishonour or our neighbours 
 prejudice: <I>Keep thy tongue from evil speaking, lying, and 
 slandering.</I> So great a way does this go in religion that, <I>if any 
 offend not in word, the same is a perfect man;</I> and so little a way 
 does religion go without this that of him who <I>bridles not his 
 tongue</I> it is declared, <I>His religion is vain.</I> 

 2. We must be upright and sincere in every thing we say, and not 
 double-tongued. Our words must be the indications of our minds; our 
 lips must be kept from speaking guile either to God or man.

 3. We must leave all our sins, and resolve we will have no more to do
 with them. We must <I>depart from evil,</I> from evil works and evil
 workers; from the sins others commit and which we have formerly allowed 
 ourselves in.

 4. It is not enough not to do hurt in the world, but we must study to 
 be useful, and live to some purpose. We must not only depart from evil, 
 but we must <I>do good,</I> good for ourselves, especially for our own 
 souls, employing them well, furnishing them with a good treasure, and 
 fitting them for another world; and, as we have ability and 
 opportunity, we must do good to others also. 

 5. Since nothing is more contrary to that love which never fails (which
 is the summary both of law and gospel, both of grace and glory) than 
 strife and contention, which bring confusion and every evil work, we 
 must <I>seek peace and pursue it;</I> we must show a peaceable 
 disposition, study the things that make for peace, do nothing to break 
 the peace and to make mischief. If peace seem to flee from us, we must 
 pursue it; <I>follow peace with all men,</I> spare no pains, no 
 expense, to preserve and recover peace; be willing to deny ourselves a 
 great deal, both in honour and interest, for peace' sake. These 
 excellent directions in a way to life and good are transcribed into the 
 New Testament and made part of our gospel duty,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:10">1 Pet. iii. 10, 11</A>.

 And, perhaps David, in warning us that we speak no guile, reflects upon
 his own sin in changing his behaviour. Those that truly repent of what 
 they have done amiss will warn others to take heed of doing 
 likewise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He enforces these directions by setting before us the happiness of 
 the godly in the love and favour of God and the miserable state of the 
 wicked under his displeasure. Here are life and death, good and evil, 
 the blessing and the curse, plainly stated before us, that we may 
 choose life and live. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:10,11">Isa. iii. 10, 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Woe to the wicked, it shall be ill with them,</I> however they 
 may bless themselves in their own way. 

 (1.) God is against them, and then they cannot but be miserable. Sad is 
 the case of that man who by his sin has made his Maker his enemy, his 
 destroyer. <I>The face of the Lord is against those that do evil,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Sometimes God is said to <I>turn his face from them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:17">Jer. xviii. 17</A>),
 
 because they have forsaken him; here he is said to <I>set his face
 against them,</I> because they have fought against him; and most 
 certainly God is able to out-face the most proud and daring sinners and 
 can frown them into hell.

 (2.) Ruin is before them; this will follow of course if God be against 
 them, for he is able both to kill and to cast into hell.

 [1.] The land of the living shall be no place for them nor theirs. When 
 God sets his face against them he will not only cut them off, but 
 <I>cut off the remembrance of them;</I> when they are alive he will 
 bury them in obscurity, when they are dead he will bury them in 
 oblivion. He will root out their posterity, by whom they would be 
 remembered. He will pour disgrace upon their achievements, which they 
 gloried in and for which they thought they should be remembered. It is 
 certain that there is no lasting honour but that which comes from God.

 [2.] There shall be a sting in their death: <I>Evil shall slay the 
 wicked,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Their death shall be miserable; and so it will certainly be, though 
 they die on a bed of down or on the bed of honour. Death, to them, has
 a curse in it, and is the king of terrors; to them it is evil, only 
 evil. It is very well observed by Dr. Hammond that the <I>evil</I> 
 here, which slays the wicked, is the same word, in the singular number, 
 that is used

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>)

 for the afflictions of the righteous, to intimate that godly people
 have many troubles, and yet they do them no hurt, but are made to work 
 for good to them, for God will deliver them out of them all; whereas 
 wicked people have fewer troubles, fewer evils befal them, perhaps but 
 one, and yet that one may prove their utter ruin. One trouble with a 
 curse in it kills and slays, and does execution; but many, with a 
 blessing in them, are harmless, nay, gainful.

 [3.] Desolation will be their everlasting portion. Those that are 
 wicked themselves often hate the righteous, name and thing, have an 
 implacable enmity to them and their righteousness; but they <I>shall be 
 desolate,</I> shall be condemned as guilty, and laid waste for ever, 
 shall be for ever forsaken and abandoned of God and all good angels and 
 men; and those that are so are desolate indeed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Yet <I>say to the righteous, It shall be well with them.</I> All 
 good people are under God's special favour and protection. We are here 
 assured of this under a great variety of instances and expressions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) God takes special notice of good people, and takes notice who have 
 their eyes ever to him and who make conscience of their duty to him: 
 <I>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 to direct and guide them, to protect and keep them. Parents that are
 very fond of a child will not let it be out of their sight; none of 
 God's children are ever from under his eye, but on them he looks with a 
 singular complacency, as well as with a watchful and tender 
 concern.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They are sure of an answer of peace to their prayers. All God's 
 people are a praying people, and they cry in prayer, which denotes 
 great importunity; but is it to any purpose? Yes, 

 [1.] God takes notice of what we say 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 They <I>cry, and the Lord hears them,</I> and hears them so as to make
 it appear he has a regard to them. <I>His ears are open to their 
 prayers,</I> to receive them all, and to receive them readily and with 
 delight. Though he has been a God hearing prayer ever since men began 
 to call upon the name of the Lord, yet his ear is not heavy. There is 
 no rhetoric, nothing charming, in a cry, yet God's ears are open to it, 
 as the tender mother's to the cry of her sucking child, which another 
 would take no notice of: <I>The righteous cry, and the Lord 
 heareth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 This intimates that it is the constant practice of good people, when 
 they are in distress, to cry unto God, and it is their constant comfort 
 that God hears them.

 [2.] He not only takes notice of what we say, but is ready for us to 
 our relief 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>He is nigh to those that are of a broken heart, and saves them.</I>
 Note, <I>First,</I> It is the character of the righteous, whose prayers 
 God will hear, that they are of a broken heart and a contrite spirit 
 (that is, humbled for sin and emptied of self); they are low in their 
 own eyes, and have no confidence in their own merit and sufficiency, 
 but in God only. <I>Secondly,</I> Those who are so have God nigh unto 
 them, to comfort and support them, that the spirit may not be broken 
 more than is meet, lest it should fail before him. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:15">Isa. lvii. 15</A>.
 
 Though God is high, and dwells on high, yet he is near to those who, 
 being of a contrite spirit, know how to value his favour, and will save 
 them from sinking under their burdens; he is near them to good 
 purpose.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) They are taken under the special protection of the divine 
 government 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>He keepeth all his bones;</I> not only his soul, but his body; not
 only his body in general, but every bone in it: <I>Not one of them is 
 broken.</I> He that has a broken heart shall not have a broken bone; 
 for David himself had found that, when he had a contrite heart, the 
 <I>broken bones</I> were <I>made to rejoice,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:8,17">Ps. li. 8, 17</A>.

 One would not expect to meet with any thing of Christ here, and yet
 this scripture is said to be fulfilled in him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:36">John xix. 36</A>)

 when the soldiers broke the legs of the two thieves that were crucified
 with him, but did not break his, they being under the protection of 
 this promise as well as of the type, even the paschal-lamb (<I>a bone 
 of him shall not be broken</I>); the promises, being made good to 
 Christ, through him are sure to all the seed. It does not follow but 
 that a good man may have a broken bone; but, by the watchful providence 
 of God concerning him, such a calamity is often wonderfully prevented, 
 and the preservation of his bones is the effect of this promise; and, 
 if he have a broken bone, sooner or later it shall be made whole, at 
 furthest at the resurrection, when that which is sown in weakness shall 
 be raised in power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) They are, and shall be, delivered out of their troubles. 

 [1.] It is supposed that they have their share of crosses in this 
 world, perhaps a greater share than others. In the world they must have 
 tribulation, that they may be conformed both to the will of God and to 
 the example of Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 <I>Many are the afflictions of the righteous,</I> witness David and his
 afflictions,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:1">Ps. cxxxii. 1</A>.

 There are those that hate them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)

 and they are continually aiming to do them a mischief; their God loves
 them, and therefore corrects them; so that, between the mercy of heaven 
 and the malice of hell, the afflictions of the righteous must needs be 
 many.

 [2.] God has engaged for their deliverance and salvation: <I>He 
 delivers them out of all their troubles</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:17,19"><I>v.</I> 17, 19</A>);
 
 he saves them
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 so that, though they may fall into trouble, it shall not be their ruin.
 This promise of their deliverance is explained, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 Whatever troubles befal them, <I>First,</I> They shall not hurt their 
 better part. <I>The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants</I> from
 the power of the grave

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:15">Ps. xlix. 15</A>)

 and from the sting of every affliction. He keeps them from sinning in
 their troubles, which is the only thing that would do them a mischief, 
 and keeps them from despair, and from being put out of the possession 
 of their own souls. <I>Secondly,</I> They shall not hinder their 
 everlasting bliss. <I>None of those that trust in him shall be 
 desolate;</I> that is, they shall not be comfortless, for they shall 
 not be cut off from their communion with God. No man is desolate but he 
 whom God has forsaken, nor is any man undone till he is in hell. Those 
 that are God's faithful servants, that make it their care to please him 
 and their business to honour him, and in doing so trust him to protect 
 and reward them, and, with good thoughts of him, refer themselves to 
 him, have reason to be easy whatever befals them, for they are safe and 
 shall be happy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:11-22">these verses</A>

 let us be confirmed in the choice we have made of the ways of God; let
 us be quickened in his service, and greatly encouraged by the 
 assurances he has given of the particular care he takes of all those 
 that faithfully adhere to him.</P>
