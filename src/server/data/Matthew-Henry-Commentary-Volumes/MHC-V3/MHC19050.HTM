 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm, as the former, is a psalm of instruction, not of prayer or
 praise; it is a psalm of reproof and admonition, in singing which we
 are to teach and admonish one another. In the foregoing psalm, after a
 general demand of attention, God by his prophet deals

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:3">ver. 3</A>)

 with the children of this world, to convince them of their sin and
 folly in setting their hearts upon the wealth of this world; in this
 psalm, after a like preface, he deals with those that were, in
 profession, the church's children, to convince them of their sin and
 folly in placing their religion in ritual services, while they
 neglected practical godliness; and this is as sure a way to ruin as the
 other. This psalm is intended,

 1. As a proof to the carnal Jews, both those that rested in the
 external performances of their religion, and were remiss in the more
 excellent duties of prayer and praise, and those that expounded the law
 to others, but lived wicked lives themselves. 

 2. As a prediction of the abolishing of the ceremonial law, and of the
 introducing of a spiritual way of worship in and by the kingdom of the
 Messiah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:23,24">John iv. 23, 24</A>.

 3. As a representation of the day of judgment, in which God will call
 men to an account concerning their observance of those things which
 they have thus been taught; men shall be judged "according to what is
 written in the books;" and therefore Christ is fitly represented
 speaking as a Judge, then when he speaks as a Lawgiver. Here is, 

 I. The glorious appearance of the Prince that gives law and judgment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. Instruction given to his worshippers, to turn their sacrifices into
 prayers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:7-15">ver. 7-15</A>.

 III. A rebuke to those that pretend to worship God, but live in 
 disobedience to his commands 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:16-20">ver. 16-20</A>),

 their doom read

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:21,22">ver. 21, 22</A>),

 and warning given to all to look to their conversation as well as to
 their devotions,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:23">ver. 23</A>.

 These instructions and admonitions we must take to ourselves, and give 
 to one another, in singing this psalm.</P>

 <P>A psalm of Asaph.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 The mighty God, <I>even</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, hath
 spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the
 going down thereof.
 &nbsp; 2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
 &nbsp; 3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall
 devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about
 him.
 &nbsp; 4 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth,
 that he may judge his people.
 &nbsp; 5 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a
 covenant with me by sacrifice.
 &nbsp; 6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God <I>is</I>
 judge himself. Selah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is probable that Asaph was not only the chief musician, who was to 
 put a tune to this psalm, but that he was himself the penman of it; for 
 we read that in Hezekiah's time they praised God <I>in the words of 
 David and of Asaph the seer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:30">2 Chron. xxix. 30</A>.
 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The court called, in the name of the King of kings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>The mighty God, even the Lord, hath spoken</I>--El, Elohim, Jehovah,
 the God of infinite power justice and mercy, Father, Son, and Holy 
 Ghost. God is the Judge, the Son of God came for judgement into the 
 world, and the Holy Ghost is the Spirit of judgment. All the earth is 
 called to attend, not only because the controversy God had with his 
 people Israel for their hypocrisy and ingratitude might safely be 
 referred to any man of reason (nay, let the house of Israel itself 
 <I>judge between God and his vineyard,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:3">Isa. v. 3</A>),

 but because all the children of men are concerned to know the right way 
 of worshipping God, in spirit and in truth, because when the kingdom of 
 the Messiah should be set up all should be instructed in the 
 evangelical worship, and invited to join in it (see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:11,Ac+10:34">Mal. i. 11, Acts x. 34</A>),

 and because in the day of final judgment all nations shall be gathered
 together to receive their doom, and every man shall give an account of 
 himself unto God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The judgment set, and the Judge taking his seat. As, when God gave 
 the law to Israel in the wilderness, it is said, <I>He came from Sinai, 
 and rose up from Seir, and shone forth from Mount Paran, and came with 
 ten thousands of his saints, and then from his right hand went a fiery 
 law</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:2">Deut. xxxiii. 2</A>),

 so, with allusion to that, when God comes to reprove them for their
 hypocrisy, and to send forth his gospel to supersede the legal
 institutions, it is said here, 

 1. That <I>he shall shine out of Zion,</I> as then from the top of
 Sinai, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Because in Zion his oracle was now fixed, thence his judgments upon 
 that provoking people denounced, and thence the orders issued for the 
 execution of them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:1">Joel ii. 1</A>):

 <I>Blow you the trumpet in Zion.</I> Sometimes there are more than
 ordinary appearances of God's presence and power working with and by 
 his word and ordinances, for the convincing of men's consciences and 
 the reforming and refining of his church; and then God, who always 
 dwells in Zion, may be said to <I>shine out of Zion.</I> Moreover, he 
 may be said to <I>shine out of Zion</I> because the gospel, which set 
 up spiritual worship, was to <I>go forth from Mount Zion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:3,Mic+4:2">Isa. ii. 3, Mic. iv. 2</A>),

 and the preachers of it were to <I>begin at Jerusalem</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:47">Luke xxiv. 47</A>),

 and Christians are said to come unto Mount Zion, to receive their
 instructions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22,28">Heb. xii. 22, 28</A>.

 Zion is here called <I>the perfection of beauty,</I> because it was the
 holy hill; and holiness is indeed the perfection of beauty. 

 2. That he <I>shall come, and not keep silence,</I> shall no longer 
 seem to wink at the sins of men, as he had done 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 but shall show his displeasure at them, and shall also cause that
 mystery to be published to the world by his holy apostles which had 
 long <I>lain hid, that the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:5,6">Eph. iii. 5, 6</A>)

 and that the partition-wall of the ceremonial law should be taken down; 
 this shall now no longer be concealed. In the great day <I>our God 
 shall come and shall not keep silence,</I> but shall make those to hear 
 his judgment that would not hearken to his law. 

 3. That his appearance should be very majestic and terrible: <I>A fire
 shall devour before him.</I> The fire of his judgments shall make way 
 for the rebukes of his word, in order to the awakening of the 
 hypocritical nation of the Jews, that the sinners in Zion, being afraid 
 of that devouring fire 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:14">Isa. xxxiii. 14</A>),

 might be startled out of their sins. When his gospel kingdom was to be
 set up Christ <I>came to send fire on the earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:49">Luke xii. 49</A>.

 The Spirit was given in cloven tongues as of fire, introduced by a
 rushing mighty wind, which was very tempestuous,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:2,3">Acts ii. 2, 3</A>.

 And in the last judgment Christ shall come in flaming fire,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:8">2 Thess. i. 8</A>.

 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:9,Heb+10:27">Dan. vii. 9; Heb. x. 27</A>.

 4. That as on Mount Sinai he came with <I>ten thousands of his
 saints,</I> so he shall now <I>call to the heavens from above,</I> to
 take notice of this solemn process 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 as Moses often <I>called heaven and earth to witness</I> against Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:26,31:28,32:21">Deut. iv. 26; xxxi. 28, xxxii. 1</A>),

 and God by his prophets,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:2,Mic+6:2">Isa. i. 2; Mic. vi. 2</A>.

 The equity of the judgment of the great day will be attested and
 applauded by heaven and earth, by saints and angels, even all the holy 
 myriads.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The parties summoned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Gather my saints together unto me.</I> This may be understood
 either,

 1. Of saints indeed: "Let them be gathered to God through Christ; let
 the few pious Israelites be set by themselves;" for to them the 
 following denunciations of wrath do not belong; rebukes to hypocrites 
 ought not to be terrors to the upright. When God will reject the
 services of those that only offered sacrifice, resting in the outside 
 of the performance, he will graciously accept those who, in 
 sacrificing, <I>make a covenant with him,</I> and so attend to and 
 answer the end of the institution of sacrifices. The design of the 
 preaching of the gospel, and the setting up of Christ's kingdom, was to 
 gather together in one the children of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:52">John xi. 52</A>.

 And at the second coming of Jesus Christ all his saints shall be 
 <I>gathered together unto him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:1">2 Thess. ii. 1</A>)

 to be assessors with him in the judgment; for <I>the saints shall judge
 the world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:2">1 Cor. vi. 2</A>.

 Now it is here given as a character of the saints that they have made a
 covenant with God by sacrifice. Note, 

 (1.) Those only shall be gathered to God as his saints who have, in 
 sincerity, covenanted with him, who have taken him to be their God and 
 given up themselves to him to be his people, and thus have joined 
 themselves unto the Lord. 

 (2.) It is only by sacrifice, by Christ the great sacrifice (from whom
 all the legal sacrifices derived what value they had), that we poor 
 sinners can covenant with God so as to be accepted of him. There must 
 be an atonement made for the breach of the first covenant before we can 
 be admitted again into covenant. Or, 

 2. It may be understood of saints in profession, such as the people of 
 Israel were, who are called <I>a kingdom of priests</I> and <I>a holy 
 nation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:6">Exod. xix. 6</A>.

 They were, as a body politic, taken into covenant with God, the
 covenant of peculiarity; and it was done with great solemnity, <I>by 
 sacrifice,</I>

 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+24:8">Exod. xxiv. 8</A>.

 "Let them come and hear what God has to say to them; let them receive
 the reproofs God sends them now by his prophets, and the gospel he 
 will, in due time, send them by his Son, which shall supersede the 
 ceremonial law. If these be slighted, let them expect to hear from God 
 another way, and to be judged by that word which they will not be ruled 
 by."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The issue of this solemn trial foretold 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The heavens shall declare his righteousness,</I> those heavens that
 were called to be witnesses to the trial

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 the <I>people in heaven shall say, Hallelujah. True and righteous are
 his judgments,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:1,2">Rev. xix. 1, 2</A>.

 The righteousness of God in all the rebukes of his word and providence, 
 in the establishment of his gospel (which <I>brings in an everlasting 
 righteousness,</I> and in which <I>the righteousness of God is 
 revealed</I>), and especially in the judgment of the great day, is what 
 the heavens will declare; that is, 

 1. It will be universally known, and proclaimed to all the world. <I>As
 the heavens declare the glory,</I> the wisdom and power, of God the 
 Creator

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:1">Ps. xix. 1</A>),

 so they shall no less openly declare the glory, the justice and
 righteousness, of God the <I>Judge;</I> and so loudly do they proclaim 
 both that <I>there is no speech nor language where their voice is not 
 heard,</I> as it follows there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 2. It will be incontestably owned and proved; who can deny what the 
 heavens declare? Even sinners' own consciences will subscribe to it, 
 and hell as well as heaven will be forced to acknowledge the 
 righteousness of God. The reason given is, <I>for God is Judge 
 himself,</I> and therefore,

 (1.) He will be just; for it is impossible he should do any wrong to 
 any of his creatures, he never did, nor ever will. When men are 
 employed to judge for him they may do unjustly; but, when he is Judge 
 himself, there can be no injustice done. <I>Is God unrighteous, who
 takes vengeance?</I> The apostle, for this reason, startles at the 
 thought of it; <I>God forbid! for then how shall God judge the
 world?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:5,6">Rom. iii. 5, 6</A>.

 These decisions will be perfectly just, for against them there will lie 
 no exception, and from them there will lie no appeal.

 (2.) He will be justified; <I>God is Judge,</I> and therefore he will 
 not only execute justice, but he will oblige all to own it; for he 
 <I>will be clear when he judges,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:4">Ps. li. 4</A>.</P>

 &nbsp; 8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt
 offerings, <I>to have been</I> continually before me.
 &nbsp; 9 I will take no bullock out of thy house, <I>nor</I> he goats out
 of thy folds.
 &nbsp; 10 For every beast of the forest <I>is</I> mine, <I>and</I> the cattle
 upon a thousand hills.
 &nbsp; 11 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts

 &nbsp; 13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

 High:
 &nbsp; 15 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee,
 and thou shalt glorify me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God is here dealing with those that placed all their religion in the 
 observances of the ceremonial law, and thought those sufficient.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He lays down the original contract between him and Israel, in which 
 they had avouched him to be their God, and he them to be his people, 
 and so both parties were agreed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Hear, O my people! and I will speak.</I> Note, It is justly expected
 that whatever others do, when he speaks, his people should give ear;
 who will, if they do not? And then we may comfortably expect that God
 will speak to us when we are ready to hear what he says; even when he 
 testifies against us in the rebukes and threatenings of his word and 
 providences we must be forward to hear what he says, to hear even 
 <I>the rod and him that has appointed it.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He puts a slight upon the legal sacrifices, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:8-13"><I>v.</I> 8</A>,

 &c. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This may be considered as looking back to the use of these under the 
 law. God had a controversy with the Jews; but what was the ground of 
 the controversy? Not their neglect of the ceremonial institutions; no, 
 they had not been wanting in the observance of them, their 
 burnt-offerings had been continually before God, they took a pride in 
 them, and hoped by their offerings to procure a dispensation for their 
 lusts, as the adulterous woman, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:14">Prov. vii. 14</A>.

 Their constant sacrifices, they thought, would both expiate and excuse
 their neglect of the weightier matters of the law. Nay, if they had, in 
 some degree, neglected these institutions, yet that should not have 
 been the cause of God's quarrel with them, for it was but a small 
 offence in comparison with the immoralities of their conversation. They 
 thought God was mightily beholden to them for the many sacrifices they 
 had brought to his altar, and that they had made him very much their 
 debtor by them, as if he could not have maintained his numerous
 family of priests without their contributions; but God here shows them 
 the contrary,

 (1.) That he did not need their sacrifices. What occasion had he for 
 their bullocks and goats who has the command of all <I>the beasts of 
 the forest,</I> and the <I>cattle upon a thousand hills</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>),
 
 has an incontestable propriety in them and dominion over them, has them
 all always under his eye and within his reach, and can make what use he 
 pleases of them; they all wait on him, and are all at his disposal?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:27-29">Ps. civ. 27-29</A>.

 Can we add any thing to his store whose all the wild fowl and wild 
 beasts are, the world itself and the fulness thereof?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 God's infinite self-sufficiency proves our utter insufficiency to add
 any thing to him. 

 (2.) That he could not be benefited by their sacrifices. Their 
 goodness, of this kind, could not possibly extend to him, nor, if they 
 were in this matter righteous, was he the better 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Will I eat the flesh of bulls?</I> It is as absurd to think that
 their sacrifices could, of themselves, and by virtue of any innate 
 excellency in them, add any pleasure of praise to God, as it would be 
 to imagine that an infinite Spirit could be supported by meat and 
 drink, as our bodies are. It is said indeed of the demons whom the 
 Gentiles worshipped that they did <I>eat the fat of their sacrifices, 
 and drink the wine of their drink-offerings</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:38">Deut. xxxii. 38</A>):

 they regaled themselves in the homage they robbed the true God of; but
 will the great Jehovah be thus entertained? No; <I>to obey is better 
 than sacrifice,</I> and to love God and our neighbour <I>better than 
 all burnt-offerings,</I> so much better that God by his prophets often 
 told them that their sacrifices were not only not acceptable, but 
 abominable, to him, while they lived in sin; instead of pleasing him, 
 he looked upon them as a mockery, and therefore an affront and 
 provocation to him; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:8,Isa+1:11-23,66:3,Jer+6:20,Am+5:21">Prov. xv. 8;
 Isa. i. 11, &c.; lxvi. 3; Jer. vi. 20; Amos v. 21</A>.

 They are therefore here warned not to rest in these performances; but
 to conduct themselves, in all other instances, towards God as their 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This may be considered as looking forward to the abolishing of these 
 by the gospel of Christ. Thus Dr. Hammond understands it. When God 
 shall set up the kingdom of the Messiah he shall abolish the old way of 
 worship by sacrifice and offerings; he will no more have those to be 
 <I>continually before him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 he will no more require of his worshippers to bring him their bullocks
 and their goats, to be burnt upon his altar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 For indeed he never appointed this as that which he had any need of, or 
 took any pleasure in, for, besides that all we have is his already, he 
 has far more beasts in the forest and upon the mountains, which we know 
 nothing of nor have any property in, than we have in our folds; but he 
 instituted it to prefigure the great sacrifice which his own Son should 
 in the fulness of time offer upon the cross, to make atonement for sin, 
 and all the other spiritual sacrifices of acknowledgment with which 
 God, through Christ, will be well pleased.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He directs to the best sacrifices of prayer and praise as those 
 which, under the law, were preferred before all burnt-offerings and
 sacrifices, and on which then the greatest stress was laid, and which 
 now, under the gospel, come in the room of those carnal ordinances 
 which were imposed until the times of reformation. He shows us here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>)

 what is good, and what the Lord our God requires of us, and will
 accept, when sacrifices are slighted and superseded.

 1. We must make a penitent acknowledgment of our sins: <I>Offer to God
 confession,</I> so some read it, and understand it of the confession of 
 sin, in order to our giving glory to God and taking shame to ourselves, 
 that we may never return to it. <I>A broken and contrite heart</I> is 
 the sacrifice which <I>God will not despise,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:17">Ps. li. 17</A>.

 If the sin was not abandoned the sin-offering was not accepted. 

 2. We must give God thanks for his mercies to us: <I>Offer to God 
 thanksgiving,</I> every day, often every day (<I>seven times a day will 
 I praise thee</I>), and upon special occasions; and <I>this shall 
 please the Lord,</I> if it come from a humble thankful heart, full of 
 love to him and joy in him, <I>better than an ox or bullock that has 
 horns and hoofs,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:30,31">Ps. lxix. 30, 31</A>.

 3. We must make conscience of performing our covenants with him: <I>Pay
 thy vows to the Most High,</I> forsake thy sins, and do thy duty 
 better, pursuant to the solemn promises thou has made him to that 
 purport. When we give God thanks for any mercy we have received we must 
 be sure to pay the vows we made to him when we were in the pursuit of 
 the mercy, else our thanksgivings will not be accepted. Dr. Hammond
 applies this to the great gospel ordinance of the eucharist, in which 
 we are to give thanks to God for his great love in sending his Son to 
 save us, and to pay our vows of love and duty to him, and to give alms. 
 Instead of all the Old Testament types of a Christ to come, we have 
 that blessed memorial of a Christ already come.

 4. In the day of distress we must address ourselves to God by faithful 
 and fervent prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Call upon me in the day of trouble,</I> and not upon any other god.
 Our troubles, though we see them coming from God's hand, must drive us 
 to him, and not drive us from him. We must thus acknowledge him in all 
 our ways, depend upon his wisdom, power, and goodness, and refer 
 ourselves entirely to him, and so give him glory. This is a cheaper,
 easier, readier way of seeking his favour than by a peace-offering, and 
 yet more acceptable.

 5. When he, in answer to our prayers, delivers us, as he has promised
 to do in such way and time as he shall think fit, we must glorify him, 
 not only by a grateful mention of his favour, but by living to his 
 praise. Thus must we keep up our communion with God, meeting him with 
 our prayers when he afflicts us and with our praises when he delivers 
 us.</P>

 God, by the psalmist, having instructed his people in the right way of 
 worshipping him and keeping up their communion with him, here directs 
 his speech to the wicked, to hypocrites, whether they were such as 
 professed the Jewish or the Christian religion: hypocrisy is wickedness 
 for which God will judge. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The charge drawn up against them. 

 1. They are charged with invading and usurping the honours and
 privileges of religion 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>What has thou to do,</I> O wicked man! <I>to declare my
 statutes?</I> This is a challenge to those that are really profane,
 but seemingly godly, to show what title they have to the cloak of 
 religion, and by what authority they wear it, when they use it only to 
 cover and conceal the abominable impieties of their hearts and lives. 
 Let them make out their claim to it if they can. Some think it points 
 prophetically at the scribes and Pharisees that were the teachers and 
 leaders of the Jewish church at the time when the kingdom of the 
 Messiah, and that evangelical way of worship spoken of in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:7-15">foregoing verses</A>,

 were to be set up. They violently opposed that great revolution, and
 used all the power and interest which they had by sitting in Moses's
 seat to hinder it; but the account which our blessed Saviour gives of
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:1-36">Matt. xxiii</A>.),

 and St. Paul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:21,22">Rom. ii. 21, 22</A>),

 makes this expostulation here agree very well to them. They took on
 them to declare God's statues, but they hated Christ's instruction; and 
 therefore what had they to do to expound the law, when they rejected 
 the gospel? But it is applicable to all those that are practicers of 
 iniquity, and yet professors of piety, especially if withal they be 
 preachers of it. Note, It is very absurd in itself, and a great
 affront to the God of heaven, for those that are wicked and ungodly to 
 declare his statutes and to take his covenant in their mouths. It is 
 very possible, and too common, for those that declare God's statutes to 
 others to live in disobedience to them themselves, and for those that 
 take God's covenant in their mouths yet in their hearts to continue 
 their covenant with sin and death; but they are guilty of a usurpation, 
 they take to themselves an honour which they have no title to, and 
 there is a day coming when they will be thrust out as intruders. 
 <I>Friend, how camest thou in hither?</I> 

 2. They are charged with transgressing and violating the laws and
 precepts of religion.

 (1.) They are charged with a daring contempt of the word of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>Thou hatest instruction.</I> They loved to give instruction, and to
 tell others what they should do, for this fed their pride and made them 
 look great, and by this craft they got their living; but they hated to 
 receive instruction from God himself, for that would be a check upon 
 them and a mortification to them. "Thou hatest discipline, the reproofs 
 of the word and the rebukes of Providence." No wonder that those who 
 hate to be reformed hate the means of reformation. <I>Thou castest my 
 words behind thee.</I> They seemed to set God's words before them, when 
 they sat in Moses's seat, and undertook to teach others out of the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:19">Rom. ii. 19</A>);

 but in their conversations they cast God's word behind them, and did
 not care for seeing that rule which they were resolved not to be ruled 
 by. This is despising the commandment of the Lord.

 (2.) A close confederacy with the worst of sinners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>When thou sawest a thief,</I> instead of reproving him and
 witnessing against him, as those should do that declare God's statutes, 
 <I>thou consentedst with him,</I> didst approve of his practices, and 
 desire to be a partner with him and to share in the profits of his 
 cursed trade; <I>and thou hast been partaker with adulterers,</I> hast 
 done as they did, and encouraged them to go on in their wicked courses, 
 hast done these things and hast <I>had pleasure in those that do 
 them,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:32">Rom. i. 32</A>.

 (3.) A constant persisting in the worst of tongue-sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):
 
 "<I>Thou givest thy mouth to evil,</I> not only allowest thyself in,
 but addictest thyself wholly to, all manner of evil-speaking."

 [1.] Lying: <I>Thy tongue frames deceit,</I> which denotes contrivance 
 and deliberation in lying. It <I>knits</I> or <I>links</I> deceit, so 
 some. One lie begets another, and one fraud requires another to cover
 it.

 [2.] Slandering 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>Thou sittest, and speakest against thy brother,</I> dost basely
 abuse and misrepresent him, magisterially judge and censure him, and 
 pass sentence upon him, as if you wert his master to whom he must stand 
 or fall, whereas he is thy brother, as good as thou art, and upon the 
 level with thee, for he is <I>thy own mother's son.</I> He is thy near 
 relation, whom thou oughtest to love, to vindicate, and stand up for, 
 if others abused him; yet thou dost thyself abuse him, whose faults 
 thou oughtest to cover and make the best of; if really he had done 
 amiss, yet thou dost most falsely and unjustly charge him with that 
 which he is innocent of; <I>thou sittest</I> and doest this, as a judge 
 upon the bench, with authority; thou sittest in the seat of the 
 scornful, to deride and backbite those whom thou oughtest to respect 
 and be kind to." Those that do ill themselves commonly delight in 
 speaking ill of others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The proof of this charge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "<I>These things thou hast done;</I> the fact is too plain to be
 denied, the fault too bad to be excused; these things God knows, and 
 thy own heart knows, thou hast done." The sins of sinners will be 
 proved upon them, beyond contradiction, in the judgment of the great 
 day: "<I>I will reprove thee,</I> or convince thee, so that thou shalt 
 have not one word to say for thyself." The day is coming when 
 impenitent sinners will have their mouths for ever stopped and be 
 struck speechless. What confusion will they be filled with when God 
 shall set their sins in order before their eyes! They would not see 
 their sins to their humiliation, but cast them behind their backs, 
 covered them, and endeavoured to forget them, nor would they suffer 
 their own consciences to put them in mind of them; but the day is 
 coming when God will make them see their sins to their everlasting 
 shame and terror; he will set them in order, original sin, actual sins, 
 sins against the law, sins against the gospel, against the first table, 
 against the second table, sins of childhood and youth, of riper age, 
 and old age. He will set them in order, as the witnesses are set in 
 order, and called in order, against the criminal, and asked what they 
 have to say against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The Judge's patience, and the sinner's abuse of that patience: 
 "<I>I kept silence,</I> did not give thee any disturbance in thy sinful 
 way, but let thee alone to take thy course; sentence against thy evil 
 works was respited, and not executed speedily." Note, The patience of 
 God is very great towards provoking sinners. He sees their sins and 
 hates them; it would be neither difficulty nor damage to him to punish 
 them, and yet he waits to be gracious and gives them space to repent, 
 that he may render them inexcusable if they repent not. His patience is 
 the more wonderful because the sinner makes such an ill use of it: 
 "<I>Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself,</I> as 
 weak and forgetful as thyself, as false to my word as thyself, nay, as 
 much a friend to sin as thyself." Sinners take God's silence for 
 consent and his patience for connivance; and therefore the longer they 
 are reprieved the more are their hearts hardened; but, if they turn 
 not, they shall be made to see their error when it is too late, and 
 that the God they provoke is just, and holy, and terrible, and not such 
 a one as themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The fair warning given of the dreadful doom of hypocrites 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):
 
 "<I>Now consider this, you that forget God,</I> consider that God knows
 and keeps account of all your sins, that he will call you to an account 
 for them, that patience abused will turn into the greater wrath, that 
 though you forget God and your duty to him he will not forget you and 
 your rebellions against him: consider this in time, before it be too 
 late; for if these things be not considered, and the consideration of 
 them improved, he will <I>tear you in pieces, and there will be none to 
 deliver.</I>" It is the doom of hypocrites to be <I>cut asunder,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:51">Matt. xxiv. 51</A>.
 
 Note, 

 1. Forgetfulness of God is at the bottom of all the wickedness of the
 wicked. Those that know God, and yet do not obey him, do certainly
 forget him. 

 2. Those that forget God forget themselves; and it will never be right
 with them till they consider, and so recover themselves. Consideration
 is the first step towards conversion. 

 3. Those that will not consider the warnings of God's word will
 certainly be torn in pieces by the executions of his wrath. 

 4. When God comes to tear sinners in pieces, there is no delivering
 them out of his hand. They cannot deliver themselves, nor can any
 friend they have in the world deliver them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Full instructions given to us all how to prevent this fearful doom. 
 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter; we have it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>,

 which directs us what to do that we may attain our chief end. 

 1. Man's chief end is to glorify God, and we are here told that
 <I>whoso offers praise glorifies him;</I> whether he be Jew or Gentile, 
 those spiritual sacrifices shall be accepted from him. We must praise 
 God, and we must sacrifice praise, direct it to God, as every sacrifice 
 was directed; put it into the hands of the priest, our Lord Jesus, who 
 is also the altar; see that it be made by fire, sacred fire, that it be 
 kindled with the flame of holy and devout affection; we must be fervent 
 in spirit, praising the Lord. This he is pleased, in infinite 
 condescension, to interpret as glorifying him. Hereby we give him the 
 glory due to his name and do what we can to advance the interests of 
 his kingdom among men. 

 2. Man's chief end, in conjunction with this, is to enjoy God; and we 
 are here told that those who <I>order their conversation aright shall 
 see his salvation.</I>

 (1.) It is not enough for us to offer praise, but we must withal order 
 our conversation aright. Thanksgiving is good, but thanks-living is 
 better. 

 (2.) Those that would have their conversation right must take care and 
 pains to order it, to dispose it according to rule, to understand their 
 way and to direct it. 

 (3.) Those that take care of their conversation make sure their 
 salvation; them God will make to see his salvation, for it is a 
 salvation ready to be revealed; he will make them to see it and enjoy 
 it, to see it, and to see themselves happy for ever in it. Note, The 
 right ordering of the conversation is the only way, and it is a sure 
 way, to obtain the great salvation.</P>
