 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm has something of David in it, but much more of Christ. It
 begins with such expressions of devotion as may be applied to Christ;
 but concludes with such confidence of a resurrection (and so timely a
 one as to prevent corruption) as must be applied to Christ, to him
 only, and cannot be understood of David, as both St. Peter and St. Paul
 have observed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:24,13:36">Acts ii. 24; xiii. 36</A>.

 For David died, and was buried, and saw corruption.

 I. David speaks of himself as a member of Christ, and so he speaks the
 language of all good Christians, professing his confidence in God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:1">
 ver. 1</A>),

 his consent to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:2">
 ver. 2</A>),

 his affection to the people of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:3">
 ver. 3</A>),

 his adherence to the true worship of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:4">
 ver. 4</A>),

 and his entire complacency and satisfaction in God and the interest he
 had in him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 II. He speaks of himself as a type of Christ, and so he speaks the
 language of Christ himself, to whom all the rest of the psalm is
 expressly and at large applied

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:25-28">Acts ii. 25</A>,

 &c.). David speaks concerning him (not concerning himself), "I foresaw
 the Lord always before my face," &c. And this he spoke, being a prophet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:30,31">ver. 30, 31</A>.

 He spoke,

 1. Of the special presence of God with the Redeemer in his services and
 sufferings,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:8">ver. 8</A>.

 2. Of the prospect which the Redeemer had of his own resurrection and
 the glory that should follow, which carried him cheerfully through his
 undertaking,

 <P>Michtam of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I
 put my trust.
 &nbsp; 2  <I>O my soul,</I> thou hast said unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, Thou <I>art</I> my
 Lord: my goodness <I>extendeth</I> not to thee;
 &nbsp; 3  <I>But</I> to the saints that <I>are</I> in the earth, and <I>to</I> the
 excellent, in whom <I>is</I> all my delight.
 &nbsp; 4  Their sorrows shall be multiplied <I>that</I> hasten <I>after</I>
 another <I>god:</I> their drink offerings of blood will I not offer,
 nor take up their names into my lips.
 &nbsp; 5  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:
 thou maintainest my lot.
 &nbsp; 6  The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant <I>places;</I> yea, I
 have a goodly heritage.
 &nbsp; 7  I will bless the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, who hath given me counsel: my reins
 also instruct me in the night seasons.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is entitled <I>Michtam,</I> which some translate <I>a
 golden</I> psalm, a very precious one, more to be valued by us than 
 gold, yea, than much fine gold, because it speaks so plainly of Christ 
 and his resurrection, who is the true treasure hidden in the field of 
 the Old Testament.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David here flies to God's protection with a cheerful believing 
 confidence in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>Preserve me, O God!</I> from the deaths, and especially from the 
 sins, to which I am continually exposed; <I>for in thee,</I> and in 
 thee only, <I>do I put my trust.</I>" Those that by faith commit 
 themselves to the divine care, and submit themselves to the divine 
 guidance, have reason to hope for the benefit of both. This is 
 applicable to Christ, who prayed, <I>Father, save me from this 
 hour,</I> and trusted in God that he would deliver him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He recognizes his solemn dedication of himself to God as his God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>O my soul! thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord,</I> and 
 therefore thou mayest venture to trust him." Note,

 1. It is the duty and interest of every one of us to acknowledge the
 Lord for our Lord, to subject ourselves to him, and then to stay 
 ourselves upon him. <I>Adonai</I> signifies <I>My stayer,</I> the 
 strength of my heart. 

 2. This must be done with our souls: "O my soul! thou hast said it."
 Covenanting with God must be heart-work; all that is within us must be 
 employed therein and engaged thereby. 

 3. Those who have avouched the Lord for their Lord should be often
 putting themselves in mind of what they have done. "Hast thou said unto 
 the Lord, <I>Thou art my Lord?</I> Say it again then, stand to it, 
 abide by it, and never unsay it. Hast thou said it? Take the comfort of 
 it, and live up to it. He is thy Lord, and worship thou him, and let
 thy eye be ever towards him."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He devotes himself to the honour of God in the service of the 
 saints 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>):

 <I>My goodness extends not to thee, but to the saints.</I> Observe,

 1. Those that have taken the lord for their Lord must, like him, be
 good and do good; we do not expect happiness without goodness. 

 2. Whatever good there is in us, or is done by us, we must humbly
 acknowledge that it extends not to God; so that we cannot pretend to 
 merit any thing by it. God has no need of our services; he is not 
 benefited by them, nor can they add any thing to his infinite 
 perfection and blessedness. The wisest, and best, and most useful, men 
 in the world cannot be profitable to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:2,35:7">Job xxii. 2; xxxv. 7</A>.

 God is infinitely above us, and happy without us, and whatever good we
 do it is all from him; so that we are indebted to him, not he to us: 
 David owns it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+29:14">1 Chron. xxix. 14</A>),

 <I>Of thy own have we given thee.</I> 

 3. If God be ours, we must, for his sake, extend our goodness to those
 that are his, to the saints in the earth; for what is done to them he 
 is pleased to take as done to himself, having constituted them his 
 receivers. Note,

 (1.) There are saints in the earth; and saints on earth we must all be, 
 or we shall never be saints in heaven. Those that are renewed by the 
 grace of God, and devoted to the glory of God, are saints on earth. 
 
 (2.) The saints in the earth are excellent ones, great, mighty, 
 magnificent ones, and yet some of them so poor in the world that they 
 need to have David's goodness extended to them. God makes them 
 excellent by the grace he gives them. <I>The righteous is more 
 excellent than his neighbour,</I> and then he accounts them excellent.
 They are precious in his sight and honourable; they are his jewels, his 
 peculiar treasure. Their God is their glory, and a diadem of beauty to 
 them. 

 (3.) All that have taken the Lord for their God delight in his saints 
 as excellent ones, because they bear his image, and because he loves 
 them. David, though a king, was a <I>companion of all that feared 
 God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:63">Ps. cxix. 63</A>),

 even the meanest, which was a sign that his delight was in them. 

 (4.) It is not enough for us to delight in the saints, but, as there is 
 occasion, our goodness must extend to them; we must be ready to show 
 them the kindness they need, distribute to their necessities, and 
 abound in the labour of love to them. This is applicable to Christ. The 
 salvation he wrought out for us was no gain to God, for our ruin would 
 have been no loss to him; but the goodness and benefit of it extend to 
 us men, in whom he delighteth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:31">Prov. viii. 31</A>.

 <I>For their sakes,</I> says he, <I>I sanctify myself,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:19">John xvii. 19</A>.

 Christ delights even in the saints on earth, notwithstanding their
 weaknesses and manifold infirmities, which is a good reason why we 
 should.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He disclaims the worship of all false gods and all communion with 
 their worshippers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 Here,

 1. He reads the doom of idolaters, who hasten after another God, being
 mad upon their idols, and pursuing them as eagerly as if they were 
 afraid they would escape from them: <I>Their sorrows shall be 
 multiplied,</I> both by the judgments they bring upon themselves from 
 the true God whom they forsake and by the disappointment they will meet 
 with in the false gods they embrace. Those that multiply gods multiply
 griefs to themselves; for, whoever thinks one God too little, will find 
 two too many, and yet hundreds not enough. 

 2. He declares his resolution to have no fellowship with them nor with 
 their unfruitful works of darkness: "<I>Their drink-offerings of blood 
 will I not offer,</I> not only because the gods they are offered to are 
 a lie, but because the offerings themselves are barbarous." At God's 
 altar, because the blood made atonement, the drinking of it was most 
 strictly prohibited, and the drink-offerings were of wine; but the 
 devil prescribed to his worshippers to drink of the blood of the 
 sacrifices, to teach them cruelty. "I will have nothing to do" (says 
 David) "with those bloody deities, nor so much as take their names into 
 my lips with any delight in them or respect to them." Thus must we hate 
 idols and idolatry with a perfect hatred. Some make this also 
 applicable to Christ and his undertaking, showing the nature of the 
 sacrifice he offered (it was not the blood of bulls and goats, which 
 was offered according to the law; that was never named, nor did he ever 
 make any mention of it, but his own blood), showing also the multiplied 
 sorrows of the unbelieving Jews, who hastened after another king, 
 C&aelig;sar, and are still hastening after another Messiah, whom they 
 in vain look for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He repeats the solemn choice he had made of God for his portion and 
 happiness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 takes to himself the comfort of the choice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 and gives God the glory of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 This is very much the language of a devout and pious soul in its
 gracious exercises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Choosing the Lord for its portion and happiness. "Most men take the 
 world for their chief good, and place their felicity in the enjoyments 
 of it; but this I say, <I>The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and 
 of my cup,</I> the portion I make choice of, and will gladly take up 
 with, how poor soever my condition is in this world. Let me have the 
 love and favour of God, and be accepted of him; let me have the comfort 
 of communion with God, and satisfaction in the communications of his 
 graces and comforts; let me have an interest in his promises, and a 
 title by promise to everlasting life and happiness in the future state; 
 and I have enough, I need no more, I desire no more, to complete my 
 felicity." Would we do well and wisely for ourselves, we must take God, 
 in Christ, to be, 

 (1.) The portion of our inheritance in the other world. Heaven is an 
 inheritance. God himself is the inheritance of the saints there, whose 
 everlasting bliss is to enjoy him. We must take that for our 
 inheritance, our home, our rest, our lasting, everlasting, good, and 
 look upon this world to be no more ours than the country through which 
 our road lies when we are on a journey. 

 (2.) The portion of our cup in this world, with which we are nourished, 
 and refreshed, and kept from fainting. Those have not God for theirs 
 who do not reckon his comforts the most reviving cordials, acquaint 
 themselves with them, and make use of them as sufficient to 
 counterbalance all the grievances of this present time and to sweeten 
 the most bitter cup of affliction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Confiding in him for the securing of this portion: "<I>Thou 
 maintainest my lot.</I> Thou that hast by promise made over thy self to 
 me, to be mine, wilt graciously make good what thou hast promised, and 
 never leave me to myself to forfeit this happiness, nor leave it in the 
 power of my enemies to rob me of it. Nothing shall pluck me out of thy 
 hands, nor separate me from thy love, and the sure mercies of David." 
 The saints and their bliss are kept by the power of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Rejoicing in this portion, and taking a complacency in it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 <I>The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places.</I> Those have 
 reason to say so that have God for their portion; they have a worthy 
 portion, a goodly heritage. What can they have better? What can they 
 desire more? <I>Return unto thy rest, O my soul!</I> and look no 
 further. Note, Gracious persons, though they still covet more of God, 
 never covet more than God; but, being satisfied of his loving-kindness, 
 they are abundantly satisfied with it, and envy not any their carnal 
 mirth and sensual pleasures and delights, but account themselves truly 
 happy in what they have, and doubt not but to be completely happy in 
 what they hope for. Those whose lot is cast, as David's was, in a land 
 of light, in a valley of vision, where God is known and worshipped, 
 have, upon that account, reason to say, <I>The lines have fallen to me 
 in pleasant places;</I> much more those who have not only the means, 
 but the end, not only Immanuel's land, but Immanuel's love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Giving thanks to God for it, and for grace to make this wise and 
 happy choice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>I will bless the Lord who has given me counsel,</I> this counsel, 
 to take him for my portion and happiness." So ignorant and foolish are 
 we that, if we be left to ourselves, our hearts will follow our eyes, 
 and we shall choose our own delusions, and forsake our own mercies for 
 lying vanities; and therefore, if we have indeed taken God for our 
 portion and preferred spiritual and eternal blessings before those that 
 are sensible and temporal, we must thankfully acknowledge the power and 
 goodness of divine grace directing and enabling us to make that choice. 
 If we have the pleasure of it, let God have the praise of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Making a good use of it. God having given him counsel by his word 
 and Spirit, his own <I>reins</I> also (his own thoughts) instructed him 
 in the night-season; when he was silent and solitary, and retired from 
 the world, then his own conscience (which is called the <I>reins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:10">Jer. xvii. 10</A>)

 not only reflected with comfort upon the choice he had made, but
 instructed or admonished him concerning the duties arising out of this 
 choice, catechized him, and engaged and quickened him to live as one 
 that had God for his portion, by faith to live upon him and to live to 
 him. Those who have God for their portion, and who will be faithful to 
 him, must give their own consciences leave to deal thus faithfully and 
 plainly with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All this may be applied to Christ, who made the Lord his portion and 
 was pleased with that portion, made his Father's glory his highest end 
 and made it his meat and drink to seek that and to do his will, and 
 delighted to prosecute his undertaking, pursuant to his Father's 
 counsel, depending upon him to maintain his lot and to carry him 
 through his undertaking. We may also apply it to ourselves in singing 
 it, renewing our choice of God as ours, with a holy complacency and 
 satisfaction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 All these verses are quoted by St. Peter in his first sermon, after the
 pouring out of the Spirit on the day of pentecost 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:25-28">Acts ii. 25-28</A>);

 and he tells us expressly that David in them speaks concerning Christ
 and particularly of his resurrection. Something we may allow here of
 the workings of David's own pious and devout affections towards God, 
 depending upon his grace to perfect every thing that concerned him, and 
 looking for the blessed hope, and happy state on the other side death, 
 in the enjoyment of God; but in these holy elevations towards God and 
 heaven he was carried by the spirit of prophecy quite beyond the 
 consideration of himself and his own case, to foretel the glory of the 
 Messiah, in such expressions as were peculiar to that, and could not be 
 understood of himself. The New Testament furnishes us with a key to let 
 us into the mystery of these lines.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. These verses must certainly be applied to Christ; of him speaks the 
 prophet this, as did many of the Old-Testament prophets, who 
 <I>testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that 
 should follow</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:11">1 Pet. i. 11</A>),

 and that is the subject of this prophecy here. It is foretold (as he
 himself showed concerning this, no doubt, among other prophecies in 
 this psalm,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:44,46">Luke xxiv. 44, 46</A>)

 that <I>Christ should suffer, and rise from the dead,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+15:3,4">
 1 Cor. xv. 3, 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he should suffer and die. This is implied here when he says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 <I>I shall not be moved;</I> he supposed that he should be struck at, 
 and have a dreadful shock given him, as he had in his agony, when his 
 soul was exceedingly sorrowful, and he prayed that the cup might pass 
 from him. When he says, "<I>My flesh shall rest,</I>" it is implied 
 that he must put off the body, and therefore must go through the pains 
 of death. It is likewise plainly intimated that his soul must go into a 
 state of separation from the body, and that his body, so deserted, 
 would be in imminent danger of seeing corruption--that he should not 
 only die, but be buried, and abide for some time under the power of 
 death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he should be wonderfully borne up by the divine power in 
 suffering and dying. 

 (1.) That he should not be moved, should not be driven off from his 
 undertaking nor sink under the weight of it, that he should not fail 
 nor be discouraged

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:4">Isa. xlii. 4</A>),

 but should proceed and persevere in it, till he could say, <I>It is
 finished.</I> Though the service was hard and the encounter hot, and he 
 trod the winepress alone, yet he was not moved, did not give up the 
 cause, but set his face as a flint,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7-9">Isa. l. 7-9</A>.

 <I>Here am I, let these go their way.</I> Nay, 

 (2.) That his heart should rejoice and his glory be glad, that he 
 should go on with his undertaking, not only resolutely, but cheerfully, 
 and with unspeakable pleasure and satisfaction, witness that saying

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:11">John xvii. 11</A>),

 <I>Now I am no more in the world, but I come to thee,</I> and that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:11">John xviii. 11</A>),

 <I>The cup that my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?</I> and
 many the like. By his glory is meant his <I>tongue,</I> as appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:26">Acts ii. 26</A>.

 For our tongue is our glory, and never more so than when it is employed
 in glorifying God. Now there were three things which bore him up and 
 carried him on thus cheerfully:--

 [1.] The respect he had to his Father's will and glory in what he did: 
 <I>I have set the Lord always before me.</I> He still had an eye to his 
 Father's commandment

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:18,14:31">John x. 18, xiv. 31</A>),

 the will of him that sent him. He aimed at his Father's honour and the
 restoring of the interests of his kingdom among men, and this kept him 
 from being moved by the difficulties he met with; for he always did 
 those things that pleased his Father. 

 [2.] The assurance he had of his Father's presence with him in his 
 sufferings: <I>He is at my right hand,</I> a present help to me, nigh 
 at hand in the time of need. <I>He is near that justifieth me</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:8">Isa. l. 8</A>);

 he is at my right hand, to direct and strengthen it, and hold it up,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:21">Ps. lxxxix. 21</A>.

 When he was in his agony an angel was sent from heaven to strengthen
 him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:43">Luke xxii. 43</A>.

 To this the victories and triumphs of the cross were all owing; it was
 the Lord at his right hand that <I>struck through kings,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+110:5,Isa+42:1,2">Ps. cx. 5; Isa. xlii. 1, 2</A>.

 [3.] The prospect he had of a glorious issue of his sufferings. It was
 <I>for the joy set before him</I> that <I>he endured the cross,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:2">Heb. xii. 2</A>.
 
 He rested in hope, and that made his rest glorious,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:10">Isa. xi. 10</A>.

 He knew he should be justified in the Spirit by his resurrection, and
 straightway glorified. See

 3. That he should be brought through his sufferings, and brought from 
 under the power of death by a glorious resurrection. 

 (1.) That his soul should not be left in hell, that is, his human 
 spirit should not be long left, as other men's spirits are, in a state 
 of separation from the body, but should, in a little time, return and 
 be re-united to it, never to part again. 

 (2.) That being God's holy One in a peculiar manner, sanctified to the 
 work of redemption and perfectly free from sin, he should not see 
 corruption nor feel it. This implies that he should not only be raised 
 from the grave, but raised so soon that his dead body should not so 
 much as begin to corrupt, which, in the course of nature, it would have
 done if it had not been raised the third day. We, who have so much
 corruption in our souls, must expect that our bodies also will corrupt 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:19">Job xxiv. 19</A>);

 but that holy One of God who knew no sin saw no corruption. Under the
 law it was strictly ordered that those parts of the sacrifices which 
 were not burnt upon the altar should by no means be kept till the third 
 day, lest they should putrefy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+7:15,18">Lev. vii. 15, 18</A>),

 which perhaps pointed at Christ's rising the third day, that he might 
 not see corruption--neither was a bone of him broken.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That he should be abundantly recompensed for his sufferings, with 
 the joy set before him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 He was well assured,

 (1.) That he should not miss of his glory: "<I>Thou wilt show me the 
 path of life,</I> and lead me to that life through this darksome 
 valley." In confidence of this, when he gave up the ghost, he said, 
 <I>Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit;</I> and, a little before, 
 <I>Father, glorify me with thy own self.</I> 

 (2.) That he should be received into the presence of God, to sit at his 
 right hand. His being admitted into God's presence would be the 
 acceptance of his service and his being set at his right hand the 
 recompence of it. 

 (3.) Thus, as a reward for the sorrows he underwent for our redemption, 
 he should have a <I>fulness of joy, and pleasures for evermore;</I> not 
 only the glory he had with God, as God, before all worlds, but the joy 
 and pleasure of a Mediator, in seeing his seed, and the success and 
 prosperity of his undertaking,

 II. Christ being the Head of the body, the church, these verses may, 
 for the most part, be applied to all good Christians, who are guided 
 and animated by the Spirit of Christ; and, in singing them, when we 
 have first given glory to Christ, in whom, to our everlasting comfort, 
 they have had their accomplishment, we may then encourage and edify 
 ourselves and one another with them, and may hence learn, 

 1. That it is our wisdom and duty to set the Lord always before us, and
 to see him continually at our right hand, wherever we are, to eye him 
 as our chief good and highest end, our owner, ruler, and judge, our 
 gracious benefactor, our sure guide and strict observer; and, while we 
 do thus, we shall not be moved either from our duty or from our 
 comfort. Blessed Paul set the Lord before him, when, though bonds and
 afflictions did await him, he could bravely say, <I>None of these 
 things move me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:24">Acts xx. 24</A>.

 2. That, if our eyes be ever towards God, our hearts and tongues may
 ever rejoice in him; it is our own fault if they do not. If the heart 
 rejoice in God, out of the abundance of that let the mouth speak, to 
 his glory, and the edification of others. 

 3. That dying Christians, as well as a dying Christ, may cheerfully put
 off the body, in a believing expectation of a joyful resurrection: 
 <I>My flesh also shall rest in hope.</I> Our bodies have little rest in 
 this world, but in the grave they shall rest as in their beds,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:2">Isa. lvii. 2</A>.

 We have little to hope for from this life, but we shall rest in hope of
 a better life; we may put off the body in that hope. Death <I>destroys 
 the hope of man</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:19">Job xiv. 19</A>),

 but not the hope of a good Christian, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+14:32">Prov. xiv. 32</A>.

 He has hope in his death, living hopes in dying moments, hopes that the
 body shall not be left for ever in the grave, but, though it see 
 corruption for a time, it shall, at the end of the time, be raised to 
 immortality; Christ's resurrection is an earnest of ours if we be his.

 4. That those who live piously with God in their eye may die 
 comfortably with heaven in their eye. In this world sorrow is our lot, 
 but in heaven there is joy. All our joys here are empty and defective, 
 but in heaven there is a fulness of joy. Our pleasures here are 
 transient and momentary, and such is the nature of them that it is not 
 fit they should last long; but those at God's right hand are pleasures 
 for evermore; for they are the pleasures of immortal souls in the 
 immediate vision and fruition of an eternal God.</P>
