 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of this psalm is the same with that of the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:1-21">foregoing psalm</A>,

 but there is something very singular in the composition of it; for the
 latter half of each verse is the same, repeated throughout the psalm, 
 "for his mercy endureth for ever," and yet no vain repetition. It is 
 allowed that such burdens, or "keepings," as we call them, add very 
 much to the beauty of a song, and help to make it moving and affecting; 
 nor can any verse contain more weighty matter, or more worthy to be
 thus repeated, than this, that God's mercy endureth for ever; and the 
 repetition of it here twenty-six times intimates, 

 1. That God's mercies to his people are thus repeated and drawn, as it
 were, with a continuando from the beginning to the end, with a progress 
 and advance in infinitum. 

 2. That in every particular favour we ought to take notice of the mercy
 of God, and to take favour we ought to take notice of the mercy of God, 
 and to take notice of it as enduring still, the same now that it has 
 been, and enduring for ever, the same always that it is. 

 3. That the everlasting continuance of the mercy of God is very much
 his honour and that which he glories in, and very much the saints' 
 comfort and that which they glory in. It is that which therefore our 
 hearts should be full of and greatly affected with, so that the most 
 frequent mention of it, instead of cloying us, should raise us the 
 more, because it will be the subject of our praise to all eternity.
 This most excellent sentence, that God's mercy endureth for ever, is 
 magnified above all the truths concerning God, not only by the 
 repetition of it here, but by the signal tokens of divine acceptance 
 with which God owned the singing of it, both in Solomon's time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+5:13">2 Chron. v. 13</A>,

 when they sang these words, "for his mercy endureth for ever," the
 house was filled with a cloud) and in Jehoshaphat's time (when they 
 sang these words, God gave them victory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:21,22">2 Chron. xx. 21, 22</A>),

 which should make us love to sing, "His mercies sure do still endure, 
 eternally." We must praise God, 

 I. As great and good in himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. As the Creator of the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:5-9">ver. 5-9</A>.

 III. As Israel's God and Saviour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:10-22">ver. 10-22</A>.

 IV. As our Redeemer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:23,24">ver. 23, 24</A>.

 V. As the great benefactor of the whole creation, and God over all, 
 blessed for evermore,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The duty we are here again and again called to is to <I>give 
 thanks,</I> to <I>offer the sacrifice of praise continually,</I> not 
 the fruits of our ground or cattle, but <I>the fruit of our lips, 
 giving thanks to his name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:15">Heb. xiii. 15</A>.

 We are never so earnestly called upon to pray and repent as to <I>give 
 thanks;</I> for it is the will of God that we should abound most in the 
 most pleasant exercises of religion, in that which is the work of 
 heaven. Now here observe, 

 1. Whom we must give thanks to--to him that we receive all good from,
 <I>to the Lord,</I> Jehovah, Israel's God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>the God of gods,</I> the God whom angels adore, from whom 
 magistrates derive their power, and by whom all pretended deities are 
 and shall be conquered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <I>to the Lord of lords,</I> the Sovereign of all sovereigns, the stay 
 and supporter of all supports; 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 In all our adorations we must have an eye to God's excellency as 
 transcendent, and to his power and dominion as incontestably and 
 uncontrollably supreme.

 2. What we must give thanks for, not as the Pharisee that made all his
 thanksgivings terminate in his own praise (<I>God, I thank thee,</I> 
 that I am so and so), but directing them all to God's glory.

 (1.) We must give thanks to God for his goodness and mercy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Give thanks to the Lord,</I> not only because he does good, but 
 because he is good (all the streams must be traced up to the fountain), 
 not only because he is merciful to us, but because his mercy endures 
 for ever, and will be drawn out to those that shall come after us. We 
 must give thanks to God, not only for that mercy which is now handed 
 out to us here on earth, but for that which shall endure for ever in 
 the glories and joys of heaven.

 (2.) We must give God thanks for the instances of his power and wisdom.
 In general

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 he <I>along does great wonders.</I> The contrivance is wonderful, the 
 design being laid by infinite wisdom; the performance is wonderful, 
 being put in execution by infinite power. He alone does marvellous 
 things; none besides can do such things, and he does them without the 
 assistance or advice of any other. More particularly,

 [1.] He made the heavens, and stretched them out, and in them we not 
 only see his wisdom and power, but we taste his mercy in their benign 
 influences; as long as the heavens endure the mercy of God endures in 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 [2.] He raised the earth out of the waters when he caused the dry land 
 to appear, that it might be fit to be a habitation for man, and therein 
 also his mercy to man still endures 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 for <I>the earth hath he given to the children of men,</I> and all its 
 products.

 [3.] Having made both heaven and earth, he settled a correspondence 
 between them, notwithstanding their distance, by making the sun, moon, 
 and stars, which he placed in the firmament of heaven, to shed their 
 light and influences upon this earth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.

 These are called the <I>great lights</I> because they appear so to us, 
 for otherwise astronomers could tell us that the moon is less than many 
 of the stars, but, being nearer to the earth, it seems much greater. 
 They are said to <I>rule,</I> not only because they govern the seasons 
 of the year, but because they are useful to the world, and benefactors 
 are the best rulers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:25">Luke xxii. 25</A>.

 But the empire is divided, one <I>rules by day,</I> the <I>other by 
 night</I> (at least, <I>the stars</I>), and yet all are subject to 
 God's direction and disposal. Those rulers, therefore, which the 
 Gentiles idolized, are the world's servants and God's subjects.
 <I>Sun, stand thou still, and thou moon.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy
 <I>endureth</I> for ever:
 &nbsp; 11  And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy

 &nbsp; 15  But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his
 mercy <I>endureth</I> for ever.
 &nbsp; 16  To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his
 mercy <I>endureth</I> for ever.
 &nbsp; 17  To him which smote great kings: for his mercy <I>endureth</I> for
 ever:
 &nbsp; 18  And slew famous kings: for his mercy <I>endureth</I> for ever:
 &nbsp; 19  Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy <I>endureth</I> for
 ever:
 &nbsp; 20  And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy <I>endureth</I> for
 ever:
 &nbsp; 21  And gave their land for a heritage: for his mercy
 <I>endureth</I> for ever:
 &nbsp; 22  <I>Even</I> a heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy
 <I>endureth</I> for ever.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The great things God did for Israel, when he first formed them into a
 people, and set up his kingdom among them, are here mentioned, as often 
 elsewhere in the psalms, as instances both of the power of God and of 
 the particular kindness he had for Israel. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:8">Ps. cxxxv. 8</A>,
 
 &c. 

 1. He brought them out of Egypt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:10-12"><I>v.</I> 10-12</A>.

 That was a mercy which endured long to them, and our redemption by 
 Christ, which was typified by that, does indeed endure for ever, for it 
 is an eternal redemption. Of all the plagues of Egypt, none is
 mentioned but the death of the first-born, because that was the 
 conquering plague; by that God, who in all the plagues distinguished 
 the Israelites from the Egyptians, brought them at last from among 
 them, not by a wile, but with a strong hand and an arm stretched out to 
 reach far and do great things. These miracles of mercy, as they proved 
 Moses's commission to give law to Israel, so they laid Israel under 
 lasting obligations to obey that law,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:2">Exod. xx. 2</A>.

 2. He forced them a way through the Red Sea, which obstructed them at 
 their first setting out. By the power he has to control the common 
 course of nature he <I>divided the sea into two parts,</I> between 
 which he opened a path, and made Israel to pass between the parts, now 
 that they were to enter into covenant with him; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+34:18">Jer. xxxiv. 18</A>.

 He not only divided the sea, but gave his people courage to go through 
 it when it was divided, which was an instance of God's power over men's 
 hearts, as the former of his power over the waters. And, to make it a 
 miracle of justice as well as mercy, the same Red Sea that was a lane 
 to the Israelites was a grave to their pursuers. There he shook off 
 Pharaoh and his host. 

 3. He conducted them through a vast howling wilderness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 there he led them and fed them. Their camp was victualled and
 fortified by a constant series of miracles for forty years; though they 
 loitered and wandered there, they were not lost. And in this the mercy 
 of God, and the constancy of that mercy, were the more observable 
 because they often provoked him in the wilderness and grieved him in 
 the desert. 

 4. He destroyed kings before them, to make room for them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>),

 not deposed and banished them, but smote and slew them, in which 
 appeared his wrath against them, but his mercy, his never-failing 
 mercy, to Israel. And that which magnified it was that they were 
 <I>great kings</I> and <I>famous kings,</I> yet God subdued them as 
 easily as if they had been the least, and weakest, and meanest, of the 
 children of men. They were wicked kings, and then their grandeur and 
 lustre would not secure them from the justice of God. The more great 
 and famous they were the more did God's mercy to Israel appear in 
 giving such kings for them. Sihon and Og are particularly mentioned, 
 because they were the first two that were conquered on the other side 
 Jordan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 It is good to enter into the detail of God's favours and not to view 
 them in the gross, and in each instance to observe, and own, that God's 
 <I>mercy endureth for ever.</I> 

 5. He put them in possession of a good land,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 He whose the earth is, and the fulness thereof, the world and those 
 that dwell therein, took land from one people and gave it to another, 
 as pleased him. The <I>iniquity of the Amorites was now full,</I> and 
 therefore it was taken from them. <I>Israel</I> was his
 <I>servant,</I> and, though they had been provoking in the wilderness, 
 yet he intended to have some service out of them, for <I>to them 
 pertained the service of God.</I> As he said to the Egyptians, <I>Let 
 my people go,</I> so to the Canaanites, <I>Let my people in,</I> that 
 they may serve me. In this <I>God's mercy</I> to them <I>endureth for 
 ever,</I> because it was a figure of the heavenly Canaan, the <I>mercy 
 of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</I></P>

 God's everlasting mercy is here celebrated, 

 1. In the redemption of his church,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 In the many redemptions wrought for the Jewish church out of the hands 
 of their oppressors (when, in the years of their servitude, their 
 estate was very low, God remembered them, and raised them up saviours, 
 the judges, and David, at length, by whom God gave them rest from all 
 their enemies), but especially in the great redemption of the universal 
 church, of which these were types, we have a great deal of reason to 
 say, "<I>He remembered us,</I> the children of men, <I>in our low 
 estate,</I> in our lost estate, <I>for his mercy endureth for ever;</I> 
 he sent his Son to redeem us from sin, and death, and hell, and all our 
 spiritual enemies, <I>for his mercy endureth for ever;</I> he was sent 
 to redeem us, and not the angels that sinned, for his mercy endureth 
 for ever." 
 
 2. In the provision he makes for all the creatures

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>He gives food to all flesh.</I> It is an instance of the mercy of 
 God's providence that wherever he has given life he gives food 
 agreeable and sufficient; and he is a good housekeeper that provides 
 for so large a family. 
 
 3. In all his glories, and all his gifts
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+136:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>Give thanks to the God of heaven.</I> This denotes him to be a 
 glorious God, and the glory of his mercy is to be taken notice of in 
 our praises. The <I>riches of his glory</I> are displayed in the 
 <I>vessels of his mercy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:23">Rom. ix. 23</A>.

 It also denotes him to be the great benefactor, <I>for every good and 
 perfect gift is from above,</I> from the Father of lights, the <I>God 
 of heaven;</I> and we should trace every stream to the fountain. This 
 and that particular mercy may perhaps endure but a while, but the mercy 
 that is in God <I>endures for ever;</I> it is an inexhaustible 
 fountain.</P>
