 When the things of God are to be taught precept must be upon precept, 
 and line upon line, not only because the things themselves are of great 
 worth and weight, but because men's minds, at the best, are unapt to 
 admit them and commonly prejudiced against them; and therefore Solomon, 
 in this chapter, with a great variety of expression and a pleasant 
 powerful flood of divine eloquence, inculcates the same things that he 
 had pressed upon us in the foregoing chapters. Here is, 

 I. An earnest exhortation to the study of wisdom, that is, of true
 religion and godliness, borrowed from the good instructions which his 
 father gave him, and enforced with many considerable arguments, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:1-13">ver. 1-13</A>.

 II. A necessary caution against bad company and all fellowship with the
 unfruitful works of darkness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:14-19">ver. 14-19</A>.

 III. Particular directions for the attaining and preserving of wisdom,
 and bringing forth the fruits of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:20-27">ver. 20-27</A>.

 So plainly, so pressingly, is the case laid before us, that we shall be 
 for ever inexcusable if we perish in our folly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to
 know understanding.
 &nbsp; 2  For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.
 &nbsp; 3  For I was my father's son, tender and only <I>beloved</I> in the
 sight of my mother.
 &nbsp; 4  He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain
 my words: keep my commandments, and live.
 &nbsp; 5  Get wisdom, get understanding: forget <I>it</I> not; neither
 decline from the words of my mouth.
 &nbsp; 6  Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and
 she shall keep thee.
 &nbsp; 7  Wisdom <I>is</I> the principal thing; <I>therefore</I> get wisdom: and
 with all thy getting get understanding.
 &nbsp; 8  Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee
 to honour, when thou dost embrace her.
 &nbsp; 9  She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of
 glory shall she deliver to thee.
 &nbsp; 10  Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy
 life shall be many.
 &nbsp; 11  I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in
 right paths.
 &nbsp; 12  When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when
 thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
 &nbsp; 13  Take fast hold of instruction; let <I>her</I> not go: keep her;
 for she <I>is</I> thy life.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The invitation which Solomon gives to his children to come and 
 receive instruction from him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>):

 <I>Hear, you children, the instruction of a father.</I> That is, 

 1. "Let my own children, in the first place, receive and give good
 heed to those instructions which I set down for the use of others 
 also." Note, Magistrates and ministers, who are entrusted with the 
 direction of larger societies, are concerned to take a more than 
 ordinary care for the good instruction of their own families; from this 
 duty their public work will by no means excuse them. This charity must 
 begin at home, though it must not end there; for he that has not his 
 children in subjection with all gravity, and does not take pains in 
 their good education, how shall he do his duty as he ought <I>to the 
 church of God?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:4,5">1 Tim. iii. 4, 5</A>.

 The children of those that are eminent for wisdom and public usefulness 
 ought to improve in knowledge and grace in proportion to the advantages 
 they derive from their relation to such parents. Yet it may be 
 observed, to save both the credit and the comfort of those parents 
 whose children do not answer the hopes that arose from their education, 
 that Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, was far from being either one of the 
 wisest or one of the best. We have reason to think that thousands have 
 got more good by Solomon's proverbs than his own son did, to whom they 
 seem to have been dedicated.

 2. Let all young people, in the days of their childhood and youth, take 
 pains to get knowledge and grace, for that is their learning age, and 
 then their minds are formed and seasoned. He does not say, <I>My</I> 
 children, but <I>You</I> children. We read but of one son that Solomon 
 had of his own; but (would you think it?) he is willing to set up for a 
 schoolmaster, and to teach other people's children! for at that age 
 there is most hope of success; the branch is easily bent when it is 
 young and tender. 

 3. Let all that would receive instruction come with the disposition of
 children, though they be grown persons. Let all prejudices be laid 
 aside, and the mind be as white paper. Let them be dutiful, tractable,
 and self-diffident, and take the word as the word of a father, which 
 comes both with authority and with affection. We must see it coming 
 from God as <I>our Father in heaven,</I> to whom we pray, from whom we 
 expect blessings, the Father of our spirits, to whom we ought to be in 
 subjection, that we may live. We must look upon our teachers as our
 fathers, who love us and seek our welfare; and therefore though the 
 instruction carry in it reproof and correction, for so the word 
 signifies, yet we must bid it welcome. Now,

 (1.) To recommend it to us, we are told, not only that it is the 
 <I>instruction of a father,</I> but that it is <I>understanding,</I> 
 and therefore should be welcome to intelligent creatures. Religion has 
 reason on its side, and we are taught it by fair reasoning. It is a law 
 indeed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 but that law is founded upon doctrine, upon unquestionable principles
 of truth, upon <I>good doctrine,</I> which is not only faithful, but 
 worthy of all acceptation. If we admit the doctrine, we cannot but 
 submit to the law.

 (2.) To rivet it in us, we are directed to receive it as a gift, to 
 attend to it with all diligence, to attend so as to know it, for 
 otherwise we cannot do it, and not to forsake it by disowning the 
 doctrine or disobeying the law.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The instructions he gives them. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How he came by these instructions; he had them from his parents, and 
 teaches his children the same that they taught him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.
 
 Observe,
 
 (1.) His parents loved him, and therefore taught him: <I>I was my 
 father's son.</I> David had many sons, but Solomon was his son 
 <I>indeed,</I> as Isaac is called 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+17:19">Gen. xvii. 19</A>)

 and for the same reason, because on him the covenant was entailed. He 
 was his father's darling, above any of his children. God had a special 
 kindness for Solomon (the prophet called him <I>Jedidiah,</I> because 
 the Lord loved him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:25">2 Sam. xii. 25</A>),

 and for that reason David had a special kindness for him, for he was a 
 man after God's own heart. If parents may ever love one child better 
 than another, it must not be till it plainly appears that God does so. 
 He was <I>tender, and only beloved, in the sight of his mother.</I> 
 Surely there was a manifest reason for making such a distinction when 
 both the parents made it. Now we see how they showed their love; they 
 catechised him, kept him to his book, and held him to a strict 
 discipline. Though he was a prince, and heir-apparent to the crown, yet 
 they did not let him live at large; nay, therefore they tutored him 
 thus. And perhaps David was the more strict with Solomon in his 
 education because he had seen the ill effects of an undue indulgence in 
 Adonijah, whom he had not <I>crossed in any thing</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:6">1 Kings i. 6</A>),

 as also in Absalom.

 (2.) What his parents taught him he teaches others. Observe,

 [1.] When Solomon was grown up he not only remembered, but took a 
 pleasure in repeating, the good lessons his parents taught him when he 
 was a child. He did not forget them, so deep were the impressions they 
 made upon him. He was not ashamed of them, such a high value had he for 
 them, nor did he look upon them as the childish things, the mean 
 things, which, when he became a man, a king, he should put away, as a 
 disparagement to him; much less did he repeat them: as some wicked 
 children have done, to ridicule them, and make his companions merry 
 with them, priding himself that he had got clear from grave lessons and 
 restraints. 

 [2.] Though Solomon was a wise man himself, and divinely inspired, yet, 
 when he was to teach wisdom, he did not think it below him to quote his 
 father and to make use of his words. Those that would learn well, and 
 teach well, in religion, must not affect new-found notions and 
 new-coined phrases, so as to look with contempt upon the knowledge and 
 language of their predecessors; if we must keep to the good old way, 
 why should we scorn the good old words?
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+6:16">Jer. vi. 16</A>.

 [3.] Solomon, having been well educated by his parents, thought himself 
 thereby obliged to give his children a good education, the same that 
 his parents had given him; and this is one way in which we must requite 
 our parents for the pains they took with us, even by showing piety at 
 home, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:4">1 Tim. v. 4</A>.

 They taught us, not only that we might learn ourselves, but that we 
 might teach our children, the good knowledge of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:6">Ps. lxxviii. 6</A>.

 And we are false to a trust if we do not; for the sacred deposit of 
 religious doctrine and law was lodged in our hands with a charge to 
 transmit it pure and entire to those that shall <I>come after us,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+2:2">2 Tim. ii. 2</A>.

 [4.] Solomon enforces his exhortations with the authority of his father 
 David, a man famous in his generation upon all accounts. Be it taken 
 notice of, to the honour of religion, that the wisest and best men in 
 every age have been most zealous, not only for the practice of it 
 themselves, but for the propagating of it to others; and we should 
 therefore <I>continue in the things which we have learned, knowing of 
 whom we have learned them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:14">2 Tim. iii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What these instructions were, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:4-13"><I>v.</I> 4-13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) By way of precept and exhortation. David, in teaching his son,
 though he was a child of great capacity and quick apprehension, yet to 
 show that he was in good earnest, and to affect his child the more with 
 what he said, expressed himself with great warmth and importunity, and 
 inculcated the same thing again and again. So children must be taught. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:7">Deut. vi. 7</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt whet them diligently upon thy children.</I> David, though 
 he was a man of public business, and had tutors for his son, took all 
 this pains with him himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] He recommends to him his Bible and his catechism, as the means, 
 his father's <I>words</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 the <I>words of his mouth</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),
 
 his <I>sayings</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 all the good lessons he had taught him; and perhaps he means
 particularly the book of Psalms, many of which were <I>Maschils--psalms
 of instruction,</I> and two of them are expressly said to be <I>for 
 Solomon.</I> These, and all his other words, Solomon must have an eye 
 to. <I>First,</I> He must <I>hear and receive them</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 diligently attend to them, and imbibe them, <I>as the earth drinks in
 the rain that comes often upon it,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:7">Heb. vi. 7</A>.

 God thus bespeaks our attention to his word: <I>Hear, O my son! and
 receive my sayings. Secondly,</I> He must <I>hold fast the form of
 sound words</I> which his father gave him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Let thy heart retain my words;</I> and except the word be hid in the
 heart, lodged in the will and affections, it will not be retained. 
 <I>Thirdly,</I> He must govern himself by them: <I>Keep my 
 commandments,</I> obey them, and that is the way to increase in the 
 knowledge of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:17">John vii. 17</A>.

 <I>Fourthly,</I> He must stick to them and abide by them: "<I>Decline
 not from the words of my mouth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 as fearing they will be too great a check upon thee, but <I>take fast
 hold of instruction</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 as being resolved to keep thy hold and never let it go." Those that
 have a good education, though they strive to shake it off, will find it 
 hang about them a great while, and, if it do not, their case is very 
 sad.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] He recommends to him wisdom and understanding as the end to be 
 aimed at in the use of these means; that <I>wisdom</I> which is the 
 <I>principal wisdom,</I> get that. <I>Quod caput est sapientia eam 
 acquire sapientiam--Be sure to mind that branch of wisdom which is the
 top branch of it,</I> and that is the <I>fear of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:7"><I>ch.</I> i. 7</A>.
 
 Junius and Tremellius. A principle of religion in the heart is the one
 thing needful; therefore, <I>First,</I> Get this <I>wisdom,</I> get 
 this <I>understanding,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 And again, "<I>Get wisdom,</I> and <I>with all thy getting, get 
 understanding,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Pray for it, take pains for it, give diligence in the use of all 
 appointed means to attain it. <I>Wait at wisdom's gate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:34">Prov. viii. 34</A>.
 
 Get dominion over thy corruptions, which are thy follies: get
 possession of wise principles and the habits of wisdom. Get wisdom by
 experience, get it <I>above all thy getting;</I> be more in care and 
 take more pains to get this than to get the wealth of this world; 
 whatever thou forgettest, get this, reckon it a great achievement, and 
 pursue it accordingly." True wisdom is God's gift, and yet we are here 
 commanded to get it, because God gives it to those that labour for it; 
 yet, after all, we must not say, <I>Our might and the power of our hand 
 have gotten us this wealth. Secondly, Forget her not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>forsake her not</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 <I>let her not go</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <I>but keep her.</I> Those that have got this wisdom must take heed of
 losing it again by returning to folly: it is indeed a good part, that 
 shall not be <I>taken from us;</I> but then we must take heed lest we 
 throw it from us, as those do that forget it first, and let it slip out 
 of their minds, and then forsake it and turn out of its good ways. That 
 good thing which is committed to us we must keep, and not let it drop, 
 through carelessness, nor suffer it to be forced from us, nor suffer 
 ourselves to be wheedled out of it; never let go such a jewel.
 <I>Thirdly, Love her</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 and <I>embrace her</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 as worldly men love their wealth and set their hearts upon it. Religion
 should be very dear to us, dearer than any thing in this world; and, if 
 we cannot reach to be great masters of wisdom, yet let us be true 
 lovers of it; and what grace we have let us embrace it with a sincere 
 affection, as those that admire its beauty. <I>Fourthly, "Exalt 
 her,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Always keep up high thoughts of religion, and do all thou canst to 
 bring it into reputation, and maintain the credit of it among men. 
 Concur with God in his purpose, which is to magnify the law and make it 
 honourable, and do what thou canst to serve that purpose." Let 
 <I>Wisdom's</I> children not only justify her, but magnify her, and 
 prefer her before that which is dearest to them in this world. In
 honouring those that fear the Lord, though they are low in the world, 
 and in regarding a <I>poor wise man,</I> we exalt wisdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) By way of motive and inducement thus to labour for wisdom, and 
 submit to the guidance of it, consider, 

 [1.] It is the main matter, and that which ought to be the chief and 
 continual care of every man in this life 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Wisdom is the principal thing;</I> other things which we are
 solicitous to get and keep are nothing to it. It is the <I>whole of 
 man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:13">Eccl. xii. 13</A>.

 It is that which recommends us to God, which beautifies the soul, which 
 enables us to answer the end of our creation, to live to some good 
 purpose in the world, and to get to heaven at last; and therefore it is 
 the principal thing.

 [2.] It has reason and equity on its side 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>I have taught thee in the way of wisdom,</I> and so it will be
 found to be at last. <I>I have led thee,</I> not in the crooked ways
 of carnal policy, which does wrong under colour of wisdom, but <I>in 
 right paths,</I> agreeable to the eternal rules and reasons of good and 
 evil." The rectitude of the divine nature appears in the rectitude of 
 all the divine laws. Observe, David not only taught his son by good
 instructions, but led him both by a good example and by applying 
 general instructions to particular cases; so that nothing was wanting 
 on his part to make him wise.

 [3.] It would be much for his own advantage: "If thou be wise and good, 
 thou shalt be so for thyself." <I>First,</I> "It will be thy life, thy 
 comfort, thy happiness; it is what thou canst not live without:" 
 <I>Keep my commandments and live,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 That of our Saviour agrees with this, <I>If thou wilt enter into life, 
 keep the commandments,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+19:17">Matt. xix. 17</A>.

 It is upon pain of death, eternal death, and in prospect of life, 
 eternal life, that we are required to be religious. "Receive wisdom's 
 sayings, <I>and the years of thy life shall be many</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 as many in this world as Infinite Wisdom sees fit, and in the other
 world thou shalt live that life the years of which shall never be 
 numbered. <I>Keep her</I> therefore, whatever it cost thee, <I>for she 
 is thy life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 All thy satisfaction will be found in this;" and a soul without true 
 wisdom and grace is really a dead soul. <I>Secondly,</I> "It will be
 thy guard and guide, thy convoy and conductor, through all the dangers 
 and difficulties of thy journey through this wilderness. Love wisdom, 
 and cleave to her, and she shall <I>preserve thee, she shall keep 
 thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 from sin, the worst of evils, the worst of enemies; she shall keep thee
 from hurting thyself, and then none else can hurt thee." As we say, 
 "Keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee;" so, "Keep thy wisdom, and 
 thy wisdom will keep thee." It will keep us from straits and 
 stumbling-blocks in the management of ourselves and our affairs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.
 
 1. That our steps be not straitened when we go, that we bring not 
 ourselves into such straits as David was in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+24:14">2 Sam. xxiv. 14</A>.

 Those that make God's word their rule shall walk at liberty, and be at 
 ease in themselves.

 2. That our feet do not stumble when we run. If wise and good men be 
 put upon sudden resolves, the certain rule of God's word which they go 
 by will keep them even then from stumbling upon any thing that may be 
 pernicious. Integrity and uprightness will preserve us.
 <I>Thirdly,</I> "It will be thy honour and reputation

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):
 
 <I>Exalt</I> wisdom (do thou but show thy good-will to her advancement)
 and though she needs not thy service she will abundantly recompense it, 
 <I>she shall promote thee, she shall bring thee to honour.</I>" Solomon 
 was to be a king, but his wisdom and virtue would be more his honour 
 than his crown or purple; it was that for which all his neighbours had 
 him so much in veneration; and no doubt, in his reign and David's, wise 
 and good men stood fairest for preferment. However, religion will,
 first or last, bring all those <I>to honour</I> that cordially 
 <I>embrace her;</I> they shall be accepted of God, respected by all 
 wise men, owned in the great day, and shall inherit everlasting glory.
 This he insists on 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>She shall give to thy head an ornament of grace</I> in this world,
 shall recommend thee both to God and man, and in the other world <I>a 
 crown of glory shall she deliver to thee,</I> a crown that shall never 
 totter, a crown of glory that shall never wither." That is the true 
 honour which attends religion. <I>Nobilitas sola est atique unica
 virtus--Virtue is the only nobility!</I> David having thus recommended
 wisdom to his son, no marvel that when God bade him ask what he would 
 he prayed, Lord, <I>give me a wise and an understanding heart.</I> We 
 should make it appear by our prayers how well we are taught.</P>

 Some make David's instructions to Solomon, which began 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>,

 to continue to the end of the chapter; nay, some continue them to the 
 end of the ninth chapter; but it is more probable that Solomon begins 
 here again, if not sooner. In these verses, having exhorted us to walk
 in the paths of wisdom, he cautions us against the path of the wicked. 

 1. We must take heed of the ways of sin and avoid them, every thing
 that looks like sin and leads to it. 

 2. In order to this we must keep out of the ways of sinners, and have 
 no fellowship with them. For fear of falling into wicked courses, we 
 must shun wicked company. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The caution itself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 1. We must take heed of falling in with sin and sinners: <I>Enter not 
 into the paths of the wicked.</I> Our teacher, having like a faithful 
 guide shown us the <I>right paths</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 here warns us of the by-paths into which we are in danger of being
 drawn aside. Those that have been well educated, and trained up in the 
 way they should go, let them never turn aside into the way they should 
 not go; let them not so much as enter into it, no, not to make trial of 
 it, lest it prove a dangerous experiment and difficult to retreat with 
 safety. "Venture not into the company of those that are infected with 
 the plague, no, not though thou think thyself guarded with an 
 antidote." 

 2. If at any time we are inveigled into an evil way, we must hasten out 
 of it. "If, ere thou wast aware, thou didst enter in at the gate, 
 because it was wide, <I>go not</I> on <I>in the way of evil men.</I> As 
 soon as thou art made sensible of thy mistake, retire immediately, take 
 not a step more, stay not a minute longer, in the way that certainly 
 leads to destruction." 

 3. We must dread and detest the ways of sin and sinners, and decline
 them with the utmost care imaginable. "<I>The way of evil men</I> may 
 seem a pleasant way and sociable, and the nearest way to the compassing 
 of some secular end we may have in view; but it is an evil way, and 
 will end ill, and therefore if thou love thy God and thy soul <I>avoid 
 it, pass not by it,</I> that thou mayest not be tempted to enter into 
 it; and, if thou find thyself near it, <I>turn from it and pass 
 away,</I> and get as far off it as thou canst." The manner of 
 expression intimates the imminent danger we are in, the need we have of 
 this caution, and the great importance of it, and that our watchmen 
 are, or should be, in good earnest, in giving us warning. It intimates 
 likewise at what a distance we should keep from sin and sinners; he 
 does not say, Keep at a due distance, but at a great distance, the 
 further the better; never think you can get far enough from it. 
 <I>Escape for thy life: look not behind thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reasons to enforce this caution.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. "Consider the character of the men whose way thou art warned to 
 shun." They are mischievous men 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>);

 they not only care not what hurt they do to those that stand in their
 way, but it is their business to do mischief, and their delight, purely 
 for mischief-sake. They are continually designing and endeavouring to
 <I>cause some to fall,</I> to ruin them body and soul. Wickedness and 
 malice are in their nature, and violence is in all their actions. They 
 are spiteful in the highest degree; for,

 (1.) Mischief is rest and sleep to them. As much satisfaction as a 
 covetous man has when he has got money, an ambitious man when he has 
 got preferment, and a good man when he has done good, so much have they 
 when they have said or done that which is injurious and ill-natured; 
 and they are extremely uneasy if they cannot get their envy and revenge 
 gratified, as Haman, to whom every thing was unpleasant as long as 
 Mordecai was unhanged. It intimates likewise how restless and unwearied 
 they are in their mischievous pursuits; they will rather be deprived of 
 sleep than of the pleasure of being vexatious. 

 (2.) Mischief is meat and drink to them; they feed and feast upon it. 
 <I>They eat the bread of the wickedness (they eat up my people as they 
 eat bread,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:4">Ps. xiv. 4</A>)
 
 <I>and drink the wine of violence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 <I>drink iniquity like water,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:16">Job xv. 16</A>.

 All they eat and drink is got by rapine and oppression. Do wicked men 
 think the time lost in which they are not doing hurt? Let good men make 
 it as much their business and delight to do good. <I>Amici, diem 
 perdidi--Friends, I have lost a day.</I> And let all that are wise, and 
 wish well to themselves, avoid the society of the wicked; for,

 [1.] It is very scandalous; for there is no disposition of mind that is 
 a greater reproach to human nature, a greater enemy to human society, a 
 bolder defiance to God and conscience, that has more of the devil's 
 image in it, or is more serviceable to his interests, than a delight to 
 do mischief and to vex, and hurt, and ruin every body. 

 [2.] It is very dangerous. "Shun those that delight to do mischief as 
 thou tenderest thy own safety; for, whatever friendship they may 
 pretend, one time or other they will do thee mischief; thou wilt ruin 
 thyself if thou dost concur with them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:18"><I>ch.</I> i. 18</A>)

 and they will ruin thee if thou dost not."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. "Consider the character of the way itself which thou art warned to 
 shun, compared with the right way which thou art invited to walk 
 in."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The way of righteousness is light 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>The path of the just,</I> which they have chosen, and in which they
 walk, <I>is as light;</I> the <I>light shines on their ways</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:28">Job xxii. 28</A>)

 and makes them both safe and pleasant. Christ is <I>their way</I> and 
 he is <I>the light.</I> They are guided by the word of God and that is 
 <I>a light to their feet;</I> they themselves are <I>light in the 
 Lord</I> and they <I>walk in the light as he is in the light.</I>

 [1.] It is a <I>shining light.</I> Their way shines to themselves in 
 the joy and comfort of it; it shines before others in the lustre and 
 honour of it; <I>it shines before men, who see their good works,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:16">Matt. v. 16</A>.

 They go on in their way with a holy security and serenity of mind, as 
 those that <I>walk in the light.</I> It is as the morning-light, which 
 <I>shines out of obscurity</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:8,10">Isa. lviii. 8, 10</A>)

 and puts an end to the <I>works of darkness.</I>

 [2.] It is a growing light; it <I>shines more and more,</I> not like 
 the light of a meteor, which soon disappears, or that of a candle, 
 which burns dim and burns down, but like that of the rising sun, which 
 goes forward shining, mounts upward shining. Grace, the guide of this 
 way, is growing; <I>he that has clean hands shall be stronger and 
 stronger.</I> That joy which is the pleasure of this way, that honour 
 which is the brightness of it, and all that happiness which is indeed 
 its light, shall be still increasing. 

 [3.] It will arrive, in the end, at <I>the perfect day.</I> The light 
 of the dayspring will at length be noon-day light, and it is this that 
 the enlightened soul is pressing towards. The saints will not be 
 perfect till they come to heaven, but there they shall themselves 
 <I>shine as the sun when he goes forth in his strength,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:43">Matt. xiii. 43</A>.
 
 Their graces and joys shall be all consummate. Therefore it is our 
 wisdom to keep close to <I>the path of the just.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The <I>way of</I> sin <I>is as darkness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The works he had cautioned us not to have fellowship with are <I>works 
 of darkness.</I> What true pleasure and satisfaction can those have who 
 know no pleasure and satisfaction but what they have in doing mischief?
 What sure guide have those that cast God's word behind them? <I>The way 
 of the wicked is dark,</I> and therefore dangerous; for they stumble 
 and yet <I>know not at what they stumble.</I> They fall into sin, but 
 are not aware which way the temptation came by which they were 
 overthrown, and therefore know not how to avoid it the next time. They 
 fall into trouble, but never enquire wherefore God contends with them; 
 they <I>consider not that they do evil,</I> nor what will be in the end 
 of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:5,Job+18:5,6">Ps. lxxxii. 5; Job xviii. 5, 6</A>.

 This is the way we are directed to shun.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon, having warned us not to do evil, here teaches us how to do 
 well. It is not enough for us to shun the occasions of sin, but we must 
 study the methods of duty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We must have a continual regard to the word of God and endeavour 
 that it may be always ready to us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The sayings of wisdom must be our principles by which we must govern 
 ourselves, our monitors to warn us of duty and danger; and therefore, 
 
 (1.) We must receive them readily: "<I>Incline thy ear to them</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 humbly bow to them; diligently listen to them." The attentive hearing
 of the word of God is a good sign of a work of grace begun in the heart 
 and a good means of carrying it on. It is to be hoped that those are 
 resolved to do their duty who are inclined to know it.

 (2.) We must retain them carefully 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 we must lay them before us as our rule: "<I>Let them not depart from
 thy eyes;</I> view them, review them, and in every thing aim to conform 
 to them." We must lodge them within us, as a commanding principle, the 
 influences of which are diffused throughout the whole man: "<I>Keep 
 them in the midst of thy heart,</I> as things dear to thee, and which 
 thou art afraid of losing." Let the word of God be written in the 
 heart, and that which is written there will remain.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The reason why we must thus make much of the words of wisdom is 
 because they will be both food and physic to us, like <I>the tree of 
 life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:2,Eze+47:12">Rev. xxii. 2; Ezek. xlvii. 12</A>.

 Those that seek and find them, find and keep them, shall find in them,

 (1.) Food: <I>For they are life unto those that find them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 As the spiritual life was begun by the word as the instrument of it, so 
 by the same word it is still nourished and maintained. We could not 
 live without it; we may by faith live upon it. 

 (2.) Physic. They are <I>health to all their flesh,</I> to the whole
 man, both body and soul; they help to keep both in good plight. They
 are <I>health to all flesh,</I> so the LXX. There is enough to cure all 
 the diseases of this distempered world. They are <I>a medicine to all 
 their flesh</I> (so the word is), to all their corruptions, for they 
 are called flesh, to all their grievances, which are as thorns in the 
 flesh. There is in the word of God a proper remedy for all our 
 spiritual maladies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We must keep a watchful eye and a strict hand upon all the motions 
 of our inward man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.
 
 Here is, 

 1. A great duty required by the laws of wisdom, and in order to our 
 getting and preserving wisdom: <I>Keep thy heart with all 
 diligence.</I> God, who gave us these souls, gave us a strict charge 
 with them: Man, woman, <I>keep thy heart; take heed to thy spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:9">Deut. iv. 9</A>.

 We must maintain a holy jealousy of ourselves, and set a strict guard, 
 accordingly, upon all the avenues of the soul; keep our hearts from 
 doing hurt and getting hurt, from being defiled by sin and disturbed by 
 trouble; keep them as our jewel, as our vineyard; keep a conscience 
 void of offence; keep out bad thoughts; keep up good thoughts; keep the 
 affections upon right objects and in due bounds. <I>Keep them with all
 keepings</I> (so the word is); there are many ways of keeping 
 things--by care, by strength, by calling in help, and we must use them 
 all in keeping our hearts; and all little enough, so deceitful are 
 they, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:9">Jer. xvii. 9</A>.

 Or <I>above all keepings;</I> we must keep our hearts with more care 
 and diligence than we keep any thing else. We must keep our eyes 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:1">Job xxxi. 1</A>),
 
 keep our tongues 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:13">Ps. xxxiv. 13</A>),
 
 keep our feet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:1">Eccl. v. 1</A>),

 but, above all, keep our hearts.

 2. A good reason given for this care, because <I>out of it are the 
 issues of life.</I> Out of a heart well kept will flow living issues, 
 good products, to the glory of God and the edification of others. Or, 
 in general, all the actions of the life flow from the heart, and 
 therefore keeping that is making the tree good and healing the springs. 
 Our lives will be regular or irregular, comfortable or uncomfortable, 
 according as our hearts are kept or neglected.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We must set a <I>watch before the door of our lips,</I> that we 
 offend not with our tongue
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>Put away from thee a froward mouth and perverse lips.</I> Our hearts
 being naturally corrupt, out of them a great deal of corrupt 
 communication is apt to come, and therefore we must conceive a great 
 dread and detestation of all manner of evil words, cursing, swearing, 
 lying, slandering, brawling, filthiness, and foolish talking, all which 
 come from a <I>froward mouth and perverse lips,</I> that will not be 
 governed either by reason or religion, but contradict both, and which 
 are as unsightly and ill-favoured before God as a crooked distorted 
 mouth drawn awry is before men. All manner of tongue sins, we must, by 
 constant watchfulness and stedfast resolution, <I>put from us,</I> put 
 <I>far from us,</I> abstaining from all words that have an appearance 
 of evil and fearing to learn any such words.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We must make a covenant with our eyes: "Let them <I>look right on 
 and straight before thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 Let the eye be fixed and not wandering; let it not rove after every 
 thing that presents itself, for then it will be diverted form good and 
 ensnared in evil. Turn it from beholding vanity; let thy eye be single 
 and not divided; let thy intentions be sincere and uniform, and look 
 not asquint at any by-end." We must keep our eye upon our Master, and 
 be careful to approve ourselves to him; keep our eye upon our rule, and 
 conform to that; keep our eye upon our mark, the <I>prize of the high 
 calling,</I> and direct all towards that. <I>Oculum in metam</I>--<I>The
 eye upon the goal.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. We must act considerately in all we do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>Ponder the path of thy feet, weigh it</I> (so the word is); "put the
 word of God in one scale, and what thou hast done, or art about to do, 
 in the other, and see how they agree; be nice and critical in examining 
 whether thy way be good before the Lord and whether it will end well." 
 We must consider our past ways and examine what we have done, and our 
 present ways, what we are doing, whither we are going, and <I>see that 
 we walk circumspectly.</I> It concerns us to consider what are the 
 duties and what the difficulties, what are the advantages and what the 
 dangers, of our way, that we may act accordingly. "Do nothing 
 rashly."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. We must act with steadiness, caution, and consistency: "<I>Let all 
 thy ways be established</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>)

 and be not unstable in them, as the double-minded man is; halt not
 between two, but go on in an even uniform course of obedience; <I>turn 
 not to the right hand not to the left,</I> for there are errors on both 
 hands, and Satan gains his point if he prevails to draw us aside either 
 way. Be very careful to <I>remove thy foot from evil;</I> take heed of 
 extremes, for in them there is evil, and <I>let thy eyes look right 
 on,</I> that thou mayest keep the golden mean." Those that would 
 approve themselves wise must always be watchful.</P>
