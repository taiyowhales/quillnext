 In this chapter, 

 I. Christ, the royal bridegroom, goes on to describe the beauties of
 his spouse, the church, in many instances, and to express his love to 
 her and the delight he has in her conversation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. The spouse, the church, expresses her great delight in him, and the
 desire that she had of communion and fellowship with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:10-13">ver. 10-13</A>.
 
 Such mutual esteem and endearment are there between Christ and 
 believers. And what is heaven but an everlasting interchanging of
 loves between the holy God and holy souls!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter!
 the joints of thy thighs <I>are</I> like jewels, the work of the hands
 of a cunning workman.
 &nbsp; 2  Thy navel <I>is like</I> a round goblet, <I>which</I> wanteth not
 liquor: thy belly <I>is like</I> a heap of wheat set about with
 lilies.
 &nbsp; 3  Thy two breasts <I>are</I> like two young roes <I>that are</I> twins.
 &nbsp; 4  Thy neck <I>is</I> as a tower of ivory; thine eyes <I>like</I> the
 fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose <I>is</I> as
 the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.
 &nbsp; 5  Thine head upon thee <I>is</I> like Carmel, and the hair of thine
 head like purple; the king <I>is</I> held in the galleries.
 &nbsp; 6  How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!
 &nbsp; 7  This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to
 clusters <I>of grapes.</I>
 &nbsp; 8  I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of
 the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of
 the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;
 &nbsp; 9  And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved,
 that goeth <I>down</I> sweetly, causing the lips of those that are
 asleep to speak.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The title which Jesus Christ here gives to the church is new: <I>O
 prince's daughter!</I> agreeing with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:13">Ps. xlv. 13</A>,

 where she is called <I>the king's daughter.</I> She is so in respect of
 her new birth, born from above, begotten of God, and his workmanship, 
 bearing the image of the King of kings, and guided by his Spirit. She 
 is so by marriage; Christ, by betrothing her to himself, though he 
 found her mean and despicable, has made her a <I>prince's daughter.</I> 
 She has a princely disposition, something in her truly noble and 
 generous; she is daughter and heir to the prince of the kings of the 
 earth. <I>If children, then heirs.</I> Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A copious description of the beauty of the spouse, which, some 
 think, is given by the virgins her companions, and that those were they 
 who called upon her to return; it seems rather to be given by Christ 
 himself, and to be designed to express his love to her and delight in 
 her, as before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:1">
 <I>ch.</I> iv. 1</A>,

 &c., and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:5,6"><I>ch.</I> vi. 5, 6</A>.

 The similitudes are here different from what they were before, to show
 that the beauty of holiness is such as nothing in nature can reach; you 
 may still say more of it, and yet still come short of it. That 
 commendation of the spouse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:1-16"><I>ch.</I> iv.</A>,

 was immediately upon the espousals 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:11"><I>ch.</I> iii. 11</A>),

 this upon her return from a by-path 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:13"><I>ch.</I> vi. 13</A>);

 yet this exceeds that, to show the constancy of Christ's love to his
 people; <I>he loves them to the end,</I> since he made them <I>precious 
 in his sight and honourable.</I> The spouse had described the beauty of 
 her beloved in ten particulars

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:11"><I>ch.</I> v. 11</A>,

 &c.); and now he describes her in as many, for he will not be
 behindhand with her in respects and endearments. Those that honour
 Christ he will certainly honour, and make honourable. As the prophet,
 in describing the corruptions of degenerate Israel, reckons <I>from the 
 sole of the foot even unto the head</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:6">Isa. i. 6</A>),

 so here the beauties of the church are reckoned from foot to head,
 that, as the apostle speaks, when he is comparing the church, as here, 
 to the natural body

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+12:23">1 Cor. xii. 23</A>),

 <I>more abundant honour</I> might be bestowed on those parts <I>of the
 body which we think to be less honourable,</I> and which therefore 
 <I>lacked honour,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 1. Her <I>feet</I> are here praised; the feet of Christ's ministers are
 beautiful in the eyes of the church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:7">Isa. lii. 7</A>),

 and her feet are here said to be beautiful in the eyes of Christ.
 <I>How beautiful are thy feet with shoes!</I> When believers, being 
 made free from the captivity of sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+12:8">Acts xii. 8</A>),

 <I>stand fast in the liberty with which they are made free,</I>
 preserve the tokens of their enfranchisement, have <I>their feet shod 
 with the preparation of the gospel of peace,</I> and walk steadily 
 according to the rule of the gospel, then their <I>feet are beautiful 
 with shoes;</I> they tread firmly, being well armed against the 
 troubles they meet with in their way. When we rest not in good 
 affections, but they are accompanied with sincere endeavors and 
 resolutions, then our feet are beautified <I>with shoes.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:10">Ezek. xvi. 10</A>.

 2. <I>The joint of the thighs are</I> here said to be <I>like
 jewels,</I> and those curiously wrought by <I>a cunning workman.</I> 
 This is explained by 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:16,Col+2:19">Eph. iv. 16 and Col. ii. 19</A>,

 where the mystical body of Christ is said to be held together by
 <I>joints and bands,</I> as the hips and knees (both which are <I>the 
 joints of the thighs</I>) serve the natural body in its strength and 
 motion. The church is <I>then</I> comely in Christ's eyes when those 
 joints are kept firm by holy love and unity, and the communion of 
 saints. When believers act in religion from good principles, and are 
 steady and regular in their whole conversation, and turn themselves 
 easily to every duty in its time and place, then <I>the joints are like 
 jewels.</I>

 3. The <I>navel</I> is here compared to a round cup or <I>goblet,</I>
 that <I>wants not</I> any of the agreeable <I>liquor</I> that one would 
 wish to find in it, such as David's cup that ran over 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:5">Ps. xxiii. 5</A>),

 well shaped, and not as that miserable infant whose navel was not cut,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:4">Ezek. xvi. 4</A>.

 The fear of the Lord is said to be <I>health to the navel.</I> See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:8">Prov. iii. 8</A>.

 When the soul wants not that fear then the <I>navel wants not
 liquor.</I>

 4. The <I>belly is like a heap of wheat</I> in the store-chamber, which
 perhaps was sometimes, to make show, adorned with flowers. The 
 <I>wheat</I> is useful, the <I>lilies</I> are beautiful; there is every 
 thing in the church which may be to the members of that body either for 
 use or for ornament. All the body is nourished from the <I>belly;</I> 
 it denotes the spiritual prosperity of a believer and the healthful 
 constitution of the soul all in good plight. 

 5. The <I>breasts are like two young roes that are twins,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 By the breasts of the church's consolations those are nourished who are
 born from its belly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+46:3">Isa. xlvi. 3</A>),

 and by the navel received nourishment in the womb. This comparison we
 had before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:5"><I>ch.</I> iv. 5</A>.

 6. The <I>neck,</I> which before was compared to <I>the tower of
 David</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:4"><I>ch.</I> iv. 4</A>),

 is here compared to <I>a tower of ivory,</I> so white, so precious;
 such is the faith of the saints, by which they are joined to Christ 
 their head. The name of the Lord, improved by faith, is to the saints 
 as a strong and impregnable tower. 

 7. The <I>eyes</I> are compared to <I>the fish-pools in Heshbon,</I> or
 the artificial fish-ponds, <I>by a gate,</I> either of Jerusalem or 
 Heshbon, which is called <I>Bath-rabbim,</I> the daughter of a 
 multitude, because a great thoroughfare. The understanding, the 
 intentions of a believer, are clean and clear as these ponds. The eyes, 
 weeping for sin, are as fountains 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:1">Jer. ix. 1</A>),
 
 and comely with Christ.
 
 8. The <I>nose</I> is like <I>the tower of Lebanon,</I> the forehead or
 face set <I>like a flint</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7">Isa. l. 7</A>),

 undaunted as that tower was impregnable. So it denotes the magnanimity
 and holy bravery of the church, or (as others) a spiritual sagacity to 
 discern things that differ, as animals strangely distinguish by the 
 smell. This tower <I>looks towards Damascus,</I> the head city of 
 Syria, denoting the boldness of the church in facing its enemies and 
 not fearing them.

 9. The <I>head like Carmel,</I> a very high hill near the sea,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The head of a believer is <I>lifted up above his enemies</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:6">Ps. xxvii. 6</A>),

 above the storms of the lower region, as the top of Carmel was,
 pointing heaven-ward. The more we get above this world, and the nearer 
 to heaven, and the more secure and serene we become by that means, the 
 more amiable we are in the eyes of the Lord Jesus.

 10. <I>The hair of the head</I> is said to be <I>like purple.</I> This
 denotes the universal amiableness of a believer in the eyes of Christ, 
 even to <I>the hair,</I> or (as some understand it) the pins with which 
 <I>the hair</I> is dressed. Some by <I>the head and the hair</I> 
 understand the governors of the church, who, if they be careful to do 
 their duty, add much to her comeliness. <I>The head like crimson</I> 
 (so some read it) <I>and the hair like purple,</I> the two colours worn 
 by great men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The complacency which Christ takes in his church thus beautified 
 and adorned. She is lovely indeed if she be so in his eyes; as he puts 
 the comeliness upon her, so it is his love that makes this comeliness 
 truly valuable, for he is an unexceptionable judge. 

 1. He delighted to look upon his church, and to converse with it,
 rejoicing in that habitable part of his earth: <I>The king is held in 
 the galleries,</I> and cannot leave them. This is explained by 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:13,14">Ps. cxxxii. 13, 14</A>,

 <I>The Lord has chosen Zion,</I> saying, <I>This is my rest for
 ever;</I> <I>here will I dwell;</I> and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:11">Ps. cxlvii. 11</A>,

 <I>The Lord takes pleasure in those that fear him.</I> And, if Christ
 has such delight <I>in the galleries</I> of communion with his people, 
 much more reason have they to delight in them, and to reckon <I>a day 
 there better than a thousand.</I>

 2. He was even struck with admiration at the beauty of his church 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love!</I> <I>How art thou made
 fair!</I> (so the word is), "not born so, but made so with the 
 comeliness which I have put upon thee." Holiness is a beauty beyond 
 expression; the Lord Jesus is wonderfully pleased with it; the outward 
 aspect of it is fair; the inward disposition of it is pleasant and 
 highly agreeable, and the complacency he has in it is inexpressible.
 <I>O my dearest for delights!</I> so some read.

 3. He determined to keep up communion with his church.

 (1.) To <I>take hold of her</I> as of <I>the boughs of a palm-tree.</I> 
 He compares her <I>stature to a palm-tree</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 so straight, so strong, does she appear, when she is looked upon in her
 full proportion. The <I>palm-tree</I> is observed to flourish most when 
 it is loaded; so the church, the more it has been afflicted, the more 
 it has multiplied; and the branches of it are emblems of victory. 
 Christ says, "<I>I will go up to the palm-tree,</I> to entertain myself 
 with the shadow of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 and <I>I will take hold of its boughs</I> and observe the beauty of
 them." What Christ has said he will do, in favour to his people; we may 
 be sure he will do it, for his kind purposes are never suffered to fall 
 to the ground; and if he <I>take hold of the boughs</I> of his church, 
 take early hold of her branches, when they are young and tender, he 
 will keep his hold and not let them go.

 (2.) To refresh himself with her fruits. He compares her <I>breasts</I> 
 (her pious affections towards him) <I>to clusters of grapes,</I> a most 
 pleasant fruit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 and he repeats it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 They <I>shall be</I> (that is, they shall be to me) <I>as clusters of
 the vine,</I> which <I>make glad the heart.</I> "Now that I come <I>up 
 to the palm-tree</I> thy graces shall be exerted and excited." Christ's 
 presence with his people kindles the holy heavenly fire in their souls, 
 and then their <I>breasts shall be as clusters of the vine,</I> a 
 cordial to themselves and acceptable to him. And since God, at first, 
 <I>breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life,</I> and breathes 
 the breath of the new life still, <I>the smell of</I> their nostrils is 
 <I>like the smell of apples,</I> or oranges, which is pleasing and 
 reviving. <I>The Lord smelt a sweet savour</I> from Noah's sacrifice,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:21">Gen. viii. 21</A>.

 And, <I>lastly, the roof of her mouth is like the best wine</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);
 
 her spiritual taste and relish, or the words she speaks of God and man,
 which come not from the teeth outward, but from <I>the roof of the 
 mouth,</I> these are pleasing to God. <I>The prayer of the upright is 
 his delight.</I> And, when <I>those that fear the Lord speak one to 
 another</I> as becomes them, <I>the Lord hearkens, and hears</I> with 
 pleasure, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:16">Mal. iii. 16</A>.
 
 It is like that wine which is,

 [1.] Very palatable and grateful to the taste. It <I>goes down 
 sweetly;</I> it <I>goes straightly</I> (so the margin reads it); it 
 <I>moves itself aright,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:31">Prov. xxiii. 31</A>.

 The pleasures of sense seem right to the carnal appetite, and go down
 smoothly, but they are often wrong, and, compared with the pleasure of 
 communion with God, they are harsh and rough. Nothing <I>goes down so 
 sweetly</I> with a gracious soul as the wine of God's consolations.

 [2.] It is a great cordial. The presence of Christ by his Spirit with
 him people shall be reviving and refreshing to them, as that strong 
 wine which makes <I>the lips</I> even <I>of those that are asleep</I> 
 (that are ready to faint away in a deliquium), <I>to speak.</I> 
 Unconverted sinners are asleep; saints are often drowsy, and listless, 
 and half asleep; but the word and Spirit of Christ will put life and 
 vigour into the soul, and <I>out of the abundance of the heart</I> that 
 is thus filled<I>the mouth</I> will <I>speak.</I> When the apostles 
 were filled with the Spirit they spoke <I>with tongues the wonderful 
 works of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:10,12">Acts ii. 10, 12</A>);

 and those who in opposition to being <I>drunk with wine, wherein is
 excess,</I> are <I>filled with the Spirit, speak to themselves in 
 psalms and hymns,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:18,19">Eph. v. 18, 19</A>.
 
 When Christ is thus commending the sweetness of his spouse's love,
 excited by the manifestation of his, she seems to put in that word, 
 <I>for my beloved,</I> as in a parenthesis. "Is there any thing in me 
 that is pleasant or valuable? As it is from, so it is for my beloved." 
 <I>Then</I> he delights in our good affections and services, when they 
 are all for him and devoted to his glory.</P>

 &nbsp; 12  Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These are the words of the spouse, the church, the believing soul, in 
 answer to the kind expressions of Christ's love in the foregoing 
 verses.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. She here triumphs in her relation to Christ and her interest in him, 
 and in his name will she boast all the day long. With what a transport 
 of joy and holy exultation does she say 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 "<I>I am my beloved's,</I> not my own, but entirely devoted to him and
 owned by him." If we can truly say that Christ is our <I>best 
 beloved,</I> we may be confident that we are his and he <I>will save 
 us,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:94">Ps. cxix. 94</A>.

 The gracious discoveries of Christ's love to us should engage us
 greatly to rejoice in the hold he has of us, his sovereignty over us 
 and property in us, which is no less a spring of comfort than a bond of 
 duty. Intimacy of communion with Christ should help clear up our 
 interest in him. Glorying in this, that she is his, to serve him, and 
 reckoning that her honour, she comforts herself with this, that his 
 <I>desire is towards her,</I> that is, he is her husband; it is a 
 periphrasis of the conjugal relation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:16">Gen. iii. 16</A>.

 Christ's desire was strongly towards his chosen remnant, when he came
 from heaven to earth to seek and save them; and when, in pursuance of 
 his undertaking, he was even straitened till the baptism of blood he 
 was to pass through for them <I>was accomplished,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:50">Luke xii. 50</A>.

 He desired <I>Zion for a habitation;</I> this is a comfort to believers
 that, whosoever slights them, Christ has a desire towards them, such a 
 desire as will again bring him from heaven to earth to receive them to 
 himself; for he longs to have them all with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:24,Joh+14:3">John xvii. 24; xiv. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. She humbly and earnestly desires communion with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>):
 
 "<I>Come, my beloved,</I> let us take a walk together, that I may
 receive counsel, instruction, and comfort from thee, and may make known 
 my wants and grievances to thee, with freedom, and without 
 interruption." Thus Christ can walk with the two disciples that were 
 going to the village called <I>Emmaus,</I> and talked with them, till 
 he made their <I>hearts burn within them.</I> Observe here, 

 1. Having received fresh tokens of his love, and full assurances of her 
 interest in him, she presses forward towards further acquaintance with 
 him; as blessed Paul, who desired yet more and more of <I>the 
 excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:8">Phil. iii. 8</A>.

 Christ has made it to appear how much his desire is towards us, and we
 are very ungrateful if ours be not towards him. Note, Communion with 
 Christ is that which all that are sanctified earnestly breathe after; 
 and the clearer discoveries he makes to them of his love the more 
 earnestly do they desire it. Sensual pleasures pall the carnal 
 appetite, and soon give it surfeit, but spiritual delights whet the 
 desires, the language of which is, <I>Nothing more than God,</I> but 
 still <I>more and more of him.</I> Christ had said, <I>I will go up to 
 the palm-tree.</I> Come, saith she, <I>Let us go.</I> The promises 
 Christ has made us of communion with him are not to supersede, but 
 quicken and encourage, our prayers for that communion.

 2. She desires to go forth into the fields and villages to have this
 communion with him. Those that would converse with Christ must go forth 
 from the world and the amusements of it, must avoid every thing that 
 would divert the mind and be a hindrance to it when it should be wholly 
 taken up with Christ; we must contrive how to <I>attend upon the Lord 
 without distraction</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:35">1 Cor. vii. 35</A>),

 for therefore the spouse here covets to get out of the noise of the
 town. <I>Let us go forth to him without the camp,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+14:13">Heb. xiv. 13</A>.

 Solitude and retirement befriend communion with God; therefore <I>Isaac
 went out into the field to meditate</I> and pray. <I>Enter into thy 
 closet, and shut thy door.</I> A believer is never less alone than when 
 alone with Christ, where no eye sees.

 3. Having business to go abroad, to look after their grounds, she
 desires the company of her beloved. Note, Wherever we are, we may keep 
 up our communion with God, if it be not our own fault, for he is always 
 at our right hand, his eye always upon us, and both his word and his 
 ear always nigh us. By going about our worldly affairs with heavenly 
 holy hearts, mixing pious thoughts with common actions, and having our 
 eyes ever towards the Lord, we may take Christ along with us 
 whithersoever we go. Nor should we go any whither where we cannot in 
 faith ask him to go along with us. 

 4. She is willing to rise betimes, to go along with her beloved: <I>Let
 us get up early to the vineyards.</I> It intimates her care to improve 
 opportunities of conversing with her beloved; when the time appointed 
 has come, we must lose no time, but, as the woman 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+16:2">Mark xvi. 2</A>),

 <I>go very early,</I> though it be to a <I>sepulchre,</I> if we be in
 hopes to meet him there. Those that will go abroad with Christ must 
 begin betimes with him, early in the morning of their days, must begin 
 every day with him, seek him early, seek him diligently.

 5. She will be content to take up her lodging in the villages, the huts
 or cottages which the country people built for their shelter when they 
 attended their business in the fields; there, in these mean and cold 
 dwellings, she will gladly reside, if she may but have her beloved with 
 her. His presence will make them fine and pleasant, and convert them 
 into palaces. A gracious soul can reconcile itself to the poorest 
 accommodations, if it may have communion with God in them. 

 6. The most pleasant delightful fields, even in the spring-time, when
 the country is most pleasant, will not satisfy her, unless she have her 
 beloved with her. No delights on earth can make a believer easy, unless 
 he enjoy God in all.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. She desires to be better acquainted with the state of her own soul 
 and the present posture of its affairs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Let us see if the vine flourish.</I> Our own souls are our
 vineyards; they are, or should be, planted with vines and pomegranates, 
 choice and useful trees. We are made keepers of these vineyards, and 
 therefore are concerned often to look into them, to examine the state 
 of our own souls, to seek whether the <I>vine flourishes,</I> whether 
 our graces be in act and exercise, whether we be fruitful in the fruits 
 of righteousness, and whether our fruit abound. And especially let us 
 enquire whether <I>the tender grape appear</I> and whether <I>the 
 pomegranates bud forth,</I> what good motions and dispositions there 
 are in us that are yet but young and tender, that they may be protected 
 and cherished with a particular care, and may not be nipped, or 
 blasted, or rubbed off, but cultivated, that they may bring forth fruit 
 unto perfection. In this enquiry into our own spiritual state, it will 
 be good to take Christ along with us, because his presence will make 
 the <I>vine flourish</I> and the <I>tender grape appear,</I> as the 
 returning sun revives the gardens, and because to him we are concerned 
 to approve ourselves. If he sees the <I>vine flourish,</I> and the 
 <I>tender grape appear</I>--if we can appeal to him, <I>Thou knowest 
 all things, thou knowest that I love thee,</I>--if his Spirit witness 
 with our spirit that our souls prosper, it is enough. And, if we would 
 be acquainted with ourselves, we must beg of him to search and try us, 
 to help us in the search, and discover us to ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. She promises to her beloved the best entertainment she can give him 
 at her country seat; for he will come in to us, and sup with us, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:20">Rev. iii. 20</A>.

 1. She promises him her best affections; and, whatever else she had for 
 him, it would utterly be contemned if her heart were not entire for 
 him: "<I>There</I> therefore <I>will I give thee my love;</I> I will 
 repeat the professions of it, honour thee with the tokens of it; and 
 the out-goings of my soul towards thee in adorations and desires shall 
 be quickened and enlarged, and my heart offered up to thee in a holy 
 fire." 

 2. She promises him her best provision, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 "There we shall find pleasant odours, for <I>the mandrakes give a
 smell;</I>" the <I>love-flowers</I> or <I>lovely ones</I> (so the word 
 signifies), or the <I>love-fruits;</I> it was something that was in all 
 respects very grateful, so valuable that Rachel and Leah had like to 
 have fallen out above it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+30:14">Gen. xxx. 14</A>.

 "We shall also find that which is good for food, as well as pleasant to
 the eye, all the rarities that the country affords: <I>At our gates are 
 all manner of pleasant fruits.</I>" Note,

 (1.) The fruits and exercises of grace are pleasant to the Lord Jesus.
 
 (2.) These must be carefully laid up for him, devoted to his service
 and honour, must be always ready to us when we have occasion for them, 
 as that which is laid up at our gates, that, by our bringing forth much 
 fruit, he may be glorified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:18">John xv. 18</A>.

 (3.) There is a great variety of these pleasant fruits, with which our 
 souls should be well stocked; we must have all sorts of them, grace for 
 all occasions, <I>new and old,</I> as the good householder has in his 
 treasury, not only the products of this year, but remainders of the 
 last, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:52">Matt. xiii. 52</A>.

 We must not only have that ready to us, for the service of Christ,
 which we have heard, and learned, and experienced lately, but must 
 retain that which we have formerly gathered; nor must we content 
 ourselves only with what we have laid up in store in the days of old, 
 but, as long as we live, must be still adding something new to it, that 
 our stock may increase, and we may be <I>thoroughly furnished for every 
 good work.</I>

 (4.) Those that truly love Christ will think all they have, even their 
 most <I>pleasant fruits,</I> and what they have treasured up most 
 carefully, too little to be bestowed upon him, and he is welcome to it 
 all; if it were more and better, it should be at his service. It is all 
 from him, and therefore it is fit it should be all for him.</P>
