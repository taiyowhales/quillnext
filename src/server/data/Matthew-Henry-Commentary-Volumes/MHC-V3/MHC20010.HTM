 Hitherto we have been in the porch or preface to the proverbs, here 
 they begin. They are short but weighty sentences; most of them are 
 distichs, two sentences in one verse, illustrating each other; but it 
 is seldom that there is any coherence between the verses, much less any 
 thread of discourse, and therefore in these chapters we need not 
 attempt to reduce the contents to their proper heads, the several 
 sentences will appear best in their own places. The scope of them all 
 is to set before us good and evil, the blessing and the curse. Many of 
 the proverbs in this chapter relate to the good government of the 
 tongue, without which men's religion is vain.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but
 a foolish son <I>is</I> the heaviness of his mother.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon, speaking to us as unto children, observes here how much the 
 comfort of parents, natural, political, and ecclesiastical, depends 
 upon the good behaviour of those under their charge, as a reason, 

 1. Why parents should be careful to give their children a good
 education, and to train them up in the ways of religion, which, if it 
 obtain the desired effect, they themselves will have the comfort of it, 
 or, if not, they will have for their support under their heaviness that 
 they have done their duty, have done their endeavour. 

 2. Why children should conduct themselves wisely and well, and live up 
 to their good education, that they may gladden the hearts of their 
 parents, and not sadden them. Observe,

 (1.) It adds to the comfort of young people that are pious and discreet 
 that thereby they do something towards recompensing their parents for 
 all the care and pains they have taken with them, and occasion pleasure 
 to them in the evil days of old age, when they most need it; and it is 
 the duty of parents to rejoice in their children's wisdom and 
 well-doing, yea, though it arrive at such an eminency as to eclipse 
 them. 

 (2.) It adds to the guilt of those that conduct themselves ill that 
 thereby they grieve those whom they ought to be a joy to, and are a 
 heaviness particularly to their poor mothers who bore them with sorrow, 
 but with greater sorrow see them wicked and vile.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness
 delivereth from death.
 &nbsp; 3  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish:
 but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These two verses speak to the same purport, and the latter may be the
 reason of the former. 

 1. That wealth which men get unjustly will do them no good, because God
 will blast it: <I>Treasures of wickedness profit nothing,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The treasures of wicked people, much more the treasure which they have 
 made themselves masters of by any wicked people, by oppression of 
 fraud, though it be ever so much, as a treasure, and laid up ever so 
 safely, though it be hidden treasure, yet it <I>profits nothing;</I> 
 when profit and loss come to be balanced the profit gained by the 
 treasures will by no means countervail the loss sustained by the 
 wickedness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:26">Matt. xvi. 26</A>.

 They do not profit the soul; they will not purchase any true comfort or 
 happiness. They will stand a man in no stead at death, or in the 
 judgment of the great day; and the reason is because God <I>casts away 
 the substance of the wicked</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 he takes that from them which they have unjustly gotten; he rejects the
 consideration of it, not regarding the rich more than the poor. We 
 often see that scattered by the justice of God which has been gathered 
 together by the injustice of men. How can the treasures of wickedness 
 profit, when, though it be counted substance, God casts it away and it 
 vanishes as a shadow? 

 2. That which is honestly got will turn to a good account, for God
 will bless it. <I>Righteousness delivers from death,</I> that is, 
 wealth gained, and kept, and used, in a right manner (righteousness 
 signifies both honesty and charity); it answers the end of wealth, 
 which is to keep us alive and be a defence to us. It will deliver from 
 those judgments which men bring upon themselves by their wickedness. It 
 will profit to such a degree as to deliver, though not from the stroke 
 of death, yet from the sting of it, and consequently from the terror of 
 it. For <I>the Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to 
 famish</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 and so their <I>righteousness delivers from death,</I> purely by the
 favour of God to them, which is their life and livelihood, and which 
 will keep them alive in famine. The soul of the righteous shall be kept 
 alive by the word of God, and faith in his promise, when <I>young lions 
 shall lack and suffer hunger.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  He becometh poor that dealeth <I>with</I> a slack hand: but the
 hand of the diligent maketh rich.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told, 

 1. Who those are who, though rich, are in a fair way to <I>become
 poor</I>--those <I>who deal with a slack hand,</I> who are careless and 
 remiss in their business, and never mind which end goes foremost, nor 
 ever set their hands vigorously to their work or stick to it; those 
 <I>who deal with a deceitful hand</I> (so it may be read); those who 
 think to enrich themselves by fraud and tricking will, in the end, 
 impoverish themselves, not only by bringing the curse of God on what 
 they have, but by forfeiting their reputation with men; none will care 
 to deal with those who deal with sleight of hand and are honest only 
 with good looking to. 

 2. Who those are who, though poor, are in a fair way to become 
 rich--those who are diligent and honest, who are careful about their 
 affairs, and, what their hands find to do, do it with all their might, 
 in a fair and honourable way, those are likely to increase what they 
 have. <I>The hand of the acute</I> (so some), of those who are sharp, 
 but not sharpers; <I>the hand of the active</I> (so others); the 
 stirring hand gets a penny. This is true in the affairs of our souls as 
 well as in our worldly affairs; slothfulness and hypocrisy lead to 
 spiritual poverty, but those who are <I>fervent in spirit, serving the 
 Lord,</I> are likely to be <I>rich in faith</I> and <I>rich in good 
 works.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  He that gathereth in summer <I>is</I> a wise son: <I>but</I> he that
 sleepeth in harvest <I>is</I> a son that causeth shame.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The just praise of those who improve their opportunities, who take
 pains to gather and increase what they have, both for soul and body, 
 who provide for hereafter while provision is to be made, who <I>gather 
 in summer,</I> which is gathering time. He who does so <I>is a wise 
 son,</I> and it is his honour; he acts wisely for his parents, whom, if 
 there be occasion, he ought to maintain, and he gives reputation to 
 himself, his family, and his education. 

 2. The just reproach and blame of those who trifle away these 
 opportunities: <I>He who sleeps,</I> loves his ease, idles away his 
 time, and neglects his work, especially <I>who sleeps in harvest,</I> 
 when he should be laying in for winter, who lets slip the season of 
 furnishing himself with that which he will have occasion for, <I>is a 
 son that causes shame;</I> for he is a foolish son; he prepares shame 
 for himself when winter comes, and reflects shame upon all his friends. 
 He who gets knowledge and wisdom in the days of his youth <I>gathers in 
 summer,</I> and he will have the comfort and credit of his industry; 
 but he who idles away the days of his youth will bear the shame of his 
 indolence when he is old.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Blessings <I>are</I> upon the head of the just: but violence
 covereth the mouth of the wicked.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. <I>The head of the just</I> crowned with <I>blessings,</I> with the
 blessings both of God and man. Variety of blessings, abundance of 
 blessings, shall descend from above, and visibly abide on the head of 
 good men, real blessings; they shall not only be spoken well of, but 
 done well to. Blessings shall be on their head as a coronet to adorn 
 and dignify them and as a helmet to protect and secure them. 

 2. <I>The mouth of the wicked covered</I> with <I>violence.</I> Their 
 mouths shall be stopped with shame for the violence which they have 
 done; they shall not have a word to say in excuse for themselves

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:16">Job v. 16</A>);

 their breath shall be stopped with the violence that shall be done to 
 them, when their violent dealings shall return on their heads, shall be 
 returned to their teeth.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  The memory of the just <I>is</I> blessed: but the name of the
 wicked shall rot.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Both the just and the wicked, when their days are fulfilled, must die. 
 Between their bodies in the grave thee is no visible difference; 
 between the souls of the one and the other, in the world of spirits, 
 thee is a vast difference, and so there is, or ought to be, between 
 their memories, which survive them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Good men are and ought to be well spoken of when they are gone; it 
 is one of the blessings that <I>comes upon the head of the just,</I> 
 even when their head is laid. Blessed men leave behind them blessed 
 memories. 

 1. It is part of the dignity of the saints, especially those who excel
 in virtue and are eminently useful, that they are remembered with 
 respect when they are dead. Their good name, their name with good men, 
 for good things, is then in a special manner as <I>precious 
 ointment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:1">Eccl. vii. 1</A>.
 
 Those that honour God he will thus honour,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:3,6,9">Ps. cxii. 3, 6, 9</A>.

 <I>The elders</I> by faith <I>obtained a good report</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+11:2">Heb. xi. 2</A>),
 
 and, being dead, are yet spoken of. 

 2. It is part of the duty of the survivors: <I>Let the memory of the 
 just be blessed,</I> so the Jews read it, and observe it as a precept, 
 not naming an eminently just man that is dead without adding, <I>Let 
 his memory be blessed.</I> We must delight in making an honourable 
 mention of good men that are gone, bless God for them, and for his 
 gifts and graces that appeared in them, and especially be followers of 
 them in <I>that which is good.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Bad men are and shall be forgotten, or spoken of with contempt. 
 When their bodies are putrefying in the grave their <I>names</I> also 
 <I>shall rot.</I> Either they shall not be preserved at all, but buried 
 in oblivion (no good can be said of them, and therefore the greatest 
 kindness that can be done them will be to say nothing of them), or they 
 shall be loathsome, and mentioned with detestation, and that rule of 
 honour, <I>De mortuis nil nisi bonum</I>--<I>Say nothing to the
 disadvantage of the dead,</I> will not protect them. Where the 
 wickedness has been notorious, and cannot but be mentioned, it ought to 
 be mentioned with abhorrence.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating
 fool shall fall.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The honour and happiness of the obedient. They <I>will receive
 commandments;</I> they will take it as a privilege, and really an ease 
 to them, to be under government, which saves them the labour of 
 deliberating and choosing for themselves; and they will take it as a 
 favour to be told their duty and admonished concerning it. And this is 
 their wisdom; those are <I>wise in heart</I> who are tractable, and 
 those who thus bend, thus stoop, shall stand and be established, shall 
 prosper, being well advised. 

 2. The shame and ruin of the disobedient, that will not be governed, 
 nor endure any yoke, that will not be taught, nor take any advice. They 
 are fools, for they act against themselves and their own interest; they 
 are commonly <I>prating fools,</I> fools of lips, full of talk, but 
 full of nonsense, boasting of themselves, prating spitefully against 
 those that admonish them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:10">3 John 10</A>),

 and pretending to give counsel and law to others. Of all fools, none 
 more troublesome than the <I>prating fools,</I> nor that more expose 
 themselves; but they <I>shall fall</I> into sin, into hell, because 
 they received not commandments. Those that are full of tongue seldom 
 look well to their feet, and therefore stumble and fall.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr10_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that
 perverteth his ways shall be known.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here told, and we may depend upon it, 

 1. That men's integrity will be their security: <I>He that walks
 uprightly</I> towards God and man, that is faithful to both, that 
 designs as he ought and means as he says, <I>walks surely;</I> he is 
 safe under a divine protection and easy in a holy security. He goes on 
 his way with a humble boldness, being well armed against the 
 temptations of Satan, the troubles of the world, and the reproaches of 
 men. He knows what ground he stands on, what guide he follows, what
 guard he is surrounded with, and what glory he is going to, and 
 therefore proceeds with assurance and <I>great peace,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:17,33:15,16">Isa. xxxii. 17; xxxiii. 15, 16</A>.

 Some understand it as part of the character of an upright man, that he 
 <I>walks surely,</I> in opposition to walking at all adventures. He 
 will not dare to do that which he is not fully satisfied in his own 
 conscience concerning the lawfulness of, but will see his way clear in 
 every thing. 

 2. That men's dishonesty will be their shame: <I>He that perverts his 
 way,</I> that turns aside into crooked paths, that dissembles with God 
 and man, looks one way and rows another, though he may for a time 
 disguise himself, and pass current, <I>shall be known</I> to be what he 
 is. It is a thousand to one but some time or other he betrays himself; 
 at least, God will discover him in the great day. <I>He that perverts 
 his ways documento erit</I>--<I>shall be made an example of,</I> for 
 warning to others; so some.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr10_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating
 fool shall fall.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Mischief is here said to attend, 

 1. Politic, designing, self-disguising sinners: <I>He that winks with
 the eye,</I> as if he took no notice of you, when at the same time he 
 is watching an opportunity to do you an ill turn, that makes signs to 
 his accomplices when to come into assist him in executing his wicked 
 projects, which are all carried on by trick and artifice, <I>causes 
 sorrow</I> both to others and to himself. Ingenuity will be no excuse
 for iniquity, but the sinner must either repent or do worse, either rue 
 it or be ruined by it. 

 2. Public, silly, self-exposing sinners: A <I>prating fool,</I> whose 
 sins go before unto judgment, <I>shall fall,</I> as was said before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 But his case is less dangerous of the two, and, though he destroys 
 himself, he does not create so much sorrow to others as <I>he that 
 winks with his eyes.</I> The dog that bites is not always the dog that 
 barks.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr10_11"> </A>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  The mouth of a righteous <I>man is</I> a well of life: but
 violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. How industrious a good man is, by communicating his goodness, to do
 good with it: <I>His mouth,</I> the outlet of his mind, <I>is a well of 
 life;</I> it is a constant spring, whence issues good discourse for the 
 edification of others, like streams that water the ground and make it 
 fruitful, and for their consolation, like streams that quench the 
 thirst of the weary traveller. It is like <I>a well of life,</I> that 
 is pure and clean, not only not poisoned, but not muddled, with any 
 corrupt communication. 

 2. How industrious a bad man is, by concealing his badness, to do hurt 
 with it: <I>The mouth of the wicked covers violence,</I> disguises the 
 designed mischief with professions of friendship, that it may be 
 carried on the more securely and effectually, as Joab kissed and 
 killed, Judas kissed and betrayed; this is his sin, to which the 
 punishment answers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Violence covers the mouth of the wicked;</I> what he got by violence 
 shall by violence be taken from him,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The great mischief-maker, and that is malice. Even where there is no
 manifest occasion of strife, yet <I>hatred</I> seeks occasion and so 
 <I>stirs it up</I> and does the devil's work. Those are the most 
 spiteful ill-natured people that can be who take a pleasure in setting 
 their neighbours together by the ears, by tale-bearing, evil surmises, 
 and misrepresentations, blowing up the sparks of contention, which had 
 lain buried, into a flame, at which, with an unaccountable pleasure, 
 they warm their hands. 

 2. The great peace-maker, and that is <I>love,</I> which <I>covers all 
 sins,</I> that is, the offences among relations which occasion discord. 
 Love, instead of proclaiming and aggravating the offence, conceals and 
 extenuates it as far as it is capable of being concealed and 
 extenuated. Love will excuse the offence which we give through mistake 
 and unadvisedly; when we are able to say that there was no ill 
 intended, but it was an oversight, and we love our friend 
 notwithstanding, this covers it. It will also overlook the offence that 
 is given us, and so cover it, and make the best of it: by this means 
 strife is prevented, or, if begun, peace is recovered and restored 
 quickly. The apostle quotes this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:8">1 Pet. iv. 8</A>.

 <I>Love will cover a multitude of sins.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found:
 but a rod <I>is</I> for the back of him that is void of understanding.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. Wisdom and grace are the honour of good men: He <I>that has
 understanding,</I> that good understanding which those have that do the 
 commandments, <I>wisdom is found in his lips,</I> that is, it is 
 discovered to be there, and consequently that he has within a good 
 treasure of it, and it is derived thence for the benefit of others. It 
 is a man's honour to have wisdom, but much more to be instrumental to 
 make others wise. 

 2. Folly and sin are the shame of bad men: <I>A rod is for the back of 
 him that is void of understanding--of him that wants a heart;</I> he 
 exposes himself to the lashes of his own conscience, to the scourges of 
 the tongue, to the censures of the magistrate, and to the righteous 
 judgments of God. Those that foolishly and wilfully go on in wicked 
 ways are preparing rods for themselves, the marks of which will be 
 their perpetual disgrace.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr10_14"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  Wise <I>men</I> lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish
 <I>is</I> near destruction.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. It is the wisdom of the wise that they treasure up a stock of useful
 knowledge, which will be their preservation: <I>Wisdom is</I> therefore 
 <I>found in their lips</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 because it is laid up in their hearts, out of which store, like the
 good householder, they bring things new and old. Whatever knowledge may 
 be at any time useful to us we must <I>lay it up,</I> because we know 
 not but some time or other we may have occasion for it. We must 
 continue laying up as long as we live; and be sure to lay it up safely, 
 that it may not be to seek when we want it. 

 2. It is the folly of fools that they lay up mischief in their hearts, 
 which is ready to them in all they say, and works terror and 
 destruction both to others and to themselves. They <I>love devouring 
 words</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:4">Ps. lii. 4</A>),

 and these come uppermost. Their <I>mouth is near destruction,</I> 
 having the <I>sharp arrows of bitter words</I> always at hand to throw 
 about.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  The rich man's wealth <I>is</I> his strong city: the destruction
 of the poor <I>is</I> their poverty.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This may be taken two ways:--

 1. As a reason why we should be diligent in our business, that we may 
 avoid that sinking dispiriting uneasiness which attends poverty, and 
 may enjoy the benefit and comfort which those have that are beforehand 
 in the world. Taking pains is really the way to make ourselves and our 
 families easy. Or, rather, 

 2. As a representation of the common mistakes both of rich and poor, 
 concerning their outward condition.

 (1.) Rich people think themselves happy because they are rich; but it
 is their mistake: <I>The rich man's wealth is,</I> in his own conceit, 
 <I>his strong city,</I> whereas the worst of evils it is too weak and 
 utterly insufficient to protect them from. It will prove that they are 
 not so safe as they imagine; nay, their wealth may perhaps expose them. 
 
 (2.) Poor people think themselves undone because they are poor; but it 
 is their mistake: <I>The destruction of the poor is their poverty;</I> 
 it sinks their spirits, and ruins all their comforts; whereas a man may 
 live very comfortably, though he has but a little to live on, if he be 
 but content, and keep a good conscience, and live by faith.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  The labour of the righteous <I>tendeth</I> to life: the fruit of
 the wicked to sin.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon here confirms what his father had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:16">Ps. xxxvii. 16</A>),

 <I>A little that a righteous man has is better than the riches of many 
 wicked.</I> 

 1. Perhaps a righteous man has no more than what he works hard for; he
 eats only <I>the labour of his hands,</I> but that <I>labour tends to 
 life;</I> he aims at nothing but to get an honest livelihood, covets 
 not to be rich and great, but is willing to live and maintain his 
 family. Nor does it tend only to his own life, but he would enable 
 himself to do good to others; he labours <I>that he may have to 
 give</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:28">Eph. iv. 28</A>);

 all his business turns to some good account or other. Or it may be 
 meant of his labour in religion; he takes most pains in that which has 
 a tendency to eternal life; he <I>sows to the Spirit,</I> that he may 
 <I>reap life everlasting.</I> 

 2. Perhaps a wicked man's wealth is fruit which he did not labour for,
 but came easily by, but it tends <I>to sin.</I> He makes it the food 
 and fuel of his lusts, his pride and luxury; he gets hurt with it and 
 not good; he gets hurt by it and is hardened by it in his wicked ways. 
 The things of this world are good or evil, life or death, as they are 
 used, and as those are that have them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  He <I>is in</I> the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he
 that refuseth reproof erreth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. That those are in the right that do not only receive instruction,
 but retain it, that do not let it slip through carelessness, as most 
 do, nor let it go to those that would rob them of it, that <I>keep 
 instruction</I> safely, keep it pure and entire, keep it for their own 
 use, that they may govern themselves by it, keep it for the benefit of 
 others, that they may instruct them; those that do so are <I>in the way 
 of life,</I> the way that has true comfort in it and eternal life at 
 the end of it. 

 2. That those are in the wrong that do not only not receive 
 instruction, but wilfully and obstinately refuse it when it is offered 
 them. They will not be taught their duty because it discovers their 
 faults to them; that instruction which carries reproof in it they have 
 a particular aversion to, and certainly they err; it is a sign that 
 they err in judgment, and have false notions of good and evil; it is a 
 cause of their erring in conversation. The traveller that has missed 
 his way, and cannot bear to be told of it and shown the right way, must 
 needs err still, err endlessly; he certainly misses <I>the way of 
 life.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, Malice is folly and wickedness. 

 1. It is so when it is concealed by flattery and dissimulation: He
 <I>is a fool,</I> though he may think himself a politician, <I>that 
 hides hatred with lying lips,</I> lest, if it break out, he should be 
 ashamed before men and should lose the opportunity of gratifying his 
 malice. <I>Lying lips</I> are bad enough of themselves, but have a 
 peculiar malignity in them when they are made <I>a cloak of 
 maliciousness.</I> But he <I>is a fool</I> who thinks to hide any thing 
 from God. 

 2. It is no better when it is vented in spiteful and mischievous 
 language: <I>He that utters slander is a fool</I> too, for God will 
 sooner or later bring forth that righteousness as the light which he 
 endeavours to cloud, and will find an expedient to roll the reproach

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here admonished concerning the government of the tongue, that 
 necessary duty of a Christian. 

 1. It is good to say little, because <I>in the multitude of words there
 wanteth not sin,</I> or <I>sin doth not cease.</I> Usually, those that 
 speak much speak much amiss, and among many words there cannot but be 
 many idle words, which they must shortly give an account of. Those that 
 love to hear themselves talk do not consider what work they are making 
 for repentance; for that will be wanted, and first or last will be had, 
 where <I>there wanteth not sin.</I> 

 2. It is therefore good to <I>keep our mouth as with a bridle: He that 
 refrains his lips,</I> that often checks himself, suppresses what he 
 has thought, and holds in that which would transpire, is a wise man; it 
 is an evidence of his wisdom, and he therein consults his own peace.

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  The tongue of the just <I>is as</I> choice silver: the heart of
 the wicked <I>is</I> little worth.
 &nbsp; 21  The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want
 of wisdom.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here taught how to value men, not by their wealth and preferment 
 in the world, but by their virtue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Good men are good for something. Though they may be poor and low in 
 the world, and may not have power and riches to do good with, yet, as 
 long as they have a mouth to speak, that will make them valuable and 
 useful, and upon that account we must honour those that fear the Lord, 
 because <I>out of the good treasure of their heart they bring forth 
 good things.</I> 

 1. This makes them valuable: <I>The tongue of the just is as choice
 silver;</I> they are sincere, freed from the dross of guile and evil 
 design. God's words are compared to <I>silver purified</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:6">Ps. xii. 6</A>),

 for they may be relied on; and such are the words of just men. They are 
 of weight and worth, and will enrich those that hear them with wisdom, 
 which is better than <I>choice silver.</I> 

 2. It makes them useful: <I>The lips of the righteous feed many;</I> 
 for they are full of the word of God, which is the bread of life, and 
 that sound doctrine wherewith souls are nourished up. Pious discourse 
 is spiritual food to the needy, to the hungry.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Bad men are good for nothing. 

 1. One can get no good by them: <I>The heart of the wicked is little
 worth,</I> and therefore that which comes out of the abundance of his 
 heart cannot be worth much. His principles, his notions, his thoughts, 
 his purposes, and all the things that fill him, and affect him, are 
 worldly and carnal, and therefore of no value. <I>He that is of the 
 earth speaks of the earth,</I> and neither understands nor relishes the 
 things of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:31,1Co+2:14">John iii. 31; 1 Cor. ii. 14</A>.

 The wicked man pretends that, though he does not talk of religion as 
 the just do, yet he has it within him, and thanks God that his heart is 
 good; but he that searches the heart here says the contrary: <I>It is 
 nothing worth.</I> 

 2. One can do no good to them. While many are fed by <I>the lips of the 
 righteous, fools die for want of wisdom;</I> and fools indeed they are 
 to die for want of that which they might so easily come by. <I>Fools 
 die for want of a heart</I> (so the word is); they perish for want of 
 consideration and resolution; they have no heart to do any thing for 
 their own good. While the righteous feed others fools starve
 themselves.</P>

 sorrow with it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Worldly wealth is that which most men have their hearts very much upon, 
 but they generally mistake both in the nature of the thing they desire 
 and in the way by which they hope to obtain it; we are therefore told 
 here, 

 1. What that wealth is which is indeed desirable, not having abundance
 only, but having it and <I>no sorrow with it,</I> no disquieting care 
 to get and keep it, no vexation of spirit in the enjoyment of it, no 
 tormenting grief for the loss of it, no guilt contracted by the abuse 
 of it--to have it and to have a heart to take the comfort of it, to do 
 good with it and to serve God with joyfulness and gladness of heart in 
 the use of it. 

 2. Whence this desirable wealth is to be expected, not by making 
 ourselves drudges to the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:2">Ps. cxxvii. 2</A>),

 but by <I>the blessing of God.</I> It is this that <I>makes rich and 
 adds no sorrow;</I> what comes from the love of God has the grace of 
 God for its companion, to preserve the soul from those turbulent lusts 
 and passions of which, otherwise, the increase of riches if commonly 
 the incentive. He had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>The hand of the diligent makes rich,</I> as a means; but here he
 ascribes it to <I>the blessing of the Lord;</I> but that blessing is 
 upon <I>the hand of the diligent.</I> It is thus in spiritual riches. 
 Diligence in getting them is our duty, but God's blessing and grace 
 must have all the glory of that which is acquired,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. Sin exceedingly sinful: <I>It is as laughter to a fool to do
 mischief;</I> it is as natural to him, and as pleasant, as it is to a 
 man to laugh. <I>Wickedness is his Isaac</I> (that is the word here); 
 it is his delight, his darling, and that in which he pleases himself.
 He makes a laughing matter of sin. When he is warned not to sin, from 
 the consideration of the law of God and the revelation of his wrath 
 against sin, he makes a jest of the admonition, and laughs at the 
 shaking of the spear; when he has sinned, instead of sorrowing for it, 
 he boasts of it, ridicules reproofs, and laughs away the convictions of 
 his own conscience,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+14:9"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 9</A>.

 2. Wisdom exceedingly wise, for it carries along with it the evidence
 of its own excellency; it may be predicated of itself, and this is 
 encomium enough; you need say no more in praise of <I>a man of 
 understanding</I> than this, "He is an <I>understanding man;</I> he 
 <I>has wisdom;</I> he is so wise as not to do mischief, or if he has, 
 through oversight, offended, he is so wise as not to make a jest of 
 it." Or, to pronounce wisdom wise indeed, read it thus: <I>As it is a 
 sport to a fool to do mischief, so it is to a man of understanding to 
 have wisdom and to show it.</I> Besides the future recompence, a good 
 man has as much present pleasure in the restraints and exercises of 
 religion as sinners can pretend to in the liberties and enjoyments of 
 sin, and much more, and much better.</P>

 I. It shall be as ill with the wicked as they can fear, and as well 
 with the righteous as they can desire. 

 1. The wicked, it is true, buoy themselves up sometimes in their
 wickedness with vain hopes which will deceive them, but at other times 
 they cannot but be haunted with just fears, and those <I>fears shall 
 come upon them;</I> the God they provoke will be every whit as terrible 
 as they, when they are under their greatest damps, apprehend him to be. 
 <I>As is thy fear, so is thy wrath,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:11">Ps. xc. 11</A>.

 Wicked men fear the punishment of sin, but they have not wisdom to 
 improve their fears by making their escape, and so the thing they 
 feared comes upon them, and their present terrors are earnests of their 
 future torments. 

 2. The righteous, it is true, sometimes have their fears, but their 
 desire is towards the favour of God and a happiness in him, and that 
 <I>desire shall be granted.</I> According to their faith, not according 
 to their fear, it shall be <I>unto them,</I>

 <I>The righteous,</I> on the contrary, make no show; they lie hid, like 
 a <I>foundation,</I> which is low and out of sight, but they are fixed 
 in their resolution to cleave to God, established in virtue, and they 
 shall be an <I>everlasting foundation,</I> immovably good. He that is

 Observe, 

 1. Those that are of a slothful disposition, that love their ease and
 cannot apply their minds to any business, are not fit to be employed, 
 no, not so much as to be sent on an errand, for they will neither 
 deliver a message with any care nor make any haste back. Such therefore 
 are very unmeet to be ministers, Christ's messengers; he will not own 
 the sending forth of sluggards into his harvest.

 vexation with them. A slothful servant is to his master as uneasy and 
 troublesome as <I>vinegar to the teeth</I> and <I>smoke to the

 Observe,

 secure him from many things that would prejudice his life, and secure 
 to him life enough in this world and eternal life in the other; <I>the

 them endlessly, will prolong them to the days of eternity. <I>What man 
 is he that would see good days?</I> Let him be religious, and then his 
 days shall not only be many, but happy, very happy as well as very 
 many, for <I>the hope of the righteous shall be gladness;</I> they 
 shall have what they hope for, to their unspeakable satisfaction. It is 
 something future and unseen that they place their happiness in

 not what they have in hand, but what they have in hope, and their hope 
 will shortly be swallowed up in fruition, and it will be their 
 everlasting <I>gladness. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</I>

 years of the wicked,</I> that are spent in the pleasures of sin and the 
 drudgery of the world, <I>shall be shortened.</I> Cut down the trees 
 that cumber the ground. And whatever comfort or happiness a wicked man

 These two verses are to the same purport with those next before, 
 intimating the happiness of the godly and the misery of the wicked; it 
 is necessary that this be inculcated upon us, so loth are we to believe 
 and consider it. 

 1. Strength and stability are entailed upon integrity: <I>The way of
 the Lord</I> (the providence of God, the way in which he walks towards 
 us) <I>is strength to the upright,</I> confirms him in his uprightness. 
 All God's dealings with him, merciful and afflictive, serve to quicken 
 him to his duty and animate him against his discouragements. Or <I>the 
 way of the Lord</I> (the way of godliness, in which he appoints us to 
 walk) is <I>strength to the upright;</I> the closer we keep to that 
 way, the more our hearts are enlarged to proceed in it, the better 
 fitted we are both for services and sufferings. A good conscience, kept 
 pure from sin, gives a man boldness in a dangerous time, and constant 
 diligence in duty makes a man's work easy in a busy time. The more we 
 do for God the more we may do,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+17:9">Job xvii. 9</A>.
 
 That <I>joy of the Lord</I> which is to be found only in the <I>way of 
 the Lord</I> will be our strength 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+8:10">Neh. viii. 10</A>),

 and therefore <I>the righteous shall never be removed.</I> Those that 
 have an established virtue have an established peace and happiness 
 which nothing can rob them of; they <I>have an everlasting 
 foundation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 2. Ruin and destruction are the certain consequences of wickedness. 
 <I>The wicked shall not</I> only not inherit the earth, though they lay 
 up their treasure in it, but they shall not so much as <I>inhabit the 
 earth;</I> God's judgments will root them out. <I>Destruction,</I> 
 swift and sure destruction, <I>shall be to the workers of iniquity,</I> 
 destruction from the presence of the Lord and the glory of his power. 
 Nay, that way of the Lord which is the strength of the upright is 
 consumption and terror <I>to the workers of iniquity;</I> the same 
 gospel which to the one is a <I>savour of life unto life</I> to the 
 other is a <I>savour of death unto death;</I> the same providence, like

 Here, as before, men are judged of, and, accordingly, are justified or 
 condemned, by their words, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:37">Matt. xii. 37</A>.

 1. It is both the proof and the praise of a man's wisdom and goodness 
 that he speaks wisely and well. A good man, in his discourse, <I>brings 
 forth wisdom</I> for the benefit of others. God gives him wisdom as a 
 reward of his righteousness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:26">Eccl. ii. 26</A>),

 and he, in gratitude for that gift and justice to the giver, does good 
 with it, and with his wise and pious discourses edifies many. He
 <I>knows what is acceptable,</I> what discourse will be pleasing to God 
 (for that is it that he studies more than to oblige the company), and 
 what will be agreeable both to the speaker and to the hearers, what 
 will become him and benefit them, and that he will speak. 

 2. It is the sin, and will be the ruin, of a wicked man, that he speaks 
 wickedly like himself. <I>The mouth of the wicked speaks 
 frowardness,</I> that which is displeasing to God and provoking to 
 those he converses with; and what is the issue of it? Why, <I>the 
 froward tongue shall be cut out,</I> as surely as the <I>flattering 
 one,</I>
