 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The deliverance of Israel out of Egypt gave birth to their church and
 nation, which were then founded, then formed; that work of wonder ought
 therefore to be had in everlasting remembrance. God gloried in it, in
 the preface to the ten commandments, and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:1">Hos. xi. 1</A>,

 "Out of Egypt have I called my son." In this psalm it is celebrated in
 lively strains of praise; it was fitly therefore made a part of the
 great Hallelujah, or song of praise, which the Jews were wont to sing
 at the close of the passover-supper. It must never be forgotten, 

 I. That they were brought out of slavery,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. That God set up his tabernacle among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:2">ver. 2</A>.

 III. That the sea and Jordan were divided before them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:3,5">ver. 3, 5</A>.

 IV. That the earth shook at the giving of the law, when God came down
 on Mount Sinai, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:4,6,7">ver. 4, 6, 7</A>.

 V. That God gave them water out of the rock, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:8">ver. 8</A>.

 In singing this psalm we must acknowledge God's power and goodness in 
 what he did for Israel, applying it to the much greater work of wonder, 
 our redemption by Christ, and encouraging ourselves and others to trust 
 in God in the greatest straits.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a
 people of strange language;
 &nbsp; 2  Judah was his sanctuary, <I>and</I> Israel his dominion.
 &nbsp; 3  The sea saw <I>it,</I> and fled: Jordan was driven back.
 &nbsp; 4  The mountains skipped like rams, <I>and</I> the little hills like
 lambs.
 &nbsp; 5  What <I>ailed</I> thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou
 Jordan, <I>that</I> thou wast driven back?
 &nbsp; 6  Ye mountains, <I>that</I> ye skipped like rams; <I>and</I> ye little
 hills, like lambs?
 &nbsp; 7  Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the
 presence of the God of Jacob;
 &nbsp; 8  Which turned the rock <I>into</I> a standing water, the flint into
 a fountain of waters.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist is here remembering <I>the days of old, the years of the 
 right hand of the Most High,</I> and the wonders which their fathers 
 told them of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+6:13">Judg. vi. 13</A>),

 for time, as it does not wear out the guilt of sin, so it should not 
 wear out the sense of mercy. Let it never be forgotten,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That God brought Israel out of the house of bondage with a high hand 
 and a stretched-out arm: <I>Israel went out of Egypt,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They did not steal out clandestinely, nor were they driven out, but 
 fairly went out, marched out with all the marks of honour; they went 
 out from a barbarous people, that had used them barbarously, from <I>a 
 people of a strange language,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+81:5">Ps. lxxxi. 5</A>.

 The Israelites, it seems, preserved their own language pure among them, 
 and cared not for learning the language of their oppressors. By this 
 distinction from them they kept up an earnest of their deliverance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That he himself framed their civil and sacred constitution 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 <I>Judah and Israel were his sanctuary, his dominion.</I> When he 
 delivered them out of the hand of their oppressors it was <I>that they 
 might serve him</I> both <I>in holiness and in righteousness,</I> in 
 the duties of religious worship and in obedience to the moral law, in 
 their whole conversation. <I>Let my people go, that they may serve 
 me.</I> In order to this, 

 1. He set up his sanctuary among them, in which he gave them the
 special tokens of his presence with them and promised to receive their 
 homage and tribute. Happy are the people that have God's sanctuary 
 among them (see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+25:8,Eze+37:26">
 Exod. xxv. 8, Ezek. xxxvii. 26</A>),

 much more those that, like Judah here, are his <I>sanctuaries,</I> his 
 living temples, on whom <I>Holiness to the Lord</I> is written. 

 2. He set up his dominion among them, was himself their lawgiver and 
 their judge, and their government was a theocracy: <I>The Lord was 
 their King.</I> All the world is God's dominion, but Israel was so in a 
 peculiar manner. What is God's sanctuary must be his dominion. Those 
 only have the privileges of his house that submit to the laws of it; 
 and for this end Christ has redeemed us that he might bring us into 
 God's service and engage us for ever in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That the Red Sea was divided before them at their coming out of 
 Egypt, both for their rescue and the ruin of their enemies; and the 
 river Jordan, when they entered into Canaan, for their honour, and the 
 confusion and terror of their enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>The sea saw it,</I> saw there that <I>Judah was God's sanctuary, and 
 Israel his dominion, and</I> therefore <I>fled;</I> for nothing could 
 be more awful. It was this that <I>drove Jordan back,</I> and was an 
 invincible dam to his streams; God was at the head of that people, and 
 therefore they must give way to them, must make room for them, they 
 must retire, contrary to their nature, when God speaks the word. To 
 illustrate this the psalmist asks, in a poetical strain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>What ailed thee, O thou sea! that thou fleddest?</I> And furnishes 
 the sea with an answer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 it was <I>at the presence of the Lord.</I> This is designed to express, 

 1. The reality of the miracle, that it was not by any power of nature,
 or from any natural cause, but it was <I>at the presence of the 
 Lord,</I> who gave the word. 

 2. The mercy of the miracle: <I>What ailed thee?</I> Was it in a 
 frolic? Was it only to amuse men? No; it was <I>at the presence of the 
 God of Jacob;</I> it was in kindness to the Israel of God, <I>for the 
 salvation</I> of that chosen people, that God was thus <I>displeased 
 against the rivers,</I> and his <I>wrath was against the sea,</I> as 
 the prophet speaks,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:8-13,Isa+51:10,63:11">Hab. iii. 8-13; 
 Isa. li. 10; lxvi. 11</A>,

 &c. 

 3. The wonder and surprise of the miracle. Who would have thought of 
 such a thing? Shall the course of nature be changed, and its 
 fundamental laws dispensed with, to serve a turn for God's Israel? Well 
 may the <I>dukes of Edom be amazed</I> and the <I>mighty men of Moab 
 tremble,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:15">Exod. xv. 15</A>.

 4. The honour hereby put upon Israel, who are taught to triumph over 
 the sea, and Jordan, as unable to stand before them. Note, There is no 
 sea, no Jordan, so deep, so broad, but, when God's time shall come for 
 the redemption of his people, it shall be divided and driven back if it 
 stand in their way. Apply this, 

 (1.) To the planting of the Christian church in the world. What ailed 
 Satan and the powers of darkness, that they trembled and truckled as 
 they did?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+1:34">Mark i. 34</A>.

 What ailed the heathen oracles, that they were silenced, struck dumb, 
 struck dead? What ailed their idolatries and witchcrafts, that they
 died away before the gospel, and melted like snow before the sun? What 
 ailed the persecutors and opposers of the gospel, that they gave up 
 their cause, hid their guilty heads, and called to rocks and mountains 
 for shelter?
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:15">Rev. vi. 15</A>.

 It was <I>at the presence of the Lord,</I> and that power which went 
 along with the gospel. 

 (2.) To the work of grace in the heart. What turns the stream in a 
 regenerate soul? What ails the lusts and corruptions, that they fly
 back, that the prejudices are removed and the whole man has become new? 
 It is at the presence of God's Spirit that imaginations are <I>cast 
 down,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:5">2 Cor. x. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That the earth shook and trembled when God came down on Mount Sinai 
 to give the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The mountains skipped like rams, and</I> then <I>the little 
 hills</I> might well be excused if they skipped <I>like lambs,</I> 
 either when they are frightened or when they sport themselves. The same 
 power that fixed the fluid waters and made them stand still shook the 
 stable mountains and made them tremble for all the powers of nature are 
 under the check of the God of nature. Mountains and hills are, before
 God, but like rams and lambs; even the bulkiest and the most rocky are 
 as manageable by him as <I>they</I> are by the shepherd. The trembling 
 of the mountains before the Lord may shame the stupidity and obduracy 
 of the children of men, who are not moved at the discoveries of his 
 glory. The psalmist asks the mountains and hills what ailed them to 
 skip thus; and he answers for them, as for the seas, it was <I>at the 
 presence of the Lord,</I> before whom, not only those mountains, but 
 the earth itself, may well tremble 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 since it has lain under a curse for man's sin. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:32,Isa+64:3,4">Ps. civ. 32; Isa. lxiv. 3, 4</A>.

 He that made the hills and mountains to skip thus can, when he pleases, 
 dissipate the strength and spirit of the proudest of his enemies and 
 make them tremble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That God supplied them with water out of the rock, which followed 
 them through the dry and sandy deserts. Well may the earth and all its 
 inhabitants tremble before that God who <I>turned the rock into a 
 standing water</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and what cannot he do who did that? The same almighty power that turned 
 waters into a rock to be a wall to Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:22">Exod. xiv. 22</A>)

 turned the rock into waters to be a well to Israel: as they were
 protected, so they were provided for, by miracles, standing miracles; 
 for such was the standing water, that fountain of waters into which the 
 rock, the flinty rock, was turned, <I>and that rock was Christ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:4">1 Cor. x. 4</A>.

 For he is a fountain of living waters to his Israel, from whom they 
 receive grace for grace.</P>
