 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm, as those before, is a prayer of David, and full of 
 complaints of the great distress and danger he was in, probably when 
 Saul persecuted him. He did not only pray in that affliction, but he 
 prayed very much and very often, not the same over again, but new 
 thoughts. In this psalm, 

 I. He complains of his troubles, through the oppression of his enemies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:3">ver. 3</A>)

 and the weakness of his spirit under it, which was ready to sink
 notwithstanding the likely course he took to support himself, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 II. He prays, and prays earnestly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:6">ver. 6</A>),

 1. That God would hear him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 2. That he would not deal with him according to his sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:2">ver. 2</A>.

 3. That he would not hide his face from him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:7">ver. 7</A>),

 but manifest his favour to him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:8">ver. 8</A>.

 4. That he would guide and direct him in the way of his duty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:8,10">ver. 8, 10</A>)

 and quicken him in it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:11">ver. 11</A>.

 5. That he would deliver him out of his troubles,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:9,11">ver. 9, 11</A>.

 6. That he would in due time reckon with his persecutors,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:12">ver. 12</A>.

 We may more easily accommodate this psalm to ourselves, in the singing
 of it, because most of the petitions in it are for spiritual blessings 
 (which we all need at all times), mercy and grace.</P>

 <P>A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Hear my prayer, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, give ear to my
 supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, <I>and</I> in thy
 righteousness.
 &nbsp; 2  And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy
 sight shall no man living be justified.
 &nbsp; 3  For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my
 life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as
 those that have been long dead.
 &nbsp; 4  Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within
 me is desolate.
 &nbsp; 5  I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I
 muse on the work of thy hands.
 &nbsp; 6  I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul <I>thirsteth</I> after
 thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, I. David humbly begs to be heard 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 not as if he questioned it, but he earnestly desired it, and was in 
 care about it, for, having desired it, and was in care about it, for 
 having directed his prayer, he looked up to see how it sped,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:1">Hab. ii. 1</A>.

 He is a suppliant to his God, and he begs that his requests may be 
 granted: <I>Hear my prayer; give ear to my supplications.</I> He is an 
 appellant against his persecutors, and he begs that his case may be 
 brought to hearing and that God will give judgment upon it, in his 
 faithfulness and righteousness, as the Judge of right and wrong. Or, 
 "Answer my petitions in thy faithfulness, according to the promises 
 thou hast made, which thou wilt be just to." We have no righteousness 
 of our own to plead, and therefore must plead God's righteousness, the 
 word of promise which he has freely given us and caused us to hope 
 in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He humbly begs not to be proceeded against in strict justice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 He seems here, if not to correct, yet to explain, his plea 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 Deliver me <I>in thy righteousness;</I> "I mean," says he, "the
 righteous promises of the gospel, not the righteous threatenings of the 
 law; if I be answered according to the righteousness of this broken 
 covenant of innocency, I am quite undone;" and therefore, 

 1. His petition is, "<I>Enter not into judgment with thy servant;</I>
 do not deal with me in strict justice, as I deserve to be dealt with." 
 In this prayer we must own ourselves to be God's servants, bound to 
 obey him, accountable to him, and solicitous to obtain his favour, and 
 we must approve ourselves to him. We must acknowledge that in many 
 instances we have offended him, and have come short of our duty to him, 
 that he might justly enquire into our offences, and proceed against us 
 for them according to law, and that, if he should do so, judgment would 
 certainly go against us; we have nothing to move in arrest or 
 mitigation of it, but execution would be taken out and awarded and then 
 we should be ruined for ever. But we must encourage ourselves with a 
 hope that there is mercy and forgiveness with God, and be earnest with 
 him for the benefit of that mercy. "<I>Enter not into judgment with thy 
 servant,</I> for thou hast already entered into judgment with thy Son, 
 and laid upon him the iniquity of us all. <I>Enter not into judgment 
 with thy servant,</I> for thy servant enters into judgment with 
 himself;" and, if <I>we will judge ourselves, we shall not be 
 judged.</I> 

 2. His plea is, "<I>In thy sight shall no man living be justified</I>
 upon those terms, for no man can plead innocency nor any righteousness 
 of his own, either that he has not sinned or that he does not deserve 
 to die for his sins; nor that he has any satisfaction of his own to 
 offer;" nay, if God contend with us, <I>we are not able to answer him 
 for one of a thousand,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:3,15:20">Job ix. 3; xv. 20</A>.

 David, before he prays for the removal of his trouble, prays for the 
 pardon of his sin, and depends upon mere mercy for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He complains of the prevalency of his enemies against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 "Saul, that great enemy, <I>has persecuted my soul,</I> sought my life, 
 with a restless malice, and has carried the persecution so far that he 
 has already <I>smitten it down to the ground.</I> Though I am not yet 
 under ground, I am struck to the ground, and that is next door to it; 
 he has forced me to <I>dwell in darkness,</I> not only in dark caves, 
 but in dark thoughts and apprehensions, in the clouds of melancholy, 
 <I>as</I> helpless and hopeless as <I>those that have been long 
 dead.</I> Lord, let me find mercy with thee, for I find no mercy with 
 men. They condemn me; but, Lord, do not thou condemn me. Am not I an 
 object of thy compassion, fit to be appeared for; and is not my enemy 
 an object of thy displeasure, fit to be appeared against?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He bemoans the oppression of his mind, occasioned by his outward 
 troubles 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Therefore is my spirit</I> overpowered and <I>overwhelmed within 
 me,</I> and I am almost plunged in despair; when without are fightings 
 within are fears, and those fears greater tyrants and oppressors than 
 Saul himself and not so easily out-run. It is sometimes the lot of the 
 best men to have their spirits for a time almost overwhelmed and their 
 hearts desolate, and doubtless it is their infirmity. David was not 
 only a great saint, but a great soldier, and yet even he was sometimes 
 ready to faint in a day of adversity. <I>Howl, fir-trees, if the
 cedars be shaken.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He applies himself to the use of proper means for the relief of his 
 troubled spirit. He had no force to muster up against the oppression of 
 the enemy, but, if he can keep possession of nothing else, he will do 
 what he can to keep possession of his own soul and to preserve his 
 inward peace. In order to this, 

 1. He looks back, and <I>remembers the days of old</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 God's former appearances for his afflicted people and for him in 
 particular. It has been often a relief to the people of God in their 
 straits to think of the wonders which their fathers told them of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:5,11">Ps. lxxvii. 5, 11</A>.

 2. He looks round, and takes notice of the works of God in the visible 
 creation, and the providential government of the world: <I>I meditate 
 on all thy works.</I> Many see them, but do not see the footsteps of 
 God's wisdom, power, and goodness in them, and do not receive the 
 benefit they might by them because they do not meditate upon them; they 
 do not dwell on that copious curious subject, but soon quit it, as if 
 they had exhausted it, when they have scarcely touched upon it. <I>I 
 muse on,</I> or (as some read it) <I>I discourse of, the</I> operation 
 <I>of thy hands,</I> how great, how good, it is! The more we consider 
 the power of God the less we shall fear the face or force of man, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+51:12,13">Isa. li. 12, 13</A>.

 3. He looks up with earnest desires towards God and his favour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 "<I>I stretch forth my hands unto thee,</I> as one begging an alms, and 
 big with expectation to receive something great, standing ready to lay 
 hold on it and bid it welcome. <I>My soul thirsteth after thee; it is 
 to thee</I> (so the word is), entire for thee, intent on thee; it is 
 <I>as a thirsty land,</I> which, being parched with excessive heat, 
 gapes for rain; so do I need, so do I crave, the support and 
 refreshment of divine consolations under my afflictions, and nothing 
 else will relieve me." This is the best course we can take when our 
 spirits are overwhelmed; and justly do those sink under their load who 
 will not take such a ready way as this to ease themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Hear me speedily, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: my spirit faileth: hide not thy
 face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
 &nbsp; 8  Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in
 thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk;
 for I lift up my soul unto thee.
 &nbsp; 9  Deliver me, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to
 hide me.
 &nbsp; 10  Teach me to do thy will; for thou <I>art</I> my God: thy spirit
 <I>is</I> good; lead me into the land of uprightness.
 &nbsp; 11  Quicken me, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, for thy name's sake: for thy
 righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.
 &nbsp; 12  And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them
 that afflict my soul: for I <I>am</I> thy servant.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here tells us what he said when he stretched forth his hands unto 
 God; he begins not only as one in earnest, but as one in haste: 
 "<I>Hear me speedily,</I> and defer no longer, for <I>my spirit 
 faileth.</I> I am just ready to faint; reach the cordial--quickly,
 quickly, or I am gone." It was not a haste of unbelief, but of vehement 
 desire and holy love. <I>Make haste, O God! to help me.</I> Three 
 things David here prays for:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The manifestations of God's favour towards him, that God would be 
 well pleased with him and let him know that he was so; this he prefers 
 before any good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6">Ps. iv. 6</A>.

 1. He dreads God's frowns: "Lord, <I>hide not thy face from me;</I>
 Lord, be not angry with me, do not turn from me, as we do from one we 
 are displeased with; Lord, let me not be left under the apprehensions 
 of thy anger or in doubt concerning thy favour; if I have thy favour, 
 let it not be hidden from me." Those that have the truth of grace 
 cannot but desire the evidence of it. He pleads the wretchedness of his 
 case if God withdrew from him: "Lord, let me not lie under thy wrath, 
 for then I am <I>like those that go down to the pit,</I> that is, down 
 to the grave (I am a dead man, weak, and pale, and ghastly; thy frowns 
 are worse than death), or down to hell, the bottomless pit." Even those 
 who through grace are delivered from going down to the pit may 
 sometimes, when the terrors of the Almighty set themselves in array 
 against them, look like those who are going to the pit. Disconsolate 
 saints have sometimes cried out of the wrath of God, as if they had 
 been damned sinners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:4,Ps+88:6">Job vi. 4; Ps. lxxxviii. 6</A>.

 2. He entreats God's favour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning.</I> He cannot 
 but think that God has a kindness for him, that he has some kind things 
 to say to him, some good words and comfortable words; but the present 
 hurry of his affairs, and tumult of his spirits, drowned those pleasing 
 whispers; and therefore he begs, "Lord, do not only speak kindly to me, 
 but cause me to hear it, to <I>hear joy and gladness,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:8">Ps. li. 8</A>.
 
 God speaks to us by his word and by his providence, and in both we 
 should desire and endeavour to <I>hear his lovingkindness</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:43">Ps. cvii. 43</A>),

 that we may set that always before us: "<I>Cause me to hear</I> it
 <I>in the morning,</I> every morning; let my waking thoughts be of 
 God's lovingkindness, that the sweet relish of that may abide upon my 
 spirits all the day long." His plea is, "<I>For in thee do I trust,</I> 
 and in thee only; I look not for comfort in any other." God's goodness 
 is commonly wrought <I>for those who trust in him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:8">Ps. xxxi. 8</A>),

 who by faith draw it out.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The operations of God's grace in him. Those he is as earnest for as 
 for the tokens of God's favour to him, and so should we be. He 
 prays,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That he might be enlightened with the knowledge of God's will; and 
 this is the first work of the Spirit, in order to his other works, for 
 God deals with men as men, as reasonable creatures. Here are three 
 petitions to this effect:--

 (1.) <I>Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk.</I> Sometimes 
 those that are much in care to walk right are in doubt, and in the 
 dark, which is the right way. Let them come boldly to the throne of 
 grace, and beg of God, by his word, and Spirit, and providence, to show 
 them the way, and prevent their missing it. A good man does not ask 
 what is the way in which he must walk, or in which is the most pleasant 
 walking, but what is the right way, the way in which he should walk. He 
 pleads, "<I>I lift up my soul unto thee,</I> to be moulded and 
 fashioned according to thy will." He did not only importunately, but 
 impartially, desire to know his duty; and those that do so shall be 
 taught. 

 (2.) "<I>Teach me to do thy will,</I> not only show me what thy will
 is, but teach me how to do it, how to turn my hand dexterously to my 
 duty." It is the desire and endeavour of all God's faithful servants to 
 know and to do his will, and to stand complete in it. He pleads, 
 "<I>Thou art my God,</I> and therefore my oracle, by whom I may expect 
 to be advised--my God, and therefore my ruler, whose will I desire to 
 do." If we do in sincerity take God for our God, we may depend upon him 
 to teach us to do his will, as a master does his servant.

 (3.) <I>Lead me into the land of uprightness,</I> into the communion of
 saints, that pleasant land of the upright, or into a settled course of 
 holy living, which will lead to heaven, that land of uprightness where 
 holiness will be in perfection, and he that is holy shall be holy 
 still. We should desire to be led, and kept safe, to heaven, not only 
 because it is a land of blessedness, but because it is a land of 
 uprightness; it is the perfection of grace. We cannot find the way that 
 will bring us to that land unless God show us, nor go in that way 
 unless he take us by the hand and lead us, as we lead those that are 
 weak, or lame, or timorous, or dim-sighted; so necessary is the grace 
 of God, not only to put us into the good way, but to keep us and carry 
 us on in it. The plea is, "<I>Thy Spirit is good,</I> and able to make 
 me good," good and willing to help those that are at a loss. Those that 
 have the Lord for their God have his Spirit for their guide; and it is 
 both their character and their privilege that they are <I>led by the 
 Spirit.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He prays that he might be enlivened to do his will 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 "<I>Quicken me, O Lord!</I>--quicken my devotions, that they may be
 lively; quicken me to my duty, and quicken me in it; and this <I>for 
 thy name's sake.</I>" The best saints often find themselves dull, and 
 dead, and slow, and therefore pray to God to quicken them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The appearance of God's providence for him, 

 1. That God would, in his own way and time, give him rest from his
 troubles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 "<I>Deliver me, O Lord! from my enemies,</I> that they may not have 
 their will against me; <I>for I flee unto thee to hide me;</I> I trust 
 to thee to defend me in my trouble, and therefore to rescue me out of 
 it." Preservations are pledges of salvation, and those shall find God 
 their hiding-place who by faith make him such. He explains himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>For thy righteousness-sake, bring my soul out of trouble,</I> for 
 thy promise-sake, nay, for thy mercy-sake" (for some by 
 <I>righteousness</I> understand <I>kindness</I> and <I>goodness</I>); 
 "do not only deliver me from my outward trouble, but from the trouble 
 of my soul, the trouble that threatens to overwhelm my spirit. Whatever 
 trouble I am in, Lord, let not my heart be troubled," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:1">John xiv. 1</A>.

 2. That he would reckon with those that were the instruments of his 
 trouble 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>Of thy mercy</I> to me <I>cut off my enemies,</I> that I may be no 
 longer in fear of them; <I>and destroy all those,</I> whoever they be, 
 how numerous, how powerful, soever, <I>who afflict my soul,</I> and 
 create vexation to that; <I>for I am thy servant,</I> and am resolved 
 to continue such, and therefore may expect to be owned and protected in 
 thy service." This prayer is a prophecy of the utter destruction of all 
 the impenitent enemies of Jesus Christ and his kingdom, who will not 
 have him to reign over them, who grieve his Spirit, and afflict his 
 soul, by afflicting his people, in whose afflictions he is 
 afflicted.</P>
