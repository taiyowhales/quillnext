 Job, in this chapter, goes on to express the bitter sense he had of his 
 calamities and to justify himself in his desire of death. 

 I. He complains to himself and his friends of his troubles, and the
 constant agitation he was in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. He turns to God, and expostulates with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:7-21">ver. 7</A>,

 to the end), in which,

 1. He pleads the final period which death puts to our present state, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.

 2. He passionately complains of the miserable condition he was now in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:11-16">ver.  11-16</A>.

 3. He wonders that God will thus contend with him, and begs for the
 pardon of his sins and a speedy release out of his miseries, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:17-21">ver. 17-21</A>.

 It is hard to methodize the speeches of one who owned himself almost
 desperate,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  <I>Is there</I> not an appointed time to man upon earth? <I>are not</I>
 his days also like the days of a hireling?
 &nbsp; 2  As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an
 hireling looketh for <I>the reward of</I> his work:
 &nbsp; 3  So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome
 nights are appointed to me.
 &nbsp; 4  When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be
 gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of
 the day.
 &nbsp; 5  My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is
 broken, and become loathsome.
 &nbsp; 6  My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent
 without hope.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job is here excusing what he could not justify, even his inordinate 
 desire of death. Why should he not wish for the termination of life, 
 which would be the termination of his miseries? To enforce this reason 
 he argues,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. From the general condition of man upon earth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "He <I>is of few days, and full of trouble.</I> Every man must die
 shortly, and every man has some reason (more or less) to desire to die 
 shortly; and therefore why should you impute it to me as so heinous a 
 crime that I wish to die shortly?" Or thus: "Pray mistake not my 
 desires of death, as if I thought the time appointed of God could be 
 anticipated: no, I know very well that that is fixed; only in such 
 language as this I take the liberty to express my present uneasiness: 
 <I>Is there not an appointed time (a warfare,</I> so the word is) to 
 <I>man upon earth?</I> and <I>are not his days</I> here <I>like the 
 days of a hireling?</I>" Observe, 

 1. Man's present place. He is upon earth, which God <I>has given to the 
 children of men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:16">Ps. cxv. 16</A>.

 This bespeaks man's meanness and inferiority. How much below the
 inhabitants of yonder elevated and refined regions is he situated! It 
 also bespeaks God's mercy to him. He is yet upon the earth, not under 
 it; on earth, not in hell. Our time on earth is limited and short, 
 according to the narrow bounds of this earth; but heaven cannot be 
 measured, nor the days of heaven numbered.

 2. His continuance in that place. Is there not a time appointed for his
 abode here? Yes, certainly there is, and it is easy to say by whom the 
 appointment is made, even by him that made us and set us here. We are 
 not to be on this earth always, nor long, but for a certain time, which 
 is determined by him in whose hand our times are. We are not to think 
 that we are governed by the blind fortune of the Epicureans, but by the 
 wise, holy, and sovereign counsel of God. 

 3.  His condition during that continuance.  Man's life is <I>a
 warfare,</I> and <I>as the days of a hireling.</I> We are every one of 
 us to look upon ourselves in this world,

 (1.) As soldiers, exposed to hardship and in the midst of enemies; we
 must serve and be under command; and, when our warfare is accomplished, 
 we must be disbanded, dismissed with either shame or honour, according 
 to what we have done in the body.

 (2.) As day-labourers, that have the work of the day to do in its day
 and must make up their account at night.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. From his own condition at this time. He had as much reason, he 
 thought, to wish for death, as a poor servant or hireling that is tired 
 with his work has to wish for the shadows of the evening, when he shall 
 receive his penny and go to rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The darkness of the night is as welcome to the labourer as the light of
 the morning is to the watchman, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:6">Ps. cxxx. 6</A>.

 The God of nature has provided for the repose of labourers, and no
 wonder that they desire it. <I>The sleep of the labouring man is 
 sweet,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:12">Eccl. v. 12</A>.

 No pleasure more grateful, more relishing, to the luxurious than rest
 to the laborious; nor can any rich man take so much satisfaction in the 
 return of his rent-days as the hireling in his day's wages. The 
 comparison is plain, the application is concise and somewhat obscure, 
 but we must supply a word or two, and then it is easy: exactness of 
 language is not to be expected from one in Job's condition. "<I>As a 
 servant earnestly desires the shadow, so</I> and for the same reason I 
 earnestly desire death; for <I>I am made to possess,</I> &c." Hear his 
 complaint.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His days were useless, and had been so a great while. He was wholly 
 taken off from business, and utterly unfit for it. Every day was a 
 burden to him, because he was in no capacity of doing good, or of 
 spending it to any purpose. <I>Et vit&aelig; partem non attigit ullam--He
 could not fill up his time with any thing that would turn to 
 account.</I> This he calls <I>possessing months of vanity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 It very much increases the affliction of sickness and age, to a good
 man, that he is thereby forced from his usefulness. He insists not so 
 much upon it that they are days in which he has no pleasure as that 
 they are days in which he does not good; on that account they are 
 months of vanity. But when we are disabled to work for God, if we will 
 but sit still quietly for him, it is all one; we shall be accepted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His nights were restless, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 The night relieves the toil and fatigue of the day, not only to the
 labourers, but to the sufferers: if a sick man can but get a little 
 sleep in the night, it helps nature, and it is hoped that he will do 
 well,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:12">John xi. 12</A>.

 However, be the trouble what it will, sleep gives some intermission to
 the cares, and pains, and griefs, that afflict us; it is the 
 parenthesis of our sorrows. But poor Job could not gain this relief. 
 
 (1.) His nights were wearisome, and, instead of taking any rest, he did
 but tire himself more with tossing to and fro until morning. Those that 
 are in great uneasiness, through pain of body or anguish of mind, think 
 by changing sides, changing places, changing postures, to get some 
 ease; but, while the cause is the same within, it is all to no purpose; 
 it is but a resemblance of a fretful discontented spirit, that is ever 
 shifting, but never easy. This made him dread the night as much as the 
 servant desires it, and, when he lay down, to say, <I>When will the 
 night be gone?</I> 

 (2.) These <I>wearisome nights</I> were <I>appointed</I> to him. God,
 who determines the times before appointed, had allotted him such nights 
 as these. Whatever is at any time grievous to us, it is good to see it 
 appointed for us, that we may acquiesce in the event, not only as 
 unavoidable because appointed, but as therefore designed for some holy 
 end. When we have comfortable nights we must see them also appointed to 
 us and be thankful for them; many better than we have wearisome 
 nights.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His body was noisome, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 His sores bred worms, the scabs were like clods of dust, and his skin
 was broken; so evil was the disease which cleaved fast to him. See what 
 vile bodies we have, and what little reason we have to pamper them or 
 be proud of them; they have in themselves the principles of their own 
 corruption: as fond as we are of them now, the time may come when we 
 may loathe them and long to get rid of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. His life was hastening apace towards a period, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 He thought he had no reason to expect a long life, for he found himself
 declining fast

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle,</I> that is, "My time
 is now but short, and there are but a few sands more in my glass, which 
 will speedily run out." Natural motions are more swift near the centre. 
 Job thought his days ran swiftly because he thought he should soon be 
 at his journey's end; he looked upon them as good as spent already, and 
 he was therefore without hope of being restored to his former 
 prosperity. It is applicable to man's life in general. Our days are 
 like a weaver's shuttle, thrown from one side of the web to the other 
 in the twinkling of an eye, and then back again, to and fro, until at 
 length it is quite exhausted of the thread it carried, and then we 
 <I>cut off, like a weaver, our life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:12">Isa. xxxviii. 12</A>.

 Time hastens on apace; the motion of it cannot be stopped, and, when it
 is past, it cannot be recalled. While we are living, as we are sowing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:8">Gal. vi. 8</A>),

 so we are weaving. Every day, like the shuttle, leaves a thread behind
 it. Many weave the spider's web, which will fail them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:14"><I>ch.</I> viii. 14</A>.

 If we are weaving to ourselves holy garments and robes of
 righteousness, we shall have the benefit of them when our work comes to 
 be reviewed and every man shall reap as he sowed and wear as he 
 wove.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job, observing perhaps that his friends, though they would not 
 interrupt him in his discourse, yet began to grow weary, and not to 
 heed much what he said, here turns to God, and speaks to him. If men 
 will not hear us, God will; if men cannot help us, he can; for his arm 
 is not shortened, neither is his ear heavy. Yet we must not go to 
 school to Job here to learn how to speak to God; for, it must be 
 confessed, there is a great mixture of passion and corruption in what 
 he here says. But, if God be not extreme to mark what his people say 
 amiss, let us also make the best of it. Job is here begging of God 
 either to ease him or to end him. He here represents himself to 
 God,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. As a dying man, surely and speedily dying. It is good for us, when 
 we are sick, to think and speak of death, for sickness is sent on 
 purpose to put us in mind of it; and, if we be duly mindful of it 
 ourselves, we may in faith put God in mind of it, as Job does here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>O remember that my life is wind.</I> He recommends himself to God as
 an object of his pity and compassion, with this consideration, that he 
 was a very weak frail creature, his abode in this world short and 
 uncertain, his removal out of it sure and speedy, and his return to it 
 again impossible and never to be expected--that his life was wind, as 
 the lives of all men are, noisy perhaps and blustering, like the wind, 
 but vain and empty, soon gone, and, when gone, past recall. God had 
 compassion on Israel, <I>remembering that they were but flesh, a wind 
 that passeth away and cometh not again,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:38,39">Ps. lxxviii. 38, 39</A>.

 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The pious reflections Job makes upon his own life and death. Such 
 plain truths as these concerning the shortness and vanity of life, the 
 unavoidableness and irrecoverableness of death, <I>then</I> do us good 
 when we think and speak of them with application to ourselves. Let us 
 consider then, 

 (1.) That we must shortly take our leave of all the things that are
 seen, that are temporal. The eye of the body must be closed, and shall 
 no more see good, the good which most men set their hearts upon; for 
 their cry is, <I>Who will make us to see good?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6">Ps. iv. 6</A>.

 If we be such fools as to place our happiness in visible good things,
 what will become of us when they shall be for ever hidden from our 
 eyes, and we shall no more see good? Let us therefore live by that 
 faith which is the substance and evidence of things not seen.

 (2.) That we must then remove to an invisible world: <I>The eye of him
 that hath</I> here <I>seen me shall see me no more</I> there. It is 
 <B><I>hades</I></B>--<I>an unseen state,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Death removes our lovers and friends into darkness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:18">Ps. lxxxviii. 18</A>),

 and will shortly remove us out of their sight; when we <I>go hence we
 shall be seen no more</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:13">Ps. xxxix. 13</A>),

 but go to converse with the things that are not seen, that are eternal.

 (3.) That God can easily, and in a moment, put an end to our lives, and
 send us to another world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Thy eyes are upon me and I am not;</I> thou canst look me into
 eternity, frown me into the grave, when thou pleasest."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He takes away our breath, and we die; nay, he but <I>looks on the 
 earth</I> and it <I>trembles,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:29,30">Ps. xiv. 29, 30</A>.

 (4.) That, when we are once removed to another world, we must never
 return to this. There is constant passing from this world to the other, 
 but <I>vestigia nulla retrorsum--there is no repassing.</I> "Therefore, 
 Lord, kindly ease me by death, for that will be a perpetual ease. I 
 shall return no more to the calamities of this life." When we are dead 
 we are gone, to return no more, 

 [1.] From our house under ground

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>He that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more</I> until the
 general resurrection, shall come up no more to his place in this world. 
 Dying is work that is to be done but once, and therefore it had need be 
 well done: an error there is past retrieve. This is illustrated by the 
 blotting out and scattering of a cloud. It is consumed and vanisheth 
 away, is resolved into air and never knits again. Other clouds arise, 
 but the same cloud never returns: so a new generation of the children 
 of men is raised up, but the former generation is quite consumed and 
 vanishes away. When we see a cloud which looks great, as if it would 
 eclipse the sun and drawn the earth, of a sudden dispersed and 
 disappearing, let us say, "Just such a thing is the life of man; it is 
 <I>a vapour that appears for a little while and then vanishes 
 away.</I>" 
 
 [2.] To return no more to our house above ground

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>He shall return no more to his house,</I> to the possession and
 enjoyment of it, to the business and delights of it. Others will take 
 possession, and keep it till they also resign to another generation. 
 The rich man in hell desired that Lazarus might be sent to his house, 
 knowing it was to no purpose to ask that he might have leave to go 
 himself. Glorified saints shall return no more to the cares, and 
 burdens, and sorrows of their house; nor damned sinners to the gaieties 
 and pleasures of their house. Their place shall no more know them, no 
 more own them, have no more acquaintance with them, nor be any more 
 under their influence. It concerns us to secure a better place when we 
 die, for this will no more own us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The passionate inference he draws from it. From these premises he 
 might have drawn a better conclusion that this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak; I will
 complain.</I> Holy David, when he had been meditating on the frailty of
 human life, made a contrary use of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:3">Ps. xxxix. 9</A>,

 <I>I was dumb, and opened not my mouth</I>); but Job, finding himself
 near expiring, hastens as much to make his complaint as if he had been 
 to make his last will and testament or as if he could not die in peace 
 until he had given vent to his passion. When we have but a few breaths 
 to draw we should spend them in the holy gracious breathings of faith 
 and prayer, not in the noisome noxious breathings of sin and 
 corruption. Better die praying and praising than die complaining and 
 quarrelling.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. As a distempered man, sorely and grievously distempered both in 
 body and mind. In this part of his representation is he is very 
 peevish, as if God dealt hardly with him and laid upon him more than 
 was meet: "<I>Am I a sea, or a whale</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 a raging sea, that must be kept within bounds, to check its proud
 waves, or an unruly whale, that must be restrained by force from 
 devouring all the fishes of the sea? Am I so strong that there needs so 
 much ado to hold me? so boisterous that no less than all these mighty 
 bonds of affliction will serve to tame me and keep me within compass?" 
 We are very apt, when we are in affliction, to complain of God and his 
 providence, as if he laid more restraints upon us that there is 
 occasion for; whereas we are never in heaviness but when there is need, 
 nor more than the necessity demands. 

 1. He complains that he could not rest in his bed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 There we promise ourselves some repose, when we are fatigued with
 labour, pain, or traveling: "<I>My bed shall comfort me, and my couch 
 shall ease my complaint.</I> Sleep will for a time give me some 
 relief;" it usually does so; it is appointed for that end; many a time 
 it has eased us, and we have awaked refreshed, and with new vigour.  
 When it is so we have great reason to be thankful; but it was not so 
 with poor Job: his bed, instead of comforting him, terrified him; and 
 his couch, instead of easing his complaint, added to it; for if he 
 dropped asleep, he was disturbed with frightful dreams, and when those 
 awaked him still he was haunted with dreadful apparitions. This was it 
 that made the night so unwelcome and wearisome to him as it was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 
 When <I>shall I arise?</I> Note, God can, when he pleases, meet us with
 terror even where we promise ourselves ease and repose; nay, he can 
 make us a terror to ourselves, and, as we have often contracted guilt 
 by the rovings of an unsanctified fancy, he can likewise, by the power 
 of our own imagination, create us much grief, and so make that our 
 punishment which has often been our sin. In Job's dreams, though they 
 might partly arise from his distemper (in fevers, or small pox, when 
 the body is all over sore, it is common for the sleep to be unquiet), 
 yet we have reason to think Satan had a hand, for he delights to 
 terrify those whom it is out of his reach to destroy; but Job looked up 
 to God, who permitted Satan to do this (<I>thou scarest me</I>), and 
 mistook Satan's representations for the <I>terror of God setting 
 themselves in array against him.</I> We have reason to pray to God that 
 our dreams may neither defile nor disquiet us, neither tempt us to sin 
 nor torment us with fear, that he who keeps Israel, and neither 
 slumbers nor sleeps, may keep us when we slumber and sleep, that the 
 devil may not then do us a mischief, either as an insinuating serpent 
 or as a roaring lion, and to bless God if we lie down and our sleep is 
 sweet and we are not thus scared. 

 2. He covets to rest in his grave, that bed where there are no tossings
 to and fro, nor any frightful dreams, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 (1.) He was sick of life, and hated the thoughts of it: "<I>I loathe 
 it;</I> I have had enough of it. <I>I would not live always,</I> not 
 only not live always in this condition, in pain and misery, but not 
 live always in the most easy and prosperous condition, to be 
 continually in danger of being thus reduced. <I>My days are vanity</I> 
 at the best, empty of solid comfort, exposed to real griefs; and I 
 would not be for ever tied to such uncertainty." Note, A good man would 
 not (if he might) life always in this world, no, not though it smile 
 upon him, because it is a world of sin and temptation and he has a 
 better world in prospect.

 (2.) He was fond of death, and pleased himself with the thoughts of it: 
 his <I>soul</I> (his judgment, he thought, but really it was his 
 passion) <I>chose strangling and death rather than life;</I> any death 
 rather than such a life as this.  Doubtless this was Job's infirmity; 
 for though a good man would not wish to live always in this world, and 
 would choose strangling and death rather than sin, as the martyrs did, 
 yet he will be content to live as long as pleases God, not choose death 
 rather than life, because life is our opportunity of glorifying God and 
 getting ready for heaven.</P>

 Job here reasons with God,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Concerning his dealings with man in general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>):

 <I>What is man, that thou shouldst magnify him?</I> This may be looked
 upon either, 

 1. As a passionate reflection upon the proceedings of divine justice;
 as if the great God did diminish and disparage himself in contending 
 with man. "Great men think it below them to take cognizance of those 
 who are much their inferiors so far as to reprove and correct their 
 follies and indecencies; why then does God magnify man, by visiting 
 him, and trying him, and making so much ado about him?  Why will he 
 thus pour all his forces upon one that is such an unequal match for 
 him? Why will he visit him with afflictions, which, like a quotidian 
 ague, return as duly and constantly as the morning light, and try, 
 every moment, what he can bear?" We mistake God, and the nature of his 
 providence, if we think it any lessening to him to take notice of the 
 meanest of his creatures. Or, 

 2. As a pious admiration of the condescensions of divine grace, like
 that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:4,144:3">Ps. viii. 4; cxliv. 3</A>.

 He owns God's favour to man in general, even when he complains of his
 own particular troubles. "<I>What is man,</I> miserable man, a poor, 
 mean, weak creature, <I>that thou,</I> the great and glorious God, 
 shouldst deal with him as thou dost? What is man,"

 (1.) "That thou shouldst put such honour upon him, <I>shouldst magnify 
 him,</I> by taking him into covenant and communion with thyself?"

 (2.) "That thou shouldst concern thyself so much about him, <I>shouldst 
 set thy heart upon him,</I> as dear to thee, and one that thou hast a 
 kindness for?"

 (3.) "<I>That thou shouldst visit him</I> with thy compassions <I>every 
 morning,</I> as we daily visit a particular friend, or as the physician 
 visits his patients every morning to help them?"

 (4.) "That thou shouldst <I>try him,</I> shouldst feel his pulse and 
 observe his looks, <I>every moment,</I> as in care about him and 
 jealous over him?" That such a worm of the earth as man is should be 
 the darling and favourite of heaven is what we have reason for ever to 
 admire.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Concerning his dealings with him in particular.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The complaint he makes of his afflictions, which he here aggravates, 
 and (as we are all too apt to do) makes the worst of, in three 
 expressions:--

 (1.) That he was the butt to God's arrows: "<I>Thou hast set me as a
 mark against thee,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 "My case is singular, and none is shot at as I am."

 (2.) That he was a <I>burden to himself,</I> ready to sink under the
 load of his own life. How much delight soever we take in ourselves God 
 can, when he pleases, make us burdens to ourselves. What comfort can we 
 take in ourselves if God appear against us as an enemy and we have not 
 comfort in him.

 (3.) That he had no intermission of his griefs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 "<I>How long</I> will it be ere thou cause thy rod to <I>depart from
 me,</I> or abate the rigour of the correction, at least for so long as 
 that I may <I>swallow down my spittle?</I>" It should seem, Job's 
 distemper lay much in his throat, and almost choked him, so that he 
 could not swallow his spittle. He complains

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:18"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 18</A>)

 that it <I>bound him about like the collar of his coat.</I> "Lord,"
 says he, "wilt not thou give me some respite, some breathing time?" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:18"><I>ch.</I> ix. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The concern he is in about his sins. The best men have sin to 
 complain of, and the better they are the more they will complain of it. 
 
 (1.) He ingenuously owns himself guilty before God: <I>I have
 sinned.</I> God had said of him that he was a <I>perfect and an upright 
 man;</I> yet he says of himself, <I>I have sinned.</I> Those may be 
 upright who yet are not sinless; and those who are sincerely penitent 
 are accepted, through a Mediator, as evangelically perfect. Job 
 maintained, against his friends, that he was not a hypocrite, not a 
 wicked man; and yet he owned to his God that he had sinned. If we have 
 been kept from gross acts of sin, it does not therefore follow that we 
 are innocent. The best must acknowledge, before God, that they have 
 sinned.  His calling God the <I>observer,</I> or <I>preserver,</I> of 
 men, may be looked upon as designed for an aggravation of his sin: 
 "Though God has had his eye upon me, his eye upon me for good, yet I 
 have sinned against him." When we are in affliction it is seasonable to 
 confess sin, as the procuring cause of our affliction. Penitent 
 confessions would drown and silence passionate complaints. 

 (2.) He seriously enquires how he may make his peace with God: "<I>What 
 shall I do unto thee,</I> having done so much against thee?" Are we 
 convinced that we have sinned, and are we brought to own it? We cannot 
 but conclude that something must be done to prevent the fatal 
 consequences of it. The matter must not rest as it is, but some course 
 must be taken to undo what has been ill done. And, if we are truly 
 sensible of the danger we have run ourselves into, we shall be willing 
 to do any thing, to take a pardon upon any terms; and therefore shall 
 be <I>inquisitive as to what we shall do</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:6,7">Mic. vi. 6, 7</A>),

 what we shall do to God, not to satisfy the demands of his justice
 (that is done only by the Mediator), but to qualify ourselves for the 
 tokens of his favour, according to the tenour of the gospel-covenant. 
 In making this enquiry it is good to eye God as the preserver or 
 Saviour of men, not their destroyer. In our repentance we must keep up 
 good thoughts of God, as one that delights not in the ruin of his 
 creatures, but would rather they should return and live. "Thou art the 
 Saviour of men; be my Saviour, for I cast myself upon thy mercy."

 (3.) He earnestly begs for the forgiveness of his sins, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 The heat of his spirit, as, on the one hand, it made his complaints the
 more bitter, so, on the other hand, it made his prayers the more lively 
 and importunate; as here: <I>"Why dost thou not pardon my 
 transgression?</I> Art thou not a God of infinite mercy, that art ready 
 to forgive? Hast not thou wrought repentance in me? Why then dost thou 
 not give me the pardon of my sin, and make me to hear the voice of that 
 joy and gladness?" Surely he means more than barely the removing of his 
 outward trouble, and is herein earnest for the return of God's favour, 
 which he complained of the want of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:4"><I>ch.</I> vi. 4</A>.

 "Lord, pardon my sins, and give me the comfort of that pardon, and then
 I can easily bear my afflictions," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:2,Isa+33:24">Matt. ix. 2; Isa. xxxiii. 24</A>.

 When the mercy of God pardons the transgression that is committed by us
 the grace of God takes away the iniquity that reigns in us. Wherever 
 God removes the guilt of sin he breaks the power of sin.  

 (4.) To enforce his prayer for pardon he pleads the prospect he had of
 dying quickly: <I>For now shall I sleep in the dust.</I> Death will lay 
 us in the dust, will lay us to sleep there, and perhaps presently, now 
 in a little time. Job had been complaining of restless nights, and that 
 sleep departed from his eyes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:3,4,13,14"><I>v.</I> 3, 4, 13, 14</A>);

 but those who cannot sleep on a bed of down will shortly sleep in a bed
 of dust, and not be scared with dreams nor tossed to and fro: "<I>Thou 
 shalt seek me in the morning,</I> to show me favour, but <I>I shall not 
 be;</I> it will be too late then. If my sins be not pardoned while I 
 live, I am lost and undone for ever." Note, The consideration of this, 
 that we must shortly die, and perhaps may die suddenly, should make us 
 all very solicitous to get our sins pardoned and our iniquity taken 
 away.</P>
