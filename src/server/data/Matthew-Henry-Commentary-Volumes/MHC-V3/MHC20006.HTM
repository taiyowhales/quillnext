 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, <I>if</I> thou hast
 stricken thy hand with a stranger,
 &nbsp; 2  Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken
 with the words of thy mouth.
 &nbsp; 3  Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come
 into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure
 thy friend.
 &nbsp; 4  Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
 &nbsp; 5  Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand <I>of the hunter,</I> and
 as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is the excellency of the word of God that it teaches us not only 
 divine wisdom for another world, but human prudence for this world, 
 that we may order our affairs with discretion; and this is one good 
 rule, To avoid suretiship, because by it poverty and ruin are often 
 brought into families, which take away that comfort in relations which 
 he had recommended in the foregoing chapter. 

 1. We must look upon suretiship as a snare and decline it accordingly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 "It is dangerous enough for a man to be bound for his friend, though it 
 be one whose circumstances he is well acquainted with, and well assured 
 of his sufficiency, but much more to <I>strike the hands with a 
 stranger,</I> to become surety for one whom thou dost not know to be 
 either able or honest." Or the stranger here with whom the hand is 
 stricken is the creditor, "the usurer to whom thou art become bound, 
 and yet as to thee he is a stranger, that is, thou owest him nothing, 
 nor hast had any dealings with him. If thou hast rashly entered into 
 such engagements, either wheedled into them or in hopes to have the 
 same kindness done for thee another time, know that <I>thou art snared 
 with the words of thy mouth;</I> it was easily done, with a word's 
 speaking; it was but setting thy hand to a paper, a bond is soon sealed 
 and delivered, and a recognizance entered into. But it will not be so 
 easily got clear of; thou art <I>in a snare</I> more than thou art 
 aware of." See how little reason we have to make light of tongue-sins; 
 if by a word of our mouth we may become indebted to men, and lie open 
 to their actions, by the words of our mouth we may become obnoxious to 
 God's justice, and even so may be snared. It is false that words are 
 but wind: they are often snares. 

 2. If we have been drawn into this snare, it will be our wisdom by all 
 means, with all speed, to get out of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>.

 It sleeps for the present; we hear nothing of it. The debt is not 
 demanded; the principal says, "Never fear, we will take care of it." 
 But still the bond is in force, interest is running on, the creditor 
 may come upon thee when he will and perhaps may be hasty and severe, 
 the principal may prove either knavish or insolvent, and then thou must 
 rob thy wife and children, and ruin thy family, to pay that which thou 
 didst neither nor drink for. And therefore <I>deliver thyself;</I> rest 
 not till either the creditor give up the bond or the principal give 
 thee counter-security; when <I>thou art come into the hand of thy 
 friend,</I> and he has advantage against thee, it is no time to 
 threaten or give ill language (that will provoke and make ill worse), 
 but <I>humble thyself,</I> beg and pray to be discharged, go down on 
 thy knees to him, and give him all the fair words thou canst; engage 
 thy friends to speak for thee; leave no stone unturned till thou hast 
 agreed with thy adversary and compromised the matter, so that thy bond 
 may not come against thee or thine. This is a care which may well break 
 thy sleep, and let it do so till thou hast got through. "<I>Give not 
 sleep to thy eyes</I> till thou hast <I>delivered thyself.</I> Strive 
 and struggle to the utmost, and hasten with all speed, <I>as a roe</I> 
 or a <I>bird</I> delivers herself out of this snare of <I>the 
 fowler</I> or hunter. Delays are dangerous, and feeble efforts will not 
 serve." See what care God, in his word, has taken to make men good 
 husbands of their estates, and to teach them prudence in the management 
 of them. <I>Godliness</I> has precepts, as well as promises, relating 
 to <I>the life that now is.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 But how are we to understand this? We are not to think it is unlawful 
 in any case to become surety, or bail, for another; it may be a piece 
 of justice or charity; he that has friends may see cause in this 
 instance to show himself friendly, and it may be no piece of 
 imprudence. Paul became bound for Onesimus, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Phile+1:19">Philem. 19</A>.

 We may help a young man into business that we know to be honest and
 diligent, and gain him credit by passing our word for him, and so do 
 him a great kindness without any detriment to ourselves. But,

 1. It is every man's wisdom to keep out of debt as much as may be, for
 it is an incumbrance upon him, entangles him in the world, puts him in 
 danger of doing wrong or suffering wrong. The <I>borrower is servant to 
 the lender,</I> and makes himself very much a slave to this world. 
 Christians therefore, who are <I>bought with a price,</I> should not 
 thus, without need, make themselves <I>the servants of men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:23">1 Cor. vii. 23</A>.

 2. It is great folly to entangle ourselves with necessitous people, and 
 to become bound for their debts, that are ever and anon taking up 
 money, and lading, as we say, out of one hole into another, for it is 
 ten to one but, some time or other, it will come upon us. A man ought 
 never to be bound as surety for more than he is both able and willing 
 to pay, and can afford to pay without wronging his family, in case the 
 principal fail, for he ought to look upon it as his own debt. 
 
 <U>Ecclesiasticus viii. 13</U>,

 <I>Be not surety above thy power, for, if thou be surety, thou must
 take care to pay it.</I> 

 3. It is a necessary piece of after-wit, if we have foolishly entangled 
 ourselves, to get out of the snare as fast as we can, to lose no time, 
 spare no pains, and stick at no submission to make ourselves safe and 
 easy, and get our affairs into a good posture.  It is better to humble 
 ourselves for an accommodation than to ruin ourselves by our stiffness 
 and haughtiness.  <I>Make sure thy friend</I> by getting clear from thy 
 engagements from him; for rash suretiship is as much the bane of 
 friendship as that which is prudent is sometimes the bond of it. Let us 
 take heed lest we any way make ourselves guilty of other men's sins 
 against God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:22">1 Tim.  v. 22</A>),

 for that is worse, and much more dangerous, than being bound for other 
 men's debts; and, if we must be in all this care to get our debts to 
 men forgiven, much more to get our peace made with God. "<I>Humble 
 thyself</I> to him; <I>make sure</I> of Christ <I>thy friend,</I> to 
 intercede for thee; pray earnestly that thy sins may be pardoned, and 
 thou mayest be delivered from going down to the pit, and it shall not 
 be in vain. <I>Give not sleep to thy eyes nor slumber to thy eye 
 lids,</I> till this be done."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
 &nbsp; 7  Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
 &nbsp; 8  Provideth her meat in the summer, <I>and</I> gathereth her food in
 the harvest.
 &nbsp; 9  How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise
 out of thy sleep?
 &nbsp; 10  <I>Yet</I> a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of
 the hands to sleep:
 &nbsp; 11  So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy
 want as an armed man.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon, in these verses, addresses himself to the sluggard who loves 
 his ease, lives in idleness, minds no business, sticks to nothing, 
 brings nothing to pass, and in a particular manner is careless in the 
 business of religion. Slothfulness is as sure a way to poverty, though 
 not so short a way, as rash suretiship. He speaks here to the 
 sluggard,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By way of instruction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>.

 He sends him to school, for sluggards must be schooled. He is to take 
 him to school himself, for, if the scholar will take no pains, the 
 master must take the more; the sluggard is not willing to come to 
 school to him (dreaming scholars will never love wakeful teachers) and 
 therefore he has found him out another school, as low as he can desire.  
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The master he is sent to school to: <I>Go to the ant, to the 
 bee,</I> so the LXX. Man is taught more than the beasts of the
 earth, and made wiser than the fowls of heaven, and yet is so
 degenerated that he may learn wisdom from the meanest insects and be
 shamed by them. When we observe the wonderful sagacities of the 
 inferior creatures we must not only give glory to the God of nature, 
 who has made them thus strangely, but receive instruction to ourselves; 
 by spiritualizing common things, we may make the things of God both 
 easy and ready to us, and converse with them daily.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The application of mind that is required in order to learn of this 
 master: <I>Consider her ways.</I> The sluggard is so because he does 
 not consider; nor shall we ever learn to any purpose, either by the 
 word or the works of God, unless we set ourselves to consider. 
 Particularly, if we would imitate others in that which is good, we must 
 consider their ways, diligently observe what they do, that we may do 
 likewise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:17">Phil.  iii. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The lesson that is to be learned. In general, learn wisdom, 
 <I>consider, and be wise;</I> that is the thing we are to aim at in all 
 our learning, not only to be knowing, but to be wise. In particular, 
 learn to <I>provide meat in summer;</I> that is, 

 (1.) We must prepare for hereafter, and not mind the present time only, 
 not eat up all, and lay up nothing, but in gathering time treasure up 
 for a spending time.  Thus provident we must be in our worldly affairs, 
 not with an anxious care, but with a prudent foresight; lay in for 
 winter, for straits and wants that may happen, and for old age; much 
 more in the affairs of our souls. We must provide meat and food, that 
 which is substantial and will stand us in stead, and which we shall 
 most need. In the enjoyment of the means of grace provide for the want 
 of them, in life for death, in time for eternity; in the state of 
 probation and preparation we must provide for the state of retribution.

 (2.) We must take pains, and labour in our business, yea, though we 
 labour under inconveniences.  Even <I>in summer,</I> when the weather 
 is hot, the ant is busy in <I>gathering food</I> and laying it up, and 
 does not indulge her ease, nor take her pleasure, as the grasshopper, 
 that sings and sports in the summer and then perishes in the winter. 
 The ants help one another; if one have a grain of corn too big for her 
 to carry home, her neighbours will come in to her assistance. 

 (3.) We must improve opportunities, we must gather when it is to be 
 had, as the ant does in summer and harvest, in the proper time. It is 
 our wisdom to improve the season while that favours us, because that 
 may be done then which cannot be done at all, or not so well done, at 
 another time.  <I>Walk while you have the light.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The advantages which we have of learning this lesson above what the 
 ant has, which will aggravate our slothfulness and neglect if we idle 
 away our time. She has <I>no guides, overseers,</I> and <I>rulers,</I> 
 but does it of herself, following the instinct of nature; the more 
 shame for us who do not in like manner follow the dictates of our own 
 reason and conscience, though besides them we have parents, masters, 
 ministers, magistrates, to put us in mind of our duty, to check us for 
 the neglect of it, to quicken us to it, to direct us in it, and to call 
 us to an account about it. The greater helps we have for working out 
 our salvation the more inexcusable shall we be if we neglect it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. By way of reproof, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:9-11"><I>v.</I> 9-11</A>.
 
 In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He expostulates with the sluggard, rebuking him and reasoning with 
 him, calling him to his work, as a master does his servant that has 
 over-slept himself: "<I>How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard?</I> How 
 long wouldst thou sleep if one would let thee alone? <I>When wilt 
 thou</I> think it time to <I>arise?</I>" Sluggards should be roused 
 with a <I>How long?</I> This is applicable, 

 (1.) To those that are slothful in the way of work and duty, in the 
 duties of their particular calling as men or their general calling as 
 Christians. "<I>How long wilt thou</I> waste thy time, and <I>when wilt 
 thou</I> be a better husband of it? <I>How long wilt thou</I> love thy 
 ease, and <I>when wilt thou</I> learn to deny thyself, and to take 
 pains? <I>How long wilt thou</I> bury thy talents, and <I>when wilt 
 thou</I> begin to trade with them? <I>How long wilt thou</I> delay, and 
 put off, and trifle away thy opportunities, as one regardless of 
 hereafter; and <I>when wilt thou</I> stir up thyself to do what thou 
 hast to do, which, if it be not done, will leave thee for ever undone?"

 (2.) To those that are secure in the way of sin and danger: "Hast thou 
 not slept enough? Is it not far in the day? Does not thy Master call? 
 Are not the Philistines upon thee? When then wilt thou arise?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He exposes the frivolous excuses he makes for himself, and shows how 
 ridiculous he makes himself. When he is roused he stretched himself, 
 and begs, as for alms, for more <I>sleep,</I> more <I>slumber;</I> he 
 is well in his warm bed, and cannot endure to think of rising, 
 especially of rising to work. But, observe, he promises himself and his 
 master that he will desire but <I>a little</I> more <I>sleep, a 
 little</I> more <I>slumber,</I> and then he will get up and go to his 
 business. But herein he deceives himself; the more a slothful temper is 
 indulged the more it prevails; let him sleep awhile, and slumber 
 awhile, and still he is in the same tune; still he asks for <I>a 
 little</I> more <I>sleep, yet a little</I> more; he never thinks he has 
 enough, and yet, when he is called, pretends he will come presently. 
 Thus men's great work is left undone by being put off yet a little 
 longer, <I>de die in diem--from day to day;</I> and they are cheated of
 all their time by being cheated of the present moments.  A little more 
 sleep proves an everlasting sleep. <I>Sleep on now, and take your 
 rest.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He gives him fair warning of the fatal consequences of his 
 slothfulness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 (1.) <I>Poverty and want</I> will certainly come upon those that are 
 slothful in their business. If men neglect their affairs, they not only 
 will not go forward, but they will go backward.  He that leaves his 
 concerns at sixes and sevens will soon see them go to wreck and ruin, 
 and bring his noble to nine-pence. Spiritual poverty comes upon those 
 that are slothful in the service of God; those will want oil, when they 
 should use it, that provide it not in their vessels. 

 (2.) "It will come silently and insensibly, will grow upon thee, and 
 come step by step, <I>as one that travels,</I> but will without fail 
 come at last." <I>It will leave thee as naked as if thou wert stripped 
 by a highwayman;</I> so bishop Patrick. 

 (3.) "It will come irresistibly, <I>like an armed man,</I> whom thou 
 canst not oppose nor make thy part good against."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward
 mouth.
 &nbsp; 13  He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he

 &nbsp; 14  Frowardness <I>is</I> in his heart, he deviseth mischief

 &nbsp; 19  A false witness <I>that</I> speaketh lies, and he that soweth

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon here gives us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The characters of one that is mischievous to man and dangerous to be 
 dealt with. If the slothful are to be condemned, that do nothing, much 
 more those that do ill, and contrive to do all the ill they can. It is 
 a <I>naughty person</I> that is here spoken of, Heb. <I>A man of 
 Belial;</I> I think it should have been so translated, because it is a 
 term often used in scripture, and this is the explication of it.  
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How a man of Belial is here described. He is <I>a wicked man,</I> 
 that makes a trade of doing evil, especially with his tongue, for he 
 <I>walks</I> and works his designs <I>with a froward mouth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 by lying and perverseness, and a direct opposition to God and man. He
 says and does every thing, 

 (1.) Very artfully and with design. He has the subtlety of the serpent, 
 and carries on his projects with a great deal of craft and management

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 <I>with his eyes, with his feet, with his fingers.</I> He expresses his
 malice <I>when he dares not speak out</I> (so some), or, rather, thus 
 he carries on his plot; those about him, whom he makes use of as the 
 tools of his wickedness, understand the ill meaning of a wink of his 
 eye, a stamp of his feet, the least motion of his fingers. He gives 
 orders for evil-doing, and yet would not be thought to do so, but has 
 ways of concealing what he does, so that he may not be suspected. He is 
 a close man, and upon the reserve; those only shall be let into the 
 secret that would do any thing he would have them to do. He is a 
 cunning man, and upon the trick; he has a language by himself, which an 
 honest man is not acquainted with, nor desires to be. 

 (2.) Very spitefully and with ill design. It is not so much ambition or 
 covetousness that <I>is in his heart,</I> as downright 
 <I>frowardness,</I> malice, and ill nature. He aims not so much to 
 enrich and advance himself as to do an ill turn to those about him. He 
 is <I>continually devising</I> one <I>mischief</I> or other, purely for 
 mischief-sake--a man of Belial indeed, of the devil, resembling him not 
 only in subtlety, but in malice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What his doom is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>His calamity shall come</I> and <I>he shall be broken;</I> he that 
 devised mischief shall fall into mischief.  His ruin shall come, 

 (1.) Without warning. It shall come suddenly: <I>Suddenly shall he be 
 broken,</I> to punish him for all the wicked arts he had to surprise 
 people into his snares.

 (2.) Without relief. He shall be irreparably broken, and never able to 
 piece again: <I>He shall be broken without remedy.</I> What relief can 
 he expect that has disobliged all mankind?  <I>He shall come to his end 
 and none shall help him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:45">Dan.  xi. 45</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A catalogue of those things which are in a special manner odious to 
 God, all which are generally to be found in those men of Belial whom he 
 had described in the foregoing verses; and the last of them (which, 
 being the seventh, seems especially to be intended, because he says 
 they are six, yea, seven) is part of his character, that he <I>sows 
 discord.</I> God hates sin; he hates every sin; he can never be 
 reconciled to it; he hates nothing but sin. But there are some sins 
 which he does in a special manner hate; and all those here mentioned 
 are such as are injurious to our neighbour. It is an evidence of the 
 good-will God bears to mankind that those sins are in a special manner 
 provoking to him which are prejudicial to the comfort of human life and 
 society. <I>Therefore</I> the men of Belial must expect their ruin to 
 <I>come suddenly,</I> and <I>without remedy,</I> because their 
 practices are such as the Lord hates and <I>are an abomination to 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Those things which God hates it is no thanks to us to hate in others, 
 but we must hate them in ourselves. 

 1. Haughtiness, conceitedness of ourselves, and contempt of
 others--<I>a proud look.</I> There are seven things that God hates, and 
 pride is the first, because it is at the bottom of much sin and gives 
 rise to it. God sees the pride in the heart and hates it there; but, 
 when it prevails to that degree that the show of men's countenance 
 witnesses against them that they overvalue themselves and undervalue 
 all about them, this is in a special manner hateful to him, for then 
 pride is proud of itself and sets shame at defiance. 

 2. Falsehood, and fraud, and dissimulation.  Next to a <I>proud 
 look</I> nothing is more an abomination to God than <I>a lying 
 tongue;</I> nothing more sacred than truth, nor more necessary to 
 conversation than speaking truth. God and all good men hate and abhor 
 lying. 

 3. Cruelty and blood-thirstiness. The devil was, from the beginning, a
 liar and a murderer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:44">John viii. 44</A>),

 and therefore, as <I>a lying tongue,</I> so <I>hands that shed innocent 
 blood</I> are hateful to God, because they have in them the devil's 
 image and do him service. 

 4. Subtlety in the contrivance of sin, wisdom to do evil, <I>a heart 
 that</I> designs and a head that <I>devises wicked imaginations,</I> 
 that is acquainted with the depths of Satan and knows how to carry on a 
 covetous, envious, revengeful plot, most effectually.  The more there 
 is of craft and management in sin the more it is an abomination to God. 

 5. Vigour and diligence in the prosecution of sin--<I>feet that are
 swift in running to mischief,</I> as if they were afraid of losing time 
 or were impatient of delay in a thing they are so greedy of. The policy 
 and vigilance, the eagerness and industry, of sinners, in their sinful 
 pursuits, may shame us who go about that which is good so awkwardly and 
 so coldly. 

 6. False-witness bearing, which is one of the greatest mischiefs that 
 the wicked imagination can devise, and against which there is least 
 fence. There cannot be a greater affront to God (to whom in an oath 
 appeal is made) nor a greater injury to our neighbour (all whose 
 interests in this world, even the dearest, lie open to an attack of 
 this kind) than knowingly to give in a false testimony. There are seven 
 things which God hates, and lying involves two of them; he hates it, 
 and doubly hates it. 

 7. Making mischief between relations and neighbours, and using all
 wicked means possible, not only to alienate their affections one from 
 another, but to irritate their passions one against another. The God of 
 love and peace hates <I>him that sows discord among brethren,</I> for 
 he delights in concord. Those that by tale-bearing and slandering, by 
 carrying ill-natured stories, aggravating every thing that is said and 
 done, and suggesting jealousies and evil surmises, blow the coals of 
 contention, are but preparing for themselves a fire of the same 
 nature.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the
 law of thy mother:
 &nbsp; 21  Bind them continually upon thine heart, <I>and</I> tie them about
 thy neck.
 &nbsp; 22  When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it

 &nbsp; 23  For the commandment <I>is</I> a lamp; and the law <I>is</I> light; and
 reproofs of instruction <I>are</I> the way of life:

 &nbsp; 25  Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her

 &nbsp; 27  Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, I. A general exhortation faithfully to adhere to the word of 
 God and to take it for our guide in all our actions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We must look upon the word of God both as a light 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>)

 and as a law, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:20,23"><I>v.</I> 20, 23</A>.

 (1.) By its arguments it is a light, which our understandings must 
 subscribe to; it <I>is a lamp</I> to our eyes for discovery, and so to 
 our feet for direction. The word of God reveals to us truths of eternal 
 certainty, and is built upon the highest reason.  Scripture-light is 
 the sure light. 

 (2.) By its authority it is a law, which our wills must submit to. As 
 never such a light shone out of the schools of the philosophers, so 
 never such a law issued from the throne of any prince, so well framed, 
 and so binding. It is such a law as is a lamp and a light, for it 
 carries with it the evidence of its own goodness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We must receive it as <I>our father's commandment</I> and <I>the law 
 of our mother,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 It is God's commandment and his law. But,
 
 (1.) Our parents directed us to it, put it into our hands, trained us 
 up in the knowledge and observance of it, its original and obligation 
 being most sacred. We believe indeed, not for their saying, for we have 
 tried it ourselves and find it to be of God; but we were beholden to 
 them for recommending it to us, and see all the reason in the world to 
 <I>continue in the things we have learned, knowing of whom we have 
 learned them.</I> 

 (2.) The cautions, counsels, and commands which our parents gave us 
 agree with the word of God, and therefore we must hold them fast. 
 Children, when they are grown up, must remember <I>the law of</I> a 
 good <I>mother,</I> as well as the <I>commandment</I> of a good 
 <I>father,</I>

 <U>Ecclesiasticus iii. 2</U>.

 <I>The Lord has given the father honour over the children and has 
 confirmed the authority of the mother over the sons.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We must retain the word of God and the good instructions which our 
 parents gave us out of it. 

 (1.) We must never cast them off, never think it a mighty achievement 
 (as some do) to get clear of the restraints of a good education: 
 "<I>Keep thy father's commandment,</I> keep it still, and never forsake 
 it."

 (2.) We must never lay them by, no, not for a time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Bind them continually,</I> not only <I>upon thy hand</I> (as Moses 
 had directed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:8">Deut. vi. 8</A>)

 but <I>upon thy heart.</I> Phylacteries upon the hand were of no value 
 at all, any further than they occasioned pious thoughts and affections 
 in the heart. There the word must be written, there it must be hid, and 
 laid close to the conscience. <I>Tie them about thy neck,</I> as an 
 ornament, a bracelet, or gold chain,--<I>about thy throat</I> (so the 
 word is); let them be a guard upon that pass; tie them about thy 
 throat, that no forbidden fruit may be suffered to go in nor any evil 
 word suffered to go out through the throat; and thus a great deal of 
 sin would be prevented. Let the word of God be always ready to us, and 
 let us feel the impressions of it, as of that which is bound upon our 
 hearts and about our necks.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. We must make use of the word of God and of the benefit that is 
 designed us by it. If we bind it continually upon our hearts, 

 (1.) It will be our guide, and we must follow its direction. "<I>When 
 thou goest, it shall lead thee</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>);

 it shall lead thee into, and lead thee in, the good and right way,
 shall lead thee from, and lead thee out of, every sinful dangerous 
 path. It will say unto thee, when thou art ready to turn aside, <I>This 
 is the way; walk in it.</I> It will be that to thee that the pillar of 
 cloud and fire was to Israel in the wilderness. Be led by that, let it 
 be thy rule, and then thou shalt be led by the Spirit; he will be thy 
 monitor and support." 

 (2.) It will be our guard, and we must put ourselves under the 
 protection of it: "<I>When thou sleepest,</I> and liest exposed to the 
 malignant powers of darkness, <I>it shall keep thee;</I> thou shalt be 
 safe, and shalt think thyself so." If we govern ourselves by the 
 precepts of the word all day, and make conscience of the duty God has 
 commanded to us, we may shelter ourselves under the promises of the 
 word at night, and take the comfort of the deliverances God does and 
 will command for us. 

 (3.) It will be our companion, and we must converse with it: "<I>When 
 thou awakest</I> in the night, and knowest not how to pass away thy 
 waking minutes, if thou pleasest, <I>it shall talk with thee,</I> and 
 entertain thee with pleasant meditations in the night-watch; <I>when 
 thou awakest</I> in the morning, and art contriving the work of the 
 day, <I>it shall talk with thee</I> about it, and help thee to contrive 
 for the best,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:2">Ps. i. 2</A>.

 The word of God has something to say to us upon all occasions, if we 
 would but enter into discourse with it, would ask it what it has to 
 say, and give it the hearing. And it would contribute to our close and 
 comfortable walking with God all day if we would begin with him in the 
 morning and let his word be the subject of our first thoughts. <I>When 
 I awake I am still with thee;</I> we are so if the word be still with 
 us. 

 (4.) It will be our life; for, as the law <I>is a lamp</I> and <I>a 
 light</I> for the present, so the <I>reproofs of instruction are the 
 way of life.</I> Those reproofs of the word which not only show us our 
 faults, but instruct us how to do better, are the way that leads to 
 life, eternal life. Let not faithful reproofs therefore, which have 
 such a direct tendency to make us happy, ever make us uneasy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is a particular caution against the sin of uncleanness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. When we consider how much this iniquity abounds, how heinous it is 
 in its own nature, of what pernicious consequence it is, and how 
 certainly destructive to all the seeds of the spiritual life in the 
 soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often 
 repeated and so largely inculcated. 

 (1.) One great kindness God designed men, in giving them his law, was 
 to preserve them from this sin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 "The reproofs of instruction are therefore <I>the way of life</I> to 
 thee, because they are designed <I>to keep thee from the evil 
 woman,</I> who will be certain death to thee, from being enticed by 
 <I>the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman,</I> who pretends to 
 love thee, but intends to ruin thee." Those that will be wrought upon 
 by flattery make themselves a very easy prey to the tempter; and those 
 who would avoid that snare must take well-instructed reproofs as great 
 kindnesses and be thankful to those that will deal faithfully with 
 them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:5,6">Prov. xxvii. 5, 6</A>.

 (2.) The greatest kindness we can do ourselves is to keep at a distance 
 from this sin, and to look upon it with the utmost dread and 
 detestation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 "<I>Lust not after her beauty,</I> no, not <I>in thy heart,</I> for, if 
 thou dost, thou hast <I>there</I> already <I>committed adultery with 
 her.</I> Talk not of the charms in her face, neither be thou smitten 
 with her amorous glances; they are all snares and nets; <I>let her</I> 
 not <I>take thee with her eye-lids.</I> Her looks are arrows and fiery 
 darts; they wound, they kill, in another sense than what lovers mean; 
 they call it a pleasing captivity, but it is a destroying one, it is 
 worse than Egyptian slavery."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Divers arguments Solomon here urges to enforce this caution against 
 the sin of whoredom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It is a sin that impoverishes men, wastes their estates, and 
 reduces them to beggary 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 <I>By means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of 
 bread;</I> many a man has been so, who has purchased the ruin of his 
 body and soul at the expense of his wealth.  The prodigal son spent his 
 living on harlots, so that he brought himself to be fellow-commoner 
 with the swine. And that poverty must needs lie heavily which men bring 
 themselves into by their own folly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:12">Job xxxi. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It threatens death; it kills men: <I>The adulteress will hunt for 
 the precious life,</I> perhaps designedly, as Delilah for Samson's, at 
 least, eventually, the sin strikes at the life. Adultery was punished 
 by the law of Moses as a capital crime.  <I>The adulterer and the 
 adulteress shall surely be put to death.</I> Every one knew this. Those 
 therefore who, for the gratifying of a base lust, would lay themselves 
 open to the law, could be reckoned no better than self-murderers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) It brings guilt upon the conscience and debauches that. He that 
 <I>touches his neighbour's wife,</I> with an immodest touch, cannot 
 <I>be innocent,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 [1.] He is in imminent danger of adultery, as he that <I>takes fire in 
 his bosom,</I> or <I>goes upon hot coals,</I> is in danger of being 
 <I>burnt.</I> The way of this sin is down-hill, and those that venture 
 upon the temptations to it hardly escape the sin itself. The fly fools 
 away her life by playing the wanton with the flames. It is a deep pit, 
 which it is madness to venture upon the brink of. He that keeps company 
 with those of ill fame, that goes in with them, and touches them, 
 cannot long preserve his innocency; he thrusts himself into temptation 
 and so throws himself out of God's protection. 

 [2.] He that commits adultery is in the high road to destruction. The 
 bold presumptuous sinner says, "I may venture upon the sin and yet 
 escape the punishment; I shall have peace though I go on." He might as 
 well say, I will <I>take fire into my bosom and not burn my 
 clothes,</I> or I will <I>go upon hot coals and not burn my feet. He 
 that goes into his neighbour's wife,</I> however he holds himself, God 
 will not hold him guiltless.  The fire of lust kindles the fire of 
 hell.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) It ruins the reputation and entails perpetual infamy upon that. It 
 is a much more scandalous sin than stealing is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:30-33"><I>v.</I> 30-33</A>.

 Perhaps it is not so in the account of men, at least not in our day. A 
 thief is sent to the stocks, to the gaol, to Bridewell, to the gallows, 
 while the vile adulterer goes unpunished, nay, with many, unblemished; 
 he dares boast of his villanies, and they are made but a jest of. But, 
 in the account of God and his law, adultery was much the more enormous 
 crime; and, if God is the fountain of honour, his word must be the 
 standard of it. 

 [1.] As for the sin of stealing, if a man were brought to it by extreme 
 necessity, if he stole meat for the <I>satisfying of his soul when he 
 was hungry,</I> though that will not excuse him from guilt, yet it is 
 such an extenuation of his crime that <I>men do not despise</I> him, do 
 not expose him to ignominy, but pity him. Hunger will break through 
 stone-walls, and blame will be laid upon those that brought him to 
 poverty, or that did not relieve him. Nay, though he have not that to 
 say in his excuse, <I>if he be found</I> stealing, and the evidence be 
 ever so plain upon him, yet he shall only make restitution 
 <I>seven-fold.</I> The law of Moses appointed that he who stole a sheep 
 should restore four-fold, and an ox five-fold

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:1">Exod. xxii. 1</A>);

 accordingly David adjudged, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:6">2 Sam. xii. 6</A>.

 But we may suppose in those cases concerning which the law had not made 
 provision the judges afterwards settled the penalties in proportion to 
 the crimes, according to the equity of the law. Now, if he that stole 
 an ox out of a man's field must restore five-fold, it was reasonable 
 that he that stole a man's goods out of his house should <I>restore 
 seven-fold;</I> for there was no law to put him to death, as with us, 
 for burglary and robbery on the highway, and of this worst kind of 
 theft Solomon here speaks; the greatest punishment was that a man might 
 be forced to <I>give all the substance of his house</I> to satisfy the 
 law and his blood was not attainted. But, 

 [2.] Committing adultery is a more heinous crime; Job calls it so, and 
 <I>an iniquity to be punished by the judge,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:11">Job xxxi. 11</A>.

 When Nathan would convict David of the evil of his adultery he did it 
 by a parable concerning the most aggravated theft, which, in David's 
 judgment, deserved to be punished with death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:5">2 Sam. xii. 5</A>),

 and then showed him that his sin was <I>more exceedingly sinful</I> 
 than that.  <I>First,</I> It is a greater reproach to a man's reason, 
 for he cannot excuse it, as a thief may, by saying that it was to 
 satisfy his hunger, but must own that it was to gratify a brutish lust 
 which would break the hedge of God's law, not for want, but for 
 wantonness.  Therefore <I>whoso commits adultery with a woman lacks 
 understanding,</I> and deserves to be stigmatized as an arrant fool.  
 <I>Secondly,</I> It is more severely punished by the law of God. A 
 thief suffered only a pecuniary mulct, but the adulterer suffered 
 death. The thief <I>steals to satisfy his soul,</I> but the adulterer 
 <I>destroys his own soul,</I> and falls an unpitied sacrifice to the 
 justice both of God and man. "Sinner, thou hast destroyed thyself." 
 This may be applied to the spiritual and eternal death which is the 
 consequence of sin; <I>he that does it</I> wounds his conscience, 
 corrupts his rational power, extinguishes all the sparks of the 
 spiritual life, and exposes himself to the wrath of God for ever, and 
 thus <I>destroys his own soul.  Thirdly,</I> The infamy of it is 
 indelible, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 It will be <I>a wound</I> to his good name, a <I>dishonour</I> to his 
 family, and, though the guilt of it may be done away by repentance, the 
 <I>reproach</I> of it never will, but will stick to his memory when he 
 is gone. David's sin in the matter of Uriah was not only a perpetual 
 blemish upon his own character, but gave occasion to the enemies of the 
 Lord to blaspheme his name too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) It exposes the adulterer to the rage of the jealous husband, whose 
 honour he puts such an affront upon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>.

 He that touches his neighbour's wife, and is familiar with her, gives 
 him occasion for jealousy, much more he that debauches her, which, if 
 kept ever so secret, might then be <I>discovered by the waters of 
 jealousy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+5:12">Num. v. 12</A>.

 "When discovered, thou hadst better meet a bear robbed of her whelps 
 than the injured husband, who, in the case of adultery, will be as 
 severe an avenger of his own honour as, in the case of manslaughter, of 
 his brother's blood. If thou art not afraid of the wrath of God, yet be 
 afraid of the <I>rage of a man.</I> Such jealousy is; it is <I>strong 
 as death</I> and <I>cruel as the grave.</I> In the <I>day of 
 vengeance,</I> when the adulterer comes to be tried for his life, the 
 prosecutor will not spare any pains or cost in the prosecution, will 
 not relent towards thee, as he would perhaps towards one that had 
 robbed him. He will not accept of any commutation, any composition; 
 <I>he will not regard any ransom.</I> Though thou offer to bribe him, 
 and <I>give him many gifts</I> to pacify him, he <I>will not rest 
 content</I> with any thing less than the execution of the law.  Thou 
 must be <I>stoned to death.</I> If <I>a man would give all the 
 substance of his house,</I> it would atone for a theft 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 but not for adultery; in that case it would utterly be contemned.
 <I>Stand in awe therefore, and sin not;</I> expose not thyself to all 
 this misery for a moment's sordid pleasure, which will be bitterness in 
 the end."</P>
