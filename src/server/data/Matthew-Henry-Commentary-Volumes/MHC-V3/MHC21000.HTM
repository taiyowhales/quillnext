 We are still among Solomon's happy men, his happy servants, that 
 <I>stood continually before him to hear his wisdom;</I> and they are 
 the choicest of all the dictates of his wisdom, such as were more 
 immediately given by divine inspiration, that are here transmitted to 
 us, not to be heard, as by them, but once, and then liable to be 
 mistaken or forgotten, and by repetition to lose their beauty, but to 
 be read, reviewed, revolved, and had in everlasting remembrance. The 
 account we have of Solomon's apostasy from God, in the latter end of 
 his reign 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+11:1">1 Kings xi. 1</A>),

 is the tragical part of his story; we may suppose that he spoke his
 <I>Proverbs</I> in the prime of his time, while he kept his integrity,
 but delivered his <I>Ecclesiastes</I> when he had grown old (for of the
 burdens and decays of age he speaks feelingly

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:1-14"><I>ch.</I> xii.</A>),

 and was, by the grace of God, recovered from his backslidings. There he
 dictated his observations; here he wrote his own experiences; this is 
 what days speak, and wisdom which the multitude of years teaches. The 
 title of the book and the penman we shall meet with in the 

 <A HREF="MHC21001.HTM#Ec1_1">first verse</A>,

 and therefore shall here only observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That it is a sermon, a sermon in print; the text is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:2"><I>ch.</I> i. 2</A>),
 
 <I>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity;</I> that is the doctrine too; it
 is proved at large by many arguments and an induction of particulars, 
 and divers objections are answered, and in the close we have the use 
 and application of all, by way of exhortation, to <I>remember our 
 Creator,</I> to <I>fear him,</I> and to <I>keep his commandments.</I> 
 There are indeed many things in this book which are dark and hard to be 
 understood, and some things which men of corrupt minds <I>wrest to 
 their own destruction,</I> for want of distinguishing between Solomon's 
 arguments and the objections of atheists and epicures; but there is 
 enough easy and plain to convince us (if we will admit the conviction) 
 of the vanity of the world, and its utter insufficiency to make us 
 happy, the vileness of sin, and its certain tendency to make us 
 miserable, and of the wisdom of being religious, and the solid comfort 
 and satisfaction that are to be had in doing our duty both to God and 
 man. This should be intended in every sermon, and that is a good sermon 
 by which these points are in any measure gained. 

 II. That it is a penitential sermon, as some of David's psalms are
 penitential psalms; it is a recantation-sermon, in which the preacher 
 sadly laments his own folly and mistake, in promising himself 
 satisfaction in the things of this world, and even in the forbidden 
 pleasures of sense, which now he finds more bitter than death. His fall 
 is a proof of the weakness of man's nature: <I>Let not the wise man 
 glory in his wisdom,</I> nor say, "I shall never be such a fool as to 
 do so and so," when Solomon himself, the wisest of men, played the fool 
 so egregiously; nor <I>let the rich man glory in his riches,</I> since 
 Solomon's wealth was so great a snare to him, and did him a great deal 
 more hurt than Job's poverty did him. His recovery is a proof of the 
 power of God's grace, in bringing one back to God that has gone so far 
 from him; it is a proof too of the riches of God's mercy in accepting 
 him notwithstanding the many aggravations of his sin, pursuant to the 
 promise made to David, that if his children should commit iniquity they 
 should be corrected, but not abandoned and disinherited, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:14,15">2 Sam. vii. 14, 15</A>.

 Let him therefore that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall; and let
 him that has fallen make haste to get up again, and not despair either 
 of assistance or acceptance therein.

 III. That it is a practical profitable sermon. Solomon, being brought
 to repentance, resolves, like his father, to teach transgressors God's 
 way 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:13">Ps. li. 13</A>)

 and to give warning to all to take heed of splitting upon those rocks
 which had been fatal to him; and these were fruits meet for repentance. 
 The fundamental error of the children of men, and that which is at the 
 bottom of all their departures from God, is the same with that of our 
 first parents, hoping to be as gods by entertaining themselves with 
 that which seems good for food, pleasant to the eyes, and desirable to 
 make one wise. Now the scope of this book is to show that this is a 
 great mistake, that our happiness consists not in being as gods to 
 ourselves, to have what we will and do what we will, but in having him 
 that made us to be a God to us. The moral philosophers disputed much 
 about man's felicity, or chief good. Various opinions they had about 
 it; but Solomon, in this book, determines the question, and assures us 
 that to fear God and to keep his commandments is the whole of man. He 
 tried what satisfaction might be found in the wealth of the world and 
 the pleasures of sense, and at last pronounced all vanity and vexation; 
 yet multitudes will not take his word, but will make the same dangerous 
 experiment, and it proves fatal to them.  He, 

 1. Shows the vanity of those things in which men commonly look for
 happiness, as human learning and policy, sensual delight, honour and 
 power, riches and great possessions. And then, 

 2. He prescribes remedies against the vexation of spirit that attends
 them. Though we cannot cure them of their vanity, we may prevent the 
 trouble they give us, by sitting loose to them, enjoying them 
 comfortable, but laying our expectations low from them, and acquiescing 
 in the will of God concerning us in every event, especially by 
 remembering God in the days of our youth, and continuing in his fear 
 and service all our days, with an eye to the judgment to come.</P>
