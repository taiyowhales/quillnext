 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David was a preacher, a royal preacher, as well as Solomon; many of his 
 psalms are doctrinal and practical as well as devotional; the greatest 
 part of this psalm is so, in which Wisdom cries to men, to the sons of 
 men (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:4,5">Prov. viii. 4, 5</A>),

 to receive instruction. The title does not tell us, as that of the
 former did, that it was penned on any particular occasion, nor are we 
 to think that all the psalms were occasional, though some were, but 
 that many of them were designed in general for the instruction of the 
 people of God, who attended in the courts of his house, the assisting 
 of their devotions, and the directing of their conversations: such a 
 one I take this psalm to be. Let us not make the prophecy of scripture 
 to be of more private interpretation than needs must,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:20">2 Pet. i. 20</A>.

 Here 

 I. David begins with a short prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:1">ver. 1</A>)

 and that prayer preaches.

 II. He directs his speech to the children of men, and,

 1. In God's name reproves them for the dishonour they do to God and the
 damage they do to their own souls,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:2">ver. 2</A>.

 2. He sets before them the happiness of godly people for their 
 encouragement to be religious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:3">ver.  3</A>.

 3. He calls upon them to consider their ways, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:4">ver. 4</A>.

 III. He exhorts them to serve God and trust in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:5">ver. 5</A>.

 IV. He gives an account of his own experiences of the grace of God 
 working in him, 

 1.  Enabling him to choose God's favour for his felicity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6">ver. 6</A>.
 
 2. Filling his heart with joy therein, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:7">ver. 7</A>.

 3.  Quieting his spirit in the assurance of the divine protection he 
 was under, night and day,

 <P>To the chief musician on Neginoth. A psalm of David.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me

 The title of the psalm acquaints us that David, having penned it by 
 divine inspiration for the use of the church, delivered it to the chief 
 musician, or master of the song, who (according to the divine 
 appointment of psalmody made in his time, which he was chiefly 
 instrumental in the establishment of) presided in that service. We have 
 a particular account of the constitution, the modelling of the several 
 classes of singers, each with a chief, and the share each bore in the 
 work, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+25:1-31">1 Chron. xxv.</A>

 Some <I>prophesied according to the order of the king,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Others <I>prophesied with a harp, to give thanks, and to praise the 
 Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Of others it is said that they were to <I>lift up the horn,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 But of them all, that they were <I>for song in the house of the 
 Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)
 
 and were <I>instructed in the songs of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 This psalm was committed to one of the chiefs, to be sung on 
 <I>neginoth--stringed instruments</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:19">Hab. iii. 19</A>),

 which were played on with the hand; with music of that kind the 
 choristers were to sing this psalm: and it should seem that then 
 <I>they</I> only sung, not the people; but the New-Testament appoints 
 all Christians to sing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:19,Col+3:16">Eph. v. 19; Col. iii. 16</A>),

 from whom it is expected that they do it decently, not artfully; and
 therefore there is not now so much occasion for musical instruments as 
 there was then: the melody is to be made in the heart. In

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:1-5">these verses,</A></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David addresses himself to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Whether the <I>sons of men,</I> to whom he is about to speak, will 
 hear, or whether they will forbear, he hopes and prays that God will 
 give him a generous audience, and an answer of peace: "<I>Hear me when 
 I call,</I> and accept my adorations, grant my petitions, and judge 
 upon my appeals; <I>have mercy upon me, and hear me.</I>" All the 
 notice God is pleased to take of our prayers, and all the returns he is 
 pleased to make to them, must be ascribed, not to our merit, but purely 
 to his mercy. "Hear me for thy mercy-sake" is our best plea. Two things 
 David here pleads further:--

 1. "Thou art <I>the God of my righteousness;</I> not only a righteous
 God thyself, but the author of my righteous dispositions, who hast by 
 the grace wrought that good that is in me, hast made me a righteous 
 man; therefore <I>hear men,</I> and so attest thy own work in me; thou 
 art also the patron of my righteous cause, the protector of my wronged 
 innocency, to whom I commit my way, and whom I trust to <I>bring forth 
 my righteousness as the light.</I>" When men condemn us unjustly, this 
 is our comfort, <I>It is God that justifies;</I> he is the God of a 
 believer's righteousness.

 2. "<I>Thou has</I> formerly <I>enlarged me when I was in distress,</I> 
 enlarged my heart in holy joy and comfort under my distresses, enlarged 
 my condition by bringing me out of my distresses; therefore <I>now, 
 Lord, have mercy upon me, and hear me.</I>" The experience we have had 
 of God's goodness to us in enlarging us when we have been in distress 
 is not only a great encouragement to our faith and hope for the future, 
 but a good plea with God in prayer. "<I>Thou hast; wilt thou not?</I> 
 For thou art God, and changest not; thy work is perfect."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He addresses himself to the children of men, for the conviction and 
 conversion of those that are yet strangers to God, and that will not 
 have the Messiah, the Son of David, to reign over them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He endeavours to convince them of the folly of their impiety 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>).

 "<I>O you sons of Men</I>" (of <I>great</I> men, so some, men of high 
 degree, understanding it of the partisans of Saul or Absalom), "<I>how 
 long will you</I> oppose me and my government, and continue disaffected 
 to it, under the influence of the false and groundless suggestions of 
 those that wish evil to me?" Or it may be taken more generally. God, by 
 the psalmist, here reasons with sinners to bring them to repentance. 
 "You that go on in the neglect of God and his worship, and in contempt 
 of the kingdom of Christ and his government, consider what you do." 
 
 (1.) "You debase yourselves, for you are <I>sons of men</I>" (the word 
 signifies man as a noble creature); "consider the dignity of your 
 nature, and the excellency of those powers of reason with which you are 
 endued, and do not act thus irrationally and unbecoming yourselves." 
 Let the <I>sons of men</I> consider and show themselves men. 

 (2.) "You dishonour your Maker, and <I>turn his glory into shame.</I>" 
 They may well be taken as God's own words, charging sinners with the 
 wrong they do him in his honour: or, if David's words, the term glory 
 may be understood of God, whom he called <I>his glory,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:3">Ps. iii. 3</A>.

 Idolaters are charged with <I>changing the glory of God</I> into shame,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:23">Rom.  i. 23</A>.

 All wilful sinners do so by disobeying the commands of his law,
 despising the offers of his grace, and giving the affection and service 
 to the creature which are due to God only. Those that profane God's 
 holy name, that ridicule his word and ordinances, and, while they 
 profess to know him, in works deny him, do what in them lies to <I>turn 
 his glory into shame.</I>

 (3.) "You put a cheat upon yourselves: <I>You love vanity,</I> and 
 <I>seek after leasing,</I> or <I>lying,</I> or that which is <I>a 
 lie.</I> You are yourselves vain and lying, and you love to be so." Or, 
 "You set your hearts upon that which will prove, at last, but vanity 
 and a lie." Those that love the world, and seek the things that are 
 beneath, love vanity, and seek lies; as those also do that please 
 themselves with the delights of sense, and portion themselves with the 
 wealth of this world; for these will deceive them, and so ruin them. 
 "How long will you do this? Will you never be wise for yourselves, 
 never consider your duty and interest? <I>When shall it once be?</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:27">Jer. xiii. 27</A>.

 The God of heaven thinks the time long that sinners persist in
 dishonouring him and in deceiving and ruining themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He shows them the peculiar favour which God has for good people, the 
 special protection they are under, and the singular privileges to which 
 they are entitled, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This comes in here, 

 (1.) As a reason why they should not oppose or persecute him that is 
 godly, nor think to run him down. It is at their peril if they 
 <I>offend one of these little ones,</I> whom God has <I>set apart for 
 himself,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:6">Matt. xviii. 6</A>.

 God reckons that those who touch them touch the apple of his eye; and
 he will make their persecutors to know it, sooner or later. They have 
 an interest in heaven, God will hear them, and therefore let none dare 
 to do them any injury, for God will hear their cry and plead their 
 cause, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:23">Exod. xxii. 23</A>.

 It is generally supposed that David speaks of his own designation to
 the throne; he is the <I>godly</I> man whom <I>the Lord has set 
 apart</I> for that honour, and who does not usurp it or assume it to 
 himself: "The opposition therefore which you give to him and to his 
 advancement is very criminal, for the rein you fight against God, and 
 it will be vain and ineffectual." God has, in like manner, set apart 
 the Lord Jesus for himself, that merciful One; and those that attempt 
 to hinder his advancement will certainly be baffled, for the Father 
 hears him always. Or, 

 (2.) As a reason why they should themselves be good, and walk no longer 
 in the counsel of the ungodly: "You have hitherto sought vanity; be 
 truly religious, and you will be truly happy here and for ever; for," 
 
 [1.] "God will secure to himself his interest in you." <I>The Lord has 
 set apart him that is godly,</I> every particular godly man, <I>for 
 himself,</I> in his eternal choice, in his effectual calling, in the 
 special disposals of his providence and operations of his grace; his 
 people are <I>purified unto him a peculiar people.</I> Godly men are 
 God's separated, sealed, ones; he knows those that are his, and has set 
 his image and superscription upon them; he distinguishes them with 
 uncommon favours: <I>They shall be mine, saith the Lord, in that day 
 when I make up my jewels. Know this;</I> let godly people know it, and 
 let them never alienate themselves from him to whom they are thus 
 appropriated; let wicked people know it, and take heed how they hurt 
 those whom God protects.  

 [2.] "God will secure to you an interest in himself." This David speaks 
 with application: <I>The Lord will hear when I call unto him.</I> We 
 should think ourselves happy if we had the ear of an earthly prince; 
 and is it not worth while upon any terms, especially such easy ones, to 
 gain the ear of the King of kings? Let us know this, and forsake lying 
 vanities for our own mercies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He warns them against sin, and exhorts them both to frighten and to 
 reason themselves out of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Stand in awe and sin not</I>" (<I>be angry and sin not,</I> so the 
 LXX., and some think the apostle takes that exhortation from him, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:26">Eph. iv. 26</A>);

 "<I>commune with your own hearts;</I> be converted, and, in order
 thereunto, consider and fear." Note,

 (1.) We must not sin, must not miss our way and so miss our aim. 

 (2.) One good remedy against sin is to stand in awe.  <I>Be moved</I> 
 (so some), in opposition to carelessness and carnal security. "Always 
 keep up a holy reverence of the glory and majesty of God, and a holy 
 dread of his wrath and curse, and dare not to provoke him." 

 (3.) One good means of preventing sin, and preserving a holy awe, is to 
 be frequent and serious in <I>communing with our own hearts: "Talk with 
 your hearts;</I> you have a great deal to say to them; they may be 
 spoken with at any time; let it not be unsaid." A thinking man is in a 
 fair way to be a wise and a good man. "<I>Commune with your hearts;</I> 
 examine them by serious self-reflection, that you may acquaint 
 yourselves with them and amend what is amiss in them; employ them in 
 solemn pious meditations; let your thoughts fasten upon that which is 
 good and keep closely to it.  Consider your ways, and observe the 
 directions here given in order to the doing of this work well and to 
 good purpose." 

 [1.] "Choose a solitary time; do it when you lie awake <I>upon your 
 beds.</I> Before you turn yourself to go to sleep at night" (as some of 
 the heathen moralists have directed) "examine your consciences with 
 respect to what you have done that day, particularly what you have done 
 amiss, that you may repent of it. When you awake in the night meditate 
 upon God, and the things that belong to your peace." David himself 
 practised what he here counsels others to do

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:6">Ps. lxiii. 6</A>),
 
 <I>I remember thee on my bed.</I> Upon a sick-bed, particularly, we
 should consider our ways and commune with our own hearts about them. 
 
 [2.] "Compose yourselves into a serious frame: <I>Be still.</I> When 
 you have asked conscience a question be silent, and wait for an answer; 
 even in unquiet times keep you spirits calm and quiet."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He counsels them to make conscience of their duty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Offer to God the sacrifice of righteousness.</I> We must not only 
 cease to do evil, but learn to do well. Those that were disaffected to 
 David and his government would soon come to a better temper, and return 
 to their allegiance, if they would but worship God aright; and those 
 that know the concerns that lie between them and God will be glad of 
 the Mediator, the Son of David. It is required here from every one of 
 us, 

 (1.) That we serve him: "<I>Offer sacrifices to him,</I> your own 
 selves first, and your best sacrifices." But they must be <I>sacrifices 
 of righteousness,</I> that is, good works, all the fruits of the 
 reigning love of God and our neighbour, and all the instances of a 
 religious conversation, which are better than all burnt-offerings and 
 sacrifices. "Let all your devotions come from an upright heart; let all 
 your alms be sacrifices of righteousness." The sacrifices of the 
 unrighteous God will not accept; they are an abomination, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11-15">Isa. i. 11</A>,

 &c.

 (2.) That we confide in him. "First make conscience of offering the 
 sacrifices of righteousness and then you are welcome to put your trust 
 in the Lord. Serve God without any diffidence of him, or any fear of 
 losing by him. Honour him, by trusting in him only, and not in your 
 wealth nor in an arm of flesh; trust in his providence, and lean not to 
 your own understanding; trust in his grace, and go not about to 
 establish your own righteousness or sufficiency."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:1-4">these verses</A>

 we must preach to ourselves the doctrine of the
 provoking nature of sin, the lying vanity of the world, and the 
 unspeakable happiness of God's people; and we must press upon ourselves 
 the duties of fearing God, conversing with our own hearts, and offering
 spiritual sacrifices; and in praying over 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:1-4">these verses</A>

 we must beg of God grace thus to think and thus to do.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The foolish wish of worldly people: <I>There be many that say, Who 
 will show us any good? Who will make us to see good?</I> What good they 
 meant is intimated, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It was the increase of their corn and wine; all they desired was plenty 
 of the wealth of this world, that they might enjoy abundance of the 
 delights of sense. Thus far they are right, that they are desirous of 
 good and solicitous about it; but there are these things amiss in this 
 wish:--

 1. They enquire, in general, "Who will make us happy?" but do not apply
 themselves to God who alone can; and so they expose themselves to be 
 ill-advised, and show they would rather be beholden to any than to God, 
 for they would willingly live without him.

 2. They enquire for good that may be seen, seeming good, sensible good; 
 and they show no concern for the good things that are out of sight and 
 are the objects of faith only. The source of idolatry was a desire of 
 gods that they might see, therefore they worshipped the sun; but, as we 
 must be taught to worship an unseen God, so to seek an unseen good,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:18">2 Cor. iv. 18</A>.

 We look with an eye of faith further than we can see with an eye of
 sense. 

 3. They enquire for <I>any</I> good, not for the chief good; all they
 want is outward good, present good, partial good, good meat, good 
 drink, a good trade, and a good estate; and what are all these worth 
 without a good God and a good heart? Any good will serve the turn of 
 most men, but a gracious soul will not be put off so. This way, this 
 wish, of carnal worldlings is their folly, yet <I>many there be</I> 
 that join in it; and their doom will be accordingly. "<I>Son, remember 
 that thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good things,</I> the penny 
 thou didst agree for."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The wise choice which godly people make. David, and the pious few 
 that adhered to him, dissented from that wish, and joined in this 
 prayer, <I>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</I> 

 1. He disagrees from the vote of the many.  God had set him apart for
 himself by distinguishing favours, and therefore he sets himself apart 
 by a distinguishing character. "They are for any good, for worldly 
 good, but so am not I; I will not say as they say; any good will not 
 serve my turn; the wealth of the world will never make a portion for my 
 soul, and therefore I cannot take up with it." 

 2. He and his friends agree in their choice of God's favour as their 
 felicity; it is this which in their account is better than life and all 
 the comforts of life.

 (1.) This is what they most earnestly desire and seek after; this is 
 the breathing of their souls, "<I>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy 
 countenance upon us.</I> Most are for other things, but we are for 
 this." Good people, as they are distinguished by their practices, so 
 they are by their prayers, not the length and language of them, but the 
 faith and fervency of them; those whom God has set apart have a prayer 
 by themselves, which, though others may speak the words of it, they 
 only offer up in sincerity; and this is a prayer which they all say 
 <I>Amen</I> to; "Lord, let us have thy favour, and let us know that we 
 have it, and we desire no more; that is enough to make us happy. Lord, 
 be at peace with us, accept of us, manifest thyself to us, let us be 
 satisfied <I>of</I> thy loving-kindness and we will be satisfied 
 <I>with</I> it." Observe, Though David speaks of himself only in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:7,8">7th and 8th verses</A>,

 he speaks, in this prayer, for others also,--"<I>upon us,</I>" as Christ
 taught us to pray, <I>"Our Father.</I>" All the saints come to the 
 throne of grace on the same errand, and in this they are one, they all 
 desire God's favour as their chief good. We should beg it for others as 
 well as for ourselves, for in God's favour there is enough for us all 
 and we shall have never the less for others sharing in what we have. 
 
 (2.) This is what, above any thing, they rejoice in

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast</I> hereby often <I>put gladness into my heart;</I> not
 only supported and refreshed me, but filled me with joy unspeakable; 
 and therefore this is what I will still pursue, what I will seek after 
 all the days of my life." When God puts grace in the heart he <I>puts 
 gladness in the heart;</I> nor is any joy comparable to that which 
 gracious souls have in the communications of the divine favour, no, not 
 the joy of harvest, of a plentiful harvest, when the corn and wine 
 increase. This is gladness in the heart, inward, solid, substantial 
 joy. The mirth of worldly people is but a flash, a shadow; <I>even in 
 laughter their heart is sorrowful,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+14:13">Prov. xiv. 13</A>.

 "Thou hast <I>given</I> gladness in my heart;" so the word is. True joy
 is God's gift, <I>not as the world giveth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:27">John xiv. 27</A>.

 The saints have no reason to envy carnal worldlings their mirth and
 joy, but should pity them rather, for they may know better and will 
 not. 

 (3.) This is what they entirely confide in, and in this confidence they
 are always easy,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He had laid himself down and slept
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:5">Ps. iii. 5</A>),

 and so he will still: "<I>I will lay myself down</I> (having the
 assurance of thy favour) <I>in peace,</I> and with as much pleasure as
 those whose corn and wine increase, and who lie down as Boaz did in his
 threshing-floor, at the end of the heap of corn, to sleep there when
 <I>his heart was merry</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:7">Ruth iii. 7</A>),

 <I>for thou only makest me to dwell in safety.</I> Though I am alone,
 yet I am not alone, for God is with me; though I have no guards to 
 attend me, the Lord alone is sufficient to protect me; he can do it 
 himself when all other defences fail." If he have the light of God's 
 countenance,

 [1.] He can enjoy himself. His soul returns to God, and reposes itself 
 in him as its rest, and so he lays himself down and sleeps in peace. He 
 has what he would have and is sure that nothing can come amiss to him. 
 
 [2.] He fears no disturbance from his enemies, sleeps quietly, and is 
 very secure, because God himself has undertaken to keep him safe. When 
 he comes to sleep the sleep of death, and to lie down in the grave, and 
 to make his bed in the darkness, he will then, with good old Simeon, 
 <I>depart in peace</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:29">Luke ii. 29</A>),

 being assured that God will receive his soul, to be safe with himself,
 and that his body also shall be made to dwell in safety in the grave. 
 
 [3.] He commits all his affairs to God, and contentedly leaves the 
 issue of them with him. It is said of the husbandman that, having 
 <I>cast his seed into the ground, he sleeps and rises night and day, 
 and the seed springs and grows up, he knows not how,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mk+4:26,27">Mark iv. 26, 27</A>.

 So a good man, having by faith and prayer cast his care upon God,
 sleeps and rests night and day, and is very easy, leaving it to his God 
 to perform all things for him and prepared to welcome his holy 
 will.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:6-8">these verses</A>,

 and praying over them, let us, with a holy contempt of the wealth and
 pleasure of this world, as insufficient to make us happy, earnestly 
 seek the favour of God and pleasingly solace ourselves in that favour; 
 and, with a holy indifferency about the issue of all our worldly 
 concerns, let us commit ourselves and all our affairs to the guidance 
 and custody of the divine Providence, and be satisfied that all shall 
 be made to work for good to us if we keep ourselves in the love of 
 God.</P>
