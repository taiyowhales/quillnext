 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is composed alphabetically, as the former is, and is (like 
 the former) entitled "Hallelujah," though it treats of the happiness of 
 the saints, because it redounds to the glory of God, and whatever we 
 have the pleasure of he must have the praise of. It is a comment upon
 the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:10">last verse</A>

 of the foregoing psalm, and fully shows how much it is our wisdom to
 fear God and do his commandments. We have here, 

 I. The character of the righteous,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. The blessedness of the righteous. 

 1. There is a blessing entailed upon their posterity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:2">ver. 2</A>.

 2. There is a blessing conferred upon themselves. 

 (1.) Prosperity outward and inward, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:3">ver. 3</A>.
 
 (2.) Comfort, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:4">ver. 4</A>.

 (3.) Wisdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:5">ver. 5</A>.

 (4.) Stability, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>.
 
 (5.) Honour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:6,9">ver. 6, 9</A>.

 III. The misery of the wicked,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:10">ver. 10</A>.

 So that good and evil are set before us, the blessing and the curse. In 
 singing this psalm we must not only teach and admonish ourselves and 
 one another to answer to the characters here given of the happy, but 
 comfort and encourage ourselves and one another with the privileges and 
 comforts here secured to the holy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist begins with a call to us to praise God, but immediately 
 applies himself to praise the people of God; for whatever glory is 
 acknowledged to be on them it comes from God, and must return to him; 
 as he is their praise, so they are his. We have reason to praise the 
 Lord that there are a people in the world who fear him and serve him, 
 and that they are a happy people, both which are owing entirely to the 
 grace of God. Now here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A description of those who are here pronounced blessed, and to whom 
 these promises are made.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They are well-principled with pious and devout affections. Those 
 have the privileges of God's subjects, not who cry, <I>Lord, Lord,</I> 
 but who are indeed well affected to his government. 

 (1.) They are such as stand in awe of God and have a constant reverence
 for his majesty and deference to his will. The happy man is he <I>that 
 fears the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 (2.) They are such as take a pleasure in their duty. He <I>that fears
 the Lord,</I> as a Father, with the disposition of a child, not of a 
 slave, <I>delights greatly in his commandments,</I> is well pleased 
 with them and with the equity and goodness of them; they are written in 
 his heart; it is his choice to be under them, and he calls them an 
 easy, a pleasant, yoke; it is his delight to be searching into and 
 conversing with God's commandments, by reading, hearing, and 
 meditation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:2">Ps. i. 2</A>.

 He delights not only in God's promises, but in his precepts, and thinks 
 himself happy under God's government as well as in his favour. It is a 
 pleasure to him to be found in the way of his duty, and he is in his 
 element when he is in the service of God. Herein he delights greatly, 
 more than in any of the employments and enjoyments of this world. And 
 what he does in religion is done from principle, because he sees 
 amiableness in religion and advantage by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are honest and sincere in their professions and intentions. 
 They are called <I>the upright</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:2,4"><I>v.</I> 2, 4</A>),

 who are really as good as they seem to be, and deal faithfully both 
 with God and man. There is no true religion without sincerity; that is 
 gospel-perfection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They are both just and kind in all their dealings: <I>He is 
 gracious, full of compassion, and righteous</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 dares not do any wrong to any man, but does to every man all the good 
 he can, and that from a principle of compassion and kindness. It was
 said of God, in the foregoing psalm 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 He <I>is gracious, and full of compassion;</I> and here it is said of 
 the good man that he is so; for herein we must be <I>followers of God 
 as dear children;</I> be merciful as he is. He is <I>full of 
 compassion, and</I> yet <I>righteous;</I> what he does good with is 
 what he came honestly by. God hates robbery for burnt-offerings, and
 so does he. One instance is given of his beneficence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 He <I>shows favour and lends.</I> Sometimes there is as much charity in 
 lending as in giving, as it obliges the borrower both to industry and 
 honesty. He is <I>gracious and lends</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:26">Ps. xxxvii. 26</A>);

 he does it from a right principle, not as the usurer lends for his own 
 advantage, nor merely out of generosity, but out of pure charity; he 
 does it in a right manner, not grudgingly, but pleasantly, and with a 
 cheerful countenance.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The blessedness that is here entailed upon those that answer to 
 these characters. Happiness, all happiness, to <I>the man that feareth 
 the Lord.</I> Whatever men think or say of them, God says that they are 
 blessed; and his saying so makes them so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The posterity of good men shall fare the better for his goodness 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>His seed shall be mighty on earth.</I> Perhaps he himself shall not 
 be so great in the world, nor make such a figure, as his seed after him 
 shall for his sake. Religion has been the raising of many a family, if 
 not so as to advance it high, yet so as to fix it firmly. When good
 men themselves are happy in heaven their seed perhaps are considerable 
 on earth, and will themselves own that it is by virtue of a blessing 
 descending from them. <I>The generation of the upright shall be 
 blessed;</I> if they tread in their steps, they shall be the more 
 blessed for their relation to them, <I>beloved for the Father's 
 sake</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:28">Rom. xi. 28</A>),

 for so runs the covenant--<I>I will be a God to thee, and to thy
 seed;</I> while <I>the seed of evil-doers shall never be renowned.</I> 
 Let the children of godly parents value themselves upon it, and take 
 heed of doing any thing to forfeit the blessing entailed upon the 
 generation of the upright.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They shall prosper in the world, and especially their souls shall 
 prosper, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 (1.) They shall be blessed with outward prosperity as far as is good
 for them: <I>Wealth and riches shall be in</I> the upright man's 
 <I>house,</I> not in his heart (for he is none of those in whom the 
 love of money reigns), perhaps not so much in his hand (for he only 
 begins to raise the estate), but in his house; his family shall grow 
 rich when he is gone. But, 

 (2.) That which is much better is that they shall be blessed with 
 spiritual blessings, which are the true riches. His <I>wealth shall be
 in his house,</I> for he must leave that to others; but <I>his 
 righteousness</I> he himself shall have the comfort of to himself, it 
 <I>endures for ever.</I> Grace is better than gold, for it will outlast 
 it. He shall have wealth and riches, and yet shall keep up his 
 religion, and in a prosperous condition shall <I>still hold fast his 
 integrity,</I> which many, who kept it in the storm, throw off and let 
 go in the sunshine. <I>Then</I> worldly prosperity is a blessing when
 it does not make men cool in their piety, but they still persevere in 
 that; and when this endures in the family, and goes along with the 
 wealth and riches, and the heirs of the father's estate inherit his 
 virtues too, that is a happy family indeed. However, the good man's
 <I>righteousness endures for ever</I> in the <I>crown of righteousness 
 which fades not away.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They shall have comfort in affliction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Unto the upright there arises light in the darkness.</I> It is here 
 implied that good men may be in affliction; the promise does not exempt 
 them from that. They shall have their share in the common calamities
 of human life; but, <I>when they sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a 
 light to them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:8">Mic. vii. 8</A>.

 They shall be supported and comforted under their troubles; their 
 spirits shall be lightsome when their outward condition is clouded. 
 <I>Sat lucis intus--There is light enough within.</I> During the
 Egyptian darkness the Israelites had <I>light in their dwellings.</I> 
 They shall be in due time, and perhaps when they least expect it, 
 delivered out of their troubles; when the night is darkest the day 
 dawns; nay, at <I>evening-time,</I> when night was looked for, <I>it 
 shall be light.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They shall have wisdom for the management of all their concerns, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 He that does good with his estate shall, through the providence of God, 
 increase it, not by miracle, but by his prudence: <I>He shall guide his 
 affairs with discretion,</I> and his God <I>instructs him to 
 discretion</I> and <I>teaches him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:26">Isa. xxviii. 26</A>.

 It is part of the character of a good man that he will use his 
 discretion in managing his affairs, in getting and saving, that he may 
 have to give. It may be understood of the affairs of his charity: He 
 <I>shows favour and lends;</I> but then it is with discretion, that his 
 charity may not be misplaced, that he may give to proper objects what 
 is proper to be given and in due time and proportion. And it is part of 
 the promise to him who thus uses discretion that God will give him 
 more. Those who most use their wisdom see most of their need of it, and 
 <I>ask it of God,</I> who has promised to <I>give it liberally,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:5">Jam. i. 5</A>.

 <I>He will guide his words with judgment</I> (so it is in the 
 original); and there is nothing in which we have more occasion for 
 wisdom than in the government of the tongue; blessed is he to whom God 
 gives that wisdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The satisfaction of saints, and their stability. It is the happiness 
 of a good man that <I>he shall not be moved for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Satan and his instruments endeavour to move him, but his foundation is
 firm and he shall never be moved, at least <I>not moved for ever;</I> 
 if he be shaken for a time, yet he settles again quickly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A good man will have a settled reputation, and that is a great 
 satisfaction. A good man shall have a good name, a name for good 
 things, with God and good people: <I>The righteous shall be in 
 everlasting remembrance</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>);

 in this sense <I>his righteousness</I> (the memorial of it) <I>endures 
 for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 There are those that do all they can to sully his reputation and to
 load him with reproach; but his integrity shall be cleared up, and the 
 honour of it shall survive him. Some that have been eminently righteous 
 are <I>had in a lasting remembrance</I> on earth; wherever the 
 scripture is read their good deeds are <I>told for a memorial</I> of 
 them. And the memory of many a good man that is dead and gone is still 
 blessed; but in heaven their remembrance shall be truly everlasting, 
 and the honour of their righteousness shall there endure for ever, with 
 the reward of it, in the <I>crown of glory that fades not away.</I> 
 Those that are forgotten on earth, and despised, are remembered there, 
 and honoured, and <I>their righteousness found unto praise, and honour, 
 and glory</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:7">1 Pet. i. 7</A>);

 then, at furthest, shall the horn of a good man <I>be exalted with 
 honour,</I> as that of the unicorn when he is a conqueror. Wicked men, 
 now in their pride, <I>lift up their horns on high,</I> but they shall 
 all be <I>cut off,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:5,10">Ps. lxxv. 5, 10</A>.

 The godly, in their humility and humiliation, have <I>defiled their 
 horn in the dust</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:15">Job xvi. 15</A>);

 but the day is coming when it <I>shall be exalted with honour.</I> That 
 which shall especially turn to the honour of good men is their 
 liberality and bounty to the poor: <I>He has dispersed, he has given to 
 the poor;</I> he has not suffered his charity to run all in one 
 channel, or directed it to some few objects that he had a particular 
 kindness for, but he has dispersed it, <I>given a portion to seven and 
 also to eight,</I> has <I>sown beside all waters,</I> and by thus 
 scattering he has increased: and this is <I>his righteousness,</I> 
 which <I>endures for ever.</I> Alms are called <I>righteousness,</I> 
 not because they will justify us by making atonement for our evil 
 deeds, but because they are good deeds, which we are bound to perform; 
 so that if we are not charitable we are not just; we <I>withhold good 
 from those to whom it is due.</I> The honour of this endures for ever, 
 for it shall be taken notice of in the great day. <I>I was hungry, and 
 you gave me meat.</I> This is quoted as an inducement and encouragement 
 to charity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:9">2 Cor. ix. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A good man shall have a settled spirit, and that is a much greater 
 satisfaction than the former; for <I>so shall a man have rejoicing in 
 himself alone, and not in another. Surely he shall not be moved,</I> 
 whatever happens, not moved either from his duty or from his comfort; 
 for <I>he shall not be afraid; his heart is established,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.
 
 This is a part both of the character and of the comfort of good people.
 It is their endeavour to keep their minds stayed upon God, and so to 
 keep them calm, and easy, and undisturbed; and God has promised them 
 both cause to do so and grace to do so. Observe, 

 (1.) It is the duty and interest of the people of God not to <I>be 
 afraid of evil tidings,</I> not to be afraid of hearing bad news; and, 
 when they do, not to be put into confusion by it and into an amazing 
 expectation of worse and worse, but whatever happens, whatever 
 threatens, to be able to say, with blessed Paul, <I>None of these 
 things move me,</I> neither will I <I>fear, though the earth be 
 removed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:2">Ps. xlvi. 2</A>.

 (2.) The fixedness of the heart is a sovereign remedy against the 
 disquieting fear of evil tidings. If we keep our thoughts composed, and 
 ourselves masters of them, our wills resigned to the holy will of God, 
 our temper sedate, and our spirits even, under all the unevenness of 
 Providence, we are well fortified against the agitations of the 
 timorous. 

 (3.) Trusting in the Lord is the best and surest way of fixing and
 establishing the heart. By faith we must cast anchor in the promise, in 
 the word of God, and so return to him and repose in him as our rest.
 The heart of man cannot fix any where, to its satisfaction, but in the 
 truth of God, and there it finds firm footing. 

 (4.) Those whose hearts are established by faith will patiently wait 
 till they have gained their point: <I>He shall not be afraid, till he 
 see his desire upon his enemies,</I> that is, till he come to heaven, 
 where he shall see Satan, and all his spiritual enemies, trodden under 
 his feet, and, as Israel saw the Egyptians, dead on the sea-shore. 
 <I>Till he look upon his oppressors</I> (so Dr. Hammond), till he 
 behold them securely, and look boldly in their faces, as being now no 
 longer under their power. It will complete the satisfaction of the 
 saints, when they shall look back upon their troubles and pressures, 
 and be able to say with St. Paul, when he had recounted the 
 persecutions he endured

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:11">2 Tim. iii. 11</A>),
 
 <I>But out of them all the Lord delivered me.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The vexation of sinners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Two things shall fret them:--

 1. The felicity of the righteous: <I>The wicked shall see</I> the
 righteous in prosperity and honour and shall <I>be grieved.</I> It will 
 vex them to see their innocency cleared and their low estate regarded, 
 and those whom they hated and despised, and whose ruin they sought and 
 hoped to see, the favourites of Heaven, and advanced to have 
 <I>dominion over them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:14">Ps. xlix. 14</A>);

 this will make them <I>gnash with their teeth and pine away.</I> This 
 is often fulfilled in this world. The happiness of the saints is the 
 envy of the wicked, and that envy is the <I>rottenness of their 
 bones.</I> But it will most fully be accomplished in the other world, 
 when it shall make damned sinners <I>gnash with their teeth,</I> to see 
 <I>Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in him bosom,</I> to see <I>all the 
 prophets in the kingdom of God and themselves thrust out.</I> 

 2. Their own disappointment: <I>The desire of the wicked shall 
 perish.</I> Their desire was wholly to the world and the flesh, and 
 they ruled over them; and therefore, when these perish, their joy is 
 gone, and their expectations from them are cut off, to their 
 everlasting confusion; their hope is as a spider's web.</P>
