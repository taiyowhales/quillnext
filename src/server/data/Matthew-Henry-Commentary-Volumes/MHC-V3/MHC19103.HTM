 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm calls more for devotion than exposition; it is a most
 excellent psalm of praise, and of general use. The psalmist,

 I. Stirs up himself and his own soul to praise God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>)

 for his favour to him in particular

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>),

 to the church in general, and to all good men, to whom he is, and will
 be, just, and kind, and constant

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:6-18">ver. 6-18</A>),

 and for his government of the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:19">ver. 19</A>.

 II.  He desires the assistance of the holy angels, and all the works of 
 God, in praising him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:20-22">ver. 20-22</A>.

 In singing this psalm we must in a special manner get our hearts 
 affected with the goodness of God and enlarged in love and 
 thankfulness.</P>

 <P>A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Bless the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, O my soul: and all
 that is within me, <I>bless</I> his holy name.
 &nbsp; 2  Bless the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
 &nbsp; 3  Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
 diseases;
 &nbsp; 4  Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee
 with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
 &nbsp; 5  Who satisfieth thy mouth with good <I>things; so that</I> thy
 youth is renewed like the eagle's.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David is here communing with his own heart, and he is no fool that thus 
 talks to himself and excites his own soul to that which is good.  
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he stirs up himself to the duty of praise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 1. It is the Lord that is to be blessed and spoken well of; for he is
 the fountain of all good, whatever are the channels or cisterns; it is 
 to his name, his holy name, that we are to consecrate our praise, 
 <I>giving thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.</I> 

 2. It is the soul that is to be employed in blessing God, <I>and all 
 that is within</I> us. We make nothing of our religious performances if 
 we do not make heart-work of them, if that which is within us, nay, if 
 <I>all that is within</I> us, be not engaged in them. The work requires 
 the inward man, the whole man, and all little enough. 

 3. In order to our return of praises to God, there must be a grateful
 remembrance of the mercies we have received from him: <I>Forget not all 
 his benefits.</I> If we do not give thanks for them, we do forget them; 
 and that is unjust as well as unkind, since in all God's favours there 
 is so much that is memorable.  "O my soul! to thy shame be it spoken, 
 thou hast forgotten many of his benefits; but surely thou wilt not 
 forget them all, for thou shouldst not have forgotten any."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he furnishes himself with abundant matter for praise, and that 
 which is very affecting: "Come, my soul, consider what God has done for 
 thee." 

 1. "He has pardoned thy sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 he has forgiven, and <I>does forgive, all thy iniquities.</I>" This is
 mentioned first because by the pardon of sin that is taken away which 
 kept good things from us, and we are restored to the favour of God, 
 which bestows good things on us. Think what the provocation was; it was 
 iniquity, and yet pardoned; how many the provocations were, and yet all 
 pardoned. <I>He has forgiven all our trespasses.</I> It is a continued 
 act; he is still forgiving, as we are still sinning and repenting.

 2. "He has cured thy sickness." The corruption of nature is the 
 sickness of the soul; it is its disorder, and threatens its death. This 
 is cured in sanctification; when sin is mortified, the disease is 
 healed; though complicated, it is all healed. Our crimes were capital, 
 but God saves our lives by pardoning them; our diseases were mortal, 
 but God saves our lives by healing them. These two go together; for, as 
 for God, his work is perfect and not done by halves; if God take away 
 the guilt of sin by pardoning mercy, he will break the power of it by 
 renewing grace. Where Christ is made righteousness to any soul he is 
 made sanctification,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:30">1 Cor. i. 30</A>.

 3. "He has rescued thee from danger." A man may be in peril of life,
 not only by his crimes, or his diseases, but by the power of his 
 enemies; and therefore here also we experience the divine goodness: 
 <I>Who redeemed thy life from destruction</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 from the destroyer, <I>from hell</I> (so the Chaldee), from the second
 death.  <I>The redemption of the soul is precious;</I> we cannot 
 compass it, and therefore are the more indebted to divine grace that 
 has wrought it out, to him who has <I>obtained eternal redemption for 
 us.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:24,28">Job xxxiii. 24, 28</A>.

 4. "He has not only saved thee from death and ruin, but has made thee
 truly and completely happy, with honour, pleasure, and long life." 

 (1.) "He has given thee true honour and great honour, no less than a 
 crown: <I>He crowns thee with his lovingkindness and tender 
 mercies;</I>" and what greater dignity is a poor soul capable of than 
 to be advanced into the love and favour of God? <I>This honour have all 
 his saints.</I> What is the crown of glory but God's favour? 

 (2.) "He has given thee true pleasure: <I>He satisfies thy mouth with
 good things</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 it is only the favour and grace of God that can give satisfaction to a
 soul, can suit its capacities, supply its needs, and answer to its 
 desires. Nothing but divine wisdom can undertake to <I>fill its 
 treasures</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:21">Prov. viii. 21</A>);

 other things will surfeit, but not <I>satiate,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+6:7,Isa+55:2">Eccl. vi. 7; Isa. lv. 2</A>.

 (3.) "He has given thee a prospect and pledge of long life: <I>Thy 
 youth is renewed like the eagle's.</I>" The eagle is long-lived, and, 
 as naturalists say, when she is nearly 100 years old, casts all her 
 feathers (as indeed she changes them in a great measure every year at 
 moulting time), and fresh ones come, so that she becomes young again.  
 When God, by the graces and comforts of his Spirit, recovers his people 
 from their decays, and fills them with new life and joy, which is to 
 them an earnest of eternal life and joy, then they may be said to 
 <I>return to the days of their youth,</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hitherto the psalmist had only looked back upon his own experiences and 
 thence fetched matter for praise; here he looks abroad and takes notice 
 of his favour to others also; for in them we should rejoice and give 
 thanks for them, all the saints being fed at a common table and sharing 
 in the same blessings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Truly God is good to all 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 He <I>executes righteousness and judgment,</I> not only for his own
 people, but <I>for all that are oppressed;</I> for even in common 
 providence he is the patron of wronged innocency, and, one way or 
 other, will plead the cause of those that are injured against their 
 oppressors. It is his honour to humble the proud and help the 
 helpless.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is in a special manner good to Israel, to every Israelite
 indeed, that is of a clean and upright heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He has revealed himself and his grace to us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>He made known his ways unto Moses,</I> and by him <I>his acts to the
 children of Israel,</I> not only by his rod to those who then lived, 
 but by his pen to succeeding ages. Note, Divine revelation is one of 
 the first and greatest of divine favours with which the church is 
 blessed; for God restores us to himself by revealing himself to us, and 
 gives us all good by giving us knowledge. He has <I>made known his acts 
 and his ways</I> (that is, his nature, and the methods of his dealing 
 with the children of men), that they may know both what to conceive of 
 him and what to expect from him; so Dr. Hammond. Or by his <I>ways</I> 
 we may understand his precepts, the way which he requires us to walk 
 in; and by his <I>acts,</I> or <I>designs</I> (as the word signifies), 
 his promises and purposes as to what he will do with us. Thus fairly 
 does God deal with us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He has never been rigorous and severe with us, but always tender, 
 full of compassion, and ready to forgive.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It is in his nature to be so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>The Lord is merciful and gracious;</I> this was his way which he
 made known unto Moses at Mount Horeb, when he thus proclaimed his name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:6,7">Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7</A>),

 in answer to Moses's request

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+33:13"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 13</A>),

 <I>I beseech thee, show me thy way, that I may know thee.</I> It is my
 way, says God, to pardon sin. 

 [1.] He is not soon angry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 He is <I>slow to anger,</I> not extreme to mark what we do amiss nor
 ready to take advantage against us. He bears long with those that are 
 very provoking, defers punishing, that he may give space to repent, and 
 does not speedily execute the sentence of his law; and he could not be 
 thus <I>slow to anger</I> if he were not <I>plenteous in mercy,</I> the 
 very <I>Father of mercies.</I>

 [2.] He is not long angry; for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 <I>he will not always chide,</I> though we always offend and deserve
 chiding.  Though he signify his displeasure against us for our sins by 
 the rebukes of Providence, and the reproaches of our own consciences, 
 and thus cause grief, yet he will have compassion, and will not always 
 keep us in pain and terror, no, not for our sins, but, after the spirit 
 of bondage, will give the spirit of adoption. How unlike are those to 
 God who always chide, who take every occasion to chide, and never know 
 when to cease! What would become of us if God should deal so with us? 
 <I>He will not keep his anger for ever</I> against his own people, but 
 will gather them with <I>everlasting mercies,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:8,57:16">Isa. liv. 8; lvii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) We have found him so; we, for our parts, must own that <I>he has 
 not dealt with us after our sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 The scripture says a great deal of the mercy of God, and we may all set
 to our seal that it is true, that we have experienced it. If he had not 
 been a God of patience, we should have been in hell long ago; but <I>he 
 has not rewarded us after our iniquities;</I> so those will say who 
 know what sin deserves. He has not inflicted the judgments which we 
 have merited, nor deprived us of the comforts which we have forfeited, 
 which should make us think the worse, and not the better, of sin; for 
 <I>God's patience should lead us to repentance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:4">Rom. ii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He has pardoned our sins, not only my <I>iniquity</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 but <I>our transgressions,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Though it is of our own benefit, by the pardoning mercy of God, that we
 are to take the comfort, yet of the benefit others have by it we must 
 give him the glory. Observe,

 (1.) The transcendent riches of God's mercy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>As the heaven is high above the earth</I> (so high that the earth is
 but a point to the vast expanse), so God's mercy is above the merits of 
 those that fear him most, so much above and beyond them that there is 
 no proportion at all between them; the greatest performances of man's 
 duty cannot demand the least tokens of God's favour as a debt, and 
 therefore all the seed of Jacob will join with him in owning themselves 
 <I>less than the least of all God's mercies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:10">Gen. xxxii. 10</A>.

 Observe, God's mercy is thus great <I>towards those that fear him,</I>
 not towards those that trifle with him. We must fear the Lord and his 
 goodness.

 (2.) The fulness of his pardons, an evidence of the riches of his mercy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>As far as the east is from the west</I> (which two quarters of the
 world are of greatest extent, because all known and inhabited, and 
 therefore geographers that way reckon their longitudes) <I>so far has 
 he removed our transgressions from us,</I> so that they shall never be 
 laid to our charge, nor rise up in judgment against us. The sins of 
 believers shall be remembered no more, shall not be mentioned unto 
 them; they shall be sought for, and not found. If we thoroughly forsake 
 them, God will thoroughly forgive them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He has pitied our sorrows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) Whom he pities--<I>those that fear him,</I> that is, all good
 people, who in this world may become objects of pity on account of the
 grievances to which they are not only born, but born again. Or it may
 be understood of those who have not yet received <I>the spirit of
 adoption,</I> but are yet <I>trembling at his word;</I> those he
 <I>pities,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:18,20">Jer. xxxi. 18, 20</A>.

 (2.) How he pities--<I>as a father pities his children,</I> and does
 them good as there is occasion. God is a Father to those that fear him 
 and owns them for his children, and he is tender of them as a father. 
 The father pities his children that are weak in knowledge and instructs 
 them, pities them when they are froward and bears with them, pities 
 them when they are sick and comforts them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:13">Isa. lxvi. 13</A>),

 pities them when they have fallen and helps them up again, pities them 
 when they have offended, and, upon their submission, forgives them, 
 pities them when they are wronged and gives them redress; thus <I>the 
 Lord pities those that fear him.</I> 

 (3.) Why he pities--<I>for he knows our frame.</I> He has reason to 
 know our frame, for he framed us; and, having himself made man of the 
 dust, <I>he remembers that he is dust,</I> not only by constitution, 
 but by sentence. <I>Dust thou art.</I> He considers the frailty of our 
 bodies and the folly of our souls, how little we can do, and expects 
 accordingly from us, how little we can bear, and lays accordingly upon 
 us, in all which appears the tenderness of his compassion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He has perpetuated his covenant-mercy and thereby provided relief 
 for our frailty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:15-18"><I>v.</I> 15-18</A>.
 
 See here,

 (1.) How short man's life is and of what uncertain continuance. The 
 lives even of great men and good men are so, and neither their 
 greatness nor their goodness can alter the property of them: <I>As for 
 man, his days are as grass,</I> which grows out of the earth, rises but 
 a little way above it, and soon withers and returns to it again. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:6,7">Isa. xl. 6, 7</A>.

 Man, in his best estate, seems somewhat more than grass; he flourishes 
 and looks gay; yet then he is but <I>like a flower of the field,</I> 
 which, though distinguished a little from the grass, will wither with 
 it. The flower of the garden is commonly more choice and valuable, and, 
 though in its own nature withering, will last the longer for its being 
 sheltered by the garden wall and the gardener's care; but the flower of 
 the field (to which life is here compared) is not only withering in 
 itself, but exposed to the cold blasts, and liable to be cropped and 
 trodden on by the beasts of the field. Man's life is not only wasting 
 of itself, but its period may be anticipated by a thousand accidents. 
 When the flower is in its perfection a blasting wind, unseen, unlooked 
 for, <I>passes over it, and it is gone;</I> it hangs the head, drops 
 the leaves, dwindles into the ground again, <I>and the place 
 thereof,</I> which was proud of it, now <I>knows it no more.</I> Such a 
 thing is man: God considers this, and pities him; let him consider it 
 himself, and be humble, dead to this world and thoughtful of another. 
 
 (2.) How long and lasting God's mercy is to his people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>):

 it will continue longer than their lives, and will survive their
 present state. Observe,

 [1.] The description of those to whom this mercy belongs. They are such 
 as fear God, such as are truly religious, from principle. <I>First,</I> 
 They live a life of faith; for they <I>keep God's covenant;</I> having 
 taken hold of it, they keep hold of it, fast hold, and will not let it 
 go.  They keep it as a treasure, keep it as their portion, and would 
 not for all the world part with it, for it is their life. 
 <I>Secondly,</I> They live a life of obedience; they <I>remember his 
 commandments to do them,</I> else they do not <I>keep his covenant.</I> 
 Those only shall have the benefit of God's promises that make 
 conscience of his precepts. See who those are that have a good memory, 
 as well as a <I>good understanding</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:10">Ps. cxi. 10</A>),

 those that <I>remember God's commandments,</I> not to talk of them, but
 <I>to do them,</I> and to be ruled by them. 

 [2.] The continuance of the mercy which belongs to such as these; it 
 will last them longer than their lives on earth, and therefore they 
 need not be troubled though their lives be short, since death itself 
 will be no abridgment, no infringement, of their bliss.  God's mercy is 
 better than life, for it will out-live it. <I>First,</I> To their 
 souls, which are immortal; to them the mercy of the Lord is <I>from 
 everlasting to everlasting;</I> from everlasting in the councils of it 
 to everlasting in the consequences of it, in their election before the 
 world was and their glorification when this world shall be no more; for 
 they are predestinated to the <I>inheritance</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:11">Eph. i. 11</A>)

 and <I>look for the mercy of the Lord,</I> the Lord Jesus, unto eternal
 life.  <I>Secondly,</I> To their seed, which shall be kept up to the 
 end of time

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:28">Ps. cii. 28</A>):

 <I>His righteousness,</I> the truth of his promise, shall be <I>unto
 children's children;</I> provided they tread in the steps of their 
 predecessors' piety, and <I>keep his covenant,</I> as they did, then 
 shall mercy be preserved to them, even to <I>a thousand 
 generations.</I></P>

 Here is, 

 I. The doctrine of universal providence laid down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He has secured the happiness of his peculiar people by promise and
 covenant, but the order of mankind, and the world in general, he 
 secures by common providence. <I>The Lord has a throne</I> of his own, 
 a throne of glory, a throne of government. He that made all rules all, 
 and both by a word of power: <I>He has prepared his throne,</I> has 
 fixed and established it that it cannot be shaken; he has 
 afore-ordained all the measures of his government and does all 
 according to the counsel of his own will. He <I>has prepared</I> it 
 <I>in the heavens,</I> above us, and out of sight; for he <I>holds back 
 the face of his throne, and spreads a cloud upon it</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:9">Job xxvi. 9</A>);

 yet he can himself <I>judge through the dark cloud,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:13">Job xxiii. 13</A>.

 Hence <I>the heavens are said to rule</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:26">Dan. iv. 26</A>),

 and we are led to consider this by the influence which even the visible 
 heavens have upon this earth, their <I>dominion,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:33,Ge+1:16">Job xxxviii. 33; Gen. i. 16</A>.

 But though God's throne is in heaven, and there he keeps his court, and
 thither we are to direct to him (<I>Our Father who art in heaven</I>), 
 yet <I>his kingdom rules over all.</I> He takes cognizance of all the 
 inhabitants, and all the affairs, of this lower world, and disposes all 
 persons and things according to the counsel of his will, to his own 
 glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:35">Dan.  iv. 35</A>):

 <I>His kingdom rules over all</I> kings and all kingdoms, and from it 
 there is no exempt jurisdiction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The duty of universal praise inferred from it: if all are under 
 God's dominion, all must do him homage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let the holy angels praise him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>):

 <I>Bless the Lord, you his angels;</I> and again, <I>Bless the Lord,
 all you his hosts, you ministers of his.</I> David had been stirring up 
 himself and others to praise God, and here, in the close, he calls upon 
 the angels to do it; not as if they needed any excitement of ours to 
 praise God, they do it continually; but thus he expresses his high 
 thoughts of God as worthy of the adorations of the holy angels, thus he 
 quickens himself and others to the duty with this consideration, That 
 it is the work of angels, and comforts himself in reference to his own 
 weakness and defect in the performance of this duty with this 
 consideration, That there is a world of holy angels who dwell in God's 
 house and are still praising him. In short, the blessed angels are 
 glorious attendants upon the blessed God. Observe,

 (1.) How well qualified they are for the post they are in. They are 
 able; for they <I>excel in strength;</I> they are <I>mighty in 
 strength</I> (so the word is); they are able to bring great things to 
 pass, and to abide in their work without weariness. And they are as 
 willing as they are able; they are willing to know their work; for they 
 <I>hearken to the voice of his word;</I> they stand expecting 
 commission and instructions from their great Lord, and <I>always behold 
 his face</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+18:10">Matt. xviii. 10</A>),

 that they may take the first intimation of his mind. They are willing
 to do their work: They <I>do his commandments</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>);

 they <I>do his pleasure</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 they dispute not any divine commands, but readily address themselves to
 the execution of them. Nor do they delay, but fly swiftly: They <I>do 
 his commandments at hearing,</I> or <I>as soon as they hear the voice 
 of his word;</I> so Dr. Hammond. <I>To obey is better than 
 sacrifice;</I> for angels obey, but do not sacrifice.

 (2.) What their service is. They are <I>his angels,</I> and 
 <I>ministers of his</I>--his, for he made them, and made them for 
 himself--his, for he employs them, though he does not need them--his, 
 for he is their owner and Lord; they belong to him and he has them at 
 his beck. All the creatures are his servants, but not as the angels 
 that attend the presence of his glory. Soldiers, and seamen, and all 
 good subjects, serve the king, but not as the courtiers do, the 
 ministers of state and those of the household. 

 [1.] The angels occasionally serve God in this lower world; they <I>do 
 his commandments,</I> go on his errands

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:21">Dan. ix. 21</A>),
 
 fight his battles

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:17">2 Kings vi. 17</A>),

 and minister for the good of his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:14">Heb. i. 14</A>.

 [2.] They <I>continually praise him</I> in the upper world; they began
 betimes to do it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:7">Job xxxviii. 7</A>),

 and it is still their business, from which they rest not <I>day nor 
 night,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:8">Rev. iv. 8</A>.

 It is God's glory that he has such attendants, but more his glory that
 he neither needs them nor is benefited by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let <I>all his works</I> praise him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 all <I>in all places of his dominion;</I> for, because they are his
 works, they are under his dominion, and they were made and are ruled 
 that they may be unto him <I>for a name and a praise. All his 
 works,</I> that is, all the children of men, in all parts of the world, 
 let them all praise God; yea, and the inferior creatures too, which are 
 God's works also; let them praise him objectively, though they cannot 
 praise him actually,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:10">Ps. cxlv. 10</A>.

 Yet all this shall not excuse David from praising God, but rather
 excite him to do it the more cheerfully, that he may bear a part in
 this concert; for he concludes, <I>Bless the Lord, O my soul!</I> as he
 began,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Blessing God and giving him glory must be the alpha and the omega of
 all our services. He began with <I>Bless the Lord, O my soul!</I> and, 
 when he had penned and sung this excellent hymn to his honour, he does 
 not say, Now, O my soul! thou hast blessed the Lord, sit down, and rest 
 thee, but, <I>Bless the Lord, O my soul!</I> yet more and more. When we 
 have done ever so much in the service of God, yet still we must stir up 
 ourselves to do more. God's praise is a subject that will never be 
 exhausted, and therefore we must never think this work done till we 
 come to heaven, where it will be for ever in the doing.</P>
