 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter is one of the most excellent in all this book, both for 
 argument to persuade us to be religious and for directions therein. 

 I. We must be constant to our duty because that is the way to be happy,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. We must live a life of dependence upon God because that is the way
 to be safe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:5">ver. 5</A>.

 III. We must keep up the fear of God because that is the way to be
 healthful, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.

 IV. We must serve God with our estates because that is the way to be
 rich, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 V. We must hear afflictions well because that is the way to get good
 by them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 VI. We must take pains to obtain wisdom because that is the way to gain 
 her, and to gain by her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:13-20">ver. 13-20</A>.

 VII. We must always govern ourselves by the rules of wisdom, of right 
 reason and religion, because that is the way to be always easy, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:21-26">ver. 21-26</A>.

 VIII. We must do all the good we can, and no hurt, to our neighbours,
 because according as men are just or unjust, charitable or 
 uncharitable, humble or haughty, accordingly they shall receive of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:27-35">ver. 27-35</A>.

 From all this it appears what a tendency religion has to make men both 
 blessed and blessings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my
 commandments:
 &nbsp; 2  For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add
 to thee.
 &nbsp; 3  Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy
 neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:
 &nbsp; 4  So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight
 of God and man.
 &nbsp; 5  Trust in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with all thine heart; and lean not unto
 thine own understanding.
 &nbsp; 6  In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
 paths.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here taught to live a life of communion with God; and without 
 controversy great is this mystery of godliness, and of great 
 consequence to us, and, as is here shown, will be of unspeakable 
 advantage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We must have a continual regard to God's precepts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We must, 

 (1.) Fix God's law, and his commandments, as our rule, by which we will 
 in every thing be ruled and to which we will yield obedience. 

 (2.) We must acquaint ourselves with them; for we cannot be said to 
 forget that which we never knew. 

 (3.) We must remember them so that they may be ready to us whenever we 
 have occasion to use them.

 (4.) Our wills and affections must be subject to them and must in every 
 thing conform to them. Not only our heads, but our hearts, must <I>keep 
 God's commandments;</I> in them, as in the ark of the testimony, both 
 the tables of the law must be deposited.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. To encourage us to submit ourselves to all the restraints and 
 injunctions of the divine law, we are assured 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 that it is the certain way to long life and prosperity.

 (1.) It is the way to be long-lived. God's commandments <I>shall add to 
 us length of days;</I> to a good useful life on earth, they shall add 
 an eternal life in heaven, <I>length of days for ever and ever,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+21:4">Ps. xxi. 4</A>.

 God shall be our life and the length of our days, and that will be 
 indeed long life, with an addition. But, because length of days may 
 possibly become a burden and a trouble, it is promised,

 (2.) That it shall prove the way to be easy too, so that even the days 
 of old age shall not be evil days, but days in which thou shalt have 
 pleasure: <I>Peace shall they</I> be continually <I>adding to thee.</I> 
 As grace increases, peace shall increase; and <I>of the increase of 
 Christ's government and peace,</I> in the heart as well as in the 
 world, <I>there shall be no end. Great</I> and growing <I>peace have 
 those that love the law.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We must have a continual regard to God's promises, which go along 
 with his precepts, and are to be received, and retained, with them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Let not mercy and truth forsake thee,</I> God's mercy in promising, 
 and his truth in performing. Do not forfeit these, but live up to them, 
 and preserve thy interest in them; do not forget these, but live upon 
 them, and take the comfort of them. <I>Bind them about thy neck,</I> as 
 the most graceful ornament." It is the greatest honour we are capable 
 of in this world to have an interest in the mercy and truth of God. 
 "<I>Write to them upon the table of thy heart,</I> as dear to thee, thy 
 portion, and most delightful entertainment; take a pleasure in applying 
 them and thinking them over." Or it may be meant of the mercy and truth 
 which are our duty, piety and sincerity, charity towards men, fidelity 
 towards God. Let these be fixed and commanding principles in thee. To 
 encourage us to do this we are assured 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 that this is the way to recommend ourselves both to our Creator and 
 fellow-creatures: <I>So shalt thou find favour and good 
 understanding.</I> 

 1. A good man seeks the favour of God in the first place, is ambitious
 of the honour of being accepted of the Lord, and he shall find that 
 favour, and with it a good understanding; God will make the best of 
 him, and put a favourable construction upon what he says and does. He 
 shall be owned as one of Wisdom's children, and shall have praise with 
 God, as one having that <I>good understanding</I> which is ascribed to 
 all those <I>that do his commandments.</I> 

 2. He wishes to have favour with men also (as Christ had, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:52">Luke ii. 52</A>),

 to be <I>accepted of the multitude of his brethren</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+10:3">Esth. x. 3</A>),
 
 and that he shall have; they shall understand him aright, and in his 
 dealings with them he shall appear to be prudent, shall act 
 intelligently and with discretion. <I>He shall have good success</I> 
 (so some translate it), the common effect of good understanding.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We must have a continual regard to God's providence, must own and 
 depend upon it in all our affairs, both by faith and prayer. 

 1. By faith. We must repose an entire confidence in the wisdom, power,
 and goodness of God, assuring ourselves of the extent of his providence 
 to all the creatures and all their actions. We must therefore <I>trust 
 in the Lord with all our hearts</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 we must believe that he is able to do what he will, wise to do what is 
 best, and good, according to his promise, to do what is best for us, if 
 we love him, and serve him. We must, with an entire submission and 
 satisfaction, depend upon him to perform all things for us, and not 
 <I>lean to our own understanding,</I> as if we could, by any forecast 
 of our own, without God, help ourselves, and bring our affairs to a 
 good issue. Those who know themselves cannot but find their own 
 understanding to be a broken reed, which, if they lean to, will 
 certainly fail them. In all our conduct we must be diffident of our own 
 judgment, and confident of God's wisdom, power, and goodness, and 
 therefore must follow Providence and not force it. That often proves 
 best which was least our own doing.
 
 2. By prayer
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>In all thy ways acknowledge God.</I> We must not only in our 
 judgment believe that there is an over-ruling hand of God ordering and 
 disposing of us and all our affairs, but we must solemnly own it, and 
 address ourselves to him accordingly. We must ask his leave, and not 
 design any thing but what we are sure is lawful. We must ask his advice 
 and beg direction from him, not only when the case is difficult (when 
 we know not what to do, no thanks to us that we have our eyes up to 
 him), but in every case, be it ever so plain, We must ask success of 
 him, as those who know <I>the race is not to the swift.</I> We must 
 refer ourselves to him as one from whom our judgment proceeds, and 
 patiently, and with a holy indifferency, wait his award. <I>In all our
 ways</I> that prove direct, and fair, and pleasant, in which we gain 
 our point to our satisfaction, we must acknowledge God with 
 thankfulness. <I>In all our ways</I> that prove cross and 
 uncomfortable, and that are hedged up with thorns, we must acknowledge 
 God with submission. Our eye must be ever towards God; to him we must, 
 in every thing, make our requests known, as Jephthah <I>uttered all his 
 words before the Lord in Mizpeh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+11:11">Judg. xi. 11</A>.

 For our encouragement to do this, it is promised, "<I>He shall direct 
 thy paths,</I> so that thy way shall be safe and good and the issue 
 happy at last." Note, Those that put themselves under a divine guidance 
 shall always have the benefit of it. God will give them that wisdom
 which is profitable to direct, so that they shall not turn aside into 
 the by-paths of sin, and then will himself so wisely order the event 
 that it shall be to their mind, or (which is equivalent) for their 
 good. Those that faithfully follow the pillar of cloud and fire shall 
 find that though it may lead them about it leads them the right way and 
 will bring them to Canaan at last.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and depart from
 evil.
 &nbsp; 8  It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here before us three exhortations, each of them enforced with a 
 good reason:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We must live in a humble and dutiful subjection to God and his 
 government 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Fear the Lord,</I> as your sovereign Lord and Master; be ruled in 
 every thing by your religion and subject to the divine will." This must 
 be, 

 1. A humble subjection: <I>Be not wise in thy own eyes.</I> Note, There
 is not a greater enemy to the power of religion, and the fear of God in 
 the heart, than conceitedness of our own wisdom. Those that have an 
 opinion of their own sufficiency think it below them, and a 
 disparagement to them, to take their measures from, much more to hamper 
 themselves with, religion's rules. 

 2. A dutiful subjection: <I>Fear the Lord, and depart from evil;</I> 
 take heed of doing any thing to offend him and to forfeit his care. To 
 <I>fear the Lord,</I> so as to <I>depart from evil,</I> is true 
 <I>wisdom</I> and <I>understanding</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:28">Job xxviii. 28</A>);

 those that have it are truly wise, but self-denyingly so, and not 
 <I>wise in their own eyes.</I> For our encouragement thus to live in 
 the fear of God it is here promised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 that it shall be as serviceable even to the outward man as our 
 necessary food. It will be nourishing: <I>It shall be health to thy 
 navel.</I> It will be strengthening: It shall be <I>marrow to thy 
 bones.</I> The prudence, temperance, and sobriety, the calmness and 
 composure of mind, and the good government of the appetites and 
 passions, which religion teaches, tend very much not only to the health 
 of the soul, but to a good habit of body, which is very desirable, and 
 without which our other enjoyments in this world are insipid. Envy is 
 <I>the rottenness of the bones;</I> the sorrow of the world dries them; 
 but hope and joy in God are marrow to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We must make a good use of our estates, and that is the way to 
 increase them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.
 
 Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A precept which makes it our duty to serve God with our estates: 
 <I>Honour the Lord with thy substance.</I> It is the end of our 
 creation and redemption to honour God, to be to him for a name and a 
 praise; we are no other way capable of serving him than in his honour. 
 His honour we must show forth and the honour we have for him. We must 
 honour him, not only <I>with our bodies and spirits which are his,</I> 
 but with our estates too, for they also are his: we and all our 
 appurtenances must be devoted to his glory. Worldly wealth is but poor 
 substance, yet, such as it is, we must honour God with it, and then, if 
 ever, it becomes substantial. We must honour God, 

 (1.) <I>With our increase.</I> Where riches increase we are tempted to 
 honour ourselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:17">Deut. viii. 17</A>)

 and to set our hearts upon the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:10">Ps. lxii. 10</A>);

 but the more God gives us the more we should study to honour him. It is 
 meant of the increase of the earth, for we live upon annual products, 
 to keep us in constant dependence on God.

 (2.) <I>With all our increase.</I> As God has prospered us in every 
 thing, we must honour him. Our law will allow a prescription for a 
 <I>modus decimandi--a mode of tithing,</I> but none <I>de non 
 decimando--for exemption from paying tithes.</I> 

 (3.) <I>With the first-fruits of all,</I> as Abel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:4">Gen. iv. 4</A>.

 This was the law 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:19">Exod. xxiii. 19</A>),

 and the prophets, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:10">Mal. iii. 10</A>.

 God, who is the first and best, must have the first and best of every 
 thing; his right is prior to all other, and therefore he must be served 
 first. Note, It is our duty to make our worldly estates serviceable to
 our religion, to use them and the interest we have by them for the 
 promoting of religion, to do good to the poor with what we have and 
 abound in all works of piety and charity, <I>devising liberal 
 things.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A promise, which makes it our interest to serve God with our 
 estates. It is the way to make a little much, and much more; it is the 
 surest and safest method of thriving: <I>So shall thy barns be filled 
 with plenty.</I> He does not say thy bags, but thy barns, not thy 
 wardrobe replenished, but thy presses: "God shall bless thee with an 
 increase of that which is for use, not for show or ornament--for
 spending and laying out, not for hoarding and laying up." Those that do 
 good with what they have shall have more to do more good with. Note, If 
 we make our worldly estates serviceable to our religion we shall find 
 our religion very serviceable to the prosperity of our worldly affairs. 
 <I>Godliness has the promise of the life that now is</I> and most of 
 the comfort of it. We mistake if we think that giving will undo us and 
 make us poor. No, giving for God's honour will make us rich, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hag+2:19">Hag. ii. 19</A>.
 
 What we gave we have.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We must conduct ourselves aright under our afflictions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.
 
 This the apostle quotes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:5">Heb. xii. 5</A>),

 and calls it <I>an exhortation which speaks unto us as unto 
 children,</I> with the authority and affection of a father. We are here 
 in a world of troubles. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What must be our care when we are in affliction. We must neither 
 despise it nor be weary of it. His exhortation, before, was to those 
 that are rich and in prosperity, here to those that are poor and in 
 adversity. 

 (1.) We must not despise an affliction, be it ever so light and short, 
 as if it were not worth taking notice of, or as if it were not sent on 
 an errand and therefore required no answer. We must not be stocks, and 
 stones, and stoics, under our afflictions, insensible of them, 
 hardening ourselves under them, and concluding we can easily get 
 through them without God. 

 (2.) We must not be weary of an affliction, be it ever so heavy and 
 long, not <I>faint</I> under it, so the apostle renders it, not be 
 dispirited, dispossessed of our own souls, or driven to despair, or to 
 use any indirect means for our relief and the redress of our 
 grievances. We must not think that the affliction either presses harder 
 or continues longer than is meet, not conclude that deliverance will 
 never come because it does not come so soon as we expect it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What will be our comfort when we are in affliction. 

 (1.) That it is a divine correction; it is <I>the chastening of the 
 Lord,</I> which, as it is a reason why we should submit to it (for it 
 is folly to contend with a God of incontestable sovereignty and 
 irresistible power), so it is a reason why we should be satisfied in 
 it; for we may be sure that a God of unspotted purity does us no wrong 
 and that a God of infinite goodness means us no hurt. It is from God, 
 and therefore must not be despised; for a slight put upon the messenger 
 is an affront to him that sends him. It is from God, and therefore we 
 must not be weary of it, for he knows our frame, both what we need and 
 what we can bear. 

 (2.) That it is a fatherly correction; it comes not from his vindictive 
 justice as a Judge, but his wise affection as a Father. The father 
 corrects <I>the son whom he</I> loves, nay, and because he loves him 
 and desires he may be wise and good. He delights in that in his son 
 which is amiable and agreeable, and therefore corrects him for the 
 prevention and cure of that which would be a deformity to him, and an 
 alloy to his delight in him. Thus God hath said, <I>As many as I love I 
 rebuke and chasten,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:19">Rev. iii. 19</A>.

 This is a great comfort to God's children, under their afflictions,

 [1.] That they not only consist with, but flow from, covenant-love. 
 
 [2.] That they are so far from doing them any real hurt that, by the 
 grace of God working with them, they do a great deal of good, and are 
 happy means of their satisfaction.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon had pressed us earnestly to seek diligently for wisdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:1"><I>ch.</I> ii. 1</A>,

 &c.), and had assured us that we should succeed in our sincere and
 constant pursuits. But the question is, What shall we get by it when we 
 have found it? Prospect of advantage is the spring and spur of 
 industry; he therefore shows us how much it will be to our profit, 
 laying this down for an unquestionable truth, <I>Happy is the man that 
 findeth wisdom,</I> that true wisdom which consists in the knowledge 
 and love of God, and an entire conformity to all the intentions of his 
 truths, providences, and laws. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What it is to find wisdom so as to be made happy by it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We must get it. He is the happy man who, having found it, makes it 
 his own, gets both an interest in it and the possession of it, who 
 <I>draws out understanding</I> (so the word it), that is, 

 (1.) Who derives it from God. Having it not in himself, he draws it 
 with the bucket of prayer from the fountain of all wisdom, <I>who gives 
 liberally.</I> 

 (2.) Who takes pains for it, as he does who draws ore out of the mine. 
 If it do not come easily, we must put the more strength to draw it.
 
 (3.) Who improves in it, who, having some understanding, draws it out 
 by growing in knowledge and making five talents ten. 

 (4.) Who does good with it, who draws out from the stock he has, as 
 wine from the vessel, and communicates to others, for their 
 instruction, <I>things new and old.</I> That is well got, and to good 
 purpose, that is thus used to good purpose.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We must trade for it. We read here of the merchandise of wisdom, 
 which intimates, 

 (1.) That we must make it our business, and not a by-business, as the 
 merchant bestows the main of his thoughts and time upon his 
 merchandise. 

 (2.) That we must venture all in it, as a stock in trade, and be 
 willing to part with all for it. This is that pearl of great price 
 which, when we have found it, we must willingly sell all for the 
 purchase of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:45,46">Matt. xiii. 45, 46</A>.

 <I>Buy the truth,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:23">Prov. xxiii. 23</A>);

 he does not say at what rate, because we must buy it at any rate rather 
 than miss it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. We must lay hold on it as we lay hold on a good bargain when it is 
 offered to us, which we do the more carefully if there be danger of 
 having it taken out of our hands. We must apprehend with all our might, 
 and put forth our utmost vigour in the pursuit of it, lay hold on all 
 occasions to improve in it, and catch at the least of its dictates.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. We must retain it. It is not enough to lay hold on wisdom, but we 
 must keep our hold, hold it fast, with a resolution never to let it go, 
 but to persevere in the ways of wisdom to the end. We must <I>sustain 
 it</I> (so some read it), must embrace it with all our might, as we do 
 that which we would sustain. We must do all we can to support the 
 declining interests of religion in the places where we live.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What the happiness of those is who do find it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is a transcendent happiness, more than can be found in the wealth 
 of this world, if we had ever so much of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 It is not only a surer, but a more gainful merchandise to trade for 
 wisdom, for Christ, and grace, and spiritual blessings, than for 
 silver, and gold, and rubies. Suppose a man to have got these in 
 abundance, nay, to have all the things he can desire of this world (and 
 who is it that ever had?), yet,

 (1.) All this would not purchase heavenly wisdom; no, it would 
 <I>utterly be contemned;</I> it <I>cannot be gotten for gold,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:15">Job xxviii. 15</A>,

 &c.

 (2.) All this would not countervail the want of heavenly wisdom nor be
 the ransom of a soul lost by its own folly. 

 (3.) All this would not make a man half so happy, no, not in this 
 world, as those are who have true wisdom, though they have none of all 
 these things. 

 (4.) Heavenly wisdom will procure that for us, and secure that to us, 
 which silver, and gold, and rubies, will not be the purchase of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is a true happiness; for it is inclusive of, and equivalent to, 
 all those things which are supposed to make men happy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.
 
 Wisdom is here represented as a bright and bountiful queen, reaching 
 forth gifts to her faithful and loving subjects, and offering them to 
 all that will submit to her government. 

 (1.) Is length of days a blessing? Yes, the most valuable; life 
 includes all good, and therefore she offers that <I>in her right 
 hand.</I> Religion puts us into the best methods of prolonging life, 
 entitles us to the promises of it, and, though our days on earth should 
 be no more than our neighbour's, yet it will secure to us everlasting 
 life in a better world. 

 (2.) Are riches and honour accounted blessings? They are so, and them
 she reaches out with <I>her left hand.</I> For, as she is ready to 
 embrace those that submit to her with both arms, so she is ready to 
 give out to them with both hands. They shall have the wealth of this 
 world as far as Infinite Wisdom sees good for them; while the true 
 riches, by which men are rich towards God, are secured to them. Nor is 
 there any honour, by birth or preferment, comparable to that which 
 attends religion; it makes the <I>righteous more excellent than his 
 neighbour,</I> recommends men to God, commands respect and veneration 
 with all the sober part of mankind, and will in the other world make 
 those that are now buried in obscurity to <I>shine forth as the 
 sun.</I> 

 (3.) Is pleasure courted as much as any thing? It is so, and it is 
 certain that true piety has in it the greatest true pleasure. <I>Her
 ways are ways of pleasantness;</I> the ways in which she has directed 
 us to walk are such as we shall find abundance of delight and 
 satisfaction in. All the enjoyments and entertainments of sense are not 
 comparable to the pleasure which gracious souls have in communion with 
 God and doing good. That which is the only right way to bring us to our 
 journey's end we must walk in, fair or foul, pleasant or unpleasant; 
 but the way of religion, as it is the right way, so it is a pleasant 
 way; it is smooth and clean, and strewed with roses: <I>All her paths 
 are peace.</I> There is not only peace in the end, but peace in the 
 way; not only in the way of religion in general, but in the particular 
 paths of that way, in all her paths, all the several acts, instances, 
 and duties of it. One does not embitter what the other sweetens, as it 
 is with the allays of this world; but they are all peace, not only 
 sweet, but safe. The saints enter into peace on this side heaven, and
 enjoy a present sabbatism.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It is the happiness of paradise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>She is a tree of life.</I> True grace is that to the soul which the 
 tree of life would have been, from which our first parents were shut 
 out for eating of the forbidden tree. It is a seed of immortality, a 
 <I>well of living waters, springing up to life eternal.</I> It is an 
 earnest of the New Jerusalem, in the midst of which is <I>the tree of 
 life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:2,Re+2:7">Rev. xxii. 2; ii. 7</A>.

 Those that feed and feast on this heavenly wisdom shall not only be 
 cured by it of every fatal malady, but shall find an antidote against 
 age and death; they shall <I>eat and live for ever.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. It is a participation of the happiness of God himself, for wisdom is 
 his everlasting glory and blessedness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.

 This should make us in love with the wisdom and understanding which God 
 gives, that <I>the Lord by wisdom founded the earth,</I> so that it 
 cannot be removed, nor can ever fail of answering all the ends of its 
 creation, to which it is admirably and unexceptionably fitted. <I>By 
 understanding he has</I> likewise <I>established the heavens</I> and 
 directed all the motions of them in the best manner. The heavenly 
 bodies are vast, yet there is no flaw in them--numerous, yet no 
 disorder in them--the motion rapid, yet no wear or tear; the depths of 
 the sea are broken up, and thence come the waters beneath the 
 firmament, and <I>the clouds drop down the dews,</I> the waters from 
 above the firmament, and all this by the divine wisdom and knowledge; 
 therefore <I>happy is the man that finds wisdom,</I> for he will 
 thereby be <I>thoroughly furnished for every good word and work.</I> 
 Christ is that Wisdom, by whom the worlds were made and still consist; 
 happy therefore are those to whom he is <I>made of God wisdom,</I> for 
 he has wherewithal to make good all the foregoing promises of long 
 life, riches, and honour; for all the wealth of heaven, earth, and 
 seas, is his.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon, having pronounced those happy who not only lay hold on wisdom, 
 but retain her, here exhorts us therefore to retain her, assuring us 
 that we ourselves shall have the comfort of doing so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The exhortation is, to have religion's rules always in view and 
 always at heart, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 1. To have them always in view: "<I>My son, let them not depart from
 thy eyes;</I> let not thy eyes ever depart from them to wander after 
 vanity. Have them always in mind, and do not forget them; be ever and 
 anon thinking of them, and conversing with them, and never imagine that 
 thou hast looked upon them long enough and that it is time now to lay 
 them by; but, as long as thou livest, keep up and cultivate thy 
 acquaintance with them." He who learns to write must always have his 
 eye upon his copy, and not let that be out of his sight; and to the 
 words of wisdom must those, in like manner, have a constant respect, 
 who will walk circumspectly. 

 2. To have them always at heart; for it is in that treasury, the hidden 
 man of the heart, that we must <I>keep sound wisdom and discretion,</I> 
 keep to the principles of it and keep in the ways of it. It is wealth 
 that is worth keeping.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The argument to enforce this exhortation is taken from the 
 unspeakable advantage which wisdom, thus kept, will be of to us. 

 1. In respect of strength and satisfaction: "It will be <I>life to thy
 soul</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>);

 it will quicken thee to thy duty when thou beginnest to be slothful and 
 remiss; it will revive thee under thy troubles when thou beginnest to 
 droop and despond. It will be thy spiritual life, an earnest of life 
 eternal." Life to the soul is life indeed. 

 2. In respect of honour and reputation: It shall be <I>grace to thy 
 neck,</I> as a chain of gold, or a jewel. <I>Grace to thy jaws</I> (so 
 the word is), grateful to thy <I>taste and relish</I> (so some); it
 shall infuse <I>grace into all thou sayest</I> (so others), shall
 furnish thee with acceptable words, which shall gain thee credit. 

 3. In respect of safety and security. This he insists upon in

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:23-26">four verses</A>,

 the scope of which is to show that <I>the effect of righteousness</I>
 (which is the same with <I>wisdom</I> here) is <I>quietness and
 assurance for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:17">Isa. xxxii. 17</A>.

 Good people are taken under God's special protection, and therein they 
 may have an entire satisfaction. They are safe and may be easy,

 (1.) In their motions by day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 If our religion be our companion, it will be our convoy: "<I>Then shalt 
 thou walk in thy way safely.</I> The natural life, and all that belongs 
 to it, shall be under the protection of God's providence; the spiritual 
 life, and all its interests, are under the protection of his grace; so 
 that thou shalt be kept from falling into sin or trouble." Wisdom will 
 direct us into, and keep us in, the safe way, as far as may be, from 
 temptation, and will enable us to walk in it with holy security. The 
 way of duty is the way of safety. "We are in danger of falling, but 
 wisdom will keep thee, that <I>thy foot shall not stumble</I> at those 
 things which are an offence and overthrow to many, but which thou shalt 
 know how to get over."

 (2.) In their rest by night,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 In our retirements we lie exposed and are most subject to frights. "But 
 keep up communion with God, and keep a good conscience, and then 
 <I>when thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid</I> of fire, or 
 thieves, or specters, or any of the terrors of darkness, knowing that 
 when we, and all our friends, are asleep, yet <I>he that keeps 
 Israel</I> and every true-born Israelite <I>neither slumbers nor 
 sleeps,</I> and to him thou hast committed thyself and taken shelter 
 under the shadow of his wings. <I>Thou shalt lie down,</I> and not
 need to sit up to keep guard; having lain down, thou shalt sleep, and 
 not have thy eyes held waking by care and fear; and <I>thy sleep shall 
 be sweet</I> and refreshing to thee, being not disturbed by any alarms 
 from without or from within," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:8,116:7">Ps. iv. 8; cxvi. 7</A>.

 The way to have a good night is to keep a good conscience; and the 
 sleep, as of the labouring man, so of the wise and godly man, is sweet.

 (3.) In their greatest straits and dangers. Integrity and uprightness
 will preserve us, so that we need <I>not be afraid of sudden fear,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 The harms that surprise us, unthought of, giving us no time to arm 
 ourselves by consideration, are most likely to put us into confusion. 
 But let not the wise and good man forget himself, and then he will not 
 give way to any fear that has torment, be the alarm ever so sudden. Let 
 him not fear the <I>desolation of the wicked, when it comes,</I> that 
 is,

 [1.] The desolation which the wicked ones make of religion and the 
 religious; though it comes, and seems to be just at the door, yet be 
 not afraid of it; for, though God may make use of the wicked as 
 instruments of his people's correction, yet he will never suffer them 
 to be the authors of their desolation. Or rather, 

 [2.] The desolation which wicked men will be brought into in a moment.
 It will come, and timorous saints may be apprehensive that they shall 
 be involved in it; but let this be their comfort, that though judgments 
 lay waste generally, at least promiscuously, yet God knows who are his 
 and how to separate between the precious and the vile. Therefore be not 
 afraid of that which appears most formidable, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>)

 "<I>the Lord shall be</I> not only thy protector to keep thee safe, but 
 <I>thy confidence</I> to keep thee secure, so that thy foot <I>shall 
 not be taken</I> by thy enemies nor ensnared by thy own fears." God has 
 engaged to keep the feet of his saints.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 True wisdom consists in the due discharge of our duty towards man, as 
 well as towards God, in honesty as well as piety, and therefore we have 
 here divers excellent precepts of wisdom which relate to our 
 neighbour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We must render to all their due, both in justice and charity, and 
 not delay to do it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>):

 "<I>Withhold not good from those to whom it is due</I> (either for want 
 of love to them or through too much love to thy money) <I>when it is in 
 the power of thy hand to do it,</I> for, if it be not, it cannot be 
 expected; but it was thy great fault if thou didst, by thy 
 extravagances, disable thyself to do justly and show mercy, and it 
 ought to be the greatest of thy griefs if God had disabled thee, not so 
 much that thou art straitened in thy own comforts and conveniences as 
 that thou hast not wherewithal to give to those to whom it is due." 
 <I>Withhold</I> it not; this implies that it is called for and 
 expected, but that the hand is drawn in and the <I>bowels of compassion 
 are shut up.</I> We must not hinder others from doing it, not be 
 ourselves backward to it. "If thou hast it by thee to-day, hast it in 
 the power of thy hand, say not to thy neighbour, <I>Go thy way for this 
 time,</I> and come at a more convenient season, and I will then see 
 what will be done; <I>to-morrow I will give;</I> whereas thou art not 
 sure that thou shalt live till to-morrow, or that to-morrow thou shalt 
 <I>have it by thee.</I> Be not thus loth to part with thy money upon a 
 good account. Make not excuses to shift off a duty that must be done, 
 nor delight to keep thy neighbour in pain and in suspense, nor to show 
 the authority which the giver has over the beggar; but readily and 
 cheerfully, and from a principle of conscience towards God, give good 
 to <I>those to whom it is due,</I>" to the <I>lords and owners of 
 it</I> (so the word is), to those who upon any account are entitled to 
 it. This requires us, 

 1. To pay our just debts without fraud, covin, or delay. 

 2. To give wages to those who have earned them. 

 3. To provide for our relations, and those that have dependence on us,
 for to them it is due.

 4. To render dues both to church and state, magistrates and ministers.
 
 5. To be ready to all acts of friendship and humanity, and in every 
 thing to be neighbourly; for these are things that are due by the law 
 of doing as we would be done by. 

 6. To be charitable to the poor and necessitous. If others want the 
 necessary supports of life, and we have wherewithal to supply them, we 
 must look upon it as due to them and not withhold it. Alms are called 
 <I>righteousness</I> because they are a debt to the poor, and a debt 
 which we must not defer to pay, <I>Bis dat, qui cito dat</I>--<I>He 
 gives twice who gives speedily.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We must never design any hurt or harm to any body 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):
 
 "<I>Devise not evil against thy neighbour;</I> do not contrive how to 
 do him an ill-turn undiscovered, to prejudice him in his body, goods, 
 or good name, and the rather because <I>he dwells securely by thee,</I> 
 and, having given thee no provocation, entertains no jealousy or 
 suspicion of thee, and therefore is off his guard." It is against the 
 laws both of honour and friendship to do a man an ill-turn and give him 
 no warning. <I>Cursed be he that smites his neighbour secretly.</I> It 
 is a most base ungrateful thing, if our neighbours have a good opinion 
 of us, that we will do them no harm, and we thence take advantage to 
 cheat and injure them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We must not be quarrelsome and litigious 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 "Do not <I>strive with a man without cause;</I> contend not for that 
 which thou hast no title to; resent not that as a provocation which 
 peradventure was but an oversight. Never trouble thy neighbour with 
 frivolous complaints and accusations, or vexatious law-suits, when 
 either there is no harm done thee or none worth speaking of, or thou 
 mightest right thyself in a friendly way." Law must be the last refuge; 
 for it is not only our duty, but our interest, <I>as much as in us 
 lies, to live peaceably with all men.</I> When accounts are balanced, 
 it will be found there is little got by striving.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We must not envy the prosperity of evil-doers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 This caution is the same with that which is so much insisted on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:1,7-9">Ps. xxxvii.</A>

 "<I>Envy not the oppressor;</I> though he be rich and great, though he
 live in ease and pleasure, and make all about him to stand in awe of
 him, yet do not think him a happy man, nor wish thyself in his
 condition. <I>Choose none of his ways;</I> do not imitate him, nor
 take the courses he takes to enrich himself. Never think of doing as he 
 does, though thou wert sure to get by it all that he has, for it would 
 be dearly bought." Now, to show what little reason saints have to envy 
 sinners, Solomon here, in the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:32-35">last four verses</A>

 of the chapter, compares the condition of sinners and saints together
 (as his father David had done, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:22">Ps. xxxvii.</A>),

 sets the one over against the other, that we may see how happy the
 saints are, though they be oppressed, and how miserable the wicked are, 
 though they be oppressors. Men are to be judged of as they stand with
 God, and as he judges of them, not as they stand in the world's books. 
 Those are in the right who are of God's mind; and, if we be of his 
 mind, we shall see, whatever pretence one sinner may have to envy 
 another, that saints are so happy themselves that they have no reason 
 at all to envy any sinner, though his condition be ever so prosperous. 
 For,

 1. Sinners are hated of God, but saints are beloved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 The froward sinners, who are continually going from-ward him, whose 
 lives are a perverse contradiction to his will, are <I>abomination to 
 the Lord.</I> He that hates nothing that he has made yet abhors those 
 who have thus marred themselves; they are not only abominable in his 
 sight, but an abomination. The righteous therefore have no reason to 
 envy them, for they have his secret with them; they are his favourites; 
 he has that communion with them which is a secret to the world and in 
 which they have a joy that a stranger does not intermeddle with; he 
 communicates to them the secret tokens of his love; his covenant is 
 with them; they know his mind, and the meanings and intentions of his 
 providence, better than others can. <I>Shall I hide from Abraham the 
 thing that I do?</I>

 2. Sinners are under the curse of God, they and their houses; saints 
 are under his blessing, they and their habitation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 The wicked has a house, a strong and stately dwelling perhaps, but 
 <I>the curse of the Lord</I> is upon it, it is <I>in it,</I> and, 
 though the affairs of the family may prosper, yet the very blessings 
 are curses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:2">Mal. ii. 2</A>.

 There is <I>leanness in the soul,</I> when the body is fed to the full, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:15">Ps. cvi. 15</A>.

 The curse may work silently and slowly; but it is as a fretting 
 leprosy; it will consume the <I>timber thereof and the stones 
 thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:4,Hab+2:11">Zech. v. 4; Hab. ii. 11</A>.

 The just have a habitation, a poor cottage (the word is used for 
 sheep-cotes), a very mean dwelling; but God blesses it; he is 
 continually blessing it, from the beginning of the year to the end of 
 it. The curse or blessing of God is upon the house according as the 
 inhabitants are wicked or godly; and it is certain that a blessed 
 family, though poor, has no reason to envy a cursed family, though 
 rich.

 3. God puts contempt upon sinners, but shows respect to saints, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.
 
 (1.) Those who exalt themselves shall certainly be abased: <I>Surely he 
 scorns the scorners.</I> Those who scorn to submit to the discipline of 
 religion, scorn to take God's yoke upon them, scorn to be beholden to 
 his grace, who scoff at godliness and godly people, and take a pleasure 
 in bantering and exposing them, God will scorn them, and lay them open 
 to scorn before all the world. He despises their impotent malice,
 <I>sits in heaven and laughs at them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:4">Ps. ii. 4</A>.

 He retaliates upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:26">Ps. xviii. 26</A>);
 
 he <I>resists the proud.</I>

 (2.) Those who humble themselves shall be exalted, for <I>he gives 
 grace to the lowly;</I> he works that in them which puts honour upon 
 them and for which they are <I>accepted of God and approved of men.</I> 
 Those who patiently bear contempt from scornful men shall have respect 
 from God and all good men, and then they have no reason to envy the 
 scorners or to choose their ways. 

 4. The end of sinners will be everlasting shame, the end of saints 
 endless honour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.

 (1.) Saints are wise men, and act wisely for themselves; for though 
 their religion now wraps them up in obscurity, and lays them open to 
 reproach, yet they are sure to inherit glory at last, the far more 
 exceeding and eternal weight of glory. They shall have it, and have it 
 by inheritance, the sweetest and surest tenure. God gives them grace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>),

 and therefore they shall inherit glory, for grace is glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:18">2 Cor. iii. 18</A>.
 
 It is glory begun, the earnest of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:11">Ps. lxxxiv. 11</A>.

 (2.) Sinners are fools, for they are not only preparing disgrace for 
 themselves, but at the same time flattering themselves with a prospect 
 of honour, as if they only took the way to be great. Their end will 
 manifest their folly: <I>Shame shall be their promotion.</I> And it 
 will be so much the more their punishment as it will come instead of 
 their promotion; it will be all the promotion they must ever expect, 
 that God will be glorified in their everlasting confusion.</P>
