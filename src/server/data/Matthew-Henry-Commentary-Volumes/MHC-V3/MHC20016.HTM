 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the
 tongue, <I>is</I> from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As we read this, it teaches us a great truth, that we are not 
 sufficient of ourselves to <I>think or speak any thing of ourselves</I> 
 that is wise and good, but that all <I>our sufficiency is of God,</I> 
 who is with the heart and with the mouth, and <I>works in us both to 
 will and to do,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+2:13,Ps+10:17">Phil. ii. 13; Ps. x. 17</A>.

 But most read it otherwise: <I>The preparation of the heart is in
 man</I> (he may contrive and design this and the other) but <I>the 
 answer of the tongue,</I> not only the delivering of what he designed 
 to speak, but the issue and success of what he designed to do, <I>is of 
 the Lord.</I> That is, in short,

 1. <I>Man purposes.</I> He has a freedom of thought and a freedom of
 will permitted him; let him form his projects, and lay his schemes, as 
 he thinks best: but, after all, 

 2. <I>God disposes.</I> Man cannot go on with his business without the 
 assistance and blessing of God, who <I>made man's mouth</I> and teaches 
 us what we shall say. Nay, God easily can, and often does, cross men's 
 purposes, and break their measures. It was a curse that was prepared in 
 Balaam's heart, but the answer of the tongue was a blessing.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  All the ways of a man <I>are</I> clean in his own eyes; but the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> weigheth the spirits.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. We are all apt to be partial in judging of ourselves: <I>All the 
 ways of a man,</I> all his designs, all his doings, <I>are clean in his 
 own eyes,</I> and he sees nothing amiss in them, nothing for which to 
 condemn himself, or which should make his projects prove otherwise than 
 well; and therefore he is confident of success, and that the answer of 
 the tongue shall be according to the expectations of the heart; but 
 there is a great deal of pollution cleaving to our ways, which we are 
 not aware of, or do not think so ill of as we ought. 

 2. The judgment of God concerning us, we are sure, is according to
 truth: He <I>weighs the spirits</I> in a just and unerring balance, 
 knows what is in us, and passes a judgment upon us accordingly, writing 
 <I>Tekel</I> upon that which passed our scale with 
 approbation--<I>weighed in the balance and found wanting;</I> and by 
 his judgment we must stand or fall. He not only sees men's ways but 
 tries their spirits, and we are as our spirits are.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr16_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  Commit thy works unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and thy thoughts shall be
 established.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is a very desirable thing to have <I>our thoughts 
 established,</I> and not tossed, and put into a hurry, by disquieting 
 cares and fears,--to go on in an even steady course of honesty and 
 piety, not disturbed, or put out of frame, by any event or change,--to 
 be satisfied that all shall work for good and issue well at last, and 
 therefore to be always easy and sedate. 

 2. The only way to have our <I>thoughts established</I> is to <I>commit 
 our works to the Lord.</I> The great concerns of our souls must be 
 committed to the grace of God, with a dependence upon and submission to 
 the conduct of that grace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:12">2 Tim. i. 12</A>);

 all our outward concerns must be committed to the providence of God, 
 and to the sovereign, wise, and gracious disposal of that providence. 
 <I>Roll thy works upon the Lord</I> (so the word is); roll the burden 
 of thy care from thyself upon God. Lay the matter before him by prayer. 
 <I>Make known thy works unto the Lord</I> (so some read it), not only 
 the works of thy hand, but the workings of thy heart; and then leave it 
 with him, by faith and dependence upon him, submission and resignation 
 to him. <I>The will of the Lord be done.</I> We may then be easy when 
 we resolve that whatever pleases God shall please us.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath made all <I>things</I> for himself: yea, even the
 wicked for the day of evil.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. That God is the first cause. He is the former of all things and all 
 persons, the fountain of being; he gave every creature the being it has 
 and appointed it its place. Even the wicked are his creatures, though 
 they are rebels; he gave them those powers with which they fight 
 against him, which aggravates their wickedness, that they will not let 
 him that made them rule them, and therefore, though he made them, he 
 will not save them. 

 2. That God is the last end. All is of him and from him, and therefore 
 all is to him and for him. He made all according to his will and for 
 his praise; he designed to serve his own purposes by all his creatures, 
 and he will not fail of his designs; all are his servants. The wicked 
 he is not glorified by, but he will be glorified upon. He makes no man 
 wicked, but he made those who he foresaw would be wicked: yet he made 
 them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:6">Gen. vi. 6</A>),

 because he knew how to <I>get himself honour upon them.</I> See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:22">Rom. ix. 22</A>.

 Or (as some understand it) he made the wicked to be employed by him as 
 the instruments of his wrath in the day of evil, when he brings 
 judgments on the world. He makes some use even of wicked men, as of 
 other things, to be his sword, his hand

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. The pride of sinners sets God against them. He that, being high in 
 estate is proud in heart, whose spirit is elevated with his condition, 
 so that he becomes insolent in his conduct towards God and man, let him 
 know that though he admires himself, and others caress him, yet he is 
 <I>an abomination to the Lord.</I> The great God despises him; the holy 
 God detests him.

 2. The power of sinners cannot secure them against God, though they 
 strengthen themselves with body hands. Though they may strengthen one 
 another with their confederacies and combinations, joining forces 
 against God, they shall not escape his righteous judgment. <I>Woe unto 
 him that strives with his Maker,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>men</I> depart from evil.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. How the guilt of sin is taken away from us--by the <I>mercy and 
 truth</I> of God, mercy in promising, truth in performing, the mercy 
 and truth which kiss each other in Jesus Christ the Mediator--by the 
 covenant of grace, in which mercy and truth shine so brightly--by our 
 mercy and truth, as the condition of the pardon and a necessary 
 qualification for it--by these, and not by the legal sacrifices, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:7,8">Mic. vi. 7, 8</A>.

 2. How the power of sin is broken in us. By the principles of <I>mercy 
 and truth</I> commanding in us the corrupt inclinations are purged out 
 (so we may take the former part); however, <I>by the fear of the 
 Lord,</I> and the influence of that fear, <I>men depart from evil;</I> 
 those will not dare to sin against God who keep up in their minds a 
 holy dread and reverence of him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  When a man's ways please the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, he maketh even his enemies
 to be at peace with him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. God can turn foes into friends when he pleases. He that has all 
 hearts in his hand has access to men's spirits and power over them, 
 working insensibly, but irresistibly upon them, can make <I>a man's 
 enemies to be at peace with him,</I> can change their minds, or force 
 them into a feigned submission. He can slay all enemies, and bring 
 those together that were at the greatest distance from each other. 

 2. He will do it for us when we please him. If we make it our care to
 be reconciled to God, and to keep ourselves in his love, he will 
 incline those that have been envious towards us, and vexatious to us, 
 to entertain a good opinion of us and to become our friends. God made 
 Esau to be at peace with Jacob, Abimelech with Isaac, and David's 
 enemies to court his favour and desire a league with Israel. The image 
 of God appearing upon the righteous, and his particular lovingkindness 
 to them, are enough to recommend them to the respect of all, even of 
 those that have been most prejudiced against them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Better <I>is</I> a little with righteousness than great revenues
 without right.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. It is supposed that an honest good man may have but a little of the 
 wealth of this world (all the righteous are not rich),--that a man may 
 have but little, and yet may be honest (though poverty is a temptation 
 to dishonesty,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:9"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 9</A>,

 yet not an invincible one),--and that a man may grow rich, for a while,
 by fraud and oppression, may have <I>great revenues,</I> and those got 
 and kept <I>without right,</I> may have no good title to them nor make 
 any good use of them. 

 2. It is maintained that a small estate, honestly come by, which a man 
 is content with, enjoys comfortably, serves God with cheerfully, and 
 puts to a right use, is much better and more valuable than a great 
 estate ill-got, and then ill-kept or ill-spent. It carries with it
 more inward satisfaction, a better reputation with all that are wise 
 and good; it will last longer, and will turn to a better account in the 
 great day, when men will be judged, not according to what they had, but 
 what they did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  A man's heart deviseth his way: but the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> directeth his
 steps.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Man is here represented to us, 

 1. As a reasonable creature, that has the faculty of contriving for 
 himself: <I>His heart devises his way,</I> designs an end, and projects 
 ways and means leading to that end, which the inferior creatures, who 
 are governed by sense and natural instinct, cannot do. The more shame 
 for him if he do not devise the way how to please God and provide for 
 his everlasting state. 

 2. But as a depending creature, that is subject to the direction and 
 dominion of his Maker. If men <I>devise their way,</I> so as to make 
 God's glory their end and his will their rule, they may expect that he 
 will <I>direct their steps</I> by his Spirit and grace, so that they 
 shall not miss their way nor come short of their end. But let men 
 devise their worldly affairs ever so politely, and with ever so great a 
 probability of success, yet God has the ordering of the event, and 
 sometimes <I>directs their steps</I> to that which they least intended.
 The design of this is to teach us to say, <I>If the Lord will, we shall 
 live and do this or that</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:14,15">Jam. iv. 14, 15</A>),

 and to have our eye to God, not only in the great turns of our lives, 
 but in every step we take. <I>Lord, direct my way,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  A divine sentence <I>is</I> in the lips of the king: his mouth
 transgresseth not in judgment.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We wish this were always true as a proposition, and we ought to make it 
 our prayer for kings, and all in authority, that a <I>divine 
 sentence</I> may be in their lips, both in giving orders, that they may 
 do that in wisdom, and in giving sentence, that they may do that in 
 equity, both which are included in <I>judgment,</I> and that in neither 
 <I>their mouth may transgress,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:1">1 Tim. ii. 1</A>.

 But it is often otherwise; and therefore,

 1. It may be read as a precept to the kings and judges of the earth to
 be wise and instructed. Let them be just, and rule in the fear of God; 
 let them act with such wisdom and conscience that there may appear a 
 holy divination in all they say or do, and that they are guided by 
 principles supernatural: let not their mouths transgress in judgment, 
 for the judgment is God's. 

 2. It may be taken as a promise to all good kings, that if they 
 sincerely aim at God's glory, and seek direction from him, he will 
 qualify them with wisdom and grace above others, in proportion to the 
 eminency of their station and the trusts lodged in their hands. When 
 Saul himself was made king God gave him another spirit. 

 3. It was true concerning Solomon who wrote this; he had extraordinary 
 wisdom, pursuant to the promise God made him, See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+3:28">1 Kings iii. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. The administration of public justice by the magistrate is an 
 ordinance of God; in it the scales are held, and ought to be held by a 
 steady and impartial hand; and we ought to submit to it, for the Lord's 
 sake, and to see his authority in that of the magistrate, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:1,1Pe+2:13">Rom. xiii. 1; 1 Pet. ii. 13</A>.

 2. The observance of justice in commerce between man and man is 
 likewise a divine appointment. He taught men discretion to make scales 
 and weights for the adjusting of right exactly between buyer and 
 seller, that neither may be wronged; and all other useful inventions 
 for the preserving of right are from him. He has also appointed by his 
 law that they be just. It is therefore a great affront to him, and to 
 his government, to falsify, and so to do wrong under colour and 
 pretence of doing right, which is <I>wickedness in the place of 
 judgment.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  <I>It is</I> an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for
 the throne is established by righteousness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The character of a good king, which Solomon intended not for his own 
 praise, but for instruction to his successors, his neighbours, and the 
 viceroys under him. A good king not only does justice, but it is <I>an 
 abomination</I> to him to do otherwise. He hates the thought of doing 
 wrong and perverting justice; he not only abhors the wickedness done by 
 others, but abhors the wickedness done by others, but abhors to do any 
 himself, though, having power, he might easily and safely do it.

 2. The comfort of a good king: His <I>throne is established by
 righteousness.</I> He that makes conscience of using his power aright 
 shall find that to be the best security of his government, both as it 
 will oblige people, make them easy, and keep them in the interest of 
 it, and as it will obtain the blessing of God, which will be a firm 
 basis to the throne and a strong guard about it.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr16_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  Righteous lips <I>are</I> the delight of kings; and they love him
 that speaketh right.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a further character of good kings, that they <I>love</I> and
 <I>delight</I> in those that <I>speak right.</I>

 1. They hate parasites and those that flatter them, and are very
 willing that all about them should deal faithfully with them and tell
 them that which is true, whether it be pleasing or displeasing, both
 concerning persons and things, that every thing should be set in a true
 light and nothing disguised,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:12"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 12</A>.

 2. They not only do righteousness themselves, but take care to employ
 those under them that do righteousness too, which is of great 
 consequence to the people, who must be subject not only to the king as
 supreme, but to the governors sent by him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:14">1 Pet. ii. 14</A>.

 A good king will therefore put those in power who are conscientious,
 and will say that which is righteous and discreet, and know how to
 speak aright and to the purpose.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  The wrath of a king <I>is as</I> messengers of death: but a wise
 man will pacify it.
 &nbsp; 15  In the light of the king's countenance <I>is</I> life; and his
 favour <I>is</I> as a cloud of the latter rain.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These two verses show the power of kings, which is every where great,
 but was especially so in those eastern countries, where they were
 absolute and arbitrary. Whom they would they slew and whom they would
 they kept alive. Their will was a law. We have reason to bless God for
 the happy constitution of the government we live under, which maintains
 the prerogative of the prince without any injury to the liberty of the
 subject. But here it is intimated,

 1. How formidable <I>the wrath of a king is:</I> It is <I>as messengers
 of death;</I> the wrath of Ahasuerus was so to Haman. An angry word
 from an incensed prince has been to many a <I>messenger of death,</I>
 and has struck so great a terror upon some as if a sentence of death
 had been pronounced upon them. He must be a very <I>wise man</I> that
 knows how to <I>pacify</I> the wrath of a king with a word fitly 
 spoken, as Jonathan once pacified his father's rage against David, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:6">1 Sam. xix. 6</A>.

 A prudent subject may sometimes suggest that to an angry prince which 
 will cool his resentments.

 2. How valuable and desirable the king's favour is to those that have 
 incurred his displeasure; it is life from the dead if the king be 
 reconciled to them. To others it is <I>as a cloud of the latter 
 rain,</I> very refreshing to the ground. Solomon put his subjects in
 mind of this, that they might not do any thing to incur his wrath, but 
 be careful to recommend themselves to his favour. We ought by it to be 
 put in mind how much we are concerned to escape the wrath and obtain 
 the favour of the King of kings. His frowns are worse than death, and 
 his favour is better than life; and therefore those are fools who to 
 escape the wrath, and obtain the favour, of an earthly prince, will 
 throw themselves out of God's favour, and make themselves obnoxious to 
 his wrath.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  How much better <I>is it</I> to get wisdom than gold! and to get
 understanding rather to be chosen than silver!
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon here not only asserts that it is better to get wisdom than gold
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:14,8:19"><I>ch.</I> iii. 14, viii. 19</A>),

 but he speaks it with assurance, that it is much better, better beyond
 expression--with admiration (<I>How much better!</I>) as one amazed at 
 the disproportion--with an appeal to men's consciences ("Judge in 
 yourselves how much better it is" )--and with an addition to the same 
 purport, that understanding is <I>rather to be chosen than silver</I> 
 and all the treasures of kings and their favourites. Note, 

 1. Heavenly wisdom is better than worldly wealth, and to be preferred 
 before it. Grace is more valuable than gold. Grace is the gift of
 God's peculiar favour; gold only of common providence. Grace is for
 ourselves; gold for others. Grace is for the soul and eternity; gold 
 only for the body and time. Grace will stand us in stead in a dying 
 hour, when gold will do us no good. 

 2. The getting of this heavenly wisdom is better than the getting of 
 worldly wealth. Many take care and pains to get wealth, and yet come 
 short of it; but grace was never denied to any that sincerely sought 
 it. There is vanity and vexation of spirit in getting wealth, but joy 
 and satisfaction of spirit in getting wisdom. <I>Great peace have those 
 that love it.</I></P>

 Note, 

 1. It is <I>the way of the upright</I> to avoid sin, and every thing 
 that looks like it and leads towards it; and this is a highway marked 
 out by authority, tracked by many that have gone before us, and in 
 which we meet with many that keep company with us; it is easy to find 
 and safe to be travelled in, like a highway, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:8">Isa. xxxv. 8</A>.

 <I>To depart from evil is understanding.</I>

 2. It is the care of the upright to preserve their own souls, that they 
 be not polluted with sin, and that by the troubles of the world they 
 may not be put out of the possession of them, especially that they may 
 not perish for ever, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:26">Matt. xvi. 26</A>.

 And it is therefore their care to keep their way, and not turn aside

 that think of themselves above what is meet, and look with contempt

 should be laid low. Pharaoh, Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar, were
 instances of this. Men cannot punish pride, but either admire it or 
 fear it, and therefore God will take the punishing of it into his own 
 hands. Let him alone to deal with proud men.

 2. Proud men are frequently most proud, and insolent, and haughty, just 
 before their destruction, so that it is a certain presage that they are 
 upon the brink of it. When proud men set God's judgments at defiance, 
 and think themselves at the greatest distance from them, it is a sign 
 that they are at the door; witness the case of Benhadad and Herod. 
 <I>While the word was in the king's mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:31">Dan. iv. 31</A>.

 Therefore let us not fear the pride of others, but greatly fear pride 
 in ourselves.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr16_19"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  Better <I>it is to be</I> of an humble spirit with the lowly,
 than to divide the spoil with the proud.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a paradox which the children of this world cannot understand 
 and will not subscribe to, that it is better to be poor and humble than 
 to be rich and proud. 

 1. Those that <I>divide the spoil</I> are commonly proud; they value 
 themselves and despise others, and their mind rises with their 
 condition; those therefore that are <I>rich in this world</I> have need 
 to be charged that they <I>be not high-minded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:17">1 Tim. vi. 17</A>.

 Those that are proud and will put forth themselves, that thrust, and 
 shove, and scramble, for preferment, are the men that commonly 
 <I>divide the spoil</I> and share it among them; they have the world at 
 will and the ball at their foot.

 2. It is upon all accounts better to take our lot with those whose 
 condition is low, and their minds brought to it, than to covet and aim 
 to make a figure and a bustle in the world. Humility, though it should 
 expose us to contempt in the world, yet while it recommends us to the 
 favour of God, qualifies us for his gracious visits, prepares us for 
 his glory, secures us from many temptations, and preserves the quiet 
 and repose of our own souls, is much better than that high-spiritedness 
 which, though it carry away the honour and wealth of the world, makes 
 God a man's enemy and the devil his master.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso
 trusteth in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, happy <I>is</I> he.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note,

 1. Prudence gains men respect and success: <I>He that handles a matter 
 wisely</I> (that is master of his trade and makes it to appear he 
 understands what he undertakes, that is considerate in his affairs, 
 and, when he speaks or writes on any subject, does it pertinently) 
 shall <I>find good,</I> shall come into good repute, and perhaps may 
 make a good hand of it. 

 2. But it is piety only that will secure men's true happiness: Those 
 that <I>handle a matter wisely,</I> if they are proud and lean to their 
 own understanding, though they may find some good, yet they will have 
 no great satisfaction in it; but he that <I>trusts in the Lord,</I> and 
 not in his own wisdom, <I>happy is he,</I> and shall speed better at 
 last. Some read the former part of the verse so as to expound it of 
 piety, which is indeed true wisdom: <I>He that attends to the word</I> 
 (the word of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+13:13"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 13</A>)

 shall <I>find good</I> in it and good by it. And whoso <I>trusts in the
 Lord,</I> in his word which he attends to, is happy.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness
 of the lips increaseth learning.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Those that have solid wisdom will have the credit of it; it will 
 gain them reputation, and they <I>shall be called prudent</I> grave 
 men, and a deference will be paid to their judgment. <I>Do that which 
 is wise and good and thou shalt have the praise of the same.</I> 

 2. Those that with their wisdom have a happy elocution, that deliver
 their sentiments easily and with a good grace, are communicative of 
 their wisdom and have words at will, and good language as well as good 
 sense, <I>increase learning;</I> they diffuse and propagate knowledge 
 to others, and do good work with it, and by that means increase their 
 own stock. They add doctrine, improve sciences, and do service to the 
 commonwealth of learning. <I>To him that has,</I> and uses what he has, 
 <I>more shall be given.</I></P>

 it: but the instruction of fools <I>is</I> folly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. There is always some good to be gotten by a wise and good man: His 
 <I>understanding is a well-spring of life to him,</I> which always 
 flows and can never be drawn dry; he has something to say upon all 
 occasions that is instructive, and of use to those that will make use 
 of it, things new and old to bring out of his treasure; at least, his 
 understanding is a <I>spring of life</I> to himself, yielding him 
 abundant satisfaction; within his own thoughts he entertains and 
 edifies himself, if not others. 

 2. There is nothing that is good to be gotten by a fool. Even his 
 instruction, his set and solemn discourses, are but folly, like 
 himself, and tending to make others like him. When he does his best it 
 is but folly, in comparison even with the common talk of a wise man, 
 who speaks better at table than a fool in Moses's seat.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon had commended eloquence, or <I>the sweetness of the lips</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 and seemed to prefer it before wisdom; but here he corrects himself, as 
 it were, and shows that unless there be a good treasure within to 
 support the eloquence it is worth little. Wisdom in <I>the heart</I> is 
 the main matter.

 1. It is this that directs us in speaking, that <I>teaches the 
 mouth</I> what to speak, and when, and how, so that what is spoken may 
 be proper, and pertinent, and seasonable; otherwise, though the 
 language be ever so fine, it had better be unsaid. 

 2. It is this that gives weight to what we speak and <I>adds 
 learning</I> to it, strength of reason and force of argument, without 
 which, let a thing be ever so well worded, it will be rejected, when it 
 comes to be considered, as trifling. Quaint expressions please the ear, 
 and humour the fancy, but it is learning in the lips that must convince 
 the judgment, and sway that, to which wisdom in the heart is 
 necessary.</P>

 The <I>pleasant words</I> here commended must be those which <I>the 
 heart of the wise teaches, and adds learning to</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 words of seasonable advice, instruction, and comfort, words taken from 
 God's word, for that is it which Solomon had learned from his father to 
 account <I>sweeter than honey and the honey-comb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:10">Ps. xix. 10</A>.

 These words, to those that know how to relish them,

 1. Are pleasant. They are like the <I>honey-comb, sweet to the 
 soul,</I> which tastes in them that <I>the Lord is gracious;</I> 
 nothing more grateful and agreeable to the new man than the word of 
 God, and those words which are borrowed from it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:103">Ps. cxix. 103</A>.

 2. They are wholesome. Many things are pleasant that are not 
 profitable, but these <I>pleasant words are health to the bones,</I> to 
 the inward man, as well as <I>sweet to the soul.</I> They make <I>the 
 bones,</I> which sin has broken and put out of joint, <I>to 
 rejoice.</I> The bones are the strength of the body; and the good word 
 of God is a means of spiritual strength, curing the diseases that 
 weaken us.</P>

 but here it is repeated, as that which is very necessary to be thought
 of, 

 1. By way of caution to us all to take heed of deceiving ourselves in 
 the great concerns of our souls by resting in that which <I>seems 
 right</I> and is not really so, and, for the preventing of a 
 self-delusion, to be impartial in self-examination and keep up a 
 jealousy over ourselves.

 This is designed to engage us to diligence, and quicken us, <I>what our

 soul that labours labours for itself.</I> It is heart-work which is 
 here intended, the labour of the soul, which is here recommended to us, 
 
 1. As that which will be absolutely needful. Our mouth is continually
 craving it of us; the necessities both of soul and body are pressing, 
 and require constant relief, so that we must either work or starve.
 Both call for daily bread, and therefore there must be daily labour; 
 for in the sweat of our face we must eat, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+3:10">2 Thess. iii. 10</A>.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There are those that are not only vicious themselves, but spiteful and 
 mischievous to others, and they are the worst of men; two sorts of such 
 are here described:--

 1. Such as envy a man the honour of his good name, and do all they can 
 to blast that by calumnies and misrepresentations: They <I>dig up 
 evil;</I> they take a great deal of pains to find out something or 
 other on which to ground a slander, or which may give some colour to 
 it. If none appear above ground, rather than want it they will dig for 
 it, by diving into what is secret, or looking a great way back, or by 
 evil suspicions and surmises, and forced innuendos. In the lips of a 
 slanderer and backbiter <I>there is as a fire,</I> not only to brand 
 his neighbour's reputation, to smoke and sully it, but <I>as a burning 
 fire</I> to consume it. And how great a matter does a little of this 
 fire kindle, and how hardly is it extinguished! 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:5,6">James iii. 5, 6</A>.

 2. Such as envy a man the comfort of his friendship, and do all they
 can to break that, by suggesting that on both sides which will set 
 those at variance that are most nearly related and have been long 
 intimate, or at least cool and alienate their affections one from 
 another: <I>A froward man,</I> that cannot find in his heart to love 
 any body but himself, is vexed to see others live in love, and 
 therefore makes it is his business to <I>sow strife,</I> by giving men 
 base characters one of another, telling lies, and carrying ill-natured 
 stories between <I>chief friends,</I> so as to <I>separate</I> them one
 from another, and make them angry at or at least suspicious of one
 another. Those are bad men, and bad women too, that do such ill
 offices; they are doing the devil's work, and his will their wages
 be.</P>

 &nbsp; 30  He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his
 lips he bringeth evil to pass.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is another sort of evil men described to us, that we may neither
 do like them, nor have any thing to do with them.

 1. Such as (like Satan) do all the mischief they can by force and
 violence, as roaring lions, and not only by fraud and insinuation, as
 subtle serpents: They are <I>violent men,</I> that do all by rapine and
 oppression, that <I>shut their eyes,</I> meditating with the closest
 intention and application of mind <I>to devise froward things,</I> to
 contrive how they may do the greatest mischief to their neighbour, to
 do it effectually and yet securely to themselves; and then <I>moving
 their lips,</I> giving the word of command to their agents, they 
 <I>bring the evil to pass,</I> and accomplish the wicked device, 
 <I>biting his lips</I> (so some read it) for vexation. When <I>the 
 wicked plots against the just</I> he <I>gnasheth upon him with his 
 teeth.</I> 

 2. Such as (like Satan still) do all they can to <I>entice</I> and
 draw in others to join with them in doing mischief, <I>leading them in 
 a way that is not good,</I> that is not honest, nor honourable, nor 
 safe, but offensive to God, and which will be in the end pernicious to 
 the sinner. Thus he aims to ruin some in this world by bringing them 
 into trouble, and others in the other world by bringing them into
 sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It ought to be the great care of old people to <I>be found in the 
 way of righteousness,</I> the way of religion and serious godliness. 
 Both God and man will look for them in that way; it will be expected 
 that those that are old should be good, that the multitude of their
 years should teach them the best wisdom; let them therefore be found in 
 that way. Death will come; the Judge is coming; <I>the Lord is at 
 hand.</I> That they may <I>be found of him in peace,</I> let them <I>be 
 found in the way of righteousness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:14">2 Pet. iii. 14</A>),

 <I>found so doing,</I>

 Let old people be old disciples; let them persevere to the end <I>in 
 the way of righteousness,</I> which they long since set out in, that 
 they may then be found in it.

 2. If old people <I>be found in the way of righteousness,</I> their age 
 will be their honour. Old age, as such, is honourable, and commands 
 respect (<I>Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+19:32">Lev. xix. 32</A>);

 but, if it be found in the way of wickedness, its honour is forfeited, 
 its crown profaned and laid in the dust, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:20">Isa. lxv. 20</A>.

 Old people therefore, if they would preserve their honour, must still 
 hold fast their integrity, and then their gray hairs are indeed <I>a 
 crown</I> to them; they are <I>worthy of double honour.</I> Grace is 
 the glory of old age.</P>

 This recommends the grace of meekness to us, which will well become us 
 all, particularly <I>the hoary head,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.
 
 Observe,

 1. The nature of it. It is to be <I>slow to anger,</I> not easily put
 into a passion, nor apt to resent provocation, taking time to consider 
 before we suffer our passion to break out, that it may not transgress 
 due bounds, so slow in our motions towards anger that we may be quickly 
 stopped and pacified. It is to have the rule of our own spirits, our 
 appetites and affections, and all our inclinations, but particularly 
 our passions, our anger, keeping that under direction and check, and 
 the strict government of religion and right reason. We must be <I>lords 
 of our anger,</I> as God is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+1:3">Nah. i. 3</A>.

 <I>&AElig;olus sis, affectuum tuorum--Rule your passions, as 
 &AElig;olus rules the winds.</I>

 2. The honour of it. He that gets and keeps the mastery of his passions 
 <I>is better than the mighty,</I> better <I>than he that</I> by a long 
 siege <I>takes a city</I> or by a long war subdues a country. Behold,
 a greater than Alexander or C&aelig;sar is here. The conquest of 
 ourselves, and our own unruly passions, requires more true wisdom, and 
 a more steady, constant, and regular management, than the obtaining of 
 a victory over the forces of an enemy. A rational conquest is more 
 honourable to a rational creature than a brutal one. It is a victory 
 that does nobody any harm; no lives or treasures are sacrificed to it, 
 but only some base lusts. It is harder, and therefore more glorious, to 
 quash an insurrection at home than to resist an invasion from a broad; 
 nay, such are the gains of meekness that by it <I>we are more than 
 conquerors.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. The divine Providence orders and directs those things which to us 
 are perfectly casual and fortuitous. Nothing comes to pass by chance, 
 nor is an event determined by a blind fortune, but every thing by the 
 will and counsel of God. What man has neither eye nor hand in God is 
 intimately concerned in. 

 2. When solemn appeals are made to Providence by the casting of lots, 
 for the deciding of that matter of moment which could not otherwise be 
 at all, or not so well, decided, God must be eyed in it, by prayer, 
 that it may be disposed aright (<I>Give a perfect lot,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:41,Ac+1:24">1 Sam. xiv. 41; Acts i. 24</A>),

 and by acquiescing in it when it is disposed, being satisfied that the 
 hand of God is in it and that hand directed by infinite wisdom. All the 
 disposals of Providence concerning our affairs we must look upon to be 
 the directing of our lot, the determining of what we referred to God, 
 and must be reconciled to them accordingly.</P>
