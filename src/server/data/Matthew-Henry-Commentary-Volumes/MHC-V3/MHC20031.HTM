 This chapter is added to Solomon's proverbs, some think because it is
 of the same author, supposing king Lemuel to be king Solomon; others
 only because it is of the same nature, though left in writing by
 another author, called Lemuel; however it be, it is a prophecy, and
 therefore given by inspiration and direction of God, which Lemuel was 
 under in the writing of it, and putting it into this form, as his 
 mother was in dictating to him the matter of it. Here is, 

 I. An exhortation to Lemuel, a young prince, to take heed of the sins
 he would be tempted to and to do the duties of the place he was called 
 to, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:1-9">ver. 1-9</A>.

 II. The description of a virtuous woman, especially in the relation of
 a wife and the mistress of a family, which Lemuel's mother drew up, not 
 as an encomium of herself, though, no doubt, it was her own true 
 picture, but either as an instruction to her daughters, as the 
 foregoing verses were to her son, or as a direction to her son in the
 choice of a wife; she must be chaste and modest, diligent and frugal, 
 dutiful to her husband, careful of her family, discreet in her
 discourse, and in the education of her children, and, above all,
 conscientious in her duty to God: such a one as this, if he can find
 her, will make him happy,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught
 him.
 &nbsp; 2  What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son
 of my vows?
 &nbsp; 3  Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which
 destroyeth kings.
 &nbsp; 4  <I>It is</I> not for kings, O Lemuel, <I>it is</I> not for kings to
 drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:
 &nbsp; 5  Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment
 of any of the afflicted.
 &nbsp; 6  Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine
 unto those that be of heavy hearts.
 &nbsp; 7  Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his
 misery no more.
 &nbsp; 8  Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are
 appointed to destruction.
 &nbsp; 9  Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the
 poor and needy.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Most interpreters are of opinion that Lemuel is Solomon; the name 
 signifies one that is <I>for God,</I> or <I>devoted to God;</I> and so 
 it agrees well enough with that honourable name which, by divine 
 appointment, was given to Solomon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:25">
 2 Sam. xii. 25</A>),

 <I>Jedediah--beloved of the Lord.</I> Lemuel is supposed to be a
 pretty, fond, endearing name, by which his mother used to call him; and 
 so much did he value himself upon the interest he had in his mother's 
 affections that he was not ashamed to call himself by it. One would the 
 rather incline to think it is Solomon that here tells us what <I>his 
 mother taught him</I> because he tells us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:4"><I>ch.</I> iv. 4</A>)

 what his father taught him. But some think (and the conjecture is not
 improbable) that Lemuel was a prince of some neighbouring country, 
 whose mother was a daughter of Israel, perhaps of the house of David, 
 and taught him these good lessons. Note, 

 1. It is the duty of mothers, as well as fathers, to teach their
 children what is good, that they may do it, and what is evil, that they 
 may avoid it; when they are young and tender they are most under the 
 mother's eye, and she has then an opportunity of moulding and 
 fashioning their minds well, which she ought not to let slip. 

 2. Even kings must be catechised; the greatest of men is less than the 
 least of the ordinances of God. 

 3. Those that have grown up to maturity should often call to mind, and
 make mention of, the good instructions they received when they were 
 children, for their own admonition, the edification of others, and the 
 honour of those who were the guides of their youth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now, in this mother's (this queen mother's) catechism, observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Her expostulation with the young prince, by which she lays hold of 
 him, claims an interest in him, and awakens his attention to what she 
 is about to say 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>What! my son?</I> What shall I say to thee?" She speaks as one
 considering what advice to give him, and choosing out words to reason 
 with him; so full of concern is she for his welfare! Or, <I>What is it 
 that thou doest?</I> It seems to be a chiding question. She observed, 
 when he was young, that he was too much inclined to women and wine, and 
 therefore she found it necessary to take him to task and deal roundly 
 with him. "<I>What! my son?</I> Is this the course of life thou 
 intendest to lead? Have I taught thee no better than thus? I must 
 reprove thee, and reprove thee sharply, and thou must take it well, 
 for," 

 1. "Thou art descended from me; thou art <I>the son of my womb,</I> and
 therefore what I say comes from the authority and affection of a parent 
 and cannot be suspected to come from any ill-will. Thou art a piece of 
 myself. I bore thee with sorrow, and I expect no other return for all 
 the pains I have taken with thee, and undergone for thee, than this, Be 
 wise and good, and then I am well paid." 

 2. "Thou art devoted to my God; thou art <I>the son of my vows,</I> the 
 son I prayed to God to give me and promised to give back to God, and 
 did so" (thus Samuel was the son of Hannah's vows); "Thou art the son I 
 have often prayed to God to give his grace to

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:1">Ps. lxxii. 1</A>),
 
 and shall a child of so many prayers miscarry? And shall all my hopes
 concerning thee be disappointed?" Our children that by baptism are 
 dedicated to God, for whom and in whose name we covenanted with God, 
 may well be called <I>the children of our vows;</I> and, as this may be 
 made a good plea with God in our prayers for them, so it may be made a 
 good plea with them in the instructions we give them; we may tell them 
 they are baptized, are <I>the children of our vows,</I> and it is at 
 their peril if they break those bonds in sunder which in their infancy 
 they were solemnly brought under.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The caution she gives him against those two destroying sins of 
 <I>uncleanness</I> and <I>drunkenness,</I> which, if he allowed himself 
 in them, would certainly be his ruin. 
 
 1. Against uncleanness
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>Give not thy strength unto women,</I> unto strange women. He must
 not be soft and effeminate, nor spend that time in a vain conversation 
 with the ladies which should be spent in getting knowledge and 
 despatching business, nor employ that wit (which is the strength of the 
 soul) in courting and complimenting them which he should employ about 
 the affairs of his government. "Especially shun all adultery, 
 fornication, and lasciviousness, which waste the strength of the body, 
 and bring into it dangerous diseases. <I>Give not thy ways,</I> thy 
 affections, thy conversation, <I>to that which destroys kings,</I> 
 which has destroyed many, which gave such a shock to the kingdom even 
 of David himself, in the matter of Uriah. Let the sufferings of others 
 be thy warnings." It lessens the honour of kings and makes them mean. 
 Are those fit to govern others that are themselves slaves to their own 
 lusts? It makes them unfit for business, and fills their court with the 
 basest and worst of animals. Kings lie exposed to temptations of this 
 kind, having wherewith both to please the humours and to bear the 
 charges of the sin, and therefore they ought to double their guard; 
 and, if they would preserve their people from the unclean spirit, they 
 must themselves be patterns of purity. Meaner people may also apply it 
 to themselves. Let none give their strength <I>to that which destroys 
 souls.</I> 

 2. Against drunkenness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 He must not <I>drink wine</I> or <I>strong drink</I> to excess; he must
 never sit to drink, as they used to do <I>in the day of their king,</I> 
 when <I>the princes made him sick with bottles of wine,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:7">Hos. vii. 7</A>.
 
 Whatever temptation he might be in from the excellency of the wine, or
 the charms of the company, he must deny himself, and be strictly sober, 
 considering,

 (1.) The indecency of drunkenness in a king. However some may call it a
 fashionable accomplishment and entertainment, <I>it is not for kings, O 
 Lemuel! it is not for kings, to</I> allow themselves that liberty; it 
 is a disparagement to their dignity, and profanes their crown, by 
 confusing the head that wears it; that which for the time unmans them 
 does for the time unking them. Shall we say, <I>They are gods?</I> No, 
 they are <I>worse than the beasts that perish.</I> All Christians are 
 <I>made to our God kings and priests,</I> and must apply this to 
 themselves. <I>It is not for</I> Christians, <I>it is not for</I> 
 Christians, <I>to drink</I> to excess; they debase themselves if they 
 do; it ill becomes the heirs of the kingdom and the spiritual priests, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+10:9">
 Lev. x. 9</A>.

 (2.) The ill consequences of it
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Lest they drink</I> away their understandings and memories, <I>drink
 and forget the law</I> by which they are to govern; and so, instead of 
 doing good with their power, do hurt with it, <I>and pervert</I> or 
 <I>alter the judgment of all the sons of affliction,</I> and, when they 
 should right them, wrong them, and add to their affliction. It is a sad 
 complaint which is made of the priests and prophets

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:7">Isa. xxviii. 7</A>),

 that <I>they have erred through wine, and through strong drink they are
 out of the way;</I> and the effect is as bad in kings, who when they 
 are drunk, or intoxicated with the love of wine, cannot but stumble in 
 judgment. Judges must have clear heads, which those cannot have who so
 often make themselves giddy, and incapacitate themselves to judge of 
 the most common things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The counsel she gives him to do good. 

 1. He must do good with his wealth. Great men must not think that they
 have their abundance only that out of it they may <I>made provision for 
 the flesh, to fulfil the lusts of it,</I> and may the more freely 
 indulge their own genius; no, but that with it they may relieve such as 
 are in distress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 "Thou hast wine or strong drink at command; instead of doing thyself
 hurt with it, do others good with it; let those have it that need it." 
 Those that have wherewithal must not only give bread to the hungry and 
 water to the thirsty, but they must <I>give strong drink to him that is 
 ready to perish</I> through sickness or pain <I>and wine to those 
 that</I> are melancholy and <I>of heavy heart;</I> for it was appointed 
 to cheer and revive the spirits, and <I>make glad the heart</I> (as it 
 does where there is need of it), not to burden and oppress the spirits, 
 as it does where there is no need of it. We must deny ourselves in the 
 gratifications of sense, that we may have to spare for the relief of 
 the miseries of others, and be glad to see our superfluities and 
 dainties better bestowed upon those whom they will be a real kindness 
 to than upon ourselves whom they will be a real injury to. Let those 
 that are <I>ready to perish</I> drink soberly, and it will be a means 
 so to revive their drooping spirits that they will <I>forget their 
 poverty</I> for the time <I>and remember their misery no more,</I> and 
 so they will be the better able to bear it. The Jews say that upon this 
 was grounded the practice of giving a stupifying drink to condemned 
 prisoners when they were going to execution, as they did to our 
 Saviour. But the scope of the place is to show that wine is a cordial, 
 and therefore to be used for want and not for wantonness, by those only 
 that need cordials, as Timothy, who is advised to <I>drink a little 
 wine,</I> only <I>for his stomach's sake and his often infirmities,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:23">1 Tim. v. 23</A>.

 2. He must do good with his power, his knowledge, and interest, must 
 administer justice with care, courage, and compassion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>.

 (1.) He must himself take cognizance of the causes his subjects have
 depending in his courts, and inspect what his judges and officers do, 
 that he may support those that do their duty, and lay those aside that 
 neglect it or are partial.

 (2.) He must, in all matters that come before him, <I>judge 
 righteously,</I> and, without fear of the face of man, boldly pass 
 sentence according to equity: <I>Open thy mouth,</I> which denotes the 
 liberty of speech that princes and judges ought to use in passing 
 sentence. Some observe that only wise men <I>open</I> their mouths, for 
 fools have their mouths always open, are full of words.

 (3.) He must especially look upon himself as obliged to be the patron
 of oppressed innocency. The inferior magistrates perhaps had not zeal 
 and tenderness enough to <I>plead the cause of the poor and needy;</I> 
 therefore the king himself must interpose, and appear as an advocate, 
 
 [1.] For those that were unjustly charged with capital crimes, as
 Naboth was, that were <I>appointed to destruction,</I> to gratify the 
 malice either of a particular person or of a party. It is a case which 
 it well befits a king to appear in, for the preserving of innocent 
 blood. 

 [2.] For those that had actions unjustly brought against them, to
 defraud them of their right, because they were <I>poor and needy,</I> 
 and unable to defend it, not having wherewithal to fee counsel; in such 
 a case also kings must be advocates for the poor. Especially,

 [3.] For those that were <I>dumb,</I> and knew not how to speak for
 themselves, either through weakness or fear, or being over-talked by 
 the prosecutor or over-awed by the court. It is generous to speak for 
 those that cannot speak for themselves, that are absent, or have not 
 words at command, or are timorous. Our law appoints the judge to be of 
 counsel for the prisoner.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price <I>is</I> far above
 rubies.
 &nbsp; 11  The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that
 he shall have no need of spoil.
 &nbsp; 12  She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
 &nbsp; 13  She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her

 &nbsp; 14  She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from

 &nbsp; 15  She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to
 her household, and a portion to her maidens.

 This description of the <I>virtuous woman</I> is designed to show what 
 wives the women should make and what wives the men should choose; it 
 consists of twenty-two verses, each beginning with a letter of the 
 Hebrew alphabet in order, as some of the <I>Psalms,</I> which makes 
 some think it was no part of the lesson which Lemuel's mother taught 
 him, but a poem by itself, written by some other hand, and perhaps had 
 been commonly repeated among the pious Jews, for the ease of which it 
 was made alphabetical. We have the abridgment of it in the New
 Testament 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:9,10,1Pe+3:1-6">1 Tim. ii. 9, 10; 1 Pet. iii. 1-6</A>),

 where the duty prescribed to wives agrees with this description of a
 good wife; and with good reason is so much stress laid upon it, since 
 it contributes as much as any one thing to the keeping up of religion 
 in families, and the entail of it upon posterity, that the mothers be 
 wise and good; and of what consequence it is to the wealth and outward 
 prosperity of a house every one is sensible. He that will thrive must 
 ask his wife leave. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A general enquiry after such a one 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 where observe, 

 1. The person enquired after, and that is <I>a virtuous woman--a woman
 of strength</I> (so the word is), though the weaker vessel, yet made 
 strong by wisdom and grace, and the fear of God: it is the same word 
 that is used in the character of good judges

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:21">Exod. xviii. 21</A>),

 that they are <I>able men,</I> men qualified for the business to which
 they are called, <I>men of truth, fearing God.</I> So it follows, <I>A 
 virtuous woman</I> is a woman of spirit, who has the command of her own 
 spirit and knows how to manage other people's, one that is pious and 
 industrious, and a help meet for a man. In opposition to this strength, 
 we read of the weakness of the heart <I>of an imperious whorish 
 woman,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+16:30">Ezek. xvi. 30</A>.

 <I>A virtuous woman</I> is a woman of resolution, who, having espoused
 good principles, is firm and steady to them, and will not be frightened 
 with winds and clouds from any part of her duty.

 2. The difficulty of meeting with such a one: <I>Who can find</I> her? 
 This intimates that good women are very scarce, and many that seem to 
 be so do not prove so; he that thought he had found a <I>virtuous 
 woman</I> was deceived; <I>Behold, it was Leah,</I> and not the Rachel 
 he expected. But he that designs to marry ought to seek diligently for 
 such a one, to have this principally in his eye, in all his enquiries, 
 and to take heed that he be not biassed by beauty or gaiety, wealth or 
 parentage, dressing well or dancing well; for all these may be and yet 
 the woman not be virtuous, and there is many a woman truly virtuous who 
 yet is not recommended by these advantages. 

 3. The unspeakable worth of such a one, and the value which he that
 has such a wife ought to put upon her, showing it by his thankfulness 
 to God and his kindness and respect to her, whom he must never think he 
 can do too much for. <I>Her price is far above rubies,</I> and all the 
 rich ornaments with which vain women adorn themselves. The more rare 
 such good wives are the more they are to be valued.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A particular description of her and of her excellent 
 qualifications.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She is very industrious to recommend herself to her husband's esteem 
 and affection. Those that are good really will be good relatively. A 
 good woman, if she be brought into the marriage state, will be a good 
 wife, and make it her business to <I>please her husband,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:34">1 Cor. vii. 34</A>.

 Though she is a woman of spirit herself, yet <I>her desire is to her
 husband,</I> to know his mind, that she may accommodate herself to it, 
 and she is willing that <I>he should rule over her.</I>

 (1.) She conducts herself so that he may repose an entire confidence in
 her. He trusts in her chastity, which she never gave him the least 
 occasion to suspect or to entertain any jealousy of; she is not morose 
 and reserved, but modest and grave, and has all the marks of virtue in 
 her countenance and behaviour; her husband knows it, and therefore his 
 <I>heart doth safely trust in her;</I> he is easy, and makes her so. He 
 trusts in her conduct, that she will speak in all companies, and act in 
 all affairs, with prudence and discretion, so as not to occasion him 
 either damage or reproach. He trusts in her fidelity to his interests, 
 and that she will never betray his counsels nor have any interest 
 separate from that of his family. When he goes abroad, to attend the 
 concerns of the public, he can confide in her to order all his affairs 
 at home, as well as if he himself were there. She is a good wife that 
 is fit to be trusted, and he is a good husband that will leave it to 
 such a wife to manage for him.

 (2.) She contributes so much to his content and satisfaction <I>that he
 shall have no need of spoil;</I> he needs not be griping and scraping 
 abroad, as those must be whose wives are proud and wasteful at home. 
 She manages his affairs so that he is always before-hand, has such 
 plenty of his own that he is in no temptation to prey upon his 
 neighbours. He thinks himself so happy in her that he envies not those 
 who have most of the wealth of this world; he needs it not, he has 
 enough, having such a wife. Happy the couple that have such a 
 satisfaction as this in each other!

 (3.) She makes it her constant business to <I>do him good,</I> and is
 afraid of doing any thing, even through inadvertency, that may turn to 
 his prejudice,

 She shows her love to him, not by a foolish fondness, but by prudent
 endearments, accommodating herself to his temper, and not crossing him, 
 giving him good words, and not bad ones, no, not when he is out of 
 humour, studying to make him easy, to provide what is fit for him both 
 in health and sickness, and attending him with diligence and tenderness 
 when any thing ails him; nor would she, no, not for the world, wilfully 
 do any thing that might be a damage to his person, family, estate, or 
 reputation. And this is her care <I>all the days of her life;</I> not 
 at first only, or now and then, when she is in a good humour, but 
 perpetually; and she is not weary of the good offices she does him: 
 <I>She does him good,</I> not only all the days of <I>his</I> life, but 
 <I>of her own</I> too; if she survive him, still she is doing him good 
 in her care of his children, his estate, and good name, and all the 
 concerns he left behind him. We read of kindness shown, not only <I>to 
 the living,</I> but <I>to the dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:20">Ruth ii. 20</A>.

 (4.) She adds to his reputation in the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 <I>Her husband is known in the gates,</I> known to have a good wife. By
 his wise counsels, and prudent management of affairs, it appears that 
 he has a discreet companion in his bosom, by conversation with whom he 
 improves himself. By his cheerful countenance and pleasant humour it
 appears that he has an agreeable wife at home; for many that have not 
 have their tempers strangely soured by it. Nay, by his appearing clean 
 and neat in his dress, every thing about him decent and handsome, yet 
 not gaudy, one may know he has a good wife at home, that takes care of 
 his clothes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She is one that takes pains in the duty of her place and takes 
 pleasure in it. This part of her character is much enlarged upon here. 
 
 (1.) She hates to sit still and do nothing: <I>She eats not the bread
 of idleness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Though she needs not work for her bread (she has an estate to live
 upon), yet she will not eat it in idleness, because she knows that we 
 were none of us sent into this world to be idle, that when we have 
 nothing to do the devil will soon find us something to do, and that it 
 is not fit that those who <I>will not labour</I> should <I>eat.</I> 
 Some eat and drink because they can find themselves nothing else to do, 
 and needless visits must be received with fashionable entertainments; 
 these are eating the bread of idleness, which she has no relish for, 
 for she neither gives nor receives idle visits nor idle talk.

 (2.) She is careful to fill up time, that none of that be lost. When
 day-light is done, she does not then think it time to lay by her work, 
 as those are forced to do whose business lies abroad in the fields

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:23">Ps. civ. 23</A>),

 but her business lying within-doors, and her work worth candle-light,
 with that she lengthens out the day; and <I>her candle goes not out by 
 night,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 It is a mercy to have candle-light to supply the want of day-light, and
 a duty, having that advantage, to improve it. We say of an elaborate 
 piece, It smells of the lamp.

 (3.) <I>She rises</I> early, <I>while it is yet night</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 to give her servants their breakfast, that they may be ready to go
 cheerfully about their work as soon as the day breaks. She is none of 
 those who sit up playing at cards, or dancing, till midnight, till 
 morning, and then lie in bed till noon. No; the <I>virtuous woman</I> 
 loves her business better than her ease or her pleasure, is in care to 
 be found in the way of her duty every hour of the day, and has more 
 true satisfaction in having <I>given meat to her household</I> betimes 
 in the morning than those can have in the money they have won, much 
 more in what they have lost, who sat up all night at play. Those that 
 have a family to take care of should not love their bed too well in a 
 morning.

 (4.) She applies herself to the business that is proper for her. It is
 not in a scholar's business, or statesman's business, or husbandman's 
 business, that she employs herself, but in women's business: <I>She 
 seeks wool and flax,</I> where she may have the best of each at the 
 best hand, and cheapest; she has a stock of both by her, and every 
 thing that is necessary to the carrying on both of the woollen and the 
 linen manufacture

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 and with this she does not only set the poor on work, which is a very
 good office, but does herself work, <I>and work willingly, with her 
 hands;</I> she <I>works with the counsel or delight of her hands</I> 
 (so the word is); she goes about it cheerfully and dexterously, lays 
 not only her hand, but her mind to it, and goes on in it without 
 weariness in well-doing. <I>She lays her</I> own <I>hands to the
 spindle,</I> or spinning-wheel, <I>and her hands hold the distaff</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and she does not reckon it either an abridgment of her liberty or a
 disparagement to her dignity, or at all inconsistent with her repose. 
 The spindle and the distaff are here mentioned as her honour, while the 
 ornaments of the daughters of Zion are reckoned up to their reproach,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:18">Isa. ii. 18</A>,
 
 &c.
 
 (5.) She does what she does with all her might, and does not trifle in 
 it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 <I>She girds her loins with strength and strengthens her arms;</I> she
 does not employ herself in sitting work only, or in that which is only 
 the nice performance of the fingers (there are works that are scarcely 
 one remove from doing nothing); but, if there be occasion, she will go 
 through with work that requires all the strength she has, which she 
 will use as one that knows it is the way to have more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. She is one that makes what she does to turn to a good account, by 
 her prudent management of it. She does not toil all night and catch 
 nothing; no, she herself <I>perceives that her merchandise is good</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);

 she is sensible that <I>in all</I> her <I>labour there is profit,</I>
 and that encourages her to go on in it. She perceives that she can make 
 things herself better and cheaper than she can buy them; she finds by 
 observation what branch of her employment brings in the best returns, 
 and to that she applies herself most closely.

 (1.) She brings in provisions of all things necessary and convenient
 for her family, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 No <I>merchants' ships,</I> no, not Solomon's navy, ever made a more
 advantageous return than her employments do. Do they bring in foreign 
 commodities with the effects they export? So does she with the fruit of 
 her labours. What her own ground does not produce she can furnish 
 herself with, if she have occasion for it, by exchanging her own goods 
 for it; and so <I>she brings her food from afar.</I> Not that she 
 values things the more for their being far-fetched, but, if they be 
 ever so far off, if she must have them she knows how to come by them.

 (2.) She purchases lands, and enlarges the demesne of the family
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>She considers a field, and buys it.</I> She considers what an
 advantage it will be to the family and what a good account it will turn 
 to, and therefore she buys it; or, rather, though she have ever so much 
 mind to it she will not buy it till she has first considered it, 
 whether it be worth her money, whether she can afford to take so much 
 money out of her stock as must go to purchase it, whether the title be 
 good, whether the ground will answer the character given of it, and 
 whether she has money at command to pay for it. Many have undone 
 themselves by buying without considering; but those who would make 
 advantageous purchases must consider, and then buy. <I>She</I> also 
 <I>plants a vineyard,</I> but it is <I>with the fruit of her hands;</I> 
 she does not take up money, or run into debt, to do it, but she does it 
 with what she can spare out of the gains of her own housewifery. Men 
 should not lay out any thing upon superfluities, till, by the blessing 
 of God upon their industry, they have got before-hand, and can afford 
 it; and <I>then</I> the fruit of the vineyard is likely to be doubly 
 sweet, when it is the fruit of honest industry.

 (3.) She furnishes her house well and has good clothing for herself and
 her family

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):
 
 <I>She makes herself coverings of tapestry</I> to hang her rooms, and
 she may be allowed to use them when they are of her own making. 
 <I>Her</I> own <I>clothing</I> is rich and fine: it is <I>silk and 
 purple,</I> according to her place and rank. Though she is not so vain 
 as to spend much time in dressing herself, nor makes the putting on of 
 apparel her adorning, nor values herself upon it, yet she has rich 
 clothes and puts them on well. The senator's robes which her husband 
 wears are of her own spinning, and they look better and wear better 
 than any that are bought. She also gets good warm clothing for her 
 children, and her servants' liveries. She needs not fear the cold of 
 the most pinching winter, for she and her family are well provided with 
 clothes, sufficient to keep out cold, which is the end chiefly to be 
 aimed at in clothing: <I>All her household are clothed in scarlet,</I> 
 strong cloth and fit for winter, and yet rich and making a good 
 appearance. They are <I>all double clothed</I> (so some read it), have 
 change of raiment, a winter suit and a summer suit. 

 (4.) She trades abroad. She makes more than she and her household have
 occasion for; and therefore, when she has sufficiently stocked her 
 family, <I>she sells fine linen and girdles to the merchants</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 who carry them to Tyre, the mart of the nations, or some other trading
 city. Those families are likely to thrive that sell more than they
 buy; as it is well with the kingdom when abundance of its home 
 manufactures are exported. It is no disgrace to those of the best 
 quality to sell what they can spare, nor to deal in trade and send 
 ventures by sea.

 (5.) She lays up for hereafter: <I>She shall rejoice in time to
 come,</I> having laid in a good stock for her family, and having good 
 portions for her children. Those that take pains when they are in their 
 prime will have the pleasure and joy of it when they are old, both in 
 reflecting upon it and in reaping the benefit of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. She takes care of her family and all the affairs of it, <I>gives 
 meat to her household</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 to every one <I>his portion of meat in due season,</I> so that none of
 her servants have reason to complain of being kept short or faring 
 hard. She gives also <I>a portion</I> (an allotment of work, as well as 
 meat) <I>to her maidens;</I> they shall all of them know their business 
 and have their task. <I>She looks well to the ways of her household</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>);

 she inspects the manners of all her servants, that she may check what
 is amiss among them, and oblige them all to behave properly and do 
 their duty to God and one another, as well as to her; as Job, who put 
 away iniquity far from his tabernacle, and David, who would suffer no 
 wicked thing in his house. She does not intermeddle in the concerns of
 other people's houses; she thinks it enough for her to look well to her 
 own.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. She is charitable <I>to the poor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 She is as intent upon giving as she is upon getting; she often serves
 the poor with her own hand, and she does if freely, cheerfully, and 
 very liberally, with an out-stretched hand. Nor does she relieve her 
 poor neighbours only, and those that are nigh at hand, but <I>she 
 reaches forth her hands to the needy</I> that are at a distance, 
 seeking opportunities <I>to do good and to communicate,</I> which is as 
 good housewifery as any thing she does.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. She is discreet and obliging in all her discourse, not talkative, 
 censorious, nor peevish, as some are, that know how to take pains; no, 
 <I>she opens her mouth with wisdom;</I> when she does speak, it is with 
 a great deal of prudence and very much to the purpose; you may perceive 
 by every word she says how much she governs herself by the rules of 
 wisdom. She not only takes prudent measures herself, but gives prudent 
 advice to others; and this not as assuming the authority of a dictator, 
 but with the affection of a friend and an obliging air: <I>In her 
 tongue is the law of kindness;</I> all she says is under the government 
 of that law. The law of love and kindness is written in the heart, but 
 it shows itself in the tongue; if we are <I>kindly affectioned one to 
 another,</I> it will appear by affectionate expression. It is called a 
 <I>law of kindness,</I> because it gives law to others, to all she 
 converses with. Her wisdom and kindness together put a commanding power 
 into all she says; they command respect, they command compliance. How 
 forcible are right words! <I>In her tongue is the law of grace,</I> or 
 <I>mercy</I> (so some read it), understanding it of the word and law of 
 God, which she delights to talk of among her children and servants. She 
 is full of pious religious discourse, and manages it prudently, which 
 shows how full her heart is of another world even when her hands are 
 most busy about this world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. That which completes and crowns her character is that she <I>fears 
 the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 With all those good qualities she lacks not that <I>one thing
 needful;</I> she is truly pious, and, in all she does, is guided and 
 governed by principles of conscience and a regard to God; this is that 
 which is here preferred far before <I>beauty;</I> that <I>is vain and 
 deceitful;</I> all that are wise and good account it so, and value 
 neither themselves nor others on it. Beauty recommends none to God, nor 
 is it any certain indication of wisdom and goodness, but it has 
 deceived many a man who has made his choice of a wife by it. There may 
 be an impure deformed soul lodged in a comely and beautiful body; nay, 
 many have been exposed by their beauty to such temptations as have been 
 the ruin of their virtue, their honour, and their precious souls. It
 is a fading thing at the best, and therefore <I>vain</I> and 
 <I>deceitful.</I> A fit of sickness will stain and sully it in a little 
 time; a thousand accidents may blast this flower in its prime; old age 
 will certainly wither it and death and the grave consume it. But the 
 fear of God reigning in the heart is the beauty of the soul; it 
 recommends those that have it to the favour of God, and is, in his 
 sight, of great price; it will last for ever, and bid defiance to death 
 itself, which consumes the beauty of the body, but consummates the 
 beauty of the soul.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The happiness of this virtuous woman.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She has the comfort and satisfaction of her virtue in her own mind 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>Strength and honour are her clothing,</I> in which she wraps
 herself, that is, enjoys herself, and in which she appears to the 
 world, and so recommends herself. She enjoys a firmness and constancy 
 of mind, has spirit to bear up under the many crosses and 
 disappointments which even the wise and virtuous must expect to meet 
 with in this world; and this is her clothing, for defence as well as 
 decency. She deals honourably with all, and she has the pleasure of 
 doing so, <I>and shall rejoice in time to come;</I> she shall reflect 
 upon it with comfort, when she comes to be old, that she was not idle 
 or useless when she was young. In the day of death it will be a 
 pleasure to her to think that she has lived to some good purpose. Nay, 
 <I>she shall rejoice in an eternity to come;</I> she shall be 
 recompensed for her goodness with <I>fulness of joy and pleasures for 
 evermore.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She is a great blessing to her relations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 (1.) <I>Her children</I> grow up in her place, <I>and</I> they <I>call
 her blessed.</I> They give her their good word, they are themselves a 
 commendation to her, and they are ready to give great commendations of 
 her; they pray for her, and bless God that they had such a good mother.
 It is a debt which they owe her, a part of that honour which the fifth 
 commandment requires to be paid to father and mother; and it is a 
 double honour that is due to a good father and a good mother.

 (2.) <I>Her husband</I> thinks himself so happy in her that he takes
 all occasions to speak well of her, as one of the best of women. It is 
 no indecency at all, but a laudable instance of conjugal love, for 
 husbands and wives to give one another their due praises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. She gets the good word of all her neighbours, as Ruth did, whom
 <I>all the city of her people knew</I> to be <I>a virtuous woman,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+3:11">Ruth iii. 11</A>.

 Virtue will have its praise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:8">Phil. iv. 8</A>.

 A woman that fears the Lord, shall have praise <I>of God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:29">Rom. ii. 29</A>)

 and of men too. It is here shown,

 (1.) That she shall be highly praised
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):
 
 <I>Many have done virtuously.</I> Virtuous women, it seems, are
 precious jewels, but not such rare jewels as was represented 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 There have been many, but such a one as this cannot be paralleled.
 <I>Who can find</I> her equal? <I>She excels them all.</I> Note, Those 
 that are good should aim and covet to excel in virtue. <I>Many 
 daughters,</I> in their father's house, and in the single state, 
 <I>have done virtuously, but</I> a good wife, if she be virtuous, 
 <I>excels them all,</I> and does more good in her place than they can 
 do in theirs. Or, as some explain it, A man cannot have his house so 
 well kept by good daughters, as by a good wife. 

 (2.) That she shall be incontestably praised, without contradiction, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>.

 Some are praised above what is their due, but those that praise her do
 but <I>give her of the fruit of her hands;</I> they give her that which 
 she has dearly earned and which is justly due to her; she is wronged if 
 she have it not. Note, Those ought to be praised the fruit of whose 
 hands is praise-worthy. The tree is known by its fruits, and therefore, 
 if the fruit be good, the tree must have our good word. If her children 
 be dutiful and respectful to her, and conduct themselves as they ought, 
 they then <I>give her the fruit of her hands;</I> she reaps the benefit 
 of all the care she has taken of them, and thinks herself well paid.
 Children must thus study to <I>requite their parents,</I> and this is 
 <I>showing piety at home,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:4">1 Tim. v. 4</A>.

 But, if men be unjust, the thing will speak itself, <I>her own
 works</I> will <I>praise her in the gates,</I> openly before all the 
 people.

 [1.] She leaves it to her own works to praise her, and does not court
 the applause of men. Those are none of the truly virtuous women that 
 love to hear themselves commended. 

 [2.] <I>Her own works</I> will <I>praise her;</I> if her relations and
 neighbours altogether hold their peace, her good works will proclaim 
 her praise. The widows gave the best encomium of Dorcas when they 
 <I>showed the coats and garments she had made for the poor,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:39">Acts ix. 39</A>.

 [3.] The least that can be expected from her neighbours is that they
 should <I>let her own works praise her,</I> and do nothing to hinder 
 them. Those that <I>do that which is good,</I> let them <I>have praise 
 of the same</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:3">
 Rom. xiii. 3</A>)

 and let us not enviously say, or do, any thing to the diminishing of
 it, but be provoked by it to a holy emulation. Let none have an ill 
 report from us, that have <I>a good report</I> even <I>of the truth 
 itself.</I> Thus is shut up this looking-glass for ladies, which they 
 are desired to open and dress themselves by; and, if they do so, their 
 adorning will be found to praise, and honour, and glory, at the 
 appearing of Jesus Christ.</P>

 Twenty chapters of the book of <I>Proverbs</I> (beginning with 
 <I>ch.</I> x. and ending with <I>ch.</I> xxix.), consisting mostly of
 entire sentences in each verse, could not well be reduced to proper 
 heads, and the contents of them gathered; I have therefore here put the 
 contents of all these chapters together, which perhaps may be of some 
 use to those who desire to see at once all that is said of any one head 
 in these chapters. Some of the verses, perhaps, I have not put under 
 the same heads that another would have put them under, but the most of 
 them fall (I hope) naturally enough to the places I have assigned them.
