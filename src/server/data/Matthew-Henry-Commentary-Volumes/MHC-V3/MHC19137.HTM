 <HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=50>
 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There are divers psalms which are thought to have been penned in the
 latter days of the Jewish church, when prophecy was near expiring and
 the canon of the Old Testament ready to be closed up, but none of them
 appears so plainly to be of a late date as this, which was penned when
 the people of God were captives in Babylon, and there insulted over by
 these proud oppressors; probably it was towards the latter end of their
 captivity; for now they saw the destruction of Babylon hastening on
 apace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:8">ver. 8</A>),

 which would be their discharge. It is a mournful psalm, a lamentation;
 and the Septuagint makes it one of the lamentations of Jeremiah, naming 
 him for the author of it. Here

 I. The melancholy captives cannot enjoy themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. They cannot humour their proud oppressors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III. They cannot forget Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 IV. They cannot forgive Edom and Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 In singing this psalm we must be much affected with the concernments of 
 the church, especially that part of it that is in affliction, laying 
 the sorrows of God's people near our hearts, comforting ourselves in 
 the prospect of the deliverance of the church and the ruin of its 
 enemies, in due time, but carefully avoiding all personal animosities, 
 and not mixing the leaven of malice with our sacrifices.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept,
 when we remembered Zion.
 &nbsp; 2  We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.
 &nbsp; 3  For there they that carried us away captive required of us a
 song; and they that wasted us <I>required of us</I> mirth, <I>saying,</I>
 Sing us <I>one</I> of the songs of Zion.
 &nbsp; 4  How shall we sing the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s song in a strange land?
 &nbsp; 5  If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget <I>her
 cunning.</I>
 &nbsp; 6  If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof
 of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the daughter of Zion covered with a cloud, and dwelling 
 with the daughter of Babylon; the people of God in tears, but sowing in 
 tears. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The mournful posture they were in as to their affairs and as to 
 their spirits. 

 1. They were posted <I>by the rivers of Babylon,</I> in a strange land,
 a great way from their own country, whence they were brought as 
 prisoners of war. The land of Babylon was now a house of bondage to 
 that people, as Egypt had been in their beginning. Their conquerors 
 quartered them <I>by the rivers,</I> with design to employ them there, 
 and keep them to work in their galleys; or perhaps they chose it as the 
 most melancholy place, and therefore most suitable to their sorrowful 
 spirits. If they must build houses there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:5">Jer. xxix. 5</A>),
 
 it shall not be in the cities, the places of concourse, but by the 
 rivers, the places of solitude, where they might mingle their tears 
 with the streams. We find some of them by the <I>river Chebar</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:3">Ezek. i. 3</A>),

 others by the <I>river Ulai,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+8:2">Dan. viii. 2</A>.

 2. There they <I>sat down</I> to indulge their grief by poring on their 
 miseries. Jeremiah had taught them under this yoke to <I>sit alone,</I> 
 and <I>keep silence,</I> and <I>put their mouths in the dust,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:28,29">Lam. iii. 28, 29</A>.

 "We sat down, as those that expected to stay, and were content, since 
 it was the will of God that it must be so." 

 3. Thoughts of Zion drew tears from their eyes; and it was not a sudden
 passion of weeping, such as we are sometimes put into by a trouble that 
 surprises us, but they were deliberate tears (we <I>sat down and 
 wept</I>), tears with consideration--we <I>wept when we remembered 
 Zion,</I> the holy hill on which the temple was built. Their affection 
 to God's house swallowed up their concern for their own houses. They 
 remembered Zion's former glory and the satisfaction they had had in 
 Zion's courts,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:7">Lam. i. 7</A>.

 <I>Jerusalem remembered, in the days of her misery, all her pleasant 
 things which she had in the days of old,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:4">Ps. xlii. 4</A>.

 They remembered Zion's present desolations, and <I>favoured the dust 
 thereof,</I> which was a good sign that the time for God to favour it 
 was not far off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:13,14">Ps. cii. 13, 14</A>.

 4. They laid by their instruments of music 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>We hung our harps upon the willows.</I> 

 (1.) The harps they used for their own diversion and entertainment.
 These they laid aside, both because it was their judgment that they 
 ought not to use them now that God called to weeping and mourning

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:12">Isa. xxii. 12</A>),

 and their spirits were so sad that they had no hearts to use them; they 
 brought their harps with them, designing perhaps to use them for the 
 alleviating of their grief, but it proved so great that it would not 
 admit the experiment. Music makes some people melancholy. <I>As
 vinegar upon nitre, so is he that sings songs to a heavy heart.</I> 
 
 (2.) The harps they used in God's worship, the Levites' harps. These
 they did not throw away, hoping they might yet again have occasion to 
 use them, but they laid them aside because they had no present use for 
 them; God had cut them out other work by <I>turning their feasting into 
 mourning and their songs into lamentations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+8:10">Amos viii. 10</A>.

 Every thing is beautiful in its season. They did not hide their harps
 in the bushes, or the hollows of the rocks; but hung them up in view, 
 that the sight of them might affect them with this deplorable change. 
 Yet perhaps they were faulty in doing this; for praising God is never 
 out of season; it is his will that we should <I>in every thing give 
 thanks,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:15,16">Isa. xxiv. 15, 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The abuses which their enemies put upon them when they were in this 
 melancholy condition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They had <I>carried them away captive</I> from their own land and then 
 <I>wasted them</I> in the land of their captivity, took what little 
 they had from them. But this was not enough; to complete their woes 
 they insulted over them: They <I>required of us mirth and a song.</I> 
 Now, 

 1. This was very barbarous and inhuman; even an enemy, in misery, is to
 be pitied and not trampled upon. It argues a base and sordid spirit to 
 upbraid those that are in distress either with their former joys or 
 with their present griefs, or to challenge those to be merry who, we 
 know, are out of tune for it. This is adding affliction to the
 afflicted. 

 2. It was very profane and impious. No songs would serve them but the
 <I>songs of Zion,</I> with which God had been honoured; so that in this 
 demand they reflected upon God himself as Belshazzar, when he drank 
 wine in temple-bowls. Their enemies <I>mocked at their sabbaths,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:7">Lam. i. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The patience wherewith they bore these abuses, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 They had laid by their harps, and would not resume them, no, not to 
 ingratiate themselves with those at whose mercy they lay; they would 
 not answer those fools according to their folly. Profane scoffers are 
 not to be humoured, nor pearls cast before swine. David prudently 
 <I>kept silence even from good</I> when the <I>wicked were before 
 him,</I> who, he knew, would ridicule what he said and make a jest of 
 it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:1,2">Ps. xxxix. 1, 2</A>.
 
 The reason they gave is very mild and pious: <I>How shall we sing the
 Lord's song in a strange land?</I> They do not say, "How shall we sing 
 when we are so much in sorrow?" If that had been all, they might 
 perhaps have put a force upon themselves so far as to oblige their 
 masters with a song; but "It is the <I>Lord's song;</I> it is a sacred 
 thing; it is peculiar to the temple-service, and therefore we dare not 
 sing it in the land of a stranger, among idolaters." We must not serve 
 common mirth, much less profane mirth, with any thing that is 
 appropriated to God, who is sometimes to be honoured by a religious 
 silence as well as by religious speaking.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The constant affection they retained for Jerusalem, the city of 
 their solemnities, even now that they were in Babylon. Though their 
 enemies banter them for talking so much of Jerusalem, and even doting 
 upon it, their love to it is not in the least abated; it is what they 
 may be jeered for, but will never be jeered out of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How these pious captives stood affected to Jerusalem. 

 (1.) Their heads were full of it. It was always in their minds; they
 remembered it; they did not forget it, though they had been long absent 
 from it; many of them had never seen it, nor knew any thing of it but 
 by report, and by what they had read in the scripture, yet it was 
 graven upon the palms of their hands, and even its ruins were 
 continually before them, which was an evidence of their faith in the
 promise of its restoration in due time. In their daily prayers they
 opened their windows towards Jerusalem; and how then could they forget 
 it? 

 (2.) Their hearts were full of it. They <I>preferred</I> it
 <I>above</I> their <I>chief joy,</I> and therefore they remembered it 
 and could not forget it. What we love we love to think of. Those that 
 rejoice in God do, for his sake, make Jerusalem their joy, and prefer 
 it before that, whatever it is, which is the head of their joy, which 
 is dearest to them in this world. A godly man will prefer a public good 
 before any private satisfaction or gratification whatsoever.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How stedfastly they resolved to keep up this affection, which they 
 express by a solemn imprecation of mischief to themselves if they 
 should let it fall: "Let me be for ever disabled either to sing or play 
 on the harp if I so far forget the religion of my country as to make 
 use of my songs and harps for the pleasing of Babylon's sons or the 
 praising of Babylon's gods. <I>Let my right hand forget her art</I>" 
 (which the hand of an expert musician never can, unless it be 
 withered), "nay, <I>let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,</I> 
 if I have not a good word to say for Jerusalem wherever I am." Though 
 they dare not sing Zion's songs among the Babylonians, yet they cannot 
 forget them, but, as soon as ever the present restraint is taken off, 
 they will sing them as readily as ever, notwithstanding the long 
 disuse.</P>

 </TABLE>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Remember, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the children of Edom in the day of
 Jerusalem; who said, Rase <I>it,</I> rase <I>it, even</I> to the foundation
 thereof.
 &nbsp; 8  O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy <I>shall
 he be,</I> that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
 &nbsp; 9  Happy <I>shall he be,</I> that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
 against the stones.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The pious Jews in Babylon, having afflicted themselves with the 
 thoughts of the ruins of Jerusalem, here please themselves with the 
 prospect of the ruin of her impenitent implacable enemies; but this not 
 from a spirit of revenge, but from a holy zeal for the glory of God and 
 the honour of his kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The Edomites will certainly be reckoned with, and all others that 
 were accessaries to the destruction of Jerusalem, that were aiding and 
 abetting, that <I>helped forward the affliction</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:15">Zech. i. 15</A>)

 and triumphed in it, that <I>said, in the day of Jerusalem,</I> the day 
 of her judgment, "<I>Rase it, rase it to the foundations;</I> down with 
 it, down with it; do not leave one stone upon another." Thus they made 
 the Chaldean army more furious, who were already so enraged that they 
 needed no spur. Thus they put shame upon Israel, who would be looked
 upon as a people worthy to be cut off when their next neighbours had 
 such an ill-will to them. And all this was a fruit of the old enmity of 
 Esau against Jacob, because he got the birthright and the blessing, and 
 a branch of that more ancient enmity between the seed of the woman and 
 the seed of the serpent: <I>Lord, remember</I> them, says the psalmist, 
 which is an appeal to his justice against them. Far be it from us to 
 avenge ourselves, if ever it should be in our power, but we will leave 
 it to him who has said, <I>Vengeance is mine.</I> Note, Those that are 
 glad at calamities, especially the calamities of Jerusalem, shall not 
 go unpunished. Those that are confederate with the persecutors of good 
 people, and stir them up, and set them on, and are pleased with what 
 they do, shall certainly be called to an account for it against another 
 day, and God will remember it against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Babylon is the principal, and it will come to her turn too to drink 
 of the cup of tremblings, the very dregs of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>):

 <I>O daughter of Babylon!</I> proud and secure as thou art, we know 
 well, by the scriptures of truth, thou <I>art to be destroyed,</I> or 
 (as Dr. Hammond reads it) <I>who art the destroyer.</I> The destroyers
 shall be destroyed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:10">Rev. xiii. 10</A>.

 And perhaps it is with reference to this that the man of sin, the head 
 of the New-Testament Babylon, is called a <I>son of perdition,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:3">2 Thess. ii. 3</A>.

 The destruction of Babylon being foreseen as a sure destruction (thou
 <I>art to be destroyed</I>), it is spoken of, 

 1. As a just destruction. She shall be paid in her own coin: "Thou
 shalt be served <I>as thou hast served us,</I> as barbarously used by 
 the destroyers as we have been by thee," See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:6">Rev. xviii. 6</A>.

 Let not those expect to find mercy who, when they had power, did not 
 show mercy. 

 2. As an utter destruction. The very little ones of Babylon, when it
 is taken by storm, and all in it are put to the sword, shall be dashed 
 to pieces by the enraged and merciless conqueror. None escape if these 
 little ones perish. Those are the seed of another generation; so that, 
 if they be cut off, the ruin will be not only total, as Jerusalem's 
 was, but final. It is sunk like a millstone into the sea, never to 
 rise. 

 3. As a destruction which should reflect honour upon the instruments of
 it. Happy shall those be that do it; for they are fulfilling God's 
 counsels; and therefore he calls Cyrus, who did it, his <I>servant,</I> 
 his <I>shepherd,</I> his <I>anointed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:28,45:1">Isa. xliv. 28; xlv. 1</A>),

 and the soldiers that were employed in it his <I>sanctified ones,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+13:3">Isa. xiii. 3</A>.

 They are making way for the enlargement of God's Israel, and happy are 
 those who are in any way serviceable to that. The fall of the 
 New-Testament Babylon will be the triumph of all the saints, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:1">Rev. xix. 1</A>.</P>
