 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, in this psalm, appeals to the righteous Judge of heaven and 
 earth against his enemies that hated and persecuted him. It is supposed 
 that Saul and his party are the persons he means, for with them he had 
 the greatest struggles. 

 I. He complains to God of the injuries they did him; they strove with
 him, fought against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:1">ver. 1</A>),
 
 persecuted him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:3">ver. 3</A>),
 
 sought his ruin
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:4,7">ver. 4, 7</A>),

 accused him falsely 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:11">ver. 11</A>),
 
 abused him basely 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>),

 and all his friends 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:20">ver. 20</A>),
 
 and triumphed over him,, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:21,25,26">ver. 21, 25, 26</A>.
 
 II. He pleads his own innocency, that he never gave them any
 provocation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:7,19">ver. 7, 19</A>),

 but, on the contrary, had studied to oblige them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.

 III. He prays to God to protect and deliver him, and appear for him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),
 
 to comfort him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:3">ver. 3</A>),
 
 to be nigh to him and rescue him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:17,22">ver. 17, 22</A>),

 to plead his cause 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:23,24">ver. 23, 24</A>),

 to defeat all the designs of his enemies against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>),

 to disappoint their expectations of his fall 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:19,25,26">ver. 19, 25, 26</A>),

 and, lastly, to countenance all his friends, and encourage them (ver. 27</A>.
 
 IV. He prophesies the destruction of his persecutors,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:4-6,8">ver. 4-6, 8</A>.
 
 V. He promises himself that he shall yet see better days 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>),

 and promises God that he will then attend him with his praises, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:18,28">ver. 18, 28</A>.

 In singing this psalm, and praying over it, we must take heed of 
 applying it to any little peevish quarrels and enmities of our own, and 
 of expressing by it any uncharitable revengeful resentments of injuries 
 done to us; for Christ has taught us to forgive our enemies and not to 
 pray against them, but to pray for them, as he did; but,

 1. We may comfort ourselves with the testimony of our consciences
 concerning our innocency, with reference to those that are any way 
 injurious to us, and with hopes that God will, in his own way and time, 
 right us, and, in the mean time, support us. 

 2. We ought to apply it to the public enemies of Christ and his 
 kingdom, typified by David and his kingdom, to resent the indignities 
 done to Christ's honour, to pray to God to plead the just and injured 
 cause of Christianity and serious godliness, and to believe that God 
 will, in due time, glorify his own name in the ruin of all the 
 irreconcilable enemies of his church, that will not repent to give him 
 glory.</P>

 <P>A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Plead <I>my cause,</I> O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, with them
 that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.
 &nbsp; 2  Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.
 &nbsp; 3  Draw out also the spear, and stop <I>the way</I> against them that
 persecute me: say unto my soul, I <I>am</I> thy salvation.
 &nbsp; 4  Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my
 soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that
 devise my hurt.
 &nbsp; 5  Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> chase <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 6  Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> persecute them.
 &nbsp; 7  For without cause have they hid for me their net <I>in</I> a pit,
 <I>which</I> without cause they have digged for my soul.
 &nbsp; 8  Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net
 that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let
 him fall.
 &nbsp; 9  And my soul shall be joyful in the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: it shall rejoice in
 his salvation.
 &nbsp; 10  All my bones shall say, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, who <I>is</I> like unto thee, which
 deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the
 poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David's representation of his case to God, setting forth the 
 restless rage and malice of his persecutors. He was God's servant, 
 expressly appointed by him to be what he was, followed his guidance, 
 and aimed at his glory in the way of duty, had lived (as St. Paul 
 speaks) <I>in all good conscience before God unto this day;</I> and yet 
 there were those that strove with him, that did their utmost to oppose 
 his advancement, and made all the interest they could against him; they 
 fought against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 not only undermined him closely and secretly, but openly avowed their
 opposition to him and set themselves to do him all the mischief they 
 could. They persecuted him with an unwearied enmity, <I>sought after 
 his soul</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 that is, his life, no less would satisfy their bloody minds; they aimed 
 to disquiet his spirit and put that into disorder. Nor was it a sudden 
 passion against him that they harboured, but inveterate malice: They 
 <I>devised his hurt,</I> laid their heads together, and set their wits 
 on work, not only to do him a mischief, but to find out ways and means 
 to ruin him. They treated him, who was the greatest blessing of his 
 country, as if he had been the curse and plague of it; they hunted him 
 as a dangerous beast of prey; they digged a pit for him and laid a net 
 in it, that they might have him at their mercy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 They took a great deal of pains in persecuting him, for they digged a
 pit

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:15">Ps. vii. 15</A>);

 and very close and crafty they were in carrying on their designs; the
 old serpent taught them subtlety: they hid their net from David and his 
 friends; but in vain, for they could not hide it from God. And, 
 <I>lastly,</I> he found himself an unequal match for them. His enemy, 
 especially Saul, was <I>too strong for him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 for he had the army at his command, and assumed to himself the sole 
 power of making laws and giving judgment, attainted and condemned whom 
 he pleased, carried not a sceptre, but a javelin, in his hand, to cast 
 at any man that stood in his way; such was the manner of the king, and 
 all about him were compelled to do as he bade them, right or wrong. The 
 king's word is a law, and every thing must be carried with a high hand; 
 he has fields, and vineyards, and preferments, at his disposal,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:7">1 Sam. xxii. 7</A>.

 But David is poor and needy, has nothing to make friends with, and
 therefore has none to take his part but men (as we say) of broken 
 fortunes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:2">1 Sam. xxii. 2</A>);

 and therefore no marvel that Saul spoiled him of what little he had got
 and the interest he had made. If the kings of the earth set themselves 
 against the Lord and his anointed, who can contend with them? Note, It 
 is no new thing for the most righteous men, and the most righteous 
 cause, to meet with many mighty and malicious enemies: Christ himself 
 is striven with and fought against, and war is made upon the holy seed; 
 and we are not to marvel at the matter: it is a fruit of the old enmity 
 in the seed of the serpent against the seed of the woman.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His appeal to God concerning his integrity and the justice of his 
 cause. If a fellow-subject had wronged him, he might have appealed to 
 his prince, as St. Paul did to C&aelig;sar; but, when his prince
 wronged him, he appealed to his God, who is prince and Judge of the 
 kings of the earth: <I>Plead my cause, O Lord!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Note, A righteous cause may, with the greatest satisfaction imaginable,
 he laid before a righteous God, and referred to him to give judgment 
 upon it; for he perfectly knows the merits of it, holds the balance 
 exactly even, and with him there is no respect of persons. God knew 
 that they were, without cause, his enemies, and that they had, without 
 cause, digged pits for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Note, It will be a comfort to us, when men do us wrong, if our
 consciences can witness for us that we have never done them any. It was
 so to St. Paul. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:10">Acts xxv. 10</A>,

 <I>To the Jews have I done no wrong.</I> We are apt to justify our
 uneasiness at the injuries men do us by this, That we never gave them 
 any cause to use us so; whereas this should, more than any thing, make 
 us easy, for then we may the more confidently expect that God will 
 plead our cause.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His prayer to God to manifest himself both for him and to him, in 
 this trial. 

 1. For him. He prays that God would <I>fight against</I> his enemies,
 so as to disable them to hurt him, and defeat their designs against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 that he would <I>take hold of shield and buckler,</I> for the Lord is a 
 man of war

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:3">Exod. xv. 3</A>),

 <I>and</I> that he would <I>stand up for his help</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 for he had few that would stand up for him, and, if he had ever so
 many, they would stand him in no stead without God. He prays that God
 would <I>stop their way</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 that they might not overtake him when he fled from them. This prayer we
 may put up against our persecutors, that God would restrain them and
 stop their way. 

 2. To him: "<I>Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation;</I> let me have
 inward comfort under all these outward troubles, to support my soul 
 which they strike at. Let God be my salvation, not only my Saviour out 
 of my present troubles, but my everlasting bliss. Let me have that 
 salvation not only which he is the author of, but which consists in his 
 favour; and let me know my interest in it; let me have the comfortable 
 assurance of it in my own breast." If God, by his Spirit, witness to 
 our spirits that he is our salvation, we have enough, we need desire no 
 more to make us happy; and this is a powerful support when men 
 persecute us. If God be our friend, no matter who is our enemy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His prospect of the destruction of his enemies, which he prays for, 
 not in malice or revenge. We find how patiently he bore Shimei's curses 
 (<I>so let him curse, for the Lord has bidden him</I>); and we cannot 
 suppose that he who was so meek in his conversation would give vent to 
 any intemperate heat or passion in his devotion; but, by the spirit of 
 prophecy, he foretels the just judgments of God that would come upon 
 them for their great wickedness, their malice, cruelty, and 
 perfidiousness, and especially the enmity to the counsels of God, the 
 interests of religion, and that reformation which they knew David, if 
 ever he had power in his hand, would be an instrument of. They seemed 
 to be hardened in their sins, and to be of the number of those who have 
 sinned unto death and are not to be prayed for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:16,11:14,14:11,1Jo+5:16">Jer. vii. 16; xi. 14; xiv. 11; 
 1 John v. 16</A>.

 As for Saul himself, David, it is probable, knew that God had rejected
 him and had forbidden Samuel to mourn for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+16:1">1 Sam. xvi. 1</A>.

 And these predictions look further, and read the doom of the enemies of
 Christ and his kingdom, as appears by comparing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:9,10">Rom. xi. 9, 10</A>.

 David here prays,

 1. Against his many enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:4-6"><I>v.</I> 4-6</A>):

 <I>Let them be confounded, &c.</I> Or, as Dr. Hammond reads it, <I>They 
 shall be confounded, they shall be turned back.</I> This may be taken 
 as a prayer for their repentance, for all penitents are put to shame 
 for their sins and turned back from them. Or, if they were not brought 
 to repentance, David prays that they might be defeated and disappointed 
 in their designs against him and so put to shame. Though they should in 
 some degree prevail, yet he foresees that it would be to their own ruin 
 at last: <I>They shall be as chaff before the wind,</I> so unable will 
 wicked men be to stand before the judgments of God and so certainly 
 will they be driven away by them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:4">Ps. i. 4</A>.

 Their way shall be <I>dark and slippery, darkness and slipperiness</I>
 (so the margin reads it); the way of sinners is so, for they walk in 
 darkness and in continual danger of falling into sin, into hell; and it 
 will prove so at last, for <I>their foot shall slide in due time,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:35">Deut. xxxii. 35</A>.

 But this is not the worst of it. Even chaff before the wind may perhaps
 be stopped, and find a place of rest, and, though the way be dark and 
 slippery, it is possible that a man may keep his footing; but it is 
 here foretold that the <I>angel of the Lord shall chase them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)
 
 so that they shall find no rest, <I>shall persecute them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 so that they cannot possibly escape the pit of destruction. As God's 
 angels encamp against those that fight against him. They are the 
 ministers of his justice, as well as of his mercy. Those that make God 
 their enemy make all the holy angels their enemies.

 2. Against his one mighty enemy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Let destruction come upon him.</I> It is probable that he means 
 Saul, who laid snares for him and aimed at his destruction. David vowed 
 that his hand should not be upon him; he would not be judge in his own 
 cause. But, at the same time, he foretold that <I>the Lord would smite 
 him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+26:10">1 Sam. xxvi. 10</A>),

 and here that the net he had hidden should catch himself, and into
 <I>that very destruction he should fall.</I> This was remarkably 
 fulfilled in the ruin of Saul; for he had laid a plot to make David 
 <I>fall by the hand of the Philistines</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:25">1 Sam. xviii. 25</A>),
 
 that was the net which he hid for him under pretence of doing him
 honour, and in that very net was he himself taken, for he fell by the 
 hand of the Philistines when his day came to fall.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. His prospect of his own deliverance, which, having committed his 
 cause to God, he did not doubt of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 1. He hoped that he should have the comfort of it: "<I>My soul shall be
 joyful,</I> not in my own ease and safety, but <I>in the Lord</I> and 
 in his favour, in his promise and <I>in his salvation</I> according to 
 the promise." Joy in God and in his salvation is the only true, solid, 
 satisfying joy. Those whose souls are sorrowful in the Lord, who sow in 
 tears and sorrow after a godly sort, need not question but that in due 
 time their souls shall be joyful in the Lord; for gladness is sown for 
 them, and they shall at last <I>enter into the joy of their Lord.</I> 

 2. He promised that then God should have the glory of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 <I>All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee?</I>

 (1.) He will praise God with the whole man, with all that is within 
 him, and with all the strength and vigour of his soul, intimated by his 
 bones, which are within the body and are the strength of it. 

 (2.) He will praise him as one of peerless and unparalleled perfection. 
 We cannot express how great and good God is, and therefore must praise 
 him by acknowledging him to be a non-such. <I>Lord, who is like unto 
 thee?</I> No such patron of oppressed innocency, no such punisher of 
 triumphant tyranny. The formation of our bones so wonderfully, so
 curiously

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:5,Ps+139:16">Eccl. xi. 5; Ps. cxxxix. 16</A>),

 the serviceableness of our bones, and the preservation of them, and
 especially the life which, at the resurrection, shall be breathed upon 
 the dry bones and make them flourish as a herb, oblige every bone in 
 our bodies, if it could speak, to say, <I>Lord, who is like unto 
 thee?</I> and willingly to undergo any services or sufferings for 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two very wicked things David here lays to the charge of his enemies, to 
 make good his appeal to God against them--perjury and ingratitude.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Perjury, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 When Saul would have David attainted of treason, in order to his being
 outlawed, perhaps he did it with the formalities of a legal 
 prosecution, produced witnesses who swore some treasonable words or 
 overt acts against him, and he being not present to clear himself (or, 
 if he was, it was all the same), Saul adjudged him a traitor. This he 
 complains of here as the highest piece of injustice imaginable: 
 <I>False witnesses did rise up,</I> who would swear anything; <I>they 
 laid to my charge things that I knew not,</I> nor ever thought of. See 
 how much the honours, estates, liberties, and lives, even of the best 
 men, lie at the mercy of the worst, against whose false oaths innocency 
 itself is no fence; and what reason we have to acknowledge with 
 thankfulness the hold God has of the consciences even of bad men, to 
 which it is owing that there is not more mischief done in that way than 
 is. This instance of the wrong done to David was typical, and had its 
 accomplishment in the Son of David, against whom false witnesses did 
 arise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:60">Matt. xxvi. 60</A>.

 If we be at any time charged with what we are innocent of let us not
 think it strange, as though some new thing happened to us; so 
 persecuted they the prophets, even the great prophet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Ingratitude. Call a man ungrateful and you can call him no worse. 
 This was the character of David's enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>They rewarded me evil for good.</I> A great deal of good service he 
 had done to his king, witness his harp, witness Goliath's sword, 
 witness the foreskins of the Philistines; and yet his king vowed his 
 death, and his country was made too hot for him. This is <I>to the 
 spoiling of his soul;</I> this base unkind usage robs him of his 
 comfort, and cuts him to the heart, more than anything else. Nay, he 
 had deserved well not only of the public in general, but of those 
 particular persons that were now most bitter against him. Probably it 
 was then well known whom he meant; it may be Saul himself for one, whom 
 he was sent for to attend upon when he was melancholy and ill, and to 
 whom he was serviceable to drive away the evil spirit, not with his 
 harp, but with his prayers; to others of the courtiers, it is likely, 
 he had shown this respect, while he lived at court, who now were, of 
 all others, most abusive to him. Herein he was a type of Christ, to
 whom this wicked world was very ungrateful.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:32">John x. 32</A>.

 <I>Many good works have I shown you from my Father; for which of those
 do you stone me?</I> David here shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How tenderly, and with what a cordial affection, he had behaved 
 towards them in their afflictions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>):

 <I>They were sick.</I> Note, Even the palaces and courts of princes are 
 not exempt from the jurisdiction of death and the visitation of 
 sickness. Now when these people were sick,

 (1.) David mourned for them and sympathized with them in their grief. 
 They were not related to him; he was under no obligations to them; he 
 would lose nothing by their death, but perhaps be a gainer by it; and 
 yet he behaved himself as though they had been his nearest relations, 
 purely from a principle of compassion and humanity. David was a man of 
 war, and of a bold stout spirit, and yet was thus susceptible of the 
 impressions of sympathy, forgot the bravery of the hero, and seemed 
 wholly made up of love and pity; it was a rare composition of hardiness 
 and tenderness, courage and compassion, in the same breast. Observe, He 
 mourned as for a brother or mother, which intimates that it is our 
 duty, and well becomes us, to lay to heart the sickness, and sorrow, 
 and death of our near relations. Those that do not are justly 
 stigmatized as without natural affection. 

 (2.) He prayed for them. He discovered not only the tender affection of 
 a man, but the pious affection of a saint. He was concerned for their 
 precious souls, and, since he helped them with his prayers to God for 
 mercy and grace; and the prayers of one who had so great an interest in 
 heaven were of more value than perhaps they knew or considered. With 
 his prayers he joined humiliation and self-affliction, both in his diet 
 (he fasted, at least from pleasant bread) and in his dress; he clothed 
 himself with sackcloth, thus expressing his grief, not only for their 
 affliction, but for their sin; for this was the guise and practice of a 
 penitent. We ought to mourn for the sins of those that do not mourn
 for them themselves. His fasting also put an edge upon his praying, and 
 was an expression of the fervour of it; he was so intent in his 
 devotions that he had no appetite to meat, nor would allow himself time 
 for eating: "<I>My prayer returned into my own bosom;</I> I had the 
 comfort of having done my duty, and of having approved myself a loving 
 neighbour, though I could not thereby win upon them nor make them my 
 friends." We shall not lose by the good offices we have done to any, 
 how ungrateful soever they are; for our rejoicing will be this, <I>the 
 testimony of our conscience.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How basely and insolently and with what a brutish enmity, and worse 
 than brutish, they had behaved towards him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>);

 <I>In my adversity they rejoiced.</I> When he fell under the frowns of 
 Saul, was banished the court, and persecuted as a criminal, they were 
 pleased, were glad at his calamities, and got together in their drunken 
 clubs to make themselves and one another merry with the disgrace of 
 this great favourite. Well, might he call them <I>abjects,</I> for 
 nothing could be more vile and sordid than to triumph in the fall of a 
 man of such unstained honour and consummate virtue. But this was not 
 all.

 (1.) They tore him, rent his good name without mercy, said all the ill 
 they could of him and fastened upon him all the reproach their cursed 
 wit and malice could reach to. 

 (2.) <I>They gnashed upon him with their teeth;</I> they never spoke of 
 him but with the greatest indignation imaginable, as those that would 
 have eaten him up if they could. David was the fool in the play, and 
 his disappointment all the table-talk of the hypocritical mockers at 
 feasts; it was the song of the drunkards. The comedians, who may fitly
 be called <I>hypocritical mockers</I> (for which does a hypocrite 
 signify but a stage-player?) and whose comedies, it is likely, were 
 acted at feasts and balls, chose David for their subject, bantered and 
 abused him, while the auditory, in token of their agreement with the 
 plot, hummed, and <I>gnashed upon him with their teeth.</I> Such has 
 often been the hard fate of the best of men. The apostles were made a 
 spectacle to the world. David was looked upon with ill-will for no 
 other reason than because he was caressed by the people. It is a 
 vexation of spirit which attends even a right work that <I>for this a 
 man is envied of his neighbour,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:4">Eccl. iv. 4</A>.

 And <I>who can stand before envy?</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses, as before,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David describes the great injustice, malice, and insolence, of his 
 persecutors, pleading this with God as a reason why he should protect 
 him from them and appear against them. 

 1. They were very unrighteous; they were his enemies wrongfully, for he
 never gave them any provocation: <I>They hated him without a cause;</I> 
 nay, for that for which they ought rather to have loved and honoured 
 him. This is quoted, with application to Christ, and is said to be 
 fulfilled in him.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:25">John xv. 25</A>,

 <I>They hated me without cause.</I> 

 2. They were very rude; they could not find in their hearts to show him 
 common civility: <I>They speak not peace;</I> if they met him, they had 
 not the good manners to give him the time of day; like Joseph's 
 brethren, that could not <I>speak peaceably to him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:4">Gen. xxxvii. 4</A>.

 3. They were very proud and scornful
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>They opened their mouth wide against me;</I> they shouted and 
 huzzaed when they saw his fall; they bawled after him when he was 
 forced to quit the court, "Aha! aha! this is the day we longed to
 see."

 4. They were very barbarous and base, for they trampled upon him when 
 he was down, rejoiced at his hurt, and <I>magnified themselves against 
 him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 <I>Turba Remi sequitur fortunam, ut semper, et odit damnatos--The Roman
 crowd, varying their opinions with every turn of fortune, are sure to 
 execrate the fallen.</I> Thus, when the Son of David was run upon by 
 the rulers, the people cried, <I>Crucify him, crucify him.</I>

 5. They set themselves against all the sober good people that adhered
 to David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>They devised deceitful matters,</I> to trepan and ruin <I>those that 
 were quiet in the land.</I> Note,

 (1.) It is the character of the godly in the land that they are the 
 quiet in the land, that they live in all dutiful subjection to 
 government and governors, in the Lord, and endeavour, as much as in 
 them lies, to live peaceably with all men, however they may have been 
 misrepresented as enemies to C&aelig;sar and hurtful to kings and 
 provinces. <I>I am for peace,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+120:7">Ps. cxx. 7</A>.

 (2.) Though the people of God are, and study to be, a quiet people, yet
 it has been the common practice of their enemies to devise deceitful 
 matters against them. All the hellish arts of malice and falsehood are 
 made use of to render them odious or despicable; their words and 
 actions are misconstrued, even that which they abhor is fathered upon 
 them, laws are made to ensnare them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+6:4">Dan. vi. 4</A>,

 &c.), and all to ruin them and root them out. Those that hated David
 thought scorn, like Haman, to lay hands on him alone, but contrived to 
 involve all the religious people of the land in the same ruin with 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He appeals to God against them, the <I>God to whom vengeance 
 belongs,</I> appeals to his knowledge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>This thou hast seen.</I> They had falsely accused him, but God, who 
 knows all things, knew that he did not falsely accuse them, nor make 
 them worse than really they were. They had carried on their plots 
 against him with a great degree of secresy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "I knew it not, till long after, when they themselves gloried in it; 
 but thy eye was upon them in their close cabals and thou art a witness 
 of all they have said and done against me and thy people." He appeals 
 to God's justice: <I>Awake to my judgment, even to my cause,</I> and 
 let it have a hearing at thy bar, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 "<I>Judge me, O Lord my God!</I> pass sentence upon this appeal,
 <I>according to the righteousness</I> of thy nature and government,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 See this explained by Solomon,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+8:31,32">1 Kings viii. 31, 32</A>.

 When thou art appealed to, <I>hear in heaven, and judge, by condemning
 the wicked and justifying the righteous.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He prays earnestly to God to appear graciously for him and his 
 friends, against his and their enemies, that by his providence the 
 struggle might issue to the honour and comfort of David and to the 
 conviction and confusion of his persecutors. 

 1. He prays that God would act for him, and not stand by as a
 spectator 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Lord, how long wilt thou look on?</I> How long wilt thou connive at 
 the wickedness of the wicked? <I>Rescue my soul from the 
 destructions</I> they are plotting against it; rescue <I>my 
 darling,</I> my only one, <I>from the lions.</I> My soul is my only 
 one, and therefore the greater is the shame if I neglect it and the 
 greater the loss if I lose it: it is my only one, and therefore ought 
 to be my darling, ought to be carefully protected and provided for. It 
 is my soul that is in danger; Lord, rescue it. It does, in a peculiar 
 manner, belong to the Father of spirits, therefore claim thy own; it is 
 thine, save it. <I>Lord, keep not silence,</I> as if thou didst
 consent to what is done against me! <I>Lord, be not far from me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 as if I were a stranger that thou wert not concerned for; let not me 
 beheld afar off, as the proud are."

 2. He prays that his enemies might not have cause to rejoice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Let them not rejoice over me</I> (and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>);

 not so much because it would be a mortification to him to be trampled 
 upon the abjects, as because it would turn to the dishonour of God and 
 the reproach of his confidence in God. It would harden the hearts of 
 his enemies in their wickedness and confirm them in their enmity to 
 him, and would be a great discouragement to all the pious Jews that 
 were friends to his righteous cause. He prays that he might never be in 
 such imminent danger as that they should <I>say in their hearts, Ah! so 
 would we have it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 much more that he might not be reduced to such extremity that they 
 should say, <I>We have swallowed him up;</I> for then they will reflect 
 upon God himself. But, on the contrary, that they might be <I>ashamed 
 and brought to confusion together</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>,

 as before,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 he desires that his innocency might be so cleared that they might be 
 ashamed of the calumnies with which they had loaded him, that his 
 interest might be so confirmed that they might be ashamed of their 
 designs against him and their expectations of his ruin, that they might 
 either be brought to that shame which would be a step towards their 
 reformation or that that might be their portion which would be their 
 everlasting misery.

 3. He prays that his friends might have cause to rejoice and give glory
 to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Notwithstanding the arts that were used to blacken David, and make him
 odious, and to frighten people from owning him, there were some that 
 favoured his righteous cause, that knew he was wronged and bore a good 
 affection to him; and he prays for them,

 (1.) That they might rejoice with him in his joys. It is a great 
 pleasure to all that are good to see an honest man, and an honest 
 cause, prevail and prosper; and those that heartily espouse the 
 interests of God's people, and are willing to take their lot with them 
 even when they are run down and trampled upon, shall in due time shout 
 for joy and be glad, for the righteous cause will at length be a 
 victorious cause. 

 (2.) That they might join with him in his praises: <I>Let them say 
 continually, The Lord be magnified,</I> by us and others, <I>who hath 
 pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.</I> Note,

 [1.] The great God has pleasure in this prosperity of good people, not 
 only of his family, the church in general, but of every particular 
 servant in his family. He has pleasure in the prosperity both of their 
 temporal and of their spiritual affairs, and delights not in their 
 griefs; for he does not afflict willingly; and we ought therefore to 
 have pleasure in their prosperity, and not to envy it. 

 [2.] When God in his providence shows his good-will to the prosperity 
 of his servants, and the pleasure he takes in it, we ought to 
 acknowledge it with thankfulness, to his praise, and to say, <I>The 
 Lord be magnified.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The mercy he hoped to win by prayer he promises to wear with 
 praise: "<I>I will give thee thanks,</I> as the author of my 
 deliverance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 <I>and my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness,</I> the justice of 
 thy judgments and the equity of all thy dispensations;" and this,

 1. Publicly, as one that took a pleasure in owning his obligations to
 his God, so far was he from being ashamed of them. He will do it in the
 great congregation, and among much people, that God might be honoured 
 and many edified. 

 2. Constantly. He will speak God's praise <I>every day</I> (so it may
 be read) and <I>all the day long;</I> for it is a subject that will 
 never be exhausted, no, not by the endless praises of saints and 
 angels.</P>
