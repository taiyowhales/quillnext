 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The foregoing psalm was penned by David when he was old, and, it should 
 seem, so was this too; for Solomon was now standing fair for the crown; 
 that was his prayer for himself, this for his son and successor, and 
 with these two the prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended, as we 
 find in the close of this psalm. If we have but God's presence with us 
 while we live, and good hopes concerning those that shall come after us 
 that they shall be praising God on earth when we are praising him in 
 heaven, it is enough. This is entitled "a psalm for Solomon:" it is 
 probable that David dictated it, or, rather, that it was by the blessed 
 Spirit dictated to him, when, a little before he died, by divine 
 direction he settled the succession, and gave orders to proclaim 
 Solomon king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:30">1 Kings i. 30</A>,

 &c. But, though Solomon's name is here made use of, Christ's kingdom is
 here prophesied of under the type and figure of Solomon's. David knew 
 what the divine oracle was, That "of the fruit of his loins, according 
 to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:30">Acts ii. 30</A>.

 To him he here bears witness, and with the prospect of the glories of
 his kingdom he comforted himself in his dying moments when he foresaw 
 that his house would not be so with God, not so great not so good, as 
 he wished. David, in spirit,

 I. Begins with a short prayer for his successor, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. He passes immediately into a long prediction of the glories of his 
 reign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:2-17">ver. 2-17</A>.
 
 And, 

 III. He concludes with praise to the God of Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>.

 In singing this psalm we must have an eye to Christ, praising him as a
 King, and pleasing ourselves with our happiness as his subjects.</P>

 <P><I>A psalm</I> for Solomon.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Give the king thy judgments, O
 God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This verse is a prayer for the king, even the king's son.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We may apply it to Solomon: <I>Give him thy judgments, O God! and 
 thy righteousness;</I> make him a man, a king; make him a good man, a 
 good king. 

 1. It is the prayer of a father for his child, a dying blessing, such
 as the patriarchs bequeathed to their children. The best thing we can 
 ask of God for our children is that God will give them wisdom and grace 
 to know and do their duty; that is better than gold. Solomon learned
 to pray for himself as his father had prayed for him, not that God 
 would give him riches and honour, but a wise and understanding heart. 
 It was a comfort to David that his own son was to be his successor, but 
 more so that he was likely to be both judicious and righteous. David 
 had given him a good education

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:3">Prov. iv. 3</A>),

 had taught him <I>good judgment and righteous,</I> yet that would not
 do unless God gave him his judgments. Parents cannot give grace to 
 their children, but may by prayer bring them to the God of grace, and 
 shall not seek him in vain, for their prayer shall either be answered 
 or it shall return with comfort into their own bosom. 

 2. It is the prayer of a king for his successor. David had executed 
 judgment and justice during his reign, and now he prays that his son 
 might do so too. Such a concern as this we should have for posterity, 
 desiring and endeavouring that those who come after us may do God more 
 and better service in their day than we have done in ours. Those have 
 little love either to God or man, and are of a very narrow selfish 
 spirit, who care not what becomes of the world and the church when they 
 are gone. 

 3. It is the prayer of subjects for their king. It should seem, David
 penned this psalm for the use of the people, that they, in singing, 
 might pray for Solomon. Those who would live quiet and peaceable lives 
 must pray for kings and all in authority, that God would give them his 
 judgments and righteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We may apply it to Christ; not that he who intercedes for us needs 
 us to intercede for him; but, 

 1. It is a prayer of the Old-Testament church for sending the Messiah,
 as the church's King, King <I>on the holy hill of Zion,</I> of whom the 
 King of kings had said, <I>Thou art my Son,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6,7">Ps. ii. 6, 7</A>.

 "Hasten his coming to whom all judgment is committed;" and we must thus
 hasten the second coming of Christ, when he shall <I>judge the world in 
 righteousness.</I> 

 2. It is an expression of the satisfaction which all true believers 
 take in the authority which the Lord Jesus has received from the 
 Father: "Let him have all power both in heaven and earth, and be the 
 Lord our righteousness; let him be the great trustee of divine grace 
 for all that are his; give it to him, that he may give it to us."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor
 with judgment.
 &nbsp; 3  The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little
 hills, by righteousness.
 &nbsp; 4  He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the
 children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
 &nbsp; 5  They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
 throughout all generations.
 &nbsp; 6  He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers
 <I>that</I> water the earth.
 &nbsp; 7  In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of
 peace so long as the moon endureth.
 &nbsp; 8  He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the
 river unto the ends of the earth.
 &nbsp; 9  They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and
 his enemies shall lick the dust.
 &nbsp; 10  The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents:
 the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
 &nbsp; 11  Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall
 serve him.
 &nbsp; 12  For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor
 also, and <I>him</I> that hath no helper.
 &nbsp; 13  He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls
 of the needy.
 &nbsp; 14  He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and
 precious shall their blood be in his sight.
 &nbsp; 15  And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of
 Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; <I>and</I> daily
 shall he be praised.
 &nbsp; 16  There shall be a handful of corn in the earth upon the top
 of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and
 <I>they</I> of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
 &nbsp; 17  His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued
 as long as the sun: and <I>men</I> shall be blessed in him: all
 nations shall call him blessed.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a prophecy of the prosperity and perpetuity of the kingdom of 
 Christ under the shadow of the reign of Solomon. It comes in, 

 1. As a plea to enforce the prayer: "Lord, <I>give him thy judgments
 and thy righteousness,</I> and then <I>he shall judge thy people with 
 righteousness,</I> and so shall answer the end of his elevation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 Give him thy grace, and then thy people, committed to his charge, will
 have the benefit of it." <I>Because God loved Israel, he made him king 
 over them to do judgment and justice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+9:8">2 Chron. ix. 8</A>.

 We may in faith wrestle with God for that grace which we have reason to
 think will be of common advantage to his church. 

 2. As an answer of peace to the prayer. As by the prayer of faith we
 return answers to God's promises of mercy, so by the promises of mercy 
 God returns answers to our prayers of faith. That this prophecy must 
 refer to the kingdom of the Messiah is plain, because there are many 
 passages in it which cannot be applied to the reign of Solomon. There 
 was indeed a great deal of righteousness and peace, at first, in the 
 administration of his government; but, before the end of his reign, 
 there were both trouble and unrighteousness. The kingdom here spoken of 
 is to last as long as the sun, but Solomon's was soon extinct. 
 Therefore even the Jewish expositors understand it of the kingdom of 
 the Messiah.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us observe the many great and precious promises here made, which 
 were to have their full accomplishment only in the kingdom of Christ; 
 and yet some of them were in part fulfilled in Solomon's reign.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That it should be a <I>righteous government</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>He shall judge thy people with righteousness.</I> Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:4">Isa. xi. 4</A>.

 All the laws of Christ's kingdom are consonant to the eternal rules of 
 equity; the chancery it erects to relieve against the rigours of the 
 broken law is indeed a court of equity; and against the sentence of his 
 last judgment there will lie no exception. The peace of his kingdom 
 shall be supported by righteousness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 for then only is the peace like a river, when the <I>righteousness is
 as the waves of the sea.</I> The world will be judged in righteousness,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:31">Acts xvii. 31</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That it should be a peaceable government: <I>The mountains shall 
 bring peace, and the little hills</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 that is (says Dr. Hammond), both the superior and the inferior courts
 of judicature in Solomon's kingdom. There shall be <I>abundance of 
 peace,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Solomon's name signifies <I>peaceable,</I> and such was his reign; for
 in it Israel enjoyed the victories of the foregoing reign and preserved 
 the tranquillity and repose of that reign. But peace is, in a special 
 manner, the glory of Christ's kingdom; for, as far as it prevails, it 
 reconciles men to God, to themselves, and to one another, and slays all 
 enmities; for he is our peace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That the poor and needy should be, in a particular manner, taken 
 under the protection of this government: <I>He shall judge thy 
 poor,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Those are God's poor that are impoverished by keeping a good
 conscience, and those shall be provided for with a distinguishing care, 
 shall be judged for with judgment, with a particular cognizance taken 
 of their case and a particular vengeance taken for their wrongs.
 <I>The poor of the people,</I> and <I>the children of the needy,</I> he 
 will be sure so to judge as to save,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 This is insisted upon again
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>),

 intimating that Christ will be sure to carry his cause on behalf of his
 injured poor. <I>He will deliver the needy</I> that lie at the mercy of 
 their oppressors, <I>the poor also,</I> both because they have <I>no 
 helper</I> and it is for his honour to help them and because they cry 
 unto him and he has promised, in answer to their prayers, to help them; 
 they by prayer <I>commit themselves unto him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:14">Ps. x. 14</A>.

 <I>He will spare the needy</I> that throw themselves on his mercy, and
 will not be rigorous and severe with them; he <I>will save their 
 souls,</I> and that is all they desire. <I>Blessed are the poor in
 spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</I> Christ is the poor 
 man's King.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That proud oppressors shall be reckoned with: <I>He shall break 
 them in pieces</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 shall take away their power to hurt, and punish them for all the
 mischief they have done. This is the office of a good king, <I>Parcere 
 subjectis, et debellare superbos--To spare the vanquished and debase 
 the proud.</I> The devil is the great oppressor, whom Christ will break 
 in pieces and of whose kingdom he will be the destruction. <I>With the 
 breath of his mouth shall he slay that wicked one</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:4">Isa. xi. 4</A>),

 and shall deliver the souls of his people <I>from deceit and 
 violence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 He shall save from the power of Satan, both as an old serpent working
 by deceit to ensnare them and as a roaring lion working by violence to 
 terrify and devour them. So <I>precious shall their blood be unto 
 him</I> that not a drop of it shall be shed, by the deceit or violence 
 of Satan or his instruments, without being reckoned for. Christ is a 
 King, who, though he calls his subjects sometimes to resist unto blood 
 for him, yet is not prodigal of their blood, nor will ever have it 
 parted with but upon a valuable consideration to his glory and theirs, 
 and the filling up of the measure of their enemies' iniquity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That religion shall flourish under Christ's government 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 <I>They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure.</I> Solomon
 indeed built the temple, and the fear and worship of God were well kept 
 up, for some time, under his government, but it did not last long; this 
 therefore must point at Christ's kingdom, all the subjects of which are 
 brought to and kept in the fear of God; for the Christian religion has 
 a direct tendency to, and a powerful influence upon, the support and 
 advancement of natural religion. Faith in Christ will set up, and keep 
 up, the fear of God; and therefore this is the everlasting gospel that 
 is preached, <I>Fear God, and give honour to him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:7">Rev. xiv. 7</A>.

 And, as Christ's government promotes devotion towards God, so it
 promotes both justice and charity among men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>In his days shall the righteous flourish;</I> righteousness shall be
 practised, and those that practise righteousness shall be preferred. 
 Righteousness shall abound and be in reputation, shall command and be 
 in power. The law of Christ, written in the heart, disposes men to be 
 honest and just, and to render to all their due; it likewise disposes 
 men to live in love, and so it produces abundance of peace and beats 
 swords into ploughshares. Both holiness and love shall be perpetual in 
 Christ's kingdom, and shall never go to decay, for the subjects of it 
 shall <I>fear God as long as the sun and moon endure;</I> Christianity, 
 in the profession of it, having got footing in the world, shall keep 
 its ground till the end of time, and having, in the power of it, got 
 footing in the heart, it will continue there till, by death, the sun, 
 and the moon, and the stars (that is, the bodily senses) are darkened.
 Through all the changes of the world, and all the changes of life, 
 Christ's kingdom will support itself; and, if the fear of God continue 
 as long as the sun and moon, abundance of peace will. The peace of the 
 church, the peace of the soul, shall run parallel with its purity and 
 piety, and last as long as these last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. That Christ's government shall be very comfortable to all his 
 faithful loving subjects 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>He shall,</I> by the graces and comforts of his Spirit, <I>come down
 like rain upon the mown grass;</I> not on that which is cut down, but 
 that which is left growing, that it may spring again, though it was 
 beheaded. The gospel of Christ distils as the rain, which softens the 
 ground that was hard, moistens that which was dry, and so makes it 
 green and fruitful,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:10">Isa. lv. 10</A>.

 Let our hearts <I>drink in the rain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:7">Heb. vi. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. That Christ's kingdom shall be extended very far, and greatly 
 enlarged; considering,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The extent of his territories 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>He shall have dominion from sea to sea</I> (from the South Sea to
 the North, or from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean) <I>and from the 
 river</I> Euphrates, or Nile, <I>to the ends of the earth.</I> 
 Solomon's dominion was very large

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+4:21">1 Kings iv. 21</A>),

 according to the promise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:18">Gen. xv. 18</A>.

 But no sea, no river, is named, that it might, by these proverbial
 expressions, intimate the universal monarchy of the Lord Jesus. His 
 gospel has been, or shall be, preached <I>to all nations</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:14">Matt. xxiv. 14</A>),

 and the <I>kingdoms of the world</I> shall <I>become his kingdoms</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:15">Rev. xi. 15</A>)

 when the fulness of the Gentiles shall be brought in. His territories
 shall be extended to those countries, 

 (1.) That were strangers to him: <I>Those that dwell in the
 wilderness,</I> out of all high roads, that seldom hear news, shall 
 hear the glad tidings of the Redeemer and redemption by him, <I>shall 
 bow before him,</I> shall believe in him, accept of him, worship him, 
 and take his yoke upon them. Before the Lord Jesus we must all either 
 bow or break; if we break, we are ruined--if we bow, we are certainly 
 made for ever.

 (2.) That were enemies to him, and had fought against him: <I>They
 shall lick the dust;</I> they shall be brought down and laid in the 
 dust, shall bite the ground for vexation, and be so hunger-bitten that 
 they shall be glad of dust, the serpent's meat

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>),

 for of his seed they are; and over whom shall not he rule, when his
 enemies themselves are thus humbled and brought low?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The dignity of his tributaries. He shall not only reign over those 
 that dwell in the wilderness, the peasants and cottagers, but over 
 those that dwell in the palaces 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>The kings of Tarshish, and of the isles,</I> that lie most remote
 from Israel and are <I>the isles of the Gentiles</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:5">Gen. x. 5</A>),

 <I>shall bring presents</I> to him as their sovereign Lord, by and
 under whom they hold their crowns and all their crown lands. They shall 
 court his favour, and make an interest in him, that they may hear his 
 wisdom. This was literally fulfilled in Solomon (for <I>all the kings 
 of the earth sought the wisdom of Solomon, and brought every man his 
 present,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+9:23,24">2 Chron. ix. 23, 24</A>),

 and in Christ too, when the wise men of the east, who probably were men
 of the first rank in their own country, came to worship him and 
 <I>brought him presents,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+2:11">Matt. ii. 11</A>.

 They shall present themselves to him; that is the best present we can
 bring to Christ, and without that no other present is acceptable, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+12:1">Rom. xii. 1</A>.

 They <I>shall offer gifts,</I> spiritual sacrifices of prayer and 
 praise, offer them to Christ as their God, on Christ as their altar, 
 which sanctifies every gift. Their conversion to God is called the 
 <I>offering up,</I> or <I>sacrificing, of the Gentiles,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:16">Rom. xv. 16</A>.

 Yea, all kings shall, sooner or later, <I>fall down before him,</I>
 either to do their duty to him or to receive their doom from him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They shall fall before him, either as his willing subjects or as his
 conquered captives, as suppliants for his mercy or expectants of his
 judgment. And, when the kings submit, the people come in of course:
 <I>All nations shall serve him;</I> all shall be invited into his
 service; some of all nations shall come into it, and in every nation
 <I>incense shall be offered to him and a pure offering,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:11,Re+7:9">Mal. i. 11; Rev. vii. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. That he shall be honoured and beloved by all his subjects 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>He shall live;</I> his subjects shall desire his life (<I>O king!
 live for ever</I>) and with good reason; for he has said, <I>Because I 
 live, you shall live also; and of him it is witnessed that he liveth, 
 ever liveth, making intercession,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:8,25">Heb. vii. 8, 25</A>.

 He shall live, and live prosperously; and, 

 1. Presents shall be made to him. Though he shall be able to live
 without them, for he needs neither the gifts nor the services of any, 
 yet to him <I>shall be given of the gold of Sheba</I>--gold, the best 
 of metals, gold of Sheba, which probably was the finest gold; for he 
 that is best must be served with the best. Those that have abundance
 of the wealth of this world, that have gold at command, must give it to 
 Christ, must serve him with it, do good with it. <I>Honour the Lord 
 with thy substance.</I> 

 2. Prayers shall be made for him, and that continually. The people
 prayed for Solomon, and that helped to make him and his reign so great 
 a blessing to them. It is the duty of subjects to make prayers, 
 intercessions, and giving of thanks, for kings and all in authority, 
 not in compliment to them, as is too often done, but in concern for the 
 public welfare. But how is this applied to Christ? He needs not our 
 prayers, nor can have any benefit by them. But the Old-Testament saints 
 prayed for his coming, prayed continually for it; for they called him, 
 <I>He that should come.</I> And now that he has come we must pray for 
 the success of his gospel and the advancement of his kingdom, which he 
 calls praying for him (Hosanna to the Son of David, prosperity to his 
 reign), and we must pray for his second coming. It may be read, 
 <I>Prayer shall be made through him,</I> or for his sake; whatsoever we 
 ask of the Father shall be in his name and in dependence upon his 
 intercession. 

 3. Praises shall be made of him, and high encomiums given of his
 wisdom, justice, and goodness: <I>Daily shall he be praised.</I> By 
 praying daily in his name we give him honour. Subjects ought to speak 
 well of the government that is a blessing to them; and much more ought 
 all Christians to praise Jesus Christ, daily to praise him; for they 
 owe their all to him, and to him they lie under the highest 
 obligations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IX. That under his government there shall be a wonderful increase both 
 of meat and mouths, both of the fruits of the earth in the country and 
 of the people inhabiting the cities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 1. The country shall grow rich. Sow but a <I>handful of corn on the top
 of the mountains,</I> whence one would expect but little, and yet 
 <I>the fruit of it shall shake like Lebanon;</I> it shall come up like 
 a wood, so thick, and tall, and strong, like the cedars of Lebanon. 
 Even upon the tops of the mountains the earth shall bring forth by 
 handfuls; that is an expression of great plenty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+41:47">Gen. xli. 47</A>),

 as the grass upon the house top is said to be that wherewith the mower
 fills not his hand. This is applicable to the wonderful productions of 
 the seed of the gospel in the days of the Messiah. A handful of that 
 seed, sown in the mountainous and barren soil of the Gentile world, 
 produced a wonderful harvest gathered in to Christ, fruit that shook 
 like Lebanon. The fields were <I>white to the harvest,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+4:35,Mt+9:37">John iv. 35; Matt. ix. 37</A>.

 The grain of mustard-seed grew up to a great tree. 

 2. The towns shall grow populous: <I>Those of the city shall flourish
 like grass,</I> for number, for verdure. The gospel church, the city of 
 God among men, shall have all the marks of prosperity, many shall be 
 added to it, and those that are shall be happy in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 X. That his government shall be perpetual, both to his honour and to 
 the happiness of his subjects. The Lord Jesus shall reign for ever, and 
 of him only this must be understood, and not at all of Solomon. It is 
 Christ only that shall <I>be feared throughout all generations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 and <I>as long as the sun and moon endure,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 1. The honour of the princes is immortal and shall never be sullied

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>His name shall endure for ever,</I> in spite of all the malicious
 attempts and endeavours of the powers of darkness to eclipse the lustre 
 of it and to cut off the line of it; it shall be preserved; it shall be 
 perpetuated; it shall be propagated. As the names of earthly princes 
 are continued in their posterity, so Christ's in himself.
 <I>Filiabitur nomen ejus--His name shall descend to posterity.</I> All 
 nations, while the world stands, shall call him blessed, shall bless 
 God for him, continually speak well of him, and think themselves happy 
 in him. To the end of time, and to eternity, his name shall be 
 celebrated, shall be made use of; every tongue shall confess it and 
 every knee shall bow before it. 

 2. The happiness of the people is universal too; it is complete and
 everlasting: <I>Men shall be blessed,</I> truly and for ever blessed, 
 <I>in him.</I> This plainly refers to the promise made unto the fathers 
 that in the Messiah all the nations of the earth should be blessed.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Such an illustrious prophecy as is in the foregoing verses of the 
 Messiah and his kingdom may fitly be concluded, as it is here, with 
 hearty prayers and praises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The psalmist is here enlarged in thanksgivings for the prophecy and 
 promise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 So sure is every word of God, and with so much satisfaction may we rely
 upon it, that we have reason enough to give thanks for what he has 
 said, though it be not yet done. We must own that for all the great 
 things he has done for the world, for the church, for the children of 
 men, for his own children, in the kingdom of providence, in the kingdom 
 of grace, for all the power and trust lodged in the hands of the 
 Redeemer, God is worthy to be praised; we must stir up ourselves and 
 all that is within us to praise him after the best manner, and desire 
 that all others may do it. <I>Blessed be the Lord,</I> that is, 
 <I>blessed be his glorious name;</I> for it is only in his name that we 
 can contribute any thing to his glory and blessedness, and yet that is 
 also <I>exalted above all blessing and praise.</I> Let it be blessed 
 for ever, it shall be blessed for ever, it deserves to be blessed for 
 ever, and we hope to be forever blessing it. We are here taught to 
 bless the name of Christ, and to bless God in Christ, for all that 
 which he has done for us by him. We must bless him, 

 1. As the Lord God, as a self-existent self-sufficient Being, and our
 sovereign Lord. 

 2. As the God of Israel, in covenant with that people and worshipped by
 them, and who does this in performance of the truth unto Jacob and the 
 mercy to Abraham, 

 3. As the God <I>who only does wondrous things,</I> in creation and
 providence, and especially this work of redemption, which excels them 
 all. Men's works are little, common, trifling things, and even these 
 they could not do without him. But God does all by his own power, and
 they are wondrous things which he does, and such as will be the eternal 
 admiration of saints and angels.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He is earnest in prayer for the accomplishment of this prophecy and 
 promise: <I>Let the whole earth be filled with his glory,</I> as it 
 will be when the <I>kings of Tarshish, and the isles, shall bring 
 presents to him.</I> It is sad to think how empty the earth is of the 
 glory of God, how little service and honour he has from a world to 
 which he is such a bountiful benefactor. All those, therefore, that 
 wish well to the honour of God and the welfare of mankind, cannot but
 desire that the earth may be filled with the discoveries of his glory, 
 suitably returned in thankful acknowledgments of his glory. Let every 
 heart, and every mouth, and every assembly, be filled with the high 
 praises of God. We shall see how earnest David is in this prayer, and 
 how much his heart is in it, if we observe, 

 1. How he shuts up the prayer with a double seal: "<I>Amen and
 amen;</I> again and again I say, I say it and let all others say the 
 same, so be it. Amen to my prayer; Amen to the prayers of all the 
 saints to this purport--<I>Hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come.</I>" 
 
 2. How he ever shuts up his life with this prayer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 This was the last psalm that ever he penned, though not placed last in
 this collection; he penned it when he lay on his death-bed, and with 
 this he breathes his last: "Let God be glorified, let the kingdom of 
 the Messiah be set up, and kept up, in the world, and I have enough, I 
 desire no more. With this let <I>the prayers of David the son of 
 Jesse</I> be <I>ended.</I> Even so, come, Lord Jesus, come 
 quickly."</P>
