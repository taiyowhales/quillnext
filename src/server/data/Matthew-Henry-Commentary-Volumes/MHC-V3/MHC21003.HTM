 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon having shown the vanity of studies, pleasures, and business, 
 and made it to appear that happiness is not to be found in the schools 
 of the learned, nor in the gardens of Epicurus, nor upon the exchange, 
 he proceeds, in this chapter, further to prove his doctrine, and the 
 inference he had drawn from it, That therefore we should cheerfully 
 content ourselves with, and make use of, what God has given us, by 
 showing, 

 I. The mutability of all human affairs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>.

 II. The immutability of the divine counsels concerning them and the
 unsearchableness of those counsels, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:11-15">ver. 11-15</A>.

 III. The vanity of worldly honour and power, which are abused for the
 support of oppression and persecution if men be not governed by the
 fear of God in the use of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16">ver. 16</A>.

 For a check to proud oppressors, and to show them their vanity, he
 reminds them, 

 1. That they will be called to account for it in the other world, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:17">ver. 17</A>.

 2.  That their condition, in reference to this world (for of that he 
 speaks), is no better than that of the beasts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:18-21">ver.  18-21</A>.

 And therefore he concludes that it is our wisdom to make use of what 
 power we have for our own comfort, and not to oppress others with 
 it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of these verses is to show,

 1. That we live in a world of changes, that the several events of time,
 and conditions of human life, are vastly different from one another,
 and yet occur promiscuously, and we are continually passing and
 repassing between them, as in the revolutions of every day and every 
 year. In the <I>wheel of nature</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:6">Jam. iii. 6</A>)

 sometimes one spoke is uppermost and by and by the contrary; there is a
 constant ebbing and flowing, waxing and waning; from one extreme to the 
 other does the <I>fashion of this world change,</I> ever did, and ever 
 will. 

 2. That every change concerning us, with the time and season of it, is 
 unalterably fixed and determined by a supreme power; and we must take 
 things as they come, for it is not in our power to change what is 
 appointed for us. And this comes in here as a reason why, when we are 
 in prosperity, we should be easy, and yet not secure--not to be secure
 because we live in a world of changes and therefore have no reason to 
 say, <I>To-morrow shall be as this day</I> (the lowest valleys join to 
 the highest mountains), and yet to be easy, and, as he had advised

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:24"><I>ch.</I> ii. 24</A>),

 <I>to enjoy the good of our labour,</I> in a humble dependence upon God
 and his providence, neither lifted up with hopes, nor cast down with 
 fears, but with evenness of mind expecting every event. Here we 
 have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A general proposition laid down: <I>To every thing there is a 
 season,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 1. Those things which seem most contrary the one to the other will, in
 the revolution of affairs, each take their turn and come into play. The 
 day will give place to the night and the night again to the day. Is it 
 summer? It will be winter. Is it winter? Stay a while, and it will be 
 summer. Every purpose has its time. The clearest sky will be clouded, 
 <I>Post gaudia luctus--Joy succeeds sorrow;</I> and the most clouded 
 sky will clear up, <I>Post nubila Phoebus--The sun will burst from 
 behind the cloud.</I> 

 2. Those things which to us seem most casual and contingent are, in the 
 counsel and foreknowledge of God, punctually determined, and the very 
 hour of them is fixed, and can neither be anticipated nor adjourned a 
 moment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The proof and illustration of it by the induction of particulars, 
 twenty-eight in number, according to the days of the moon's revolution, 
 which is always increasing or decreasing between its full and change. 
 Some of these changes are purely the act of God, others depend more 
 upon the will of man, but all are determined by the divine counsel. 
 Every thing <I>under heaven</I> is thus changeable, but in heaven there 
 is an unchangeable state, and an unchangeable counsel concerning these 
 things. 

 1.  There is <I>a time to be born and a time to die.</I> These are
 determined by the divine counsel; and, as we were born, so we must die, 
 at the time appointed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:26">Acts xvii. 26</A>.

 Some observe that here is <I>a time to be born and a time to die,</I>
 but no time to live; that is so short that it is not worth mentioning; 
 as soon as we are born we begin to die. But, as there is <I>a time to 
 be born and a time to die,</I> so there will be a time to rise again, a 
 set time when those that lie in the grave shall be remembered,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:13">Job xiv. 13</A>.

 2. <I>A time</I> for God <I>to plant</I> a nation, as that of Israel in 
 Canaan, <I>and,</I> in order to that, <I>to pluck up</I> the seven 
 nations <I>that were planted</I> there, to make room for them; and at 
 length there was a time when God spoke concerning Israel too, to 
 <I>pluck up and to destroy,</I> when the measure of their iniquity was 
 full, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+18:7,9">Jer. xviii. 7, 9</A>.

 There is <I>a time</I> for men <I>to plant,</I> a time of the year, a
 time of their lives; but, when <I>that which was planted</I> has grown 
 fruitless and useless, it is <I>time to pluck it up.</I>

 3. <I>A time to kill,</I> when the judgments of God are abroad in a
 land and lay all waste; but, when he returns in ways of mercy, then is 
 <I>a time to heal</I> what <I>he has torn</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:1,2">Hos.  vi. 1, 2</A>),

 to comfort a people after the time that he has <I>afflicted them,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:15">Ps. xc. 15</A>.

 There is a time when it is the wisdom of rulers to use severe methods,
 but there is a time when it is as much their wisdom to take a more 
 gentle course, and to apply themselves to lenitives, not corrosives.

 4. <I>A time to break down</I> a family, an estate, a kingdom, when it
 has ripened itself for destruction; but God will find <I>a time,</I> if 
 they return and repent, to rebuild what he has broken down; there is 
 <I>a time,</I> a set time, for the Lord <I>to build up Zion,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:13,16">Ps.  cii. 13, 16</A>.

 There is <I>a time</I> for men <I>to break up</I> house, and break off
 trade, and so <I>to break down,</I> which those that are busy in 
 <I>building up</I> both must expect and prepare for.

 5. <I>A time</I> when God's providence calls <I>to weep and mourn,</I>
 and when man's wisdom and grace will comply with the call, and will 
 <I>weep and mourn,</I> as in times of common calamity and danger, and 
 there it is very absurd to <I>laugh, and dance,</I> and make merry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:12,13,Eze+21:10">Isa. xxii. 12, 13; Ezek. xxi. 10</A>);

 but then, on the other hand, there is a time when God calls to
 cheerfulness, <I>a time to laugh and dance,</I> and then he expects we 
 should <I>serve him with joyfulness and gladness of heart.</I> Observe, 
 The time of mourning and weeping is put first, before that of laughter 
 and dancing, for we must first <I>sow in tears</I> and then <I>reap in 
 joy.</I> 

 6. <I>A time to cast away stones,</I> by breaking down and demolishing
 fortifications, when God gives peace in the borders, and there is no 
 more occasion for them; but there is <I>a time to gather stones 
 together,</I> for the making of strong-holds,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 A time for old towers to fall, as that in Siloam

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:4">Luke xii. 4</A>),

 and for the temple itself to be so ruined as that <I>not one stone
 should be left upon another;</I> but also a time for towers and 
 trophies too to be erected, when national affairs prosper. 

 7. <I>A time to embrace</I> a friend when we find him faithful, but
 <I>a time to refrain from embracing</I> when we find he is unfair or 
 unfaithful, and that we have cause to suspect him; it is then our 
 prudence to be shy and keep at a distance.  It is commonly applied to 
 conjugal embraces, and explained by

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+7:3-5,Joe+2:16">1 Cor. vii. 3-5; Joel ii. 16</A>.

 8. <I>A time to get,</I> get money, get preferment, get good bargains
 and a good interest, when opportunity smiles, a time when a wise man 
 will <I>seek</I> (so the word is); when he is setting out in the world 
 and has a growing family, when he is in his prime, when he prospers and 
 has a run of business, then it is time for him to be busy and make hay 
 when the sun shines.  There is <I>a time to get</I> wisdom, and 
 knowledge, and grace, when a man has a price put into his hand; but 
 then let him expect there will come a time to spend, when all he has 
 will be little enough to serve his turn. Nay, there will come <I>a time 
 to lose,</I> when what has been soon got will be soon scattered and 
 cannot be held fast. 

 9. <I>A time to keep,</I> when we have use for what we have got, and
 can keep it without running the hazard of a good conscience; but there 
 may come <I>a time to cast away,</I> when love to God may oblige us to 
 cast away what we have, because we must deny Christ and wrong our 
 consciences if we keep it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:37,38">Matt. x. 37, 38</A>),

 and rather to make shipwreck of all than of the faith; nay, when love
 to ourselves may oblige us to cast it away, when it is for the saving 
 of our lives, as it was when Jonah's mariners heaved their cargo into 
 the sea. 

 10. <I>A time to rend</I> the garments, as upon occasion of some great
 grief, <I>and a time to sew,</I> them again, in token that the grief is 
 over. A time to undo what we have done and a time to do again what we 
 have undone. Jerome applies this to the rending of the Jewish church 
 and the sewing and making up of the gospel church thereupon.

 11. <I>A time</I> when it becomes us, and is our wisdom and duty, <I>to
 keep silence,</I> when it is an <I>evil time</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:13">Amos v. 13</A>),

 when our speaking would be the <I>casting of pearl before swine,</I> or
 when we are in danger of speaking amiss

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:2">Ps. xxxix. 2</A>);

 but there is also <I>a time to speak</I> for the glory of God and the
 edification of others, when silence would be the betraying of a 
 righteous cause, and when with the mouth confession is to be made to 
 salvation; and it is a great part of Christian prudence to know when to 
 speak and when to hold our peace. 

 12. <I>A time to love,</I> and to show ourselves friendly, to be free 
 and cheerful, and it is a pleasant time; but there may come <I>a time 
 to hate,</I> when we shall see cause to break off all familiarity with 
 some that we have been fond of, and to be upon the reserve, as having 
 found reason for a suspicion, which love is loth to admit. 

 13. <I>A time of war,</I> when God draws the sword for judgment and
 gives it commission to devour, when men draw the sword for justice and 
 the maintaining of their rights, when there is in the nations a 
 disposition to war; but we may hope for <I>a time of peace,</I> when 
 the sword of the Lord shall be sheathed and he shall <I>make wars to 
 cease</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:9">Ps. xlvi. 9</A>),

 when the end of the war is obtained, and when there is on all sides a
 disposition to peace. War shall not last always, nor is there any peace 
 to be called lasting on this side the everlasting peace. Thus in all 
 these changes God has set the one over-against the other, that we may 
 <I>rejoice as though we rejoiced not and weep as though we wept 
 not.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The inferences drawn from this observation. If our present state 
 be subject to such vicissitude, 

 1. Then we must not expect our portion in it, for the good things of it
 are of no certainty, no continuance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>What profit has he that works?</I> What can a man promise himself
 from planting and building, when that which he thinks is brought to 
 perfection may so soon, and will so surely, be plucked up and broken 
 down? All our pains and care will not alter either the mutable nature 
 of the things themselves or the immutable counsel of God concerning 
 them. 

 2. Then we must look upon ourselves as upon our probation in it.  There 
 is indeed no profit <I>in that wherein we labour;</I> the thing itself, 
 when we have it, will do us little good; but, if we make a right use of 
 the disposals of Providence about it, there will be profit in that

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>I have seen the travail which God has given to the sons of men,</I>
 not to make up a happiness by it, but <I>to be exercised in it,</I> to 
 have various graces exercised by the variety of events, to have their 
 dependence upon God tried by every change, and to be trained up to it, 
 and taught both <I>how to want and how to abound,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:12">Phil. iv. 12</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) There is a great deal of toil and trouble to be seen among the
 children of men. Labour and sorrow fill the world.

 (2.) This toil and this trouble are what God has allotted us. He never
 intended this world for our rest, and therefore never appointed us to 
 take our ease in it.

 (3.) To many it proves a gift.  God gives it to men, as the physician
 gives a medicine to his patient, to do him good. This travail is given 
 to us to make us weary of the world and desirous of the remaining rest. 
 It is given to us that we may be kept in action, and may always have 
 something to do; for we were none of us sent into the world to be idle. 
 Every change cuts us out some new work, which we should be more 
 solicitous about, than about the event.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  He hath made every <I>thing</I> beautiful in his time: also he
 hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out
 the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.
 &nbsp; 12  I know that <I>there is</I> no good in them, but for <I>a man</I> to
 rejoice, and to do good in his life.

 &nbsp; 15  That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath
 already been; and God requireth that which is past.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have seen what changes there are in the world, and must not expect 
 to find the world more sure to us than it has been to others. Now here 
 Solomon shows the hand of God in all those changes; it is he that has 
 made every creature to be that to us which it is, and therefore we must 
 have our eye always upon him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We must make the best of <I>that which is,</I> and must believe it 
 best for the present, and accommodate ourselves to it: <I>He has made 
 every thing beautiful in his time</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and therefore, while its time lasts, we must be reconciled to it: nay,
 we must please ourselves with the beauty of it. Note, 

 1. Every thing is as God has made it; it is really as he appointed it
 to be, not as it appears to us. 

 2. That which to us seems most unpleasant is yet, in its proper time, 
 altogether becoming.  Cold is as becoming in winter as heat in summer; 
 and the night, in its turn, is a black beauty, as the day, in its turn, 
 is a bright one. 

 3. There is a wonderful harmony in the divine Providence and all its
 disposals, so that the events of it, when they come to be considered in 
 their relations and tendencies, together with the seasons of them, will 
 appear very beautiful, to the glory of God and the comfort of those 
 that trust in him. Though we see not the complete beauty of Providence, 
 yet we shall see it, and a glorious sight it will be, when the mystery 
 of God shall be finished.  Then every thing shall appear to have been 
 done in the most proper time and it will be the wonder of eternity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:4,Eze+1:18">Deut. xxxii. 4; Ezek.  i. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We must wait with patience for the full discovery of that which to 
 us seems intricate and perplexed, acknowledging that we <I>cannot find 
 out the work that God makes from the beginning to the end,</I> and 
 therefore must judge nothing before the time. We are to believe that 
 God has made all beautiful. Every thing is done well, as in creation, 
 so in providence, and we shall see it when the end comes, but till then 
 we are incompetent judges of it. While the picture is in drawing, and 
 the house in building, we see not the beauty of either; but when the 
 artist has put his last hand to them, and given them their finishing 
 strokes, then all appears very good. We see but the middle of God's 
 works, not from the beginning of them (then we should see how admirably 
 the plan was laid in the divine counsels), nor to the end of them, 
 which crowns the action (then we should see the product to be 
 glorious), but we must wait till the veil be rent, and not arraign 
 God's proceedings nor pretend to pass judgment on them. <I>Secret 
 things belong not to us.</I> Those words, <I>He has set the world in 
 their hearts,</I> are differently understood. 

 1. Some make them to be a reason why we may know more of God's works
 than we do; so Mr. Pemble: "God has not left himself without witness of 
 his righteous, equal, and beautiful ordering of things, but has set it 
 forth, to be observed in the book of <I>the world,</I> and this he has 
 <I>set in men's hearts,</I> given man a large desire, and a power, in 
 good measure, to comprehend and understand the history of nature, with 
 the course of human affairs, so that, if men did but give themselves to 
 the exact observation of things, they might in most of them perceive an 
 admirable order and contrivance." 

 2. Others make them to be a reason why we do not know so much of God's 
 works as we might; so bishop Reynolds: "We have the world so much in 
 our hearts, are so taken up with thoughts and cares of worldly things, 
 and are so exercised in our travail concerning them, that we have 
 neither time nor spirit to eye God's hand in them." The world has not 
 only gained possession of the heart, but has formed prejudices there 
 against the beauty of God's works.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We must be pleased with our lot in this world, and cheerfully 
 acquiesce in the will of God concerning us, and accommodate ourselves 
 to it. <I>There is no</I> certain, lasting, <I>good in</I> these 
 things; what good there is in them we are here told, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>.

 We must make a good use of them,

 1. For the benefit of others. All the <I>good</I> there is <I>in
 them</I> is <I>to do good</I> with them, to our families, to our 
 neighbours, to the poor, to the public, to its civil and religious 
 interests.  What have we our beings, capacities, and estates for, but 
 to be some way serviceable to our generation? We mistake if we think we 
 were born for ourselves. No; it is our business <I>to do good;</I> it 
 is in doing good that there is the truest pleasure, and what is so laid 
 out is best laid up and will turn to the best account. Observe, It is 
 <I>to do good in this life,</I> which is short and uncertain; we have 
 but a little time to be doing good in, and therefore had need to redeem 
 time. It is <I>in this life,</I> where we are in a state of trial and 
 probation for another life. Every man's life is his opportunity of 
 doing that which will make for him in eternity. 

 2. For our own comfort.  Let us make ourselves easy, <I>rejoice, and 
 enjoy the good of our labour,</I> as <I>it is the gift of God,</I> and 
 so enjoy God in it, and taste his love, return him thanks, and make him 
 the centre of our joy, <I>eat and drink</I> to his glory, and <I>serve 
 him with joyfulness of heart, in the abundance of all things.</I> If 
 all things in this world be so uncertain, it is a foolish thing for men 
 sordidly to spare for the present, that they may hoard up all for 
 hereafter; it is better to live cheerfully and usefully upon what we 
 have, and let to-morrow <I>take thought for the things of itself.</I> 
 Grace and wisdom to do this <I>is the gift of God,</I> and it is a good 
 gift, which crowns the gifts of his providential bounty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. We must be entirely satisfied in all the disposals of the divine 
 Providence, both as to personal and public concerns, and bring our 
 minds to them, because God, in all, performs the thing that is 
 appointed for us, acts according to the counsel of his will; and we are 
 here told, 

 1. That that counsel cannot be altered, and therefore it is our wisdom
 to make a virtue of necessity, by submitting to it. It must be as God 
 wills: <I>I know</I> (and every one knows it that knows any thing of 
 God) <I>that whatsoever God does it shall be for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:14"><I>v.</I>  14</A>.
 
 <I>He is in one mind, and who can turn him?</I> His measures are never
 broken, nor is he ever put upon new counsels, but what he has purposed 
 shall be effected, and all the world cannot defeat nor disannul it. It 
 behoves us therefore to say, "Let it be as God wills," for, how cross 
 soever it may be to our designs and interests, God's will is his 
 wisdom. 

 2. That that counsel needs not to be altered, for there is nothing 
 amiss in it, nothing that can be amended. If we could see it
 altogether at one view, we should see it so perfect that <I>nothing can 
 be put to it,</I> for there is no deficiency in it, <I>nor any thing 
 taken from it,</I> for there is nothing in it unnecessary, or that can 
 be spared. As the word of God, so the works of God are every one of 
 them perfect in its kind, and it is presumption for us either to add to 
 them or to diminish from them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:2">Deut. iv. 2</A>.

 It is therefore as much our interest, as our duty, to bring our wills 
 to the will of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. We must study to answer God's end in all his providences, which is 
 in general to make us religious. <I>God does</I> all <I>that men should 
 fear before him,</I> to convince them that there is a God above them 
 that has a sovereign dominion over them, at whose disposal they are and 
 all their ways, and in whose hands their times are and all events 
 concerning them, and that therefore they ought to have their eyes ever 
 towards him, to worship and adore him, to acknowledge him in all their 
 ways, to be careful in every thing to please him, and afraid of 
 offending him in any thing. God thus changes his disposals, and yet is 
 unchangeable in his counsels, not to perplex us, much less to drive us 
 to despair, but to teach us our duty to him and engage us to do it. 
 That which God designs in the government of the world is the support 
 and advancement of religion among men.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Whatever changes we see or feel in this world, we must acknowledge 
 the inviolable steadiness of God's government. The sun rises and sets, 
 the moon increases and decreases, and yet both are where they were, and 
 their revolutions are in the same method from the beginning according 
 to <I>the ordinances of heaven;</I> so it is with the events of 
 Providence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>That which has been is now.</I> God has not of late begun to use
 this method. No; things were always as mutable and uncertain as they 
 are now, and so they will be: <I>That which is to be has already 
 been;</I> and therefore we speak inconsiderately when we say, "Surely 
 the world was never so bad as it is now," or "None ever met with such 
 disappointments as we meet with," or "The times will never mend;" they 
 may mend with us, and after a time to mourn there may come a time to 
 rejoice, but that will still be liable to the common character, to the 
 common fate. The world, as it has been, is and will be constant in 
 inconstancy; for <I>God requires that which is past,</I> that is, 
 repeats what he has formerly done and deals with us no otherwise than 
 as he has used to deal with good men; and <I>shall the earth be 
 forsaken for us, or the rock removed out of his place?</I> There has no 
 change befallen us, nor any temptation by it overtaken us, <I>but such 
 as is common to men.</I> Let us not be proud and secure in prosperity, 
 for God may recall a past trouble, and order that to seize us and spoil 
 our mirth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:7">Ps. xxx. 7</A>);

 nor let us despond in adversity, for God may call back the comforts
 that are past, as he did to Job. We may apply this to our past actions, 
 and our behaviour under the changes that have affected us. God will 
 call us to account for <I>that which is past;</I> and therefore, when 
 we enter into a new condition, we should judge ourselves for our sins 
 in our former condition, prosperous or afflicted.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment,
 <I>that</I> wickedness <I>was</I> there; and the place of righteousness,
 <I>that</I> iniquity <I>was</I> there.
 &nbsp; 17  I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
 wicked: for <I>there is</I> a time there for every purpose and for
 every work.
 &nbsp; 18  I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of
 men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that
 they themselves are beasts.
 &nbsp; 19  For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts;
 even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the
 other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no
 preeminence above a beast: for all <I>is</I> vanity.
 &nbsp; 20  All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to
 dust again.
 &nbsp; 21  Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the
 spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?
 &nbsp; 22  Wherefore I perceive that <I>there is</I> nothing better, than
 that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that <I>is</I> his
 portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon is still showing that every thing in this world, without piety 
 and the fear of God, is vanity. Take away religion, and there is 
 nothing valuable among men, nothing for the sake of which a wise man 
 would think it worth while to live in this world. In these verses he 
 shows that power (than which there is nothing men are more ambitious 
 of) and life itself (than which there is nothing men are more fond, 
 more jealous of) are nothing without the fear of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is the vanity of man as mighty, man in his best estate, man 
 upon the throne, where his authority is submitted to, man upon the 
 judgment-seat, where his wisdom and justice are appealed to, and where, 
 if he be governed by the laws of religion, he is God's vicegerent; nay, 
 he is of those to whom it is said, <I>You are gods;</I> but without the 
 fear of God it <I>is vanity,</I> for, set that aside, and,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The judge will not judge aright, will not use his power well, but 
 will abuse it; instead of doing good with it he will do hurt with it, 
 and then it is not only vanity, but a lie, a cheat to himself and to 
 all about him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Solomon perceived, by what he had read of former times, what he heard
 of other countries, and what he had seen in some corrupt judges, even 
 in the land of Israel, notwithstanding all his care to prefer good men, 
 that there was <I>wickedness in the place of judgment.</I> It is not so 
 above the sun: far be it from God that he should do iniquity, or 
 pervert justice. But <I>under the sun</I> it is often found that that 
 which should be the refuge, proves the prison, of oppressed innocency. 
 <I>Man being in honour, and not understanding</I> what he ought to do, 
 <I>becomes like the beasts that perish,</I> like the beasts of prey, 
 even the most ravenous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:20">Ps. xlix. 20</A>.

 Not only from the persons that sat in judgment, but even <I>in the
 places</I> where judgment was, in pretence, administered, and 
 righteousness was expected, <I>there was iniquity;</I> men met with the 
 greatest wrongs in those courts to which they fled for justice. This is 
 <I>vanity and vexation;</I> for,

 (1.) It would have been better for the people to have had no judges
 than to have had such.

 (2.) It would have been better for the judges to have had no power than
 to have had it and used it to such ill purposes; and so they will say 
 another day.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The judge will himself be judged for not judging aright. When 
 Solomon saw how judgment was perverted among men he looked up to God 
 the Judge, and looked forward to the day of his judgment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>I said in my heart</I> that this unrighteous judgment is not so
 conclusive as both sides take it to be, for there will be a review of 
 the judgment; <I>God shall judge</I> between <I>the righteous and the 
 wicked,</I> shall judge for the righteous and plead their cause, though 
 now it is run down, and judge against the wicked and reckon with them 
 for all their <I>unrighteous decrees</I> and the <I>grievousness which 
 they have prescribed,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:1">Isa. x. 1</A>.

 With an eye of faith we may see, not only the period, but the
 punishment of the pride and cruelty of oppressors

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+92:7">Ps. xcii. 7</A>),

 and it is an unspeakable comfort to the oppressed that their cause will
 be heard over again. Let them therefore wait with patience, for there 
 is another <I>Judge</I> that <I>stands before the door.</I> And, though 
 the day of affliction may last long, yet <I>there is a time,</I> a set 
 time, for the examination of <I>every purpose, and every work</I> done 
 under the sun. Men have their day now, but God's day is coming, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:13">Ps. xxxvii. 13</A>.

 With God <I>there is a time</I> for the re-hearing of causes,
 redressing of grievances, and reversing of unjust decrees, though as 
 yet we see it not here,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:1">Job xxiv. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is the vanity of man as mortal. He now comes to speak more 
 generally <I>concerning the estate of the sons of men</I> in this 
 world, their life and being on earth, and shows that their reason, 
 without religion and the fear of God, advances them but little above 
 the beasts. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he aims at in this account of man's estate. 

 (1.) That God may be honoured, may be justified, may be
 glorified--<I>that they might clear God</I> (so the margin reads it), 
 that if men have an uneasy life in this world, full of vanity and 
 vexation, they may thank themselves and lay no blame on God; let them 
 clear him, and not say that he made this world to be man's prison and 
 life to be his penance; no, God made man, in respect both of honour and 
 comfort, <I>little lower than the angels;</I> if he be mean and 
 miserable, it is his own fault. Or, <I>that God</I> (that is, the world 
 of God) <I>might manifest them,</I> and discover them to themselves, 
 and so appear to be <I>quick and powerful,</I> and a judge of men's 
 characters; and we may be made sensible how open we lie to God's 
 knowledge and judgment.

 (2.) That men may be humbled, may be vilified, may be
 mortified--<I>that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</I> 
 It is no easy matter to convince proud men that <I>they are but men</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:20">Ps. ix. 20</A>),

 much more to convince bad men <I>that they are beasts,</I> that, being
 destitute of religion, they are as <I>the beasts that perish,</I> as 
 <I>the horse and the mule that have no understanding.</I> Proud 
 oppressors are as beasts, as <I>roaring lions and ranging bears.</I> 
 Nay, every man that minds his body only, and not his soul, makes 
 himself no better than a brute, and must wish, at least, to die like 
 one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The manner in which he verifies this account. That which he 
 undertakes to prove is that a worldly, carnal, earthly-minded <I>man, 
 has no preeminence above the beast, for all</I> that which he sets his 
 heart upon, places his confidence, and expects a happiness in, <I>is 
 vanity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Some make this to be the language of an atheist, who justifies himself
 in his iniquity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 and evades the argument taken from the judgment to come

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>)

 by pleading that there is not another life after this, but that when
 man dies there is an end of him, and therefore while he lives he may 
 live as he lists; but others rather think Solomon here speaks as he 
 himself thinks, and that it is to be understood in the same sense with 
 that of his father

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:14">Ps. xlix. 14</A>),
 
 <I>Like sheep they are laid in the grave,</I> and that he intends to
 show the vanity of this world's wealth and honours "By the equal 
 condition in mere outward respects (as bishop Reynolds expounds it) 
 between men and beasts," 

 (1.) The events concerning both seem much alike

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 <I>That which befals the sons of men</I> is no other than that which
 <I>befals beasts;</I> a great deal of knowledge of human bodies is 
 gained by the anatomy of the bodies of brutes. When the deluge swept 
 away the old world the beasts perished with mankind.  Horses and men 
 are killed in battle with the same weapons of war.

 (2.) The end of both, to an eye of sense, seems alike too: <I>They have
 all one breath,</I> and breathe in the same air, and it is the general 
 description of both that <I>in their nostrils is the breath of life</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+7:22">Gen. vii. 22</A>),

 and therefore, <I>as the one dies, so dies the other;</I> in their
 expiring there is no visible difference, but death makes much the same 
 change with a beast that it does with a man.  

 [1.] As to their bodies, the change is altogether the same, except the
 different respects that are paid to them by the survivors. Let a man be 
 <I>buried with the burial of an ass</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+22:19">Jer. xxii. 19</A>)

 and what pre&euml;minence then has he <I>above a beast?</I> The touch
 of the dead body of a man, by the law of Moses, contracted a greater 
 ceremonial pollution than the touch of the carcase even of an unclean 
 beast or fowl. And Solomon here observes that <I>all go unto one 
 place;</I> the dead bodies of men and beasts putrefy alike; <I>all are 
 of the dust,</I> in their original, for we see <I>all turn to dust 
 again</I> in their corruption. What little reason then have we to be 
 proud of our bodies, or any bodily accomplishments, when they must not 
 only be reduced to the earth very shortly, but must be so in common 
 with the beasts, and we must mingle our dust with theirs! 

 [2.] As to their spirits there is indeed a vast difference, but not a
 visible one,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 It is certain that <I>the spirit of</I> the sons of men at death is
 ascending; it <I>goes upwards</I> to the Father of spirits, who made 
 it, to the world of spirits to which it is allied; it dies not with the 
 body, but <I>is redeemed from the power of the grave,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:15">Ps. xlix. 15</A>.

 It <I>goes upwards</I> to be judged and determined to an unchangeable
 state. It is certain that <I>the spirit of the beast goes downwards to 
 the earth;</I> it dies with the body; it perishes and is gone at death.  
 The soul of a beast is, at death, like a candle blown out--there is an 
 end of it; whereas the soul of a man is then like a candle taken out of 
 a dark lantern, which leaves the lantern useless indeed, but does 
 itself shine brighter. This great difference there is between the 
 spirits of men and beasts; and a good reason it is why men should 
 <I>set their affections on things above,</I> and lift up their souls to 
 those things, not suffering them, as if they were the souls of brutes, 
 to cleave to this earth. But <I>who knows</I> this difference? We 
 cannot see the ascent of the one and the descent of the other with our 
 bodily eyes; and therefore those that live by sense, as all carnal 
 sensualists do, that <I>walk in the sight of their eyes</I> and will 
 not admit any other discoveries, by their own rule of judgment have no 
 <I>pre&euml;minence above the beasts. Who knows,</I> that is, who 
 considers this?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:1">Isa.  liii. 1</A>.

 Very few. Were it better considered, the world would be every way
 better; but most men live as if they were to be here always, or as if 
 when they die there were an end of them; and it is not strange that 
 those live like beasts who think they shall die like beasts, but on 
 such the noble faculties of reason are perfectly lost and thrown 
 away.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. An inference drawn from it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>There is nothing better,</I> as to this world, nothing better to be
 had out of our wealth and honour, <I>than that a man should rejoice in 
 his own works,</I> that is,

 (1.) Keep a clear conscience, and never admit <I>iniquity</I> into
 <I>the place of righteousness. Let every man prove his own work,</I> 
 and approve himself to God in it, <I>so shall he have rejoicing in 
 himself alone,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:4">Gal. vi. 4</A>.

 Let him not get nor keep any thing but what he can rejoice in.  See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:12">2 Cor. i. 12</A>.

 (2.) Live a cheerful life. If God have prospered the work of our hands
 unto us, let us rejoice in it, and take the comfort of it, and not make 
 it a burden to ourselves and leave others the joy of it; <I>for that is 
 our portion,</I> not the portion of our souls (miserable are those that 
 have their portion in this life,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>,

 and fools are those that choose it and take up with it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:19">Luke xii. 19</A>),

 but it is the portion of the body; that only which we enjoy is ours out
 of this world; it is taking what is to be had and making the best of 
 it, and the reason is because none can give us a sight of <I>what shall 
 be after us,</I> either who shall have our estates or what use they 
 will make of them. When we are gone it is likely we shall not see what 
 is after us; there is no correspondence that we know of between the 
 other world and this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:21">Job xiv. 21</A>.

 Those in the other world will be wholly taken up with that world, so
 that they will not care for seeing what is done in this; and while we 
 are here we cannot foresee <I>what shall be after us,</I> either as to 
 our families or the public. <I>It is not for us to know the times and 
 seasons</I> that <I>shall be after</I> us, which, as it should be a 
 restraint to our cares about this world, so it should be a reason for 
 our concern about another.  Since death is a final farewell to this 
 life, let us look before us to another life.</P>
