 Many humbling confounding questions God had put to Job, in the 
 foregoing chapter; now, in this chapter, 

 I. He demands an answer to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Job submits in a humble silence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>.

 III. God proceeds to reason with him, for his conviction, concerning
 the infinite distance and disproportion between him and God, showing
 that he was by no means an equal match for God. He challenges him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>)

 to vie with him, if he durst, for justice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:8">ver. 8</A>),
 
 power 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:9">ver. 9</A>),
 
 majesty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:10">ver. 10</A>),
 
 and dominion over the proud 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>),

 and he gives an instance of his power in one particular animal, here
 called "Behemoth,"

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Moreover the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> answered Job, and said,
 &nbsp; 2  Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct <I>him?</I> he
 that reproveth God, let him answer it.
 &nbsp; 3  Then Job answered the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and said,
 &nbsp; 4  Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine
 hand upon my mouth.
 &nbsp; 5  Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I
 will proceed no further.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A humbling challenge which God gave to Job. After he had heaped up 
 many hard questions upon him, to show him, by his manifest ignorance in 
 the works of nature, what an incompetent judge he was of the methods 
 and designs of Providence, he clenches the nail with one demand more, 
 which stands by itself here as the application of the whole. It should 
 seem, God paused awhile, as Elihu had done, to give Job time to say 
 what he had to say, or to think of what God had said; but Job was in 
 such confusion that he remained silent, and therefore God here put him 
 upon replying, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 This is not said to be spoken <I>out of the whirlwind,</I> as before; 
 and therefore some think God said it in a still small voice, which 
 wrought more upon Job than the whirlwind did, as upon Elijah,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:12,13">1 Kings xix. 12, 13</A>.

 <I>My doctrine shall drop as the rain,</I> and then it does wonders.
 Though Job had not spoken any thing, yet God is said to answer him; for 
 he knows men's thoughts, and can return a suitable answer to their 
 silence. Here, 

 1. God puts a convincing question to him: "<I>Shall he that contendeth
 with the Almighty instruct him?</I> Shall he pretend to dictate to 
 God's wisdom or prescribe to his will? Shall God receive instruction 
 from every peevish complainer, and change the measures he has taken to 
 please him?" It is a question with disdain. <I>Shall any teach God 
 knowledge?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:22"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 22</A>.

 It is intimated that those who quarrel with God do, in effect, go about
 to teach him how to mend his work. For if we contend with men like 
 ourselves, as not having done well, we ought to instruct them how to do 
 better; but is it a thing to be suffered that any man should teach his 
 Maker? He that contends with God is justly looked upon as his enemy; 
 and shall he pretend so far to have prevailed in the contest as to 
 prescribe to him? We are ignorant and short-sighted, but before him all 
 things are naked and open; we are depending creatures, but he is the 
 sovereign Creator; and shall we pretend to instruct him? Some read it, 
 <I>Is it any wisdom to contend with the Almighty?</I> The answer is 
 easy. No; it is the greatest folly in the world. Is it wisdom to 
 contend with him whom it will certainly be our ruin to oppose and 
 unspeakably our interest to submit to? 

 2. He demands a speedy reply to it: "<I>He that reproaches God let him 
 answer</I> this question to his own conscience, and answer it thus, 
 <I>Far be it from me to contend with the Almighty</I> or to <I>instruct 
 him.</I> Let him answer all those questions which I have put, if he 
 can. Let him answer for his presumption and insolence, answer it at 
 God's bar, to his confusion." Those have high thoughts of themselves, 
 and mean thoughts of God, who reprove any thing he says or does.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Job's humble submission thereupon. Now Job came to himself, and 
 began to melt into godly sorrow. When his friends reasoned with him he 
 did not yield; but the voice of the Lord is powerful. <I>When the 
 Spirit of truth shall come, he shall convince.</I> They had condemned 
 him for a wicked man; Elihu himself had been very sharp upon him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:7,8,37"><I>ch.</I> xxxiv. 7, 8, 37</A>);

 but God had not given him such hard words. We may sometimes have reason
 to expect better treatment from God, and a more candid construction of 
 what we do, than we meet with from our friends. This the good man is
 here overcome by, and yields himself a conquered captive to the grace 
 of God. 

 1. He owns himself an offender, and has nothing to say in his own
 justification 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Behold, I am vile,</I> not only mean and contemptible, but vile and 
 abominable, in my own eyes." He is now sensible that he has sinned, and 
 therefore calls himself <I>vile.</I> Sin debases us, and penitents 
 abase themselves, reproach themselves, are ashamed, yea, even 
 confounded. "I have acted undutifully to my Father, ungratefully to my 
 benefactor, unwisely for myself; and therefore I am vile." Job now 
 vilifies himself as much as ever he had justified and magnified 
 himself. Repentance changes men's opinion of themselves. Job had been
 too bold in demanding a conference with God, and thought he could make 
 his part good with him: but now he is convinced of his error, and owns 
 himself utterly unable to stand before God or to produce any thing 
 worth his notice, the veriest dunghill-worm that ever crawled upon 
 God's ground. While his friends talked with him, he answered them, for
 he thought himself as good as they; but, when God talked with him, he 
 had nothing to say, for, in comparison with him, he sees himself 
 nothing, less than nothing, worse than nothing, vanity and vileness 
 itself; and therefore, <I>What shall I answer thee?</I> God demanded an 
 answer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Here he gives the reason of his silence; it was not because he was 
 sullen, but because he was convinced he had been in the wrong. Those 
 that are truly sensible of their own sinfulness and vileness dare not 
 justify themselves before God, but are ashamed that ever they 
 entertained such a thought, and, in token of their shame, lay their 
 hand upon their mouth. 

 2. He promises not to offend any more as he had done; for Elihu had 
 told him that this was meet to be said unto God. When we have spoken
 amiss we must repent of it and not repeat it nor stand to it. He 
 enjoins himself silence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>I will lay my hand upon my mouth,</I> will keep that as with a 
 bridle, to suppress all passionate thoughts which may arise in my mind, 
 and keep them from breaking out in intemperate speeches." It is bad to 
 think amiss, but it is much worse to speak amiss, for that is an 
 allowance of the evil thought and gives it an <I>imprimatur--a 
 sanction;</I> it is publishing the seditious libel; and therefore, 
 <I>if thou hast thought evil, lay thy hand upon thy mouth</I> and let 
 it go no further 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:32">Prov. xxx. 32</A>)

 and that will be an evidence for thee that that which thou thoughtest 
 thou allowest not. Job had suffered his evil thoughts to vent
 themselves: "<I>Once have I spoken</I> amiss, <I>yea, twice,</I>" that 
 is, "divers times, in one discourse and in another; but I have done: 
 <I>I will not answer;</I> I will not stand to what I have said, nor say 
 it again; <I>I will proceed no further.</I>" Observe here what true 
 repentance is.

 (1.) It is to rectify our errors, and the false principles we went upon 
 in doing as we did. What we have long, and often, and vigorously 
 maintained, once, yea, twice, we must retract as soon as we are 
 convinced that it is a mistake, not adhere to it any longer, but take 
 shame to ourselves for holding it so long. 

 (2.) It is to return from every by-path and to proceed not one step 
 further in it: "<I>I will not add</I>" (so the word is); "I will never 
 indulge my passion so much again, nor give myself such a liberty of 
 speech, will never say as I have said nor do as I have done." Till it 
 comes to this, we come short of repentance. Further observe, Those who
 dispute with God will be silenced at last. Job had been very bold and
 forward in demanding a conference with God, and talked very boldly, how 
 plain he would make his case, and how sure he was that he should be 
 justified. <I>As a prince he would go near unto him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:37"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 37</A>);

 he would <I>come even to his seat</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:3"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 3</A>);

 but he has soon enough of it; he lets fall his plea and will not
 answer. "Lord, the wisdom and right are all on thy side, and I have 
 done foolishly and wickedly in questioning them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Then answered the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> unto Job out of the whirlwind, and
 said,
 &nbsp; 7  Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and
 declare thou unto me.
 &nbsp; 8  Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me,
 that thou mayest be righteous?
 &nbsp; 9  Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice
 like him?
 &nbsp; 10  Deck thyself now <I>with</I> majesty and excellency; and array
 thyself with glory and beauty.
 &nbsp; 11  Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one
 <I>that is</I> proud, and abase him.
 &nbsp; 12  Look on every one <I>that is</I> proud, <I>and</I> bring him low; and
 tread down the wicked in their place.
 &nbsp; 13  Hide them in the dust together; <I>and</I> bind their faces in
 secret.
 &nbsp; 14  Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand
 can save thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job was greatly humbled for what God had already said, but not 
 sufficiently; he was brought low, but not low enough; and therefore God 
 here proceeds to reason with him in the same manner and to the same 
 purport as before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Observe,

 1. Those who duly receive what they have heard from God, and profit by
 it, shall hear more from him. 

 2. Those who are truly convinced of sin, and penitent for it, yet have
 need to be more thoroughly convinced and to be made more deeply 
 penitent. Those who are under convictions, who have their sins set in 
 order before their eyes and their hearts broken for them, must learn 
 from this instance not to catch at comfort too soon; it will be 
 everlasting when it comes, and therefore it is necessary that we be 
 prepared for it by deep humiliation, that the wound be searched to the 
 bottom and not skinned over, and that we do not make more haste out of 
 our convictions than good speed. When our hearts begin to melt and 
 relent within us, let those considerations be dwelt upon and pursued 
 which will help to make a thorough effectual thaw of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God begins with a challenge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),
 
 as before
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:3"><I>ch.</I> xxxviii. 3</A>):

 "<I>Gird up thy loins now like a man;</I> if thou hast the courage and
 confidence thou hast pretended to, show them now; but thou wilt soon be 
 made to see and own thyself no match for me." This is that which every 
 proud heart must be brought to at last, either by its repentance or by 
 its ruin; and thus low must every mountain and hill be, sooner or 
 later, brought. We must acknowledge,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That we cannot vie with God for justice, that the Lord is righteous 
 and holy in his dealings with us, but that we are unrighteous and 
 unholy in our conduct towards him; we have a great deal to blame 
 ourselves for, but nothing to blame him for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Wilt thou disannul my judgment?</I> Wilt thou take exceptions to 
 what I say and do, and bring a writ of error, to reverse the judgment I 
 have given as erroneous and unjust?" Many of Job's complaints had too 
 much of a tendency this way: <I>I cry out of wrong,</I> says he, <I>but 
 I am not heard;</I> but such language as this is by no means to be 
 suffered. God's judgment cannot, must not, be disannulled, for we are
 sure it is according to truth, and therefore it is a great piece of 
 impudence and iniquity in us to call in question. "<I>Wilt thou,</I>" 
 says God, "<I>condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?</I> Must my 
 honour suffer for the support of thy reputation? Must I be charged as 
 dealing unjustly with thee because thou canst not otherwise clear 
 thyself from the censures thou liest under?" Our duty is to condemn 
 ourselves, that God may be righteous. David is <I>therefore</I> ready 
 to own the evil he has done in God's sight, that <I>God may be 
 justified when he speaks and clear when he judges,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:4">Ps. li. 4</A>.
 
 See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:33,Da+9:7">Neh. ix. 33; Dan. ix. 7</A>.

 But those are very proud, and very ignorant both of God and themselves,
 who, to clear themselves, will condemn God; and the day is coming when, 
 if the mistake be not rectified in time by repentance, the eternal 
 judgment will be both the confutation of the plea and the confusion of 
 the prisoner, for the heavens shall declare God's righteousness and all 
 the world shall become guilty before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That we cannot vie with God for power; and therefore, as it is 
 great impiety, so it is great impudence to contest with him, and is as 
 much against our interest as it is against reason and justice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 "<I>Hast thou an arm like God,</I> equal to his in length and strength? 
 <I>Or canst thou thunder with a voice like him,</I> as he did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:1,2"><I>ch.</I> xxxvii. 1, 2</A>),

 or does now out of the whirlwind?" To convince Job that he was not so
 able as he thought himself to contest with God, he shows him, 

 1. That he could never fight it out with him, nor carry his cause by
 force of arms. Sometimes, among men, controversies have been decided by 
 battle, and the victorious champion is adjudged to have justice on his 
 side; but, if the controversy were put upon that issue between God and 
 man, man would certainly go by the worse, for all the forces he could 
 raise against the Almighty would be but like briers and thorns before a 
 consuming fire, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4">Isa. xxvii. 4</A>.

 "Hast thou, a poor weak worm of the earth, an arm comparable to his who
 upholds all things?" The power of creatures, even of angels themselves, 
 is derived from God, limited by him, and dependent on him; but the 
 power of God is original, independent, and unlimited. He can do every 
 thing without us; we can do nothing without him; and therefore we have 
 not an arm like God.

 2. That he could never talk it out with him, nor carry his cause by 
 noise and big words, which sometimes among men go a great way towards 
 the gaining of a point: "<I>Canst thou thunder with a voice like 
 him?</I> No; his voice will soon drown thine and one of his thunders 
 will overpower and overrule all thy whispers." Man cannot speak so 
 convincingly, so powerfully, nor with such a commanding conquering 
 force as God can, who <I>speaks, and it is done.</I> His creating voice
 is called his <I>thunder</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:7">Ps. civ. 7</A>),

 so is that voice of his with which he terrifies and discomfits his
 enemies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:10">1 Sam. ii. 10</A>.

 The wrath of a king may sometimes be like the roaring of a lion, but
 can never pretend to imitate God's thunder.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That we cannot vie with God for beauty and majesty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 "If thou wilt enter into a comparison with him, and appear more 
 amiable, put on thy best attire: <I>Deck thyself now with majesty and 
 excellency.</I> Appear in all the martial pomp, in all the royal 
 pageantry that thou hast; make the best of every thing that will set 
 thee off: <I>Array thyself with glory and beauty,</I> such as may awe 
 thy enemies and charm thy friends; but what is it all to the divine 
 majesty and beauty? No more than the light of a glow-worm to that of 
 the sun when he goes forth in his strength." God decks himself with 
 such majesty and glory as are the terror of devils and all the powers 
 of darkness and make them tremble; he arrays himself with such glory 
 and beauty as are the wonder of angels and all the saints in light and 
 make them rejoice. David could dwell all his days in God's house, to 
 behold the beauty of the Lord. But, in comparison with this, what is 
 all the majesty and excellency by which princes think to make 
 themselves feared, and all the glory and beauty by which lovers think 
 to make themselves beloved? If Job think, in contending with God, to 
 carry the day by looking great and making a figure, he is quite 
 mistaken. <I>The sun shall be ashamed, and the moon confounded, when 
 God shines forth.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That we cannot vie with God for dominion over the proud,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:11-14"><I>v.</I> 11-14</A>.

 Here the cause is put upon this short issue: if Job can humble and
 abase proud tyrants and oppressors as easily and effectually as God 
 can, it shall be acknowledged that he has some colour to compete with 
 God. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The justice Job is here challenged to do, and that is to bring the 
 proud low with a look. If Job will pretend to be a rival with God, 
 especially if he pretend to be a judge of his actions, he must be able 
 to do this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) It is here supposed that God can do it and will do it himself, 
 else he would not have put it thus upon Job. By this God proves himself 
 to be God, that he resists the proud, sits Judge upon them, and is able 
 to bring them to ruin. Observe here, 

 [1.] That proud people are wicked people, and pride is at the bottom of 
 a great deal of the wickedness that is in this world both towards God 
 and man. 

 [2.] Proud people will certainly be abased and brought low; for 
 <I>pride goes before destruction.</I> If they bend not, they will 
 break; if they humble not themselves by true repentance, God will 
 humble them, to their everlasting confusion. The wicked will be 
 <I>trodden down in their place,</I> that is, Wherever they are found, 
 though they pretend to have a place of their own, and to have taken 
 root in it, yet even there they shall be trodden down, and all the 
 wealth, and power, and interest, to which their place entitles them, 
 will not be their security. 

 [3.] The wrath of God, scattered among the proud, will humble them, and 
 break them, and bring them down. If he casts abroad the rage of his 
 wrath, as he will do at the great day and sometimes does in this life, 
 the stoutest heart cannot hold out against him. <I>Who knows the power 
 of his anger?</I> 

 [4.] God can and does easily abase proud tyrants; he can <I>look upon 
 them, and bring them low,</I> can overwhelm them with shame, and fear, 
 and utter ruin, by one angry look, as he can, by a gracious look, 
 revive the hearts of the contrite ones.

 [5.] He can and will at last do it effectually 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 not only bring them to the dust, from which they might hope to arise, 
 but <I>hide them in the dust,</I> like the proud Egyptian whom Moses 
 slew and <I>hid in the sand</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+2:12">Exod. ii. 12</A>),

 that is, they shall be brought not only to death, but to the grave,
 that pit out of which there is no return. They were proud of the figure 
 they made, but they shall be buried in oblivion and be no more 
 remembered than those that are hidden in the dust, out of sight and out 
 of mind. They were linked in leagues and confederacies to do mischief, 
 and are now bound in bundles. They are hidden <I>together;</I> not 
 their rest, but their shame together <I>is in the dust,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+17:16"><I>ch.</I> xvii. 16</A>.

 Nay, they are treated as malefactors (who, when condemned, had their
 faces covered, as Haman's was: He <I>binds their faces in secret</I>) 
 or as dead men: Lazarus, in the grave, had his face bound about. Thus 
 complete will be the victory that God will gain, at last, over proud 
 sinners that set themselves in opposition to him. Now by this he proves 
 himself to be God. Does he thus hate proud men? Then he is holy. Will 
 he thus punish them? Then he is the just Judge of the world. Can he 
 thus humble them? Then he is the Lord Almighty. When he had abased 
 proud Pharaoh, and hidden him in the sand of the Red Sea, Jethro thence 
 inferred that doubtless <I>the Lord is greater than all gods, for 
 wherein the proud</I> enemies of his <I>Israel dealt proudly he was 
 above them,</I> he was too hard for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+18:11">Exod. xviii. 11</A>.

 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:1,2">Rev. xix. 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) It is here proposed to Job to do it. He had been passionately 
 quarrelling with God and his providence, casting abroad the rage of his 
 wrath towards heaven, as if he thought thereby to bring God himself to 
 his mind. "Come," says God, "try thy hand first upon proud men, and 
 thou wilt soon see how little they value the rage of thy wrath; and 
 shall I then regard it, or be moved by it?" Job had complained of the 
 prosperity and power of tyrants and oppressors, and was ready to charge 
 God with mal-administration for suffering it; but he ought not to find 
 fault, except he could mend. If God, and he only, has power enough to 
 humble and bring down proud men, no doubt he has wisdom enough to know 
 when and how to do it, and it is not for us to prescribe to him or to 
 teach him how to prescribe to him or to teach him how to govern the 
 world. Unless we had an arm like God we must not think to take his work 
 out of his hands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The justice which is here promised to be done him if he can perform 
 such mighty works as these 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>They will I also confess unto thee that thy right hand</I> is 
 sufficient to save thee, though, after all, it would be too weak to 
 contend with me." It is the innate pride and ambition of man that he 
 would be his own saviour (would have his own hands sufficient for him 
 and be independent), but it is presumption to pretend that he is. Our 
 own hands cannot save us by recommending us to God's grace, much less 
 by rescuing us from his justice. Unless we could by our own power 
 humble our enemies, we cannot pretend by our own power to save 
 ourselves; but, if we could, God himself would confess it. He never did 
 nor ever will defraud any man of his just praise, nor deny him the 
 honour he has merited. But, since we cannot do this, we must confess 
 unto him that our own hands cannot save us, and therefore into his hand 
 we must commit ourselves.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass
 as an ox.
 &nbsp; 16  Lo now, his strength <I>is</I> in his loins, and his force <I>is</I>
 in the navel of his belly.
 &nbsp; 17  He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones

 like bars of iron.

 make his sword to approach <I>unto him.</I>
 &nbsp; 20  Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the
 beasts of the field play.
 &nbsp; 21  He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed,

 &nbsp; 22  The shady trees cover him <I>with</I> their shadow; the willows
 of the brook compass him about.
 &nbsp; 23  Behold, he drinketh up a river, <I>and</I> hasteth not: he
 trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
 &nbsp; 24  He taketh it with his eyes: <I>his</I> nose pierceth through
 snares.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God, for the further proving of his own power and disproving of Job's 
 pretensions, concludes his discourse with the description of two vast 
 and mighty animals, far exceeding man in bulk and strength, one he 
 calls <I>behemoth,</I> the other <I>leviathan.</I> In these verses we 
 have the former described. "<I>Behold now behemoth,</I> and consider 
 whether thou art able to contend with him who made that beast and gave 
 him all the power he has, and whether it is not thy wisdom rather to 
 submit to him and make thy peace with him." <I>Behemoth</I> signifies 
 <I>beasts</I> in general, but must here be meant of some one particular 
 species. Some understand it of the <I>bull;</I> others of an amphibious 
 animal, well known (they say) in Egypt, called the <I>river-horse 
 (hippopotamus</I>), living among the fish in the river Nile, but coming
 out to feed upon the earth. But I confess I see no reason to depart 
 from the ancient and most generally received opinion, that it is the 
 elephant that is here described, which is a very strong stately 
 creature, of very large stature above any other, of wonderful sagacity, 
 and of so great a reputation in the animal kingdom that among so many 
 four-footed beasts as we have had the natural history of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:1-39:30"><I>ch.</I> xxxviii. and xxxix.</A>)

 we can scarcely suppose this should be omitted. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The description here given of the behemoth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His body is very strong and well built. <I>His strength is in his 
 loins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 <I>His bones,</I> compared with those of other creatures, <I>are like 
 bars of iron,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 His back-bone is so strong that, though his tail be not large, yet he 
 moves it like a cedar, with a commanding force, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 Some understand it of the trunk of the elephant, for the word signifies 
 any extreme part, and in that there is indeed a wonderful strength. So 
 strong is the elephant in his back and loins, and the sinews of his 
 thighs, that he will carry a large wooden tower, and a great number of 
 fighting men in it. No animal whatsoever comes near the elephant for 
 strength of body, which is the main thing insisted on in this 
 description.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He feeds on the productions of the earth and does not prey upon 
 other animals: He <I>eats grass as an ox</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 the <I>mountains bring him forth food</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 and the beasts of the field do not tremble before him nor flee from 
 him, as from a lion, but they play about him, knowing they are in no 
 danger from him. This may give us occasion,

 (1.) To acknowledge the goodness of God in ordering it so that a 
 creature of such bulk, which requires so much food, should not feed 
 upon flesh (for then multitudes must die to keep him alive), but should 
 be content with the grass of the field, to prevent such destruction of 
 lives as otherwise must have ensued. 

 (2.) To commend living upon herbs and fruits without flesh, according 
 to the original appointment of man's food, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:29">Gen. i. 29</A>.

 Even the strength of an elephant, as of a horse and an ox, may be
 supported without flesh; and why not that of a man? Though therefore
 we use the liberty God has allowed us, yet <I>be not among riotous 
 eaters of flesh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:20">Prov. xxiii. 20</A>.

 (3.) To commend a quiet and peaceable life. Who would not rather, like 
 the elephant, have his neighbours easy and pleasant about him, than, 
 like the lion, have them all afraid of him?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He <I>lodges under the shady trees</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 which <I>cover him with their shadow</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 where he has a free and open air to breathe in, while lions, which live 
 by prey, when they would repose themselves, are obliged to retire into 
 a close and dark den, to live therein, and to abide in the covert of 
 that,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:40"><I>ch.</I> xxxviii. 40</A>.

 Those who are a terror to others cannot but be sometimes a terror to
 themselves too; but those will be easy who will let others be easy 
 about them; and the reed and fens, and the willows of the brook, though 
 a very weak and slender fortification, yet are sufficient for the 
 defence and security of those who <I>therefore</I> dread no harm, 
 because they design none.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That he is a very great and greedy drinker, not of wine or strong 
 drink (to be greedy of that is peculiar to man, who by his drunkenness 
 makes a beast of himself), but of fair water. 

 (1.) His size is prodigious, and therefore he must have supply 
 accordingly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 He drinks so much that one would think he could drink up a river, if 
 you would give him time, and not hasten him. Or, when he drinks, <I>he 
 hasteth not,</I> as those do that drink in fear; he is confident of his 
 own strength and safety, and therefore makes no haste when he drinks, 
 no more haste than good speed.

 (2.) His eye anticipates more than he can take; for, when he is very 
 thirsty, having been long kept without water, <I>he trusts that he can 
 drink up Jordan in his mouth,</I> and even <I>takes it with his 
 eyes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 As a covetous man causes his eyes to fly upon the wealth of this world, 
 which he is greedy of, so this great beast is said to snatch, or draw 
 up, even a river with his eyes.

 (3.) His nose has in it strength enough for both; for, when he goes 
 greedily to drink with it, he <I>pierces through snares</I> or nets, 
 which perhaps are laid in the waters to catch fish. He makes nothing of 
 the difficulties that lie in his way, so great is his strength and so 
 eager his appetite.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The use that is to be made of this description. We have taken a 
 view of this mountain of a beast, this over-grown animal, which is here 
 set before us, not merely as a show (as sometimes it is in our country) 
 to satisfy our curiosity and to amuse us, but as an argument with us to 
 humble ourselves before the great God; for, 

 1. He made this vast animal, which is so fearfully and wonderfully
 made; it is the work of his hands, the contrivance of his wisdom, the 
 production of his power; it is <I>behemoth which I made,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.
 
 Whatever strength this, or any other creature, has, it is derived from 
 God, who therefore must be acknowledged to have all power originally 
 and infinitely in himself, and such an arm as it is not for us to 
 contest with. This beast is here called <I>the chief,</I> in its kind, 
 <I>of the ways of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 an eminent instance of the Creator's power and wisdom. Those that will 
 peruse the accounts given by historians of the elephant will find that 
 his capacities approach nearer to those of reason than the capacities 
 of any other brute-creature whatsoever, and therefore he is fitly 
 called <I>the chief of the ways of God,</I> in the inferior part of the 
 creation, no creature below man being preferable to him.

 2. He made him with man, as he made other four-footed beasts, on the 
 same day with man 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:25,26">Gen. i. 25, 26</A>),

 whereas the fish and fowl were made the day before; he made him to live
 and move on the same earth, in the same element, and therefore man and
 beast are said to be jointly preserved by divine Providence as
 fellow-commoners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:6">Ps. xxxvi. 6</A>.

 "It is <I>behemoth, which I made with thee;</I> I made that beast as
 well as thee, and he does not quarrel with me; why then dost thou? Why 
 shouldst thou demand peculiar favours because I made thee

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:9"><I>ch.</I> x. 9</A>),

 when I made the <I>behemoth</I> likewise with thee? I made thee as well
 as that beast, and therefore can as easily manage thee at pleasure as 
 that beast, and will do it whether thou refuse or whether thou choose. 
 I made him with thee, that thou mayest look upon him and receive 
 instruction." We need not go far for proofs and instances of God's 
 almighty power and sovereign dominion; they are near us, they are with 
 us, they are under our eye wherever we are. 

 3. <I>He that made him can make his sword to approach to him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 that is, the same hand that made him, notwithstanding his great bulk 
 and strength, can unmake him again at pleasure and kill an elephant as 
 easily as a worm or a fly, without any difficulty, and without the 
 imputation either of waste or wrong. God that gave to all the creatures 
 their being may take away the being he gave; for may he not do what he 
 will with his own? And he <I>can</I> do it; he that has power to create 
 with a word no doubt has power to destroy with a word, and can as 
 easily speak the creature into nothing as at first he spoke it out of 
 nothing. The <I>behemoth</I> perhaps is here intended (as well as the 
 <I>leviathan</I> afterwards) to represent those proud tyrants and 
 oppressors whom God had just now challenged Job to abase and bring 
 down. They think themselves as well fortified against the judgments of 
 God as the elephant with his bones of brass and iron; but he that made 
 the soul of man knows all the avenues to it, and can make the sword of 
 justice, his wrath, to approach to it, and touch it in the most tender 
 and sensible part. He that framed the engine, and put the parts of it 
 together, knows how to take it in pieces. Woe to him therefore that 
 strives with his Maker, for he that made him has therefore power to 
 make him miserable, and will not make him happy unless he will be ruled 
 by him.</P>
