 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter begins Job's reply to Eliphaz. In this reply he takes no 
 notice of his friends, either because he saw it was to no purpose or 
 because he liked the good counsel Eliphaz gave him in the close of his 
 discourse so well that he would make no answer to the peevish 
 reflections he began with; but he appeals to God, begs to have his 
 cause heard, and doubts not but to make it good, having the testimony 
 of his own conscience concerning his integrity. Here seems to be a 
 struggle between flesh and spirit, fear and faith, throughout this 
 chapter. 

 I. He complains of his calamitous condition, and especially of God's
 withdrawings from him, so that he could not get his appeal heard 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:2-5">ver. 2-5</A>),

 nor discern the meaning of God's dealings with him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>),

 nor gain any hope of relief,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.

 This made deep impressions of trouble and terror upon him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>.

 But,

 II. In the midst of these complaints he comforts himself with the
 assurance of God's clemency 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>),

 and his own integrity, which God himself was a witness to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:10-12">ver. 10-12</A>.

 Thus was the light of his day like that spoken of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:6,7">Zech. xiv. 6, 7</A>,

 neither perfectly clear nor perfectly dark, but "at evening time it was
 light."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then Job answered and said,
 &nbsp; 2  Even to day <I>is</I> my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier
 than my groaning.
 &nbsp; 3  Oh that I knew where I might find him! <I>that</I> I might come
 <I>even</I> to his seat!
 &nbsp; 4  I would order <I>my</I> cause before him, and fill my mouth with
 arguments.
 &nbsp; 5  I would know the words <I>which</I> he would answer me, and
 understand what he would say unto me.
 &nbsp; 6  Will he plead against me with <I>his</I> great power? No; but he
 would put <I>strength</I> in me.
 &nbsp; 7  There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be
 delivered for ever from my judge.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job is confident that he has wrong done him by his friends, and
 therefore, ill as he is, he will not give up the cause, nor let them
 have the last word.  Here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He justifies his own resentments of his trouble

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Even to day,</I> I own, <I>my complaint is bitter;</I> for the
 affliction, the cause of the complaint, is so. There are <I>wormwood 
 and gall in the affliction and misery; my soul has them still in 
 remembrance</I> and is embittered by them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:19,20">Lam. iii. 19, 20</A>.

 <I>Even to day is my complaint</I> counted <I>rebellion</I> (so some
 read it); his friends construed the innocent expressions of his grief 
 into reflections upon God and his providence, and called them 
 <I>rebellion.</I> "But," says he, "I do not complain more than there is 
 cause; <I>for my stroke is heavier than my groaning.</I> Even today, 
 after all you have said to convince and comfort me, still the pains of 
 my body and the wounds of my spirit are such that I have reason enough 
 for my complaints, if they were more bitter than they are." We wrong 
 God if our groaning be heavier than our stroke, like froward children, 
 who, when they cry for nothing, have justly something given them to cry 
 for; but we do not wrong ourselves though our stroke be heavier than 
 our groaning, for little said is soon amended.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He appeals from the censures of his friends to the just judgment of 
 God; and this he thought was an evidence for him that he was not a 
 hypocrite, for then he durst not have made such an appeal as this. St 
 Paul comforted himself in this, that <I>he that judged him was the 
 Lord,</I> and therefore he valued not man's judgment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:3,4">1 Cor. iv. 3, 4</A>),

 but he was willing to wait till the appointed day of decision came;
 whereas Job is impatient, and passionately wishes to have the 
 judgment-day anticipated, and to have his cause tried quickly, as it 
 were, by a special commission. The apostle found it necessary to press 
 it much upon suffering Christians patiently to expect the Judge's 
 coming, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:7-9">Jam. v. 7-9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He is so sure of the equity of God's tribunal that he longs to 
 appear before it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>O that I knew where I might find him!</I> This may properly express
 the pious breathings of a soul convinced that it has by sin lost God 
 and is undone for ever if it recover not its interest in his favour. "O 
 that I knew how I might recover his favour!  How I might come into his 
 covenant and communion with him!" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:6,7">Mic. vi. 6, 7</A>.

 It is the cry of a poor deserted soul. "<I>Saw you him whom my soul
 loveth? O that I knew where I might find him!</I> O that he who has 
 laid open the way to himself would direct me into it and lead me in 
 it!" But Job here seems to complain too boldly that his friends wronged 
 him and he knew not which way to apply himself to God to have justice 
 done him, else he would go even to his seat, to demand it. A patient 
 waiting for death and judgment is our wisdom and duty, and, if we duly 
 consider things, that cannot be without a holy fear and trembling; but 
 a passionate wishing for death or judgment, without any such fear and 
 trembling, is our sin and folly, and ill becomes us. Do we know what 
 death and judgment are, and are we so very ready for them, that we need 
 not time to get readier? <I>Woe to those that</I> thus, in a heat, 
 <I>desire the day of the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:18">Amos v. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He is so sure of the goodness of his own cause that he longs to be 
 opening it at God's bar 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>I would order my cause before him,</I> and set it in a true light.
 I would produce the evidences of my sincerity in a proper method, and 
 would <I>fill my mouth with arguments</I> to prove it." We may apply 
 this to the duty of prayer, in which we have <I>boldness to enter into 
 the holiest</I> and to come even to the footstool of the throne of 
 grace. We have not only liberty of access, but liberty of speech. We 
 have leave,

 (1.) To be particular in our requests, <I>to order our cause before
 God,</I> to speak the whole matter, to lay before him all our 
 grievances, in what method we think most proper; we durst not be so 
 free with earthly princes as a humble holy soul may be with God.

 (2.) To be importunate in our requests. We are allowed, not only to
 pray, but to plead, not only to ask, but to argue; nay, to <I>fill our 
 mouths with arguments,</I> not to move God (he is perfectly apprized of 
 the merits of the cause without our showing), but to move ourselves, to 
 excite our fervency and encourage our faith in prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He is so sure of a sentence in favour of him that he even longed to 
 hear it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>I would know the words which he would answer me,</I>" that is, "I
 would gladly hear what God will say to this matter in dispute between 
 you and me, and will entirely acquiesce in his judgment." This becomes 
 us, in all controversies; let the word of God determine them; let us 
 know what he answers, and understand what he says. Job knew well enough 
 what his friends would answer him; they would condemn him, and run him 
 down. "But" (says he) "<I>I would</I> fain <I>know what God would 
 answer me;</I> for I am sure his judgment is according to truth, which 
 theirs is not. I cannot understand them; they talk so little to the 
 purpose. But what he says I should understand and therefore be fully 
 satisfied in."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He comforts himself with the hope that God would deal favourably 
 with him in this matter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 Note, It is of great use to us, in every thing wherein we have to do
 with God, to keep up good thoughts of him. He believes,

 1. That God would not overpower him, that he would not deal with him 
 either by absolute sovereignty or in strict justice, not with a high 
 hand, nor with a strong hand: <I>Will he plead against me with his 
 great power?</I> No. Job's friends pleaded against him with all the 
 power they had; but will God do so? No; his power is all just and holy, 
 whatever men's is. Against those that are obstinate in their unbelief 
 and impenitency God will <I>plead with his great power;</I> their 
 destruction will come <I>from the glory of his power.</I> But with his 
 own people, that love him and trust in him, he will deal in tender 
 compassion. 

 2. That, on the contrary, he would empower him to plead his own cause
 before God: "<I>He would put strength in me,</I> to support me and bear 
 me up, in maintaining my integrity." Note, The same power that is 
 engaged against proud sinners is engaged for humble saints, who prevail 
 with God by strength derived from him, as Jacob did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:3">Hos. xii. 3</A>.

 See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:35">Ps. lxviii. 35</A>.

 3. That the issue would certainly be comfortable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:7"><I>v.</I>  7</A>.

 There, in the court of heaven, when the final sentence is to be given,
 <I>the righteous might dispute with him</I> and come off in his 
 righteousness.  Now, even the upright are often <I>chastened of the 
 Lord,</I> and they cannot dispute against it; integrity itself is no 
 fence either against calamity or calumny; but in that day <I>they shall 
 not be condemned with the world,</I> though God may afflict by 
 prerogative. <I>Then you shall discern between the righteous and the 
 wicked</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+3:18">Mal. iii. 18</A>),

 so vast will be the difference between them in their everlasting state;
 whereas now we can scarcely distinguish them, so little is the 
 difference between them as to their outward condition, for all things 
 come alike to all. Then, when the final doom is given, <I>"I shall be 
 delivered for ever from my Judge,</I>" that is, "I shall be saved from 
 the unjust censures of my friends and from that divine sentence which 
 is now so much a terror to me." Those that are delivered up to God as 
 their owner and ruler shall be for ever delivered from him as their 
 judge and avenger; and there is no flying from his justice but by 
 flying to his mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Job complains that he cannot understand the meaning of God's 
 providences concerning him, but is quite at a loss about them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>):

 <I>I go forward, but he is not there,</I> &c. Eliphaz had bid him
 acquaint himself with God. "So I would, with all my heart," says Job, 
 "If I knew how to get acquainted with him." He had himself a great 
 desire to appear before God, and get a hearing of his case, but the 
 Judge was not to be found. Look which way he would, he could see no 
 sign of God's appearing for him to clear up his innocency. Job, no 
 doubt, believed that God is every where present; but three things he 
 seems to complain of here:--

 1. That he could not fix his thoughts, nor form any clear judgment of 
 things in his own mind. His mind was so hurried and discomposed with 
 his troubles that he was like a man in a fright, or at his wits' end, 
 who runs this way and that way, but, being in confusion, brings nothing 
 to a head. By reason of the disorder and tumult his spirit was in he 
 could not fasten upon that which he knew to be in God, and which, if he 
 could but have mixed faith with it and dwelt upon it in his thoughts, 
 would have been a support to him. It is the common complaint of those 
 who are sick or melancholy that, when they would think of that which is 
 good, they can make nothing of it. 

 2.  That he could not find out the cause of his troubles, nor the sin
 which provoked God to contend with him. He took a view of his whole 
 conversation, turned to every side of it, and could not perceive 
 wherein he had sinned more than others, for which he should thus be 
 punished more than others; nor could he discern what other end God 
 should aim at in afflicting him thus. 

 3. That he could not foresee what would be in the end hereof, whether
 God would deliver him at all, nor, if he did, when or which way. He saw 
 not his signs, nor was there any to tell him how long; as the church 
 complains, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:9">Ps. lxxiv. 9</A>.

 He was quite at a loss to know what God designed to do with him; and,
 whatever conjecture he advanced, still something or other appeared 
 against it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He satisfies himself with this, that God himself was a witness to 
 his integrity, and therefore did not doubt but the issue would be 
 good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. After Job had almost lost himself in the labyrinth of the divine 
 counsels, how contentedly does he sit down, at length, with this 
 thought: "Though <I>I</I> know not the way that he takes (for <I>his 
 way is in the sea and his path in the great waters,</I> his thoughts 
 and ways are infinitely above ours and it would be presumption in us to 
 pretend to judge of them), yet <I>he knows the way that I take,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 That is,

 (1.) He is acquainted with it. His friends judged of that which they
 did not know, and therefore charged him with that which he was never 
 guilty of; but God, who knew every step he had taken, would not do so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:3">Ps. cxxxix. 3</A>.

 Note, It is a great comfort to those who mean honestly that God
 understands their meaning, though men do not, cannot, or will not.

 (2.) He approves of it: "He knows that, however I may sometimes have
 <I>taken a false step,</I> yet I have still <I>taken a good way,</I> 
 have <I>chosen the way of truth,</I> and therefore he knows it," that 
 is, he accepts it, and is well pleased with it, as he is said to 
 <I>know the way of the righteous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:6">Ps. i. 6</A>.

 This comforted the prophet,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:3">Jer. xii. 3</A>.

 <I>Thou hast tried my heart towards thee.</I> From this Job infers,
 <I>When he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold.</I> Those that 
 <I>keep the way of the Lord</I> may comfort themselves, when they are 
 in affliction, with these three things:--

 [1.] That they are but tried. It is not intended for their hurt, but 
 for their honour and benefit; <I>it is the trial of their faith,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:7">1 Pet. i. 7</A>.

 [2.] That, when they are sufficiently tried, they shall come forth out
 of the furnace, and not be left to consume in it as dross or reprobate 
 silver. The trial will have an end. <I>God will not contend for 
 ever.</I> 

 [3.] That they shall come forth as gold, pure in itself and precious to
 the refiner. They shall come forth as gold approved and improved, found 
 to be good and made to be better.  Afflictions are to us as we are; 
 those that go gold into the furnace will come out no worse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Now that which encouraged Job to hope that his present troubles 
 would thus end well was the testimony of his conscience for him, that 
 he had lived a good life in the fear of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That God's way was the way he walked in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>My foot hath held his steps,</I>" that is, "held to them, adhered
 closely to them; the steps he takes. I have endeavoured to conform 
 myself to his example." Good people are followers of God.  Or, "I have 
 accommodated myself to his providence, and endeavoured to answer all 
 the intentions of that, to follow Providence step by step." Or, "His 
 steps are the steps he has appointed me to take; the way of religion 
 and serious godliness--that way I have kept, and have not declined from 
 it, not only not turned back from it by a total apostasy, but not 
 turned aside out of it by any wilful transgression." His holding God's 
 steps, and keeping his way, intimate that the tempter had used all his 
 arts by fraud and force to draw him aside; but, with care and 
 resolution, he had by the grace of God hitherto persevered, and those 
 that will do so must hold and keep, hold with resolution and keep with 
 watchfulness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That God's word was the rule he walked by, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He governed himself by <I>the commandment of God's lips,</I> and would
 not go back from that, but go forward according to it. Whatever 
 difficulties we may meet with in the way of God's commandments, though 
 they lead us through a wilderness, yet we must never think of going 
 back, but must press on towards the mark. Job kept closely to the law 
 of God in his conversation, for both his judgment and his affection led 
 him to it: <I>I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my 
 necessary food;</I> that is, he looked upon it as his necessary food; 
 he could as well have lived without his daily bread as without the word 
 of God.  <I>I have laid it up</I> (so the word is), as those that lay 
 up provision for a siege, or as Joseph laid up corn before the famine.  
 Eliphaz had told him to <I>lay up God's words in his heart,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:22"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 22</A>.

 "I do," says he, "and always did, <I>that I might not sin against
 him,</I> and that, like the good householder, I might bring forth for 
 the good of others." Note, The word of God is to our souls what our 
 necessary food is to our bodies; it sustains the spiritual life and 
 strengthens us for the actions of life; it is that which we cannot 
 subsist without, and which nothing else can make up the want of: and we 
 ought therefore so to esteem it, to take pains for it, hunger after it, 
 feed upon it with delight, and nourish our souls with it; and this will 
 be our rejoicing in the day of evil, as it was Job's here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some make Job to complain here that God dealt unjustly and unfairly 
 with him in proceeding to punish him without the least relenting or 
 relaxation, though he had such incontestable evidences to produce of 
 his innocency. I am loth to think holy Job would charge the holy God 
 with iniquity; but his complaint is indeed bitter and peevish, and he 
 reasons himself into a sort of <I>patience per force,</I> which he 
 cannot do without reflecting upon God as dealing hardly with him, but 
 he must bear it because he cannot help it; the worst he says is that 
 God deals unaccountably with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He lays down good truths, and truths which were capable of a good 
 improvement, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 1. That God's counsels are immutable: <I>He is in one mind, and who can 
 turn him? He is one</I> (so some read it) or <I>in one;</I> he has no 
 counsellors by whose interest he might be prevailed with to alter his 
 purpose: he has no counsellors by whose interest he might be prevailed 
 with to alter his purpose: he is one with himself, and never alters his 
 mind, never alters his measures.  Prayer has prevailed to change God's 
 way and his providence, but never was his will or purpose changed; for 
 <I>known unto God are all his works.</I> 

 2. That his power is irresistible: <I>What his soul desires</I> or
 designs <I>even that he does,</I> and nothing can stand in his way or 
 put him upon new counsels. Men desire many things which they may not 
 do, or cannot do, or dare not do. But God has an incontestable 
 sovereignty; his will is so perfectly pure and right that it is highly 
 fit he should pursue all its determinations.  And he has an 
 uncontrollable power. <I>None can stay his hand. Whatever the Lord 
 pleased that did he</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:6">Ps. cxxxv. 6</A>),

 and always will, for it is always best.

 3. That all he does is according to the counsel of his will

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>He performs the thing that is appointed for me.</I> Whatever happens
 to us, it is God that performs it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:2">Ps. lvii. 2</A>),

 and an admirable performance the whole will appear to be when the
 mystery of God shall be finished. He performs all that, and that only, 
 which was appointed, and in the appointed time and method. This may 
 silence us, for what is appointed cannot be altered. But to consider 
 that, when God was appointing us to eternal life and glory as our end, 
 he was appointing to this condition, this affliction, whatever it is, 
 in our way, this may do more than silence us, it may satisfy us that it 
 is all for the best; though what he does we know not now, yet we shall 
 know hereafter.  

 4. That all he does is according to the custom of his providence:
 <I>Many such things are with him,</I> that is, He does many things in 
 the course of his providence which we can give no account of, but must 
 resolve into his absolute sovereignty. Whatever trouble we are in 
 others have been in the like. Our case is not singular; the same 
 <I>afflictions are accomplished in our brethren,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+5:9">1 Pet. v. 9</A>.

 Are we sick or sore, impoverished and stripped? Are our children
 removed by death or our friends unkind? This is what <I>God has 
 appointed for us, and many such things are with him. Shall the earth be 
 forsaken for us?</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He makes but a bad use of these good truths. Had he duly considered 
 them, he might have said, "Therefore am I easy and pleased, and well 
 reconciled to the way of my God concerning me; therefore will I rejoice 
 in hope that my troubles will issue well at last." But he said, 
 <I>Therefore am I troubled at his presence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Those are indeed of troubled spirits who are troubled at the presence
 of God, as the psalmist, who <I>remembered God and was troubled,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:3">Ps. lxxvii. 3</A>.

 See what confusion poor Job was now in, for he contradicted himself:
 just now he was troubled for God's absence

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>);

 now he is troubled at his presence. <I>When I consider, I am afraid of
 him.</I> What he now felt made him fear worse. There is indeed that 
 which, if we consider it, will show that we have cause to be afraid of 
 God--his infinite justice and purity, compared with our own sinfulness 
 and vileness; but if, withal, we consider his grace in a Redeemer, and 
 our compliance with that grace, our fears will vanish and we shall see 
 cause to hope in him. See what impressions were made upon him by the 
 wounds of his spirit. 
 
 1. He was very fearful

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>The Almighty troubled him,</I> and so <I>made his heart soft,</I>
 that is, utterly unable to bear any thing, and afraid of every thing 
 that stirred. There is a gracious softness, like that of Josiah, whose 
 heart was tender, and trembled at the word of God; but this is meant of 
 a grievous softness which apprehends every thing that is present to be 
 pressing and every thing future to be threatening. 

 2. He was very fretful, peevish indeed, for he quarrels with God,

 (1.) Because he did not die before his troubles, that he might never 
 have seen them (<I>Because I was not cut off before the darkness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 and yet if, in the height of his prosperity, he had received a summons
 to the grave, he would have thought it hard. This may help to reconcile 
 us to death, whenever it comes, that we do not know what evil we may be 
 taken away from. But when trouble comes it is folly to wish we had not 
 lived to see it and it is better to make the best of it.

 (2.) Because he was left to live so long in his troubles, and the 
 darkness was not covered from his face by his being hidden in the 
 grave. We should bear the darkness better than thus if we would but 
 remember that to the upright there sometimes arises a marvellous light 
 in the darkness; however, there is reserved for them a more marvellous 
 light after it.</P>
