 The scope of this chapter is much the same with that of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+2:1-22"><I>ch.</I> ii</A>.

 To write the same things, in other words, ought not to be grievous, for
 it is safe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:1">Phil. iii. 1</A>.
 
 Here is,

 I. An exhortation to get acquaintance with and submit to the laws of
 wisdom in general, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:2">ver. 2</A>.

 II. A particular caution against the sin of whoredom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:3-14">ver. 3-14</A>.

 III. Remedies prescribed against that sin.

 1. Conjugal love, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:15-20">ver. 15-20</A>.

 2. A regard to God's omniscience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:21">ver. 21</A>.

 3. A dread of the miserable end of wicked people,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:22,23">ver. 22, 23</A>.

 And all little enough to arm young people against those fleshly lusts 
 which war against the soul.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  My son, attend unto my wisdom, <I>and</I> bow thine ear to my
 understanding:
 &nbsp; 2  That thou mayest regard discretion, and <I>that</I> thy lips may
 keep knowledge.
 &nbsp; 3  For the lips of a strange woman drop <I>as</I> an honeycomb, and
 her mouth <I>is</I> smoother than oil:
 &nbsp; 4  But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.
 &nbsp; 5  Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
 &nbsp; 6  Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are
 moveable, <I>that</I> thou canst not know <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 7  Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the
 words of my mouth.
 &nbsp; 8  Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of
 her house:
 &nbsp; 9  Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto

 &nbsp; 10  Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours
 <I>be</I> in the house of a stranger;
 &nbsp; 11  And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are
 consumed,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A solemn preface, to introduce the caution which follows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 
 Solomon here addresses himself to his son, that is, to all young men, 
 as unto his children, whom he has an affection for and some influence 
 upon. In God's name, he demands attention; for he writes by divine 
 inspiration, and is a prophet, though he begins not with, <I>Thus saith 
 the Lord. "Attend, and bow thy ear;</I> not only hear what is said, and 
 read what is written, but apply thy mind to it and consider it 
 diligently." To gain attention he urges, 

 1. The excellency of his discourse: "It is <I>my wisdom, my
 understanding;</I> if I undertake to teach thee wisdom I cannot 
 prescribe any thing to be more properly called so; moral philosophy is 
 my philosophy, and that which is to be learned in my school." 

 2. The usefulness of it: "Attend to what I say,"

 (1.) "That thou mayest act wisely--<I>that thou mayest regard
 discretion.</I>" Solomon's lectures are not designed to fill our heads 
 with notions, with matters of nice speculation, or doubtful 
 disputation, but to guide us in the government of ourselves, that we 
 may act prudently, so as becomes us and so as will be for our true 
 interest. 

 (2.) "That thou mayest speak wisely--<I>that thy lips may keep
 knowledge,</I> and thou mayest have it ready at thy tongue's end" (as 
 we say), "for the benefit of those with whom thou dost converse." The 
 priest's lips are said to <I>keep knowledge</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+2:7">Mal. ii. 7</A>);

 but those that are ready and mighty in the scriptures may not only in 
 their devotions, but in their discourses, be spiritual priests.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The caution itself, and that is to abstain from fleshly lusts, from 
 adultery, fornication, and all uncleanness. Some apply this 
 figuratively, and by the adulterous woman here understand idolatry, or 
 false doctrine, which tends to debauch men's minds and manners, or the 
 sensual appetite, to which it may as fitly as any thing be applied; but 
 the primary scope of it is plainly to warn us against 
 seventh-commandment sins, which youth is so prone to, the temptations 
 to which are so violent, the examples of which are so many, and which, 
 where admitted, are so destructive to all the seeds of virtue in the 
 soul that it is not strange that Solomon's cautions against it are so 
 very pressing and so often repeated. Solomon here, as a faithful 
 watchman, gives fair warning to all, as they regard their lives and 
 comforts, to dread this sin, for it will certainly be their ruin. Two 
 things we are here warned to take heed of:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That we do not listen to the charms of this sin. It is true <I>the 
 lips of a strange woman drop as a honey-comb</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 the pleasures of fleshly lust are very tempting (like the wine that
 <I>gives its colour in the cup</I> and <I>moves itself aright</I>); its 
 mouth, the kisses of its mouth, the words of its mouth, are <I>smoother 
 than oil,</I> that the poisonous pill may go down glibly and there may 
 be no suspicion of harm in it. But consider,

 (1.) How fatal the consequences will be. What fruit will the sinner 
 have of his honey and oil when the end will be,

 [1.] The terrors of conscience: It <I>is bitter as wormwood,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 What was luscious in the mouth rises in the stomach and turns sour 
 there; it cuts, in the reflection, like <I>a two-edged sword;</I> take 
 it which way you will, it wounds. Solomon could speak by experience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:26">Eccl. vii. 26</A>.

 [2.] The torments of hell. If some that have been guilty of this sin 
 have repented and been saved, yet the direct tendency of the sin is to 
 destruction of body and soul; the <I>feet</I> of it <I>go down to 
 death,</I> nay, they <I>take hold on hell,</I> to pull it to the 
 sinner, as if the damnations slumbered too long, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Those that are entangled in this sin should be reminded that there is 
 but a step between them and hell, and that they are ready to drop into 
 it.

 (2.) Consider how false the charms are. The adulteress flatters and 
 speaks fair, her words are honey and oil, but she will deceive those 
 that hearken to her: <I>Her ways are movable, that thou canst not know 
 them;</I> she often changes her disguise, and puts on a great variety 
 of false colours, because, if she be rightly known, she is certainly 
 hated. Proteus-like, she puts on many shapes, that she may keep in with 
 those whom she has a design upon. And what does she aim at with all 
 this art and management? Nothing but to keep them from <I>pondering the 
 path of life,</I> for she knows that, if they once come to do that, she 
 shall certainly lose them. Those are <I>ignorant of Satan's devices</I> 
 who do not understand that the great thing he drives at in all his 
 temptations is,

 [1.] To keep them from choosing the path of life, to prevent them from 
 being religious and from going to heaven, that, being himself shut out 
 from happiness, he may keep them out from it. 

 [2.] In order hereunto, to keep them from pondering the path of life, 
 from considering how reasonable it is that they should walk in that 
 path, and how much it will be for their advantage. Be it observed, to 
 the honour of religion, that it certainly gains its point with all 
 those that will but allow themselves the liberty of a serious thought 
 and will weigh things impartially in an even balance, and that the 
 devil has no way of securing men in his interests but by diverting them 
 with continual amusements of one kind or another from the calm and 
 sober consideration of the <I>things that belong to their peace.</I> 
 And uncleanness is a sin that does as much as any thing blind the 
 understanding, sear the conscience, and keep people from pondering the 
 path of life. Whoredom <I>takes away the heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:11">Hos. iv. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That we do not approach the borders of this sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) This caution is introduced with a solemn preface: "<I>Hear me now 
 therefore, O you children!</I> whoever you are that read or hear these 
 lines, take notice of what I say, and mix faith with it, treasure it 
 up, and <I>depart not from the words of my mouth,</I> as those will do 
 that hearken to the words of the strange woman. Do not only receive 
 what I say, for the present merely, but cleave to it, and let it be 
 ready to thee, and of force with thee, when thou art most violently 
 assaulted by the temptation."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The caution itself is very pressing: "<I>Remove thy way far from 
 her;</I> if thy way should happen to lie near her, and thou shouldst 
 have a fair pretence of being led by business within the reach of her 
 charms, yet change thy way, and alter the course of it, rather than 
 expose thyself to danger; <I>come not nigh the door of her house;</I> 
 go on the other side of the street, nay, go through some other street, 
 though it be about." This intimates, 

 [1.] That we ought to have a very great dread and detestation of the 
 sin. We must fear it as we would a place infected with the plague; we 
 must loathe it as the odour of carrion, that we will not come near. 
 <I>Then</I> we are likely to preserve our purity when we conceive a 
 rooted antipathy to all fleshly lusts. 

 [2.] That we ought industriously to avoid every thing that may be an 
 occasion of this sin or a step towards it. Those that would be kept 
 from harm must keep out of harm's way. Such tinder there is in the 
 corrupt nature that it is madness, upon any pretence whatsoever, to 
 come near the sparks. If we thrust ourselves into temptation, we mocked 
 God when we prayed, <I>Lead us not into temptation.</I> 

 [3.] That we ought to be jealous over ourselves with a godly jealousy, 
 and not to be so confident of the strength of our own resolutions as to 
 venture upon the brink of sin, with a promise to ourselves that 
 <I>hitherto we will come and no further.</I> 

 [4.] That whatever has become a snare to us and an occasion of sin, 
 though it be as a <I>right eye</I> and a <I>right hand,</I> we must 
 <I>pluck it out, cut it off, and cast it from us,</I> must part with 
 that which is dearest to us rather than hazard our own souls; this is 
 our Saviour's command, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:28-30">Matt. v. 28-30</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) The arguments which Solomon here uses to enforce this caution are 
 taken from the same topic with those before, the many mischiefs which 
 attend this sin. 

 [1.] It blasts the reputation. "Thou wilt <I>give thy honour unto 
 others</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 thou wilt lose it thyself; thou wilt put into the hand of each of thy
 neighbours a stone to throw at thee, for they will all, with good 
 reason, cry shame on thee, will despise thee, and trample on thee, as a 
 foolish men." Whoredom is a sin that makes men contemptible and base, 
 and no man of sense or virtue will care to keep company with one that 
 keeps company with harlots.

 [2.] It wastes the time, gives <I>the years,</I> the years of youth, 
 the flower of men's time, <I>unto the cruel,</I> "that base lust of 
 thine, which with the utmost cruelty <I>wars against the soul,</I> that 
 base harlot which pretends an affection for thee, but really hunts for 
 the precious life." Those years that should be given to the honour of a 
 gracious God are spent in the service of a cruel sin. 

 [3.] It ruins the estate 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>Strangers</I> will be <I>filled with thy wealth,</I> which thou art
 but entrusted with as a steward for thy family; and the fruit of <I>thy 
 labours,</I> which should be provision for thy own house, will be in 
 <I>the house of a stranger,</I> that neither has right to it nor will 
 ever thank thee for it."

 [4.] It is destructive to the health, and shortens men's days: <I>Thy 
 flesh and thy body</I> will be <I>consumed</I> by it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The lusts of uncleanness not only <I>war against the soul,</I> which 
 the sinner neglects and is in no care about, but they war against the 
 body too, which he is so indulgent of and is in such care to please and 
 pamper, such deceitful, such foolish, such hurtful lusts are they.
 Those that give themselves to work uncleanness with greediness waste 
 their strength, throw themselves into weakness, and often have their 
 bodies filled with loathsome distempers, by which the number of their 
 months is cut off in the midst and they fall unpitied sacrifices to a 
 cruel lust.

 [5.] It will fill the mind with horror, if ever conscience be awakened. 
 "Though thou art merry now, <I>sporting thyself in thy own 
 deceivings,</I> yet thou wilt certainly <I>mourn at the last,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Thou art all this while making work for repentance, and laying up 
 matter for vexation and torment in the reflection, when the sin is set 
 before thee in its own colours." Sooner or later it will bring sorrow, 
 either when the soul is humbled and brought to repentance or when the 
 <I>flesh and body are consumed,</I> either by sickness, when conscience 
 flies in the sinner's face, or by the grave; when the body is rotting 
 there, the soul is racking in the torments of hell, where the worm dies 
 not, and "<I>Son, remember,</I>" is the constant peal. Solomon here
 brings in the convinced sinner reproaching himself, and aggravating his 
 own folly. He will then most bitterly lament it. <I>First,</I> That
 because he hated to be reformed he therefore hated to be informed, and 
 could not endure either to be taught his duty (<I>How have I hated</I> 
 not only the discipline of being instructed, but the <I>instruction</I> 
 itself, though all true and good!) or to be told of his faults--<I>My
 heart despised reproof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He cannot but own that those who had the charge of him, parents, 
 ministers, had done their part; they had been his teachers; they had 
 instructed him, had given him good counsel and fair warning

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 but to his own shame and confusion does he speak it, and therein
 justifies God in all the miseries that were brought upon him, he had 
 not <I>obeyed their voice,</I> for indeed he <I>never inclined his ear 
 to those that instructed him,</I> never minded what they said nor 
 admitted the impressions of it. Note, Those who have had a good 
 education and do not live up to it will have a great deal to answer for 
 another day; and those who will not now remember what they were taught, 
 to conform themselves to it, will be made to remember it as an 
 aggravation of their sin, and consequently of their ruin.
 <I>Secondly,</I> That by the frequent acts of sin the habits of it were 
 so rooted and confirmed that his heart was fully set in him to commit 
 it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and
 assembly.</I> When he came into the synagogue, or into the courts of 
 the temple, to worship God with other Israelites, his unclean heart was 
 full of wanton thoughts and desires and his eyes of adultery. Reverence 
 of the place and company, and of the work that was doing, could not 
 restrain him, but he was almost as wicked and vile there as any where. 
 No sin will appear more frightful to an awakened conscience than the 
 profanation of holy things; nor will any aggravation of sin render it 
 more exceedingly sinful than the place we are honoured with in the 
 congregation and assembly, and the advantages we enjoy thereby. Zimri 
 and Cozbi avowed their villany <I>in the sight of Moses and all the 
 congregation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:6">Num. xxv. 6</A>),

 and heart-adultery is as open to God, and must needs be most offensive 
 to him, when we draw nigh to him in religious exercises. <I>I was in
 all evil</I> in defiance of the magistrates and judges, and their 
 assemblies; so some understand it. Others refer it to the evil of
 punishment, not to the evil of sin: "I was made an example, a spectacle 
 to the world. I was under almost all God's sore judgments <I>in the 
 midst of the congregation of Israel,</I> set up for a mark. <I>I stood 
 up and cried in the congregation,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:28">Job xxx. 28</A>.

 Let that be avoided which will be thus rued at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon, having shown the great evil that there is in adultery and 
 fornication, and all such lewd and filthy courses, here prescribes 
 remedies against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Enjoy with satisfaction the comforts of lawful marriage, which was 
 ordained for the prevention of uncleanness, and therefore ought to be 
 made use of in time, lest it should not prove effectual for the cure of 
 that which it might have prevented. Let none complain that God has 
 dealt unkindly with them in forbidding them those pleasures which they 
 have a natural desire of, for he has graciously provided for the 
 regular gratification of them. "Thou mayest not indeed eat of every 
 tree of the garden, but choose thee out one, which thou pleasest, and 
 of that thou mayest freely eat; nature will be content with that, but 
 lust with nothing." God, in thus confining men to one, has been so far 
 from putting any hardship upon them that he has really consulted their 
 true interest; for, as Mr. Herbert observes, "<I>If God had laid all 
 common, certainly man would have been the encloser.</I>"--Church-porch.
 Solomon here enlarges much upon this, not only prescribing it as an 
 antidote, but urging it as an argument against fornication, that the 
 allowed pleasures of marriage (however wicked wits may ridicule them, 
 who are factors for the unclean spirit) far transcend all the false 
 forbidden pleasures of whoredom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let young men marry, marry and not burn. Have <I>a cistern,</I> a 
 <I>well of thy own</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 even the wife <I>of thy youth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 <I>Wholly abstain, or wed.</I>--Herbert. "The world is wide, and there
 are varieties of accomplishments, among which thou mayest please 
 thyself."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let him that is married take delight in his wife, and let him be 
 very fond of her, not only because she is the wife that he himself has 
 chosen and he ought to be pleased with his own choice, but because she 
 is the wife that God in his providence appointed for him and he ought 
 much more to be pleased with the divine appointment, pleased with her 
 because she is his own. <I>Let thy fountain be blessed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>);
 
 think thyself very happy in her, look upon her as a blessed wife, let
 her have thy blessing, pray daily for her, and then <I>rejoice with 
 her.</I> Those comforts we are likely to have joy of that are 
 sanctified to us by prayer and the blessing of God. It is not only 
 allowed us, but commanded us, to be pleasant with our relations; and it 
 particularly becomes yoke-fellows to rejoice together and in each 
 other. Mutual delight is the bond of mutual fidelity. It is not only 
 taken for granted that the <I>bridegroom rejoices over his bride</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:5">Isa. lxii. 5</A>),
 
 but given for law. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:9">Eccl. ix. 9</A>,

 <I>Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy 
 life.</I> Those take not their comforts where God has appointed who are 
 jovial and merry with their companions abroad, but sour and morose with 
 their families at home.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Let him be fond of his wife and love her dearly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Let her be as the loving hind and the pleasant roe,</I> such as
 great men sometimes kept tame in their houses and played with. Desire 
 no better diversion from severe study and business than the innocent 
 and pleasant conversation of thy own wife; let her lie in thy bosom, as 
 the poor man's ewe-lamb did in his

 and do thou repose thy head in hers, and let that <I>satisfy thee at 
 all times;</I> and seek not for pleasure in any other. "<I>Err thou 
 always in her love.</I> If thou wilt suffer thy love to run into an 
 excess, and wilt be dotingly fond of any body, let it be only of thy 
 own wife, where there is least danger of exceeding." This is 
 <I>drinking waters,</I> to quench the thirst of thy appetite, <I>out of 
 thy own cistern,</I> and <I>running waters,</I> which are clear, and 
 sweet, and wholesome, <I>out of thy own well,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:15,1Co+7:2,3"><I>v.</I> 15. 
 1 Cor. vii. 2, 3</A>.</P>

 4. Let him take delight in his children and look upon them with 
 pleasure 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>):

 "Look upon them as streams from thy own pure fountains" (the Jews are
 said to <I>come forth out of the waters of Judah,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+48:1">Isa. xlviii. 1</A>),

 "so that they are parts of thyself, as the streams are of the fountain.
 Keep to thy own wife, and thou shalt have,"

 (1.) "A numerous offspring, like <I>rivers of water,</I> which run in 
 abundance, and they shall be dispersed abroad, matched into other 
 families, whereas those that <I>commit whoredom</I> shall <I>not 
 increase,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:10">Hos. iv. 10</A>.

 (2.) "A peculiar offspring, which shall be <I>only thy own,</I> whereas 
 the children of whoredom, that are fathered upon thee, are, probably, 
 not so, but, for aught thou knowest, are the offspring of strangers, 
 and yet thou must keep them." 

 (3.) "A creditable offspring, which are an honour to thee, and which 
 thou mayest send abroad, and appear with, in the streets, whereas a 
 spurious brood is thy disgrace, and that which thou art ashamed to 
 own." In this matter, virtue has all the pleasure and honour in it; 
 justly therefore it is called <I>wisdom.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Let him then scorn the offer of forbidden pleasures when he is 
 <I>always ravished with the love</I> of a faithful virtuous wife; let 
 him consider what an absurdity it will be for him to be <I>ravished 
 with a strange woman</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 to be in love with a filthy harlot, and <I>embrace the bosom of a
 stranger,</I> which, if he had any sense of honour or virtue, he would 
 loathe the thoughts of. "Why wilt thou be so sottish, such an enemy to 
 thyself, as to prefer puddle-water, and that poisoned too and stolen, 
 before pure living waters out of thy own well?" Note, If the dictates 
 of reason may be heard, the laws of virtue will be obeyed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. "See the eye of God always upon thee and let his fear rule in thy 
 heart," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 Those that live in this sin promise themselves secresy (<I>the eye of 
 the adulterer waits for the twilight,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+24:15">Job xxiv. 15</A>);

 but to what purpose, when it cannot be hidden from God? For,

 1. He sees it. <I>The ways of man,</I> all his motions, all his
 actions, are <I>before the eyes of the Lord,</I> all the workings of 
 the heart and all the outgoings of the life, that which is done ever so 
 secretly and disguised ever so artfully. God sees it in a true light, 
 and knows it with all its causes, circumstances, and consequences. He 
 does not cast an eye upon men's ways now and then, but they are always 
 actually in his view and under his inspection; and darest thou sin 
 against God in his sight, and do that wickedness under his eye which 
 thou durst not do in the presence of a man like thyself? 

 2. He will call the sinner to an account for it; for he not only sees, 
 but <I>ponders all his goings,</I> judges concerning them, as one that 
 will shortly judge the sinner for them. Every action is <I>weighed,</I> 
 and shall be <I>brought into judgment</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:14">Eccl. xii. 14</A>),

 which is a good reason why we should <I>ponder the path of our feet</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:26"><I>ch.</I> iv. 26</A>),

 and so <I>judge ourselves</I> that we <I>may not be judged.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. "Foresee the certain ruin of those that go on still in their 
 trespasses." Those that live in this sin promise themselves impunity, 
 but they deceive themselves; their sin will find them out, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.
 
 The apostle gives the sense of these verses in a few words. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:4">Heb. xiii. 4</A>,

 <I>Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</I>

 1. It is a sin which men with great difficulty shake off the power of.
 When the sinner is old and weak his lusts are strong and active, in 
 <I>calling to remembrance the days of his youth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+23:19">Ezek. xxiii. 19</A>.

 Thus <I>his own iniquities</I> having <I>seized the wicked himself</I> 
 by his own consent, and he having voluntarily surrendered himself a 
 captive to them, he is <I>held in the cords of his own sins,</I> and 
 such full possession they have gained of him that he cannot extricate 
 himself, but in the <I>greatness of his folly</I> (and what greater 
 folly could there be than to yield himself a servant to such cruel 
 task-masters?) he shall <I>go astray,</I> and wander endlessly.
 Uncleanness is a sin from which, when once men have plunged themselves 
 into it, they very hardly and very rarely recover themselves.

 2. It is a sin which, if it be not forsaken, men cannot possibly escape 
 the punishment of; it will unavoidably be their ruin. As their own 
 iniquities do arrest them in the reproaches of conscience and present 
 rebukes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+7:19">Jer. vii. 19</A>),

 so their own iniquities shall arrest them and bind them over to the 
 judgments of God. There needs no prison, no chains; they shall be 
 <I>holden in the cords of their own sins,</I> as the fallen angels, 
 being incurably wicked, are thereby <I>reserved in chains of 
 darkness.</I> The sinner, who, having been <I>often reproved, hardens 
 his neck,</I> shall <I>die at length without instruction.</I> Having 
 had general warnings sufficient given him already, he shall have no 
 particular warnings, but he shall die without seeing his danger 
 beforehand, shall die because he would not receive instruction, but 
 <I>in the greatness of his folly</I> would <I>go astray;</I> and so 
 shall his doom be, he shall never find the way home again. Those that 
 are so foolish as to choose the way of sin are justly left of God to 
 themselves to go in it till they come to that destruction which it 
 leads to, which is a good reason why we should guard with watchfulness 
 and resolution against the allurements of the sensual appetite.</P>
