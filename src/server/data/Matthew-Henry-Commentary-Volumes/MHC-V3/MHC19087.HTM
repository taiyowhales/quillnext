 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The foregoing psalm was very plain and easy, but in this are things 
 dark and hard to be understood. It is an encomium of Zion, as a type 
 and figure of the gospel-church, to which what is here spoken is very 
 applicable. Zion, for the temple's sake, is here preferred, 

 I. Before the rest of the land of Canaan, as being crowned with special
 tokens of God's favour, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. Before any other place or country whatsoever, as being replenished
 with more eminent men and with a greater plenty of divine blessings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>.

 Some think it was penned to express the joy of God's people when Zion
 was in a flourishing state; others think it was penned to encourage
 their faith and hope when Zion was in ruins and was to be rebuilt after
 the captivity.  Though no man cared for her

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+30:17">Jer. xxx. 17</A>,

 "This is Zion whom no man seeketh after"), yet God had done great
 things for her, and spoken glorious things of her, which should all
 have their perfection and accomplishment in the gospel-church; to that 
 therefore we must have an eye in singing this psalm.</P>

 <P>A psalm <I>or</I> song for the sons of Korah.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  His foundation <I>is</I> in the holy mountains.
 &nbsp; 2  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some make the first words of the psalm to be part of the title; it is a 
 psalm or song whose subject is the holy mountains--the temple built in 
 Zion upon Mount Moriah. This is the foundation of the argument, or 
 beginning of the psalm. Or we may suppose the psalmist had now the 
 tabernacle or temple in view and was contemplating the glories of it, 
 and at length he breaks out into this expression, which has reference, 
 though not to what he had written before, yet to what he had thought 
 of; every one knew what he meant when he said thus abruptly, <I>Its 
 foundation is in the holy mountains.</I> Three things are here 
 observed, in praise of the temple:--

 1. That it was founded on the holy mountains,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 The church has a foundation, so that it cannot sink or totter; Christ
 himself is the foundation of it, which God has laid. The Jerusalem
 above is a city that has foundations. The foundation is upon the
 mountains. It is built high; the <I>mountain of the Lord's house is
 established upon the top of the mountains,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:2">Isa. ii. 2</A>.

 It is built firmly; the mountains are rocky, and on a rock the church
 is built. The world is founded upon the seas

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:2">Ps. xxiv. 2</A>),

 which are continually ebbing and flowing, and are a very weak 
 foundation; Babel was built in a plain, where the ground was rotten. 
 But the church is built upon the everlasting mountains and the 
 perpetual hills; for sooner shall the mountains depart, and the hills 
 be removed, than the covenant of God's peace shall be disannulled, and 
 on that the church is built, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:10">Isa.  lxiv. 10</A>.

 The foundation is upon the holy mountains. Holiness is the strength and 
 stability of the church: it is this that will support it and keep it 
 from sinking; not so much that it is built upon mountains as that it is 
 built upon holy mountains--upon the promise of God, for the confirming 
 of which he has sworn by his holiness, upon the sanctification of the 
 Spirit, which will secure the happiness of all the saints. 

 2. That God had expressed a particular affection for it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:2"><I>v.</I>  2</A>):

 <I>The Lord loveth the gates of Zion,</I> of the temple, of <I>the 
 houses of doctrine</I> (so the Chaldee), <I>more than all the dwellings 
 of Jacob,</I> whether in Jerusalem or any where else in the country.  
 God had said concerning Zion, <I>This is my rest for ever; here will I 
 dwell.</I> There he met his people, and conversed with them, received 
 their homage, and showed them the tokens of his favour, and therefore 
 we may conclude how well he loves those gates. Note, 

 (1.) God has a love for the dwellings of Jacob, has a gracious regard 
 to religious families and accepts their family-worship. 

 (2.) Yet he loves the gates of Zion better, not only better than any, 
 but better than all, of the dwellings of Jacob. God was worshipped in 
 the dwellings of Jacob, and family-worship is family-duty, which must 
 by no means be neglected; yet, when they come in competition, public 
 worship (<I>c&aelig;teris paribus--other things being equal</I>) is to 
 be preferred before private. 

 3. That there was much said concerning it in the word of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God!</I> We are to 
 judge of things and persons by the figure they make and the estimate 
 put upon them in and by the scripture. Many base things were spoken of 
 the city of God by the enemies of it, to render it mean and odious; but 
 by him whose judgment we are sure is according to truth glorious things 
 are spoken of it. God said of the temple, <I>My eyes and my heart shall 
 be there perpetually; I have sanctified this house, that my name may be 
 there for ever,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+7:16">2 Chron. vii. 16</A>.

 <I>Beautiful for situation is Mount Zion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:2">Ps. xlviii. 2</A>.

 These are glorious things. Yet more glorious things are spoken of the
 gospel-church. It is the spouse of Christ, the purchase of his blood; 
 it is a <I>peculiar people, a holy nation, a royal priesthood,</I> and 
 the <I>gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</I> Let us not be 
 ashamed of the church of Christ in its meanest condition, nor of any 
 that belong to it, nor disown our relation to it, though it be turned 
 ever so much to our reproach, since such glorious things are spoken of 
 it, and not on iota or tittle of what is said shall fall to the 
 ground.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Zion is here compared with other places, and preferred before them; the 
 church of Christ is more glorious and excellent than the nations of the 
 earth. 
 
 1. It is owned that other places have their glories
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 
 "<I>I will make mention of Rahab</I>" (that is, <I>Egypt) "and Babylon,
 to those that know me</I> and are about me, and with whom I discourse 
 about public affairs; <I>behold Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia</I>" 
 (or rather Arabia), "we will observe that <I>this man was born 
 there;</I> here and there one famous man, eminent for knowledge and 
 virtue, may be produced, that was a native of these countries; here and 
 there one that becomes a proselyte and worshipper of the true God." But 
 some give another sense of it, supposing that it is a prophecy or 
 promise of bringing the Gentiles into the church and of uniting them in 
 one body with the Jews. God says, "<I>I will reckon Egypt and Babylon 
 with those that know me.</I> I will reckon them my people as much as 
 Israel when they shall receive the gospel of Christ, and own them as 
 born in Zion, born again there, and admitted to the privileges of Zion 
 as freely as a true-born Israelite." Those that were strangers and 
 foreigners became <I>fellow-citizens with the saints,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:19">Eph. ii. 19</A>.

 A Gentile convert shall stand upon a level with a native Jew; compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:23-25">Isa. xix. 23-25</A>.

 <I>The Lord shall say, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work
 of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.</I>

 2. It is proved that the glory of Zion outshines them all, upon many
 accounts; for,

 (1.) Zion shall produce many great and good men that shall be famous in 
 their generation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Of Zion it shall be said by all her neighbours that <I>this and that
 man were born in her,</I> many men of renown for wisdom and piety, and
 especially for acquaintance with the words of God and the visions of
 the Almighty--many prophets and kings, who should be greater favourites
 of heaven, and greater blessings to the earth, than ever were bred in
 Egypt or Babylon. The worthies of the church far exceed those of
 heathen nations, and their names will shine brighter than in perpetual
 records. <I>A man, a man was born in her,</I> by which some understand
 Christ, that man, that son of man, who is fairer than the children of
 men; he was born at Bethlehem near Zion, and was the glory of his
 people Israel. The greatest honour that ever was put upon the Jewish
 nation was, that of them, <I>as concerning the flesh, Christ came,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:5">Rom. ix. 5</A>.

 Or this also may be applied to the conversion of the Gentiles. Of Zion
 it shall be said that the law which went forth out of Zion, the gospel 
 of Christ, shall be an instrument to beget many souls to God, and the 
 Jerusalem that is from above shall be acknowledged the mother of them 
 all.

 (2.) Zion's interest shall be strengthened and settled by an almighty 
 power. <I>The Highest himself shall</I> undertake to <I>establish 
 her,</I> who can do it effectually; the accession of proselytes out of 
 various nations shall be so far from occasioning discord and division 
 that it shall contribute greatly to Zion's strength; for, God himself 
 having founded her upon an everlasting foundation, whatever convulsions 
 and revolutions there are of states and kingdoms, and however heaven 
 and earth may be shaken, these are things which cannot be shaken, but 
 must remain. 

 (3.) Zion's sons shall be registered with honour
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>The Lord shall count, when he writes up the people,</I> and takes a 
 catalogue of his subjects, <I>that this man was born there,</I> and so 
 is a subject by birth, by the first birth, being born in his house--by 
 the second birth, being born again of his Spirit." When God comes to 
 reckon with the children of men, that he may render to every man 
 according to his works, he will observe who was born in Zion, and 
 consequently enjoyed the privileges of God's sanctuary, to whom 
 pertained the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the 
 service of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4,Ro+3:1,2">Rom. ix. 4; iii. 1, 2</A>.

 For to them much was given, and therefore of them much will be
 required, and the account will be accordingly; five talents must be 
 improved by those that were entrusted with five. <I>I know thy works, 
 and where thou dwellest,</I> and where thou was born. <I>Selah.</I> Let 
 those that dwell in Zion <I>mark this,</I> and live up to their 
 profession.

 (4.) Zion's songs shall be sung with joy and triumph: <I>As well the 
 singers as the players on instruments shall be there</I> to praise God, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 It was much to the honour of Zion, and is to the honour of the
 gospel-church, that there God is served and worshipped with rejoicing:
 his work is done, and done cheerfully; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:25">Ps. lxviii. 25</A>.

 <I>All my springs are in thee,</I> O Zion!  So God says; he has
 deposited treasures of grace in his holy ordinances; there are the 
 springs from which those streams take rise <I>which make glad the city 
 of our God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:4">Ps. xlvi. 4</A>.

 So the psalmist says, reckoning the springs from which his dry soul
 must be watered to lie in the sanctuary, in the word and ordinances, 
 and in the communion of saints. The springs of the joy of a carnal 
 worldling lie in wealth and pleasure; but the springs of the joy of a 
 gracious soul lie in the word of God and prayer. Christ is the true 
 temple; all our springs are in him, and from him all our streams flow. 
 <I>It pleased the Father,</I> and all believers are well pleased with 
 it too, <I>that in him should all fulness dwell.</I></P>
