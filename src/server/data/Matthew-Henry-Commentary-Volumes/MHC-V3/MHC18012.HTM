 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this and the two following chapters we have Job's answer to Zophar's 
 discourse, in which, as before, he first reasons with his friends (see
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:19"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 19</A>)

 and then turns to his God, and directs his expostulations to him, from
 thence to the end of his discourse. In this chapter he addresses
 himself to his friends, and,

 I. He condemns what they had said of him, and the judgment they had
 given of his character, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. He contradicts and confronts what they had said of the destruction
 of wicked people in this world, showing that they often prosper, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:6-11">ver. 6-11</A>.

 III. He consents to what they had said of the wisdom, power, and
 sovereignty of God, and the dominion of his providence over the 
 children of men and all their affairs; he confirms this, and enlarges 
 upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:12-25">ver. 12-25</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  And Job answered and said,
 &nbsp; 2  No doubt but ye <I>are</I> the people, and wisdom shall die with
 you.
 &nbsp; 3  But I have understanding as well as you; I <I>am</I> not inferior
 to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
 &nbsp; 4  I am <I>as</I> one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God,
 and he answereth him: the just upright <I>man is</I> laughed to scorn.
 &nbsp; 5  He that is ready to slip with <I>his</I> feet <I>is as</I> a lamp
 despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The reproofs Job here gives to his friends, whether they were just or 
 no, were very sharp, and may serve for a rebuke to all that are proud 
 and scornful, and an exposure of their folly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He upbraids them with their conceitedness of themselves, and the 
 good opinion they seemed to have of their own wisdom in comparison with 
 him, than which nothing is more weak and unbecoming, nor better 
 deserves to be ridiculed, as it is here. 

 1. He represents them as claiming the monopoly of wisdom, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He speaks ironically: "<I>No doubt you are the people;</I> you think
 yourselves fit to dictate and give law to all mankind, and your own 
 judgment to be the standard by which every man's opinion must be 
 measured and tried, as if nobody could discern between truth and 
 falsehood, good and evil, but you only; and therefore every top-sail 
 must lower to you, and, right or wrong, we must all say as you say, and 
 you three must be the people, the majority, to have the casting vote." 
 Note, It is a very foolish and sinful thing for any to think themselves 
 wiser than all mankind besides, or to speak and act confidently and 
 imperiously, as if they thought so. Nay, he goes further: "You not only 
 think there are none, but that there will be none, as wise as you, and 
 therefore that <I>wisdom must die with you,</I> that all the world must 
 be fools when you are gone, and in the dark when your sun has set." 
 Note, It is folly for us to think that there will be any great 
 irreparable loss of us when we are gone, or that we can be ill spared, 
 since God has the residue of the Spirit, and can raise up others, more 
 fit than we are, to do his work. When wise men and good men die it is a 
 comfort to think that wisdom and goodness shall not die with them. Some 
 think Job here reflects upon Zophar's comparing him (as he thought) and 
 others to the wild ass's colt,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:12"><I>ch.</I> xi. 12</A>.

 "Yes," says he, "we must be asses; you are the only men." 

 2. He does himself the justice to put in his claim as a sharer in the
 gifts of wisdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>But I have understanding (a heart) as well as you;</I> nay, <I>I
 fall not lower than you;</I>" as it is in the margin. "I am as well 
 able to judge of the methods and meanings of the divine providence, and 
 to construe the hard chapters of it, as you are." He says not this to 
 magnify himself. It was no great applause of himself to say, <I>I have 
 understanding as well as you;</I> no, nor to say, "I understand this 
 matter as well as you;" for what reason had either he or they to be 
 proud of understanding that which was obvious and level to the capacity 
 of the meanest? "<I>Yea, who knows not such things as these?</I> What 
 things you have said that are true are plain truths, and common themes, 
 which there are many that can talk as excellently of as either you or 
 I." But he says it to humble them, and check the value they had for 
 themselves as doctors of the chair. Note,

 (1.) It may justly keep us from being proud of our knowledge to 
 consider how many there are that know as much as we do, and perhaps 
 much more and to better purpose. 

 (2.) When we are tempted to be harsh in our censures of those we differ 
 from and dispute with we ought to consider that they also have 
 understanding as well as we, a capacity of judging, and a right of 
 judging for themselves; nay, perhaps they are not inferior to us, but 
 superior, and it is possible that they may be in the right and we in 
 the wrong; and therefore we ought not to judge or despise them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:3">Rom. xiv. 3</A>),

 nor pretend to be masters
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:1">Jam. iii. 1</A>),

 while <I>all we are brethren,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:8">Matt. xxiii. 8</A>.

 It is a very reasonable allowance to be made to all we converse with,
 all we contend with, that they are rational creatures as well as 
 we.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He complains of the great contempt with which they had treated him. 
 Those that are haughty and think too well of themselves are commonly 
 scornful and ready to trample upon all about them. Job found it so, at 
 least he thought he did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>I am as one mocked.</I> I cannot say there was cause for this 
 charge; we will not think Job's friends designed him any abuse, nor 
 aimed at any thing but to convince him, and so, in the right method, to 
 comfort him; yet he cries out, <I>I am as one mocked.</I> Note, We are 
 apt to call reproofs reproaches, and to think ourselves mocked when we 
 are but advised and admonished; this peevishness is our folly, and a 
 great wrong to ourselves and to our friends. Yet we cannot but say 
 there was colour for this charge; they came to comfort him, but they 
 vexed him, gave him counsels and encouragements, but with no great 
 opinion that either the one or the other would take effect; and 
 therefore he thought they mocked him, and this added much to his grief. 
 Nothing is more grievous to those that have fallen from the height of 
 prosperity into the depth of adversity than to be trodden on, and 
 insulted over, when they are down; and on this head they are too apt to 
 be suspicious.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What aggravated this grievance to him. Two things:--

 (1.) That they were his <I>neighbours,</I> his friends, his companions 
 (so the word signifies), and the scoffs of such are often most 
 spitefully given, and always most indignantly received. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+55:12,13">Ps.  lv. 12, 13</A>,
 
 <I>It was not an enemy that reproached me; then I would have</I>
 slighted it, and <I>so borne it; but it was thou, a man, my equal.</I> 
 
 (2.) That they were professors of religion, such as <I>called upon 
 God,</I> and said that he <I>answered them:</I> for some understand 
 that of the persons mocking. "They are such as have a regard to heaven, 
 and an interest in heaven, whose prayers I would therefore be glad of 
 and thankful for, whose good opinion I cannot but covet, and therefore 
 whose censures are the more grievous." Note, It is sad that any who 
 call upon God should mock their brethren 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:9,10">Jam. iii. 9, 10</A>),

 and it cannot but lie heavily on a good man to be thought ill of by
 those whom he thinks well of, yet this is no new thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What supported him under it. 

 (1.) That he had a God to go to, with whom he could lodge his appeal; 
 for some understand those words of the person mocked, that he <I>calls 
 upon God and he answers him;</I> and so it agrees with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:20"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 20</A>.

 <I>My friends scorn me, but my eye poureth out tears to God.</I> If our
 friends be deaf to our complaints, God is not; if they condemn us, God 
 knows our integrity; if they make the worst of us, he will make the 
 best of us; if they give us cross answers, he will give us kind ones. 
 
 (2.) That his case was not singular, but very common: <I>The just 
 upright man is laughed to scorn.</I> By many he is laughed at even for 
 his justice and his uprightness, his honesty towards men and his piety 
 towards God; these are derided as foolish things, which silly people 
 needlessly hamper themselves with, as if religion were a jest and 
 therefore to be made a jest of. By most he is laughed at for any little 
 infirmity or weakness, notwithstanding his justice and uprightness, 
 without any consideration had of that which is so much his honour. 
 Note, It was of old the lot of honest good people to be despised and 
 derided; we are not therefore to think it strange 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:12">1 Pet. iv. 12</A>),

 no, nor to think it hard, if it be our lot; <I>so persecuted they</I>
 not only <I>the prophets,</I> but even the saints of the patriarchal 
 age 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:12">Matt. v. 12</A>),

 and can we expect to fare better than they?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What he suspected to be the true cause of it, and that was, in 
 short, this: they were themselves rich and at ease, and therefore they 
 despised him who had fallen into poverty. It is the way of the world; 
 we see instances of it daily. Those that prosper are praised, but of 
 those that are going down it is said, "Down with them." <I>He that is 
 ready to slip with his feet</I> and fall into trouble, though he has 
 formerly shone as a lamp, is then looked upon as a lamp going out like 
 the snuff of a candle, which we throw to the ground and tread upon, and 
 is accordingly <I>despised in the thought of him that is at ease,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Even the just upright man, that is in his generation as a burning and
 shining light, if he enter into temptation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:2">Ps. lxxiii. 2</A>)

 or come under a cloud, is looked upon with contempt. See here,

 (1.) What is the common fault of those that live in prosperity. Being 
 full, and easy, and merry themselves, they look scornfully upon those 
 that are in want, pain, and sorrow; they overlook them, take no notice 
 of them, and study to forget them. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+123:4">Ps. cxxiii. 4</A>.

 The chief butler drinks wine in bowls, but makes nothing of the
 afflictions of Joseph.  Wealth without grace often makes men thus 
 haughty, thus careless of their poor neighbours.

 (2.) What is the common fate of those that fall into adversity. Poverty 
 serves to eclipse all their lustre; though they are lamps, yet, if 
 taken out of golden candlesticks, and put, like Gideon's, into earthen 
 pitchers, nobody values them as formerly, but those that live at ease 
 despise them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God
 are secure; into whose hand God bringeth <I>abundantly.</I>
 &nbsp; 7  But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the
 fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:
 &nbsp; 8  Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the
 fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
 &nbsp; 9  Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath
 wrought this?
 &nbsp; 10  In whose hand <I>is</I> the soul of every living thing, and the
 breath of all mankind.
 &nbsp; 11  Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job's friends all of them went upon this principle, that wicked people 
 cannot prosper long in this world, but some remarkable judgment or 
 other will suddenly light on them: Zophar had concluded with it, that 
 <I>the eyes of the wicked shall fail,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:20"><I>ch.</I> xi. 20</A>.

 This principle Job here opposes, and maintains that God, in disposing
 men's outward affairs, acts as a sovereign, reserving the exact 
 distribution of rewards and punishments for the future state.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He asserts it as an undoubted truth that wicked people may, and 
 often do, prosper long in this world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Even great sinners may enjoy great prosperity. Observe,

 1. How he describes the sinners. They are <I>robbers,</I> and such as 
 provoke God, the worst kind of sinners, blasphemers and persecutors. 
 Perhaps he refers to the Sabeans and Chaldeans, who had robbed him, and 
 had always lived by spoil and rapine, and yet they prospered; all the 
 world saw they did, and there is no disputing against sense; one 
 observation built upon matter of fact is worth twenty notions framed by 
 an hypothesis. Or more generally, All proud oppressors are robbers and 
 pirates. It is supposed that what is injurious to men is provoking to 
 God, the patron of right and the protector of mankind. It is not 
 strange if those that violate the bonds of justice break through the 
 obligations of all religion, bid defiance even to God himself, and make 
 nothing of provoking him. 

 2. How he describes their prosperity. It is very great; for,

 (1.) Even <I>their tabernacles prosper,</I> those that live with them 
 and those that come after them and descend from them. It seems as if a 
 blessing were entailed upon their families; and that is sometimes 
 preserved to succeeding generations which was got by fraud. 

 (2.) They <I>are secure,</I> and not only feel no hurt, but fear none, 
 are under no apprehensions of danger either from threatening 
 providences or an awakened conscience. But those <I>that provoke 
 God</I> are never the more safe for their being secure. 

 (3.) <I>Into their hand God brings abundantly. They have more than 
 heart could wish</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:7">Ps. lxxiii. 7</A>),

 not for necessity only, but for delight--not for themselves only, but
 for others--not for the present only, but for hereafter; and this from 
 the hand of Providence too. God brings plentifully to them. We cannot 
 therefore judge of men's piety by their plenty, nor of what they have 
 in their heart by what they have in their hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He appeals even to the inferior creatures for the proof of this--the
 beasts, and fowls, and trees, and even the earth itself; consult these, 
 and they shall tell thee, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 Many a good lesson we may learn from them, but what are they here to
 teach us?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We may from them learn that <I>the tabernacles of robbers 
 prosper</I> (so some); for, 

 (1.) Even among the brute creatures the greater devour the less and the 
 stronger prey upon the weaker, and men are as the fishes of the sea, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:14">Hab. i. 14</A>.

 If sin had not entered, we may suppose there would have been no such
 disorder among the creatures, but the wolf and the lamb would have lain 
 down together.

 (2.) These creatures are serviceable to wicked men, and so they declare 
 their prosperity. Ask the herds and the flocks to whom they belong, and 
 they will tell you that such a robber, such an oppressor, is their 
 owner: the fishes and fowls will tell you that they are served up to 
 the tables, and feed the luxury, of proud sinners. The earth brings 
 forth her fruits to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:24"><I>ch.</I> ix. 24</A>),

 and the whole creation groans under the burden of their tyranny, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:20,22">Rom. viii. 20, 22</A>.

 Note, All the creatures which wicked men abuse, by making them the food
 and fuel of their lusts, will witness against them another day, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:3,4">Jam. v. 3, 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We may from them learn the wisdom, power, and goodness of God, and 
 that sovereign dominion of his into which plain and self-evident truth 
 all these difficult dispensations must be resolved. Zophar had made a 
 vast mystery of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:7"><I>ch.</I> xi. 7</A>.

 "So far from that," says Job, "that what we are concerned to know we
 may learn even from the inferior creatures; for <I>who knows not from 
 all these?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Any one may easily gather from the book of the creatures that <I>the
 hand of the Lord has wrought this,</I>" that is, "that there is a wise 
 Providence which guides and governs all these things by rules which we 
 are neither acquainted with nor are competent judges of." Note, From 
 God's sovereign dominion over the inferior creatures we should learn to 
 acquiesce in all his disposals of the affairs of the children of men, 
 though contrary to our measures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He resolves all into the absolute propriety which God has in all 
 the creatures 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>In whose hand is the soul of every living thing.</I> All the 
 creatures, and mankind particularly, derive their being from him, owe 
 their being to him, depend upon him for the support of it, lie at his 
 mercy, are under his direction and dominion and entirely at his 
 disposal, and at his summons must resign their lives.  All souls are 
 his; and may he not do what he will with his own? The name 
 <I>Jehovah</I> is used here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 and it is the only time that we meet with it in all the discourses 
 between Job and his friends; for God was, in that age, more known by 
 the name of <I>Shaddai--the Almighty.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Those words--
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 <I>Doth not the ear try words, as the mouth tastes meat?</I> may be 
 taken either as the conclusion to the foregoing discourse or the 
 preface to what follows. The mind of man has as good a faculty of 
 discerning between truth and error, when duly stated, as the palate has 
 of discerning between what is sweet and what is bitter. Job therefore 
 demands from his friends a liberty to judge for himself of what they 
 had said, and desires them to use the same liberty in judging of what 
 he had said; nay, he seems to appeal to any man's impartial judgment in 
 this controversy; let the ear try the words on both sides, and it would 
 be found that he was in the right. Note, The ear must try words before 
 it receives them so as to subscribe to them. As by the taste we judge 
 what food is wholesome to the body and what not, so by the spirit of 
 discerning we must judge what doctrine is sound, and savoury, and 
 wholesome, and what not,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a noble discourse of Job's concerning the wisdom, power, and
 sovereignty of God, in ordering and disposing of all the affairs of the
 children of men, according to the counsel of his own will, which none
 dares gainsay or can resist. Take both him and them out of the
 controversy in which they were so warmly engaged, and they all spoke
 admirably well; but, in <I>that,</I> we sometimes scarcely know what to
 make of them. It were well if wise and good men, that differ in their
 apprehensions about minor things, would see it to be for their honour
 and comfort, and the edification of others, to dwell most upon those
 great things in which they are agreed. On this subject Job speaks like
 himself. Here are no passionate complaints, no peevish reflections, but
 every thing masculine and great.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He asserts the unsearchable wisdom and irresistible power of God. It
 is allowed that among men there is <I>wisdom and understanding,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 But it is to be found only with some few, <I>with the ancient,</I> and
 those who are blessed with length of days, who get it by long 
 experience and constant experience; and, when they have got the wisdom, 
 they have lost their strength and are unable to execute the results of 
 their wisdom. But now <I>with God there are</I> both <I>wisdom and 
 strength,</I> wisdom to design the best and strength to accomplish what 
 is designed. He does not get counsel or understanding, as we do, by 
 observation, but he has it essentially and eternally in himself,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 What is the wisdom of ancient men compared with the wisdom of the
 ancient of days! It is but little that we know, and less that we can 
 do; but God can do every thing, and <I>no thought can be withheld from 
 him.</I> Happy are those who have this God for their God, for they have 
 infinite wisdom and strength engaged for them. Foolish and fruitless 
 are all the attempts of men against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>He breaketh down, and it cannot be built again.</I> Note, There is 
 no contending with the divine providence, nor breaking the measures of 
 it. As he had said before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:12"><I>ch.</I>  ix. 12</A>),

 <I>He takes away, and who can hinder him?</I> so he says again. What
 God says cannot be gainsaid, nor what he does undone.  There is no 
 rebuilding what God will have to lie in ruins; witness the tower of 
 Babel, which the undertakers could not go on with, and the desolations 
 of Sodom and Gomorrah, which could never be repaired. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:2,Eze+26:14,Re+18:21">Isa. xxv. 2;
 Ezek. xxvi. 14; Rev. xviii. 21</A>.

 There is no releasing those whom God has condemned to a perpetual
 imprisonment; if <I>he shut up</I> a man by sickness, reduce him to 
 straits, and embarrass him in his affairs, <I>there can be no 
 opening.</I> He shuts up in the grave, and none can break open those 
 sealed doors--shuts up in hell, in chains of darkness, and none can 
 pass that great gulf fixed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He gives an instance, for the proof of this doctrine in nature, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 God has the command of <I>the waters, binds them as in a garment</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:4">Prov. xxx. 4</A>),

 holds them <I>in the hollow of his hand</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:12">Isa. xl. 12</A>);

 and he can punish the children of men either by the defect or by the
 excess of them. As men break the laws of virtue by extremes on each 
 hand, both defects and excesses, while virtue is in the mean, so God 
 corrects them by extremes, and denies them the mercy which is in the 
 mean.

 1. Great droughts are sometimes great judgments: <I>He withholds the 
 waters, and they dry up;</I> if the heaven be as brass, the earth is as 
 iron; if the rain be denied, fountains dry up and their streams are 
 wanted, fields are parched and their fruits are wanted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:7">Amos iv. 7</A>.

 2.  Great wet is sometimes a great judgment. He raises the waters, and
 <I>overturns the earth,</I> the productions of it, the buildings upon 
 it. A sweeping rain is said to <I>leave no food,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:3">Prov. xxviii. 3</A>.

 See how many ways God has of contending with a sinful people and taking
 from them abused, forfeited, mercies; and how utterly unable we are to 
 contend with him. If we might invert the order,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:15">this verse</A>

 would fitly refer to Noah's flood, that ever memorable instance of the
 divine power. God then, in wrath, sent the waters out, and they 
 overturned the earth; but in mercy he withheld them, shut the windows 
 of heaven and the fountains of the great deep, and then, in a little 
 time, they dried up.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He gives many instances of it in God's powerful management of the 
 children of men, crossing their purposes and serving his own by them 
 and upon them, overruling all their counsels, overpowering all their 
 attempts, and overcoming all their oppositions. What changes does God 
 make with men! what turns does he give them! how easily, how 
 surprisingly!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>With him are strength and reason</I> (so some translate it), 
 strength and consistency with himself: it is an elegant word in the 
 original. With him are the very quintessence and extract of wisdom. 
 <I>With him are power and all that is;</I> so some read it. He is what 
 he is of himself, and by him and in him all things subsist.  Having 
 this strength and wisdom, he knows how to make use, not only of those 
 who are wise and good, who willingly and designedly serve him, but even 
 of those who are foolish and bad, who, one would think, could be made 
 no way serviceable to the designs of his providence: <I>The deceived 
 and the deceiver are his;</I> the simplest men that are deceived are 
 not below his notice; the subtlest men that deceive cannot with all 
 their subtlety escape his cognizance. The world is full of deceit; the 
 one half of mankind cheats the other, and God suffers it to be so, and 
 from both will at last bring glory to himself. The deceivers make tools 
 of the deceived, but the great God makes tools of them both, wherewith 
 he works, and none can hinder him. He has wisdom and might enough to 
 manage all the fools and knaves in the world, and knows how to serve 
 his own purposes by them, notwithstanding the weakness of the one and 
 the wickedness of the other. When Jacob by a fraud got the blessing the 
 design of God's grace was served; when Ahab was drawn by a false 
 prophecy into an expedition that was his ruin the design of God's 
 justice was served; and in both <I>the deceived and the deceiver</I> 
 were at his disposal. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+14:9">Ezek. xiv. 9</A>.

 God would not suffer the sin of the deceiver, nor the misery of the
 deceived, if he knew not how to set bounds to both and bring glory to 
 himself out of both. <I>Hallelujah, the Lord God omnipotent</I> thus 
 reigns; and it is well he does, for otherwise there is so little wisdom 
 and so little honesty in the world that it would all have been in 
 confusion and ruin long ago.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He next descends to the particular instances of the wisdom and power 
 of God in the revolutions of states and kingdoms; for thence he fetches 
 his proofs, rather than from the like operations of Providence 
 concerning private persons and families, because the more high and 
 public the station is in which men are placed the more the changes that 
 befal them are taken notice of, and consequently the more illustriously 
 does Providence shine forth in them. And it is easy to argue, If God 
 can thus turn and toss the great ones of the earth, like a ball in a 
 large place (as the prophet speaks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:18">Isa. xxii. 18</A>),

 much more the little ones; and with him to whom states and kingdoms
 must submit it is surely the greatest madness for us to contend. Some 
 think that Job here refers to the extirpation of those powerful 
 nations, the Rephaim, the Zuzim, the Emim, and the Horites (mentioned

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+14:5,6,De+2:10,20">Gen. xiv. 5, 6; Deut. ii. 10, 20</A>),


 in which perhaps it was particularly noticed how strangely they were
 infatuated and enfeebled: if so, it is designed to show that whenever 
 the like is done in the affairs of nations it is God that does it, and 
 we must therein observe his sovereign dominion, even over those that 
 think themselves most powerful, politic, and absolute. Compare this 
 with that of Eliphaz,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:12-14"><I>ch.</I> v. 12</A>,

 &c. Let us gather up the particular
 changes here specified, which God makes upon persons, either for the 
 destruction of nations and the planting of others in their room or for 
 the turning out of a particular government and ministry and the 
 elevation of another in its room, which may be a blessing to the 
 kingdom; witness the glorious Revolution in our own land twenty years 
 ago, in which we saw as happy an exposition as ever was given of this 
 discourse of Job's. 

 (1.) Those that were wise are sometimes strangely infatuated, and in 
 this the hand of God must be acknowledged 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>He leadeth counsellors away spoiled,</I> as trophies of his victory 
 over them, spoiled of all the honour and wealth they have got by their 
 policy, nay, spoiled of the wisdom itself for which they have been 
 celebrated and the success they promised themselves in their projects.  
 His counsel stands, while all their devices are brought to nought and 
 their designs baffled, and so they are spoiled both of the satisfaction 
 and of the reputation of their wisdom. <I>He maketh the judges 
 fools.</I> By a work on their minds he deprives them of their 
 qualifications for business, and so they become really fools; and by 
 his disposal of their affairs he makes the issue and event of their 
 projects to be quite contrary to what they themselves intended, and so 
 he makes them look like fools. The counsel of Ahithophel, one in whom 
 this scripture was remarkably fulfilled, became foolishness, and he, 
 according to his name, <I>the brother of a fool.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+19:13">Isa. xix. 13</A>,
 
 <I>The princes of Zoan have become fools; they have seduced Egypt, even
 those that are the stay of the tribes thereof.</I> Let not the wise man 
 therefore glory in his wisdom, nor the ablest counsellors and judges be 
 proud of their station, but humbly depend upon God for the continuance 
 of their abilities. Even the aged, who seem to hold their wisdom by 
 prescription, and think they have got it by their own industry and 
 therefore have an indefeasible title to it, may yet be deprived of it, 
 and often are, by the infirmities of age, which make them twice 
 children: He <I>taketh away the understanding of the aged,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.
 
 The aged, who were most depended on for advice, fail those that
 depended on them. We read of an old and yet foolish king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:13">Eccl. iv. 13</A>.

 (2.) Those that were high and in authority are strangely brought down, 
 impoverished, and enslaved, and it is God that humbles them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):
 
 <I>He looseth the bond of kings,</I> and taketh from them the power 
 wherewith they ruled their subjects, perhaps enslaved them and ruled 
 them with rigour; he strips them of all the ensigns of their honour and 
 authority, and all the supports of their tyranny, unbuckles their 
 belts, so that the sword drops from their side, and then no marvel if 
 the crown quickly drops from their head, on which immediately follows 
 the <I>girding of their loins with a girdle,</I> a badge of servitude, 
 for servants went with their loins girt. Thus <I>he leads</I> great 
 <I>princes away spoiled</I> of all their power and wealth, and that in 
 which they pleased and prided themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Note, Kings are not exempt from God's jurisdiction. To us they are
 gods, but men to him, and subject to more than the common changes of 
 human life.

 (3.) Those that were strong are strangely weakened, and it is God that 
 weakens them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)

 and <I>overthrows the mighty.</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Strong bodies are weakened by age and sickness; powerful armies
 moulder and come to nothing, and their strength will not secure them 
 from a fatal overthrow. No force can stand before Omnipotence, no, not 
 that of Goliath.

 (4.) Those that were famed for eloquence, and entrusted with public 
 business, are strangely silenced, and have nothing to say 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):
 
 <I>He removeth away the speech of the trusty,</I> so that they cannot 
 speak as they intended and as they used to do, with freedom and 
 clearness, but blunder, and falter, and make nothing of it. Or they 
 cannot speak what they intended, but the contrary, as Balaam, who 
 blessed those whom he was called to curse. Let not the orator therefore 
 be proud of his rhetoric, nor use it to any bad purposes, lest God take 
 it away, who made man's mouth. 

 (5.) Those that were honoured and admired strangely fall into disgrace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 He <I>poureth contempt upon princes.</I> He leaves them to themselves 
 to do mean things, or alters the opinions of men concerning them. If 
 princes themselves dishonour God and despise him, if they offer 
 indignities to the people of God and trample upon them, they shall be 
 lightly esteemed, and God will pour contempt upon them. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:40">Ps. cvii. 40</A>.
 
 Commonly none more abject in themselves, nor more abused by others when
 they are down, than those who were haughty and insolent when they were 
 in power.

 (6.) That which was secret, and lay hidden, is strangely brought to 
 light and laid open 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>He discovers deep things out of darkness.</I> Plots closely laid are 
 discovered and defeated; wickedness closely committed and artfully 
 concealed is discovered, and the guilty are brought to condign 
 punishment--secret treasons 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:20">Eccl. x. 20</A>),

 secret murders, secret whoredoms. The cabinet-councils of princes are
 before God's eye,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+6:11">2 Kings vi. 11</A>.

 (7.) Kingdoms have their ebbings and flowings, their waxings and
 wanings; and both are from God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>):

 He sometimes <I>increases their numbers,</I> and enlarges their bounds, 
 so that they make a figure among the nations and become formidable; but 
 after a while, by some undiscerned cause perhaps, they are destroyed 
 and straitened, made few and poor, cut short and many of them cut off, 
 and so they are rendered despicable among their neighbours, and those 
 that were the head become the tail of the nations. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:38,39">Ps. cvii. 38, 39</A>.

 (8.) Those that were bold and courageous, and made nothing of dangers,
 are strangely cowed and dispirited; and this also is the Lord's doing
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people,</I> that were 
 their leaders and commanders, and were most famed for their martial 
 fire and great achievements; when any thing is to be done they are 
 heartless, and ready to flee at the shaking of a leaf. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:5">Ps. lxvi. 5</A>.

 (9.) Those that were driving on their projects with full speed are
 strangely bewildered and at a loss; they know not where they are nor 
 what they do, are unsteady in their counsels and uncertain in their 
 motions, off and on, this way and that way, wandering like men in a 
 desert 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 groping like men in the dark, and staggering like men in drink,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:25,Isa+59:10"><I>v.</I> 25. Isa. lix. 10</A>.

 Note, God can soon nonplus the deepest politicians and bring the
 greatest wits to their wits' end, to show that wherein they deal
 proudly he is above them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus are the revolutions of kingdoms wonderfully brought about by an
 overruling Providence. Heaven and earth are shaken, but the Lord sits
 King for ever, and with him we look for <I>a kingdom that cannot be
 shaken.</I></P>
