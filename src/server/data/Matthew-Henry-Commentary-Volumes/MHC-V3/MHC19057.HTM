 <BR><FONT SIZE=+2>PSALM LVII.</FONT>
 <HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=50>
 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is very much like that which goes next before it; it was 
 penned upon a like occasion, when David was both in danger of trouble 
 and in temptation to sin; it begins as that did, "Be merciful to me;" 
 the method also is the same. 

 I. He begins with prayer and complaint, yet not without some assurance
 of speeding in his request, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. He concludes with joy and praise,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:7-11">ver. 7-11</A>.

 So that hence we may take direction and encouragement, both in our 
 supplications and in our thanksgivings, and may offer both to God, in
 singing this psalm.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician, Al-taschith, Michtam <BR>of David,
 when he fled from Saul in the cave.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Be merciful unto me, O God, be
 merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the
 shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until <I>these</I>
 calamities be overpast.
 &nbsp; 2  I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth <I>all
 things</I> for me.
 &nbsp; 3  He shall send from heaven, and save me <I>from</I> the reproach of
 him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his
 mercy and his truth.
 &nbsp; 4  My soul <I>is</I> among lions: <I>and</I> I lie <I>even among</I> them that
 are set on fire, <I>even</I> the sons of men, whose teeth <I>are</I> spears
 and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.
 &nbsp; 5  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; <I>let</I> thy glory
 <I>be</I> above all the earth.
 &nbsp; 6  They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down:
 they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are
 fallen <I>themselves.</I> Selah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The title of this psalm has one word new in it, <I>Al-taschith--Destroy
 not.</I> Some make it to be only some known tune to which this psalm 
 was set; others apply it to the occasion and matter of the psalm. 
 <I>Destroy not;</I> that is, David would not let Saul be destroyed, 
 when now in the cave there was a fair opportunity of killing him, and 
 his servants would fain have done so. No, says David, <I>destroy him 
 not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:4,6">1 Sam. xxiv. 4, 6</A>.

 Or, rather, God would not let David be destroyed by Saul; he suffered
 him to persecute David, but still under this limitation, <I>Destroy him 
 hot;</I> as he permitted Satan to afflict Job, <I>Only save his 
 life.</I> David must not be destroyed, for <I>a blessing is in him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:8">Isa. lxv. 8</A>),

 even Christ, the best of blessings. When David was in the cave, in
 imminent peril, he here tells us what were the workings of his heart 
 towards God; and happy are those that have such good thoughts as these 
 in their minds when they are in danger!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He supports himself with faith and hope in God, and prayer to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 Seeing himself surrounded with enemies, he looks up to God with that 
 suitable prayer: <I>Be merciful to me, O Lord!</I> which he again 
 repeats, and it is no vain repetition: <I>Be merciful unto me.</I> It 
 was the publican's prayer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:13">Luke xviii. 13</A>.

 It is a pity that any should use it slightly and profanely, should cry,
 <I>God be merciful to us,</I> or, <I>Lord, have mercy upon us,</I> when 
 they mean only to express their wonder, or surprise, or vexation, but 
 God and his mercy are not in all their thoughts. It is with much devout 
 affection that David here prays, "<I>Be merciful unto me, O Lord!</I> 
 look with compassion upon me, and in thy love and pity redeem me." To 
 recommend himself to God's mercy, he here professes,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That all his dependence is upon God: <I>My soul trusteth in 
 thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 He did not only profess to trust in God, but his soul did indeed rely
 on God only, with a sincere devotion and self-dedication, and an entire 
 complacency and satisfaction. He goes to God, and, at the footstool of
 the throne of his grace, humbly professes his confidence in him: <I>In 
 the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge,</I> as the chickens take 
 shelter under the wings of the hen when the birds of prey are ready to 
 strike at them, <I>until these calamities be over-past.</I>

 (1.) He was confident his troubles would end well, in due time; 
 <I>these calamities will be over-past;</I> the storm will blow over. 
 <I>Non si male nunc et olim sic erit--Though now distressed, I shall 
 not always be so.</I> Our Lord Jesus comforted himself with this in his 
 sufferings,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:37">Luke xxii. 37</A>.

 <I>The things concerning me have an end.</I> 

 (2.) He was very easy under the divine protection in the mean time.

 [1.] He comforted himself in the goodness of God's nature, by which he 
 is inclined to succour and protect his people, as the hen is by 
 instinct to shelter her young ones. God comes upon the wing to the help 
 of his people, which denotes a speedy deliverance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:10">Ps. xviii. 10</A>);

 and he takes them under his wing, which denotes warmth and refreshment,
 even when the calamities are upon them; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37">Matt. xxiii. 37</A>.

 [2.] In the promise of his word and the covenant of his grace; for it
 may refer to the out-stretched <I>wings of the cherubim,</I> between
 which God is said to dwell 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:1">Ps. lxxx. 1</A>)

 and whence he gave his oracles. "To God, as the God of grace, will I
 fly, and his promise shall be my refuge, and a sure passport it will be 
 through all these danger." God, by his promise, offers himself to us, 
 to be trusted; we by our faith must accept of him, and put our trust in 
 him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That all his desire is towards God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>I will cry unto God most high,</I> for succour and relief; to him
 that is most high will I lift up my soul, and pray earnestly, even 
 <I>unto God that performs all things for me.</I>" Note,

 (1.) In every thing that befalls us we ought to see and own the hand of 
 God; whatever is done is of his performing; in it his counsel is 
 accomplished and the scripture is fulfilled. 

 (2.) Whatever God performs concerning his people, it will appear, in 
 the issue, to have been performed for them and for their benefit. 
 Though God be high, <I>most high,</I> yet he condescends so low as to 
 take care that all things be made to work for good to them. 

 (3.) This is a good reason why we should, in all our straits and 
 difficulties, cry unto him, not only pray, but pray earnestly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That all his expectation is from God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>He shall send from heaven, and save me.</I> Those that make God
 their only refuge, and fly to him by faith and prayer, may be sure of 
 salvation, in his way and time. Observe here,

 (1.) Whence he expects the salvation--from heaven. Look which way he
 will, in this earth, refuge fails, no help appears; but he looks for it 
 from heaven. Those that lift up their hearts to things above may thence 
 expect all good. 

 (2.) What the salvation is that he expects. He trusts that God will 
 save him <I>from the reproach of those that would swallow him up,</I> 
 that aimed to ruin him, and, in the mean time, did all they could to 
 vex him. Some read it, <I>He shall send from heaven and save me, for he 
 has put to shame him that would swallow me up;</I> he has disappointed 
 their designs against me hitherto, and therefore he will perfect my 
 deliverance. 

 (3.) What he will ascribe his salvation to: <I>God shall send forth his 
 mercy and truth.</I> God is good in himself and faithful to every word 
 that he has spoken, and so he makes it appear when he works deliverance 
 for his people. We need no more to make us happy than to have the 
 benefit of the mercy and truth of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:10">Ps. xxv. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He represents the power and malice of his enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>My soul is among lions.</I> So fierce and furious was Saul, and
 those about him, against David, that he might have been as safe in a 
 den of lions as among such men, who were continually roaring against 
 him and ready to make a prey of him. They are set on fire, and breathe 
 nothing but flame; they set on fire the course of nature, inflaming one 
 another against David, and <I>they were themselves set on fire of 
 hell,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:6">Jam. iii. 6</A>.

 They were sons of men, from whom one might have expected something of
 the reason and compassion of a man; but they were beasts of prey in the 
 shape of men; their <I>teeth,</I> which they gnashed upon him, and with 
 which they hoped to tear him to pieces and to eat him up, <I>were 
 spears and arrows</I> fitted for mischiefs and murders; and their 
 <I>tongue,</I> with which they cursed him and wounded his reputation, 
 was <I>as a sharp sword</I> to cut and kill; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:10">Ps. xlii. 10</A>.

 A spiteful tongue is a dangerous weapon, wherewith Satan's instruments 
 fight against God's people. He describes their malicious projects 
 against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 and shows the issue of them: "<I>They have prepared a net for my
 steps,</I> in which to take me, that I might not again escape out of 
 their hands; <I>they have digged a pit before me,</I> that I might, ere 
 I was aware, run headlong into it." See the policies of the church's 
 enemies; see the pains they take to do mischief. But let us see what 
 comes of it.

 1. It is indeed some disturbance to David: <I>My soul is bowed
 down.</I> It made him droop, and hang the head, to think that there 
 should be those that bore him so much ill-will. But, 

 2. It was destruction to themselves; they dug a pit for David, <I>into 
 the midst whereof they have fallen.</I> The mischief they designed 
 against David returned upon themselves, and they were embarrassed in 
 their counsels; then when Saul was pursuing David the Philistines were 
 invading <I>him;</I> nay, in the cave, when Saul thought David should 
 fall into his hands, he fell into the hands of David, and lay at his 
 mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He prays to God to glorify himself and his own great name 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 "Whatever becomes of me and my interest, <I>be thou exalted, O God!
 above the heavens,</I> be thou praised by the holy angels, those 
 glorious inhabitants of the upper world; <I>and let thy glory be 
 above</I> or over <I>all the earth;</I> let all the inhabitants of this 
 earth be brought to know and praise thee." Thus God's glory should lie 
 nearer our hearts, and we should be more concerned for it, than for any
 particular interests of our own. When David was in the greatest 
 distress and disgrace he did not pray, <I>Lord, exalt me,</I> but, 
 <I>Lord, exalt thy own name.</I> Thus the Son of David, when his soul 
 was troubled, and he prayed, <I>Father, save me from this hour,</I> 
 immediately withdrew that petition, and presented this in the room of 
 it, <I>For this cause came I to this hour; Father, glorify thy 
 name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:27,28">John xii. 27, 28</A>.

 Or it may be taken as a plea to enforce his petition for deliverance:
 "Lord, <I>send from heaven to save me,</I> and thereby thou wilt 
 glorify thyself as the God both of heaven and earth." Our best 
 encouragement in prayer is taken from the glory of God, and to that 
 therefore, more than our own comfort, we should have an eye in all our 
 petitions for particular mercies; for this is made the first petition 
 in the Lord's prayer, as that which regulates and directs all the rest, 
 <I>Father in heaven, hallowed by thy name.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and
 give praise.
 &nbsp; 8  Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I <I>myself</I> will
 awake early.
 &nbsp; 9  I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing
 unto thee among the nations.

 <I>be</I> above all the earth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 How strangely is the tune altered here! David's prayers and complaints, 
 by the lively actings of faith, are here, all of a sudden, turned into 
 praises and thanksgivings; his sackcloth is loosed, he is girded with 
 gladness, and his hallelujahs are as fervent as his hosannas. This 
 should make us in love with prayer, that, sooner or later, it will be 
 swallowed up in praise. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he prepares himself for the duty of praise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>My heart is fixed, O God! my heart is fixed.</I> My heart is
 <I>erect,</I> or <I>lifted up</I> (so some), which was bowed down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 <I>My heart is fixed,</I>

 1. With reference to God's providences; it is prepared for every event,
 being <I>stayed upon God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:7,Isa+26:3">Ps. cxii. 7; Isa. xxvi. 3</A>.

 <I>My heart is fixed,</I> and then <I>none of these things move me,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+20:24">Acts xx. 24</A>

 If by the grace of God we be brought into this even composed frame of
 spirit, we have great reason to be thankful. 

 2. With reference to the worship of God: <I>My heart is fixed</I> to 
 <I>sing and give praise.</I> It is implied that the heart is the main 
 thing required in all acts of devotion; nothing is done to purpose, in 
 religion, further than it is done with the heart. The heart must be 
 fixed, fixed for the duty, fitted and put in frame for it, fixed in the 
 duty by a close application, <I>attending on the Lord without 
 distraction.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he excites himself to the duty of praise 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Awake up my glory,</I> that is, my tongue (our tongue is our glory,
 and never more so than when it is employed in praising God), or my 
 soul, that must be first awakened; dull and sleepy devotions will never 
 be acceptable to God. We must stir up ourselves, and all that is within 
 us, to praise God; with a holy fire must that sacrifice be kindled, and 
 ascend in a holy flame. David's tongue will lead, and his psaltery and 
 harp will follow, in these hymns of praise. <I>I myself will awake,</I> 
 not only, "I will not be dead, and drowsy, and careless, in this work," 
 but, "I will be in the most lively frame, as one newly awakened out of 
 a refreshing sleep." He will awake <I>early</I> to this work, early in 
 the morning, to begin the day with God, early in the beginnings of a 
 mercy. When God is coming towards us with his favours we must go forth 
 to meet him with our praises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How he pleases himself, and (as I may say) even prides himself, in 
 the work of praise; so far is he from being ashamed to own his 
 obligations to God, and dependence upon him, that he resolves to 
 <I>praise him among the people</I> and to <I>sing unto him among the 
 nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.
 
 This intimates,

 1. That his own heart was much affected and enlarged in praising God;
 he would even make the earth ring with his sacred songs, that all might 
 take notice how much he thought himself indebted to the goodness of 
 God. 

 2. That he desired to bring others in to join with him in praising God. 
 He will publish God's praises <I>among the people,</I> that the 
 knowledge, and fear, and love of God might be propagated, and the ends 
 of the earth might see his salvation. When David was driven out into 
 heathen lands he would not only not worship their gods, but he would 
 openly avow his veneration for the God of Israel, would take his 
 religion along with him wherever he went, would endeavour to bring 
 others in love with it, and leave the sweet savour of it behind him.
 David, in his psalms, which fill the universal church, and will to the 
 end of time, may be said to be still <I>praising God among the 
 people</I> and <I>singing to him among the nations;</I> for all good 
 people make use of his words in praising God. Thus St. John, in his
 writings, is said to <I>prophesy again before many peoples and 
 nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+10:11">Rev. x. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How he furnishes himself with matter for praise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 That which was the matter of his hope and comfort (<I>God shall send 
 forth his mercy and his truth,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 is here the matter of his thanksgiving: <I>Thy mercy is great unto the 
 heavens,</I> great beyond conception and expression; and <I>thy truth 
 unto the clouds,</I> great beyond discovery, for what eye can reach 
 that which is wrapped up in the clouds? God's mercy and truth reach to 
 the heavens, for they will bring all such to heaven as lay up their 
 treasure in them and build their hopes upon them. God's mercy and truth 
 are praised even to the heavens, that is, by all the bright and blessed 
 inhabitants of the upper world, who are continually exalting God's 
 praises to the highest, while David, on earth, is endeavouring to 
 spread his praises to the furthest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. How he leaves it at last to God to glorify his own name 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 <I>Be thou exalted, O God!</I> The same words which he had used
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)
 
 to sum up his prayers in here he uses again (and no vain repetition) to
 sum up his praises in: "Lord, I desire to exalt thy name, and that all 
 the creatures may exalt it; but what can the best of us do towards it?
 Lord, take the work into thy own hands; do it thyself: <I>Be thou 
 exalted, O God!</I> In the praises of the church triumphant thou art 
 exalted to the heavens, and in the praises of the church militant thy 
 glory is throughout all the earth; but thou art above all the blessing 
 and praise of both 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+9:5">Neh. ix. 5</A>),

 and therefore, Lord, exalt thyself <I>above the heavens</I> and
 <I>above all the earth. Father, glorify thy own name. Thou hast 
 glorified it, glorify it yet again.</I>"</P>
