 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is calculated for the meridian of princes' courts and courts 
 of justice, not in Israel only, but in other nations; yet it was 
 probably penned primarily for the use of the magistrates of Israel, the 
 great Sanhedrim, and their other elders who were in places of power, 
 and perhaps by David's direction. This psalm is designed to make kings 
 wise, and "to instruct the judges of the earth" (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:2,10">2 and 10</A>),

 to tell them their duty as

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:3">2 Sam. xxiii. 3</A>),

 and to tell them of their faults as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:1">Ps. lviii. 1</A>.

 We have here, 

 I. The dignity of magistracy and its dependence upon God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II.  The duty of magistrates, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III. The degeneracy of bad magistrates and the mischief they do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:2,5">ver. 2, 5</A>.

 IV.  Their doom read, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 V. The desire and prayer of all good people that the kingdom of God may 
 be set up more and more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:8">ver. 8</A>.

 Though magistrates may most closely apply this psalm to themselves, yet 
 we may any of us sing it with understanding when we give glory to God, 
 in singing it, as presiding in all public affairs, providing for the 
 protection of injured innocency, and ready to punish the most powerful 
 injustice, and when we comfort ourselves with a belief of his present 
 government and with the hopes of his future judgment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  God standeth in the congregation of the
 mighty; he judgeth among the gods.
 &nbsp; 2  How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of

 and needy.
 &nbsp; 4  Deliver the poor and needy: rid <I>them</I> out of the hand of the

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God's supreme presidency and power in all councils and courts 
 asserted and laid down, as a great truth necessary to be believed both 
 by princes and subjects 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>God stands,</I> as chief director, <I>in the congregation of the 
 mighty,</I> the mighty One, <I>in coetu fortis--in the councils of the 
 prince,</I> the supreme magistrate, and he judges among the gods, the 
 inferior magistrates; both the legislative and the executive power of 
 princes is under his eye and his hand. Observe here,

 1. The power and honour of magistrates; they are the <I>mighty.</I>
 They are so in authority, for the public good (it is a great power that 
 they are entrusted with), and they ought to be so in wisdom and 
 courage. They are, in the Hebrew dialect, called <I>gods;</I> the same 
 word is used for these subordinate governors that is used for the 
 sovereign ruler of the world. They are <I>elohim.</I> Angels are so 
 called both because they are great in power and might and because God 
 is pleased to make use of their service in the government of this lower 
 world; and magistrates in an inferior capacity are likewise the 
 ministers of his providence in general, for the keeping up of order and 
 peace in human societies, and particularly of his justice and goodness 
 in punishing evil-doers and protecting those that do well.  Good 
 magistrates, who answer the ends of magistracy, are as God; some of his 
 honour is put upon them; they are his vicegerents, and great blessings 
 to any people. <I>A divine sentence is in the lips of the king,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:10">Prov. xvi. 10</A>.

 But, as <I>roaring lions and ranging bears,</I> so are <I>wicked rulers 
 over the poor people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:15">Prov. xxviii. 15</A>.

 2. A good form and constitution of government intimated, and that is a
 mixed monarchy like ours; here is the mighty one, the sovereign, and
 here is his congregation, his privy-council, his parliament, his bench 
 of judges, who are called the <I>gods.</I> 

 3. God's incontestable sovereignty maintained in and over all the
 congregations of the mighty.  <I>God stands,</I> he <I>judges among 
 them;</I> they have their power from him and are accountable to him. 
 <I>By him kings reign.</I> He is present at all their debates, and 
 inspects all they say and do, and what is said and done amiss will be 
 called over again, and they reckoned with for their 
 mal-administrations. God has their hearts in his hands, and their 
 tongues too, and he directs them <I>which way soever he will,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+21:1">Prov. xxi. 1</A>.

 So that he has a negative voice in all their resolves, and his counsels 
 shall stand, whatever devices are in men's hearts. He makes what use he 
 pleases of them, and serves his own purposes and designs by them; 
 though their hearts little think so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:7">Isa. x. 7</A>.

 Let magistrates consider this and be awed by it; God is with them in
 the judgment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+19:6,De+1:17">2 Chron. xix. 6; Deut. i. 17</A>.

 Let subjects consider this and be comforted with it; for good princes
 and good judges, who mean well, are under a divine direction, and bad 
 ones, who mean ever so ill, are under a divine restraint.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A charge given to all magistrates to do good with their power, as 
 they will answer it to him by whom they are entrusted with it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 1. They are to be the protectors of those who lie exposed to injury and 
 the patrons of those who want advice and assistance: <I>Defend the 
 poor,</I> who have no money wherewith to make friends or fee counsel, 
 <I>and the fatherless,</I> who, while they are young and unable to help 
 themselves, have lost those who would have been the guides of their 
 youth.  Magistrates, as they must be fathers to their country in 
 general, so particularly to those in it who are fatherless. Are they 
 called <I>gods?</I> Herein they must be followers of him, they must be 
 <I>fathers of the fatherless.</I> Job was so, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:12">Job xxix. 12</A>.

 2. They are to administer justice impartially, and do <I>right to the 
 afflicted and needy,</I> who, being weak and helpless, have often 
 wrongs done them; and will be in danger of losing all if magistrates do 
 not, <I>ex officio--officially,</I> interpose for their relief. If a 
 poor man has an honest cause, his poverty must be no prejudice to his 
 cause, how great and powerful soever those are that contend with him. 

 3. They are to rescue those who have already fallen into the hands of 
 oppressors and deliver them. 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:4"><I>v.</I>  4</A>):

 <I>Rid them out of the hand of the wicked.  Avenge them of their 
 adversary,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+18:3">Luke xviii. 3</A>.

 These are clients whom there is nothing to be got by, no pay for
 serving them, no interest by obliging them; yet these are those whom 
 judges and magistrates must concern themselves for, whose comfort they 
 must consult and whose cause they must espouse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A charge drawn up against bad magistrates, who neglect their duty 
 and abuse their power, forgetting that God standeth among them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:2,5"><I>v.</I> 2, 5</A>.
 
 Observe,

 1. What the sin is they are here charged with; they <I>judge
 unjustly,</I> contrary to the rules of equity and the dictates of their 
 consciences, giving judgment against those who have right on their 
 side, out of malice and ill-will, or for those who have an unrighteous 
 cause, out of favour and partial affection. To do unjustly is bad, but 
 to judge unjustly is much worse, because it is doing wrong under colour 
 of right; against such acts of injustice there is least fence for the 
 injured and by them encouragement is given to the injurious. It was as 
 great an evil as any Solomon saw under the sun when he observed <I>the 
 place of judgment, that iniquity was there,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:16,Isa+5:7">Eccl. iii. 16; Isa. v. 7</A>.
 
 They not only accepted the persons of the rich because they were rich,
 though that is bad enough, but (which is much worse) they <I>accepted 
 the persons of the wicked</I> because they were wicked; they not only 
 countenanced them in their wickedness, but loved them the better for 
 it, and fell in with their interests. Woe unto thee, O land! when thy 
 judges are such as these. 

 2. What was the cause of this sin. They were told plainly enough that 
 it was their office and duty to protect and deliver the poor; it was 
 many a time given them in charge; yet they judge unjustly, for <I>they 
 know not, neither will they understand.</I> They do not care to hear 
 their duty; they will not take pains to study it; they have no desire 
 to take things right, but are governed by interest, not by reason or 
 justice. <I>A gift in secret blinds their eyes.</I> They know not 
 because they will not understand.  None so blind as those that will not 
 see. They have baffled their own consciences, and so they walk on in 
 darkness, not knowing nor caring what they do nor whither they go. 
 Those that walk on in darkness are walking on to everlasting darkness. 

 3. What were the consequences of this sin: <I>All the foundations of 
 the earth</I> (or <I>of the land) are out of course.</I> When justice 
 is perverted what good can be expected? <I>The earth and all the 
 inhabitants thereof are dissolved,</I> as the psalmist speaks in a like 
 case,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:3">Ps. lxxv. 3</A>.

 The miscarriages of public persons are public mischiefs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Earthly gods abased and brought down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 The dignity of their character is acknowledged

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>I have said, You are gods.</I> They have been honoured with the name 
 and title of gods. God himself called them so in the statute against 
 treasonable words

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:28">Exod. xxii. 28</A>,

 <I>Thou shalt not revile the gods.</I> And, if they have this style
 from the fountain of honour, who can dispute it? But what is man, that 
 he should be thus magnified? He called them <I>gods</I> because <I>unto 
 them the word of God came,</I> so our Saviour expounds it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:35">John x. 35</A>);
 
 they had a commission from God, and were delegated and appointed by him
 to be the shields of the earth, the conservators of the public peace,
 and revengers to execute wrath upon those that disturb it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+13:4">Rom.  xiii. 4</A>.
 
 All of them are in this sense <I>children of the Most High.</I> God has
 put some of his honour upon them, and employs them in his providential
 government of the world, as David made his sons chief rulers. Or,
 "Because <I>I said, You are gods,</I> you have carried the honour
 further than was intended and have imagined yourselves to be <I>the
 children of the Most High,</I>" as the king of Babylon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:14">Isa. xiv. 14</A>),
 
 <I>I will be like the Most High,</I> and the king of Tyre 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+28:2">Ezek. xxviii. 2</A>),
 
 <I>Thou hast set thy heart as the heart of God.</I> It is a hard thing
 for men to have so much honour put upon them by the hand of God, and so 
 much honour paid them, as ought to be by the children of men, and not 
 to be proud of it and puffed up with it, and so to think of themselves 
 above what is meet. But here follows a mortifying consideration: <I>You 
 shall die like men.</I> This may be taken either, 

 1. As the punishment of bad magistrates, such as judged unjustly, and
 by their misrule put the <I>foundations of the earth out of course.</I> 
 God will reckon with them, and will cut them off in the midst of their 
 pomp and prosperity; they shall die like other wicked men, <I>and fall 
 like one of the</I> heathen <I>princes</I> (and their being Israelites 
 shall not secure them anymore than their being judges) or like one of 
 the angels that sinned, or like one of the giants of the old world. 
 Compare this with that which Elihu observed concerning the mighty 
 oppressors in his time.  
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:26">Job xxxiv. 26</A>,

 <I>He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others.</I> Let
 those that abuse their power know that God will take both it and their 
 lives from them; for wherein they deal proudly he will <I>show himself 
 above them.</I> Or,

 2. As the period of the glory of all magistrates in this world. Let 
 them not be puffed up with their honour nor neglect their work, but let 
 the consideration of their mortality be both mortifying to their pride 
 and quickening to their duty. "You are called gods, but you have no 
 patent for immortality; <I>you shall die like men,</I> like common men; 
 and <I>like one of them, you, O princes! shall fall.</I>" Note, Kings 
 and princes, all the judges of the earth, though they are gods to us, 
 are men to God, and shall die like men, and all their honour shall be 
 laid in the dust.  <I>Mors sceptra ligonibus &aelig;quat--Death mingles 
 sceptres with spades.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The God of heaven exalted and raised high, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+82:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 The psalmist finds it to little purpose to reason with these proud
 oppressors; they turned a deaf ear to all he said and walked on in 
 darkness; and therefore he looks up to God, appeals to him, and begs of 
 him <I>to take unto himself his great power: Arise, O God! judge the 
 earth;</I> and, when he prays that he would do it, he believes that he 
 will do it: <I>Thou shalt inherit all nations.</I> This has respect,

 1. To the kingdom of providence. God governs the world, sets up and
 puts down whom he pleases; he inherits all nations, has an absolute 
 dominion over them, to dispose of them as a man does of his 
 inheritance. This we are to believe and to comfort ourselves with, that 
 the earth is not given so much <I>into the hands of the wicked,</I> the 
 wicked rulers, as we are tempted to think it is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:24">Job ix. 24</A>.

 But God has reserved the power to himself and overrules them. In this
 faith we must pray, "<I>Arise, O God! judge the earth,</I> appear 
 against those that judge unjustly, and set shepherds over thy people 
 after thy own heart." There is a righteous God to whom we may have 
 recourse, and on whom we may depend for the effectual relief of all 
 that find themselves aggrieved by unjust judges.

 2. To the kingdom of the Messiah. It is a prayer for the hastening of 
 that, that Christ would come, who is to judge the earth, and that 
 promise is pleaded, that God shall <I>give him the heathen for his 
 inheritance.</I> Thou, O Christ! shalt <I>inherit all nations,</I> and 
 be the governor over them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:8,22:28">Ps. ii. 8; xxii. 28</A>.

 Let the second coming of Christ set to-rights all these disorders.
 There are two words with which we may comfort ourselves and one another
 in reference to the mismanagements of power among men: one is 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:6">Rev. xix. 6</A>,
 
 <I>Hallelujah, the Lord God omnipotent reigneth;</I> the other is
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:20">Rev. xxii. 20</A>,
 
 <I>Surely, I come quickly.</I></P>
