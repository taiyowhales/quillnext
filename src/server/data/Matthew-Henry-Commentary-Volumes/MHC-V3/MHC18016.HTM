 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter begins Job's reply to that discourse of Eliphaz which we 
 had in the foregoing chapter; it is but the second part of the same 
 song of lamentation with which he had before bemoaned himself, and is 
 set to the same melancholy tune. 

 I. He upbraids his friends with their unkind usage of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. He represents his own case as very deplorable upon all accounts,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:6-16">ver. 6-16</A>.

 III. He still holds fast his integrity, concerning which he appeals to
 God's righteous judgment from the unrighteous censures of his friends,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then Job answered and said,
 &nbsp; 2  I have heard many such things: miserable comforters <I>are</I> ye
 all.
 &nbsp; 3  Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that
 thou answerest?
 &nbsp; 4  I also could speak as ye <I>do:</I> if your soul were in my soul's
 stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at
 you.
 &nbsp; 5  <I>But</I> I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of
 my lips should assuage <I>your grief.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Both Job and his friends took the same way that disputants commonly 
 take, which is to undervalue one another's sense, and wisdom, and 
 management. The longer the saw of contention is drawn the hotter it 
 grows; and the <I>beginning of</I> this sort of <I>strife is as the 
 letting forth of water; therefore leave it off before it be meddled 
 with.</I> Eliphaz had represented Job's discourses as idle, and 
 unprofitable, and nothing to the purpose; and Job here gives his the 
 same character. Those who are free in passing such censures must expect 
 to have them retorted; it is easy, it is endless: but <I>cui bono?--what
 good does it do?</I> It will stir up men's passions, but will never 
 convince their judgments, nor set truth in a clear light. Job here 
 reproves Eliphaz, 

 1. For needless repetitions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>I have heard many such things.</I> You tell me nothing but what I
 knew before, nothing but what you yourselves have before said; you 
 offer nothing new; it is the same thing over and over again." This Job 
 thinks as great a trial of his patience as almost any of his troubles. 
 The inculcating of the same things thus by an adversary is indeed 
 provoking and nauseous, but by a teacher it is often necessary, and 
 must not be grievous to the learner, to whom <I>precept must be upon 
 precept, and line upon line.</I> Many things we have heard which it is 
 good for us to hear again, that we may understand and remember them 
 better, and be more affected with them and influenced by them.

 2. For unskilful applications. They came with a design to comfort him,
 but they went about it very awkwardly, and, when they touched Job's 
 case, quite mistook it: "<I>Miserable comforters are you all,</I> who, 
 instead of offering any thing to alleviate the affliction, add 
 affliction to it, and make it yet more grievous." The patient's case is 
 sad indeed when his medicines are poisons and his physicians his worst 
 disease. What Job says here of his friends is true of all creatures, in 
 comparison with God, and, one time or other, we shall be made to see it 
 and own it, that miserable comforters are they all. When we are under 
 convictions of sin, terrors of conscience, and the arrests of death, it 
 is only the blessed Spirit that can comfort effectually; all others, 
 without him, do it miserably, and sing songs to a heavy heart, to no 
 purpose. 

 3. For endless impertinence. Job wishes that <I>vain words might have 
 an end,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 If vain, it were well that they were never begun, and the sooner they 
 are ended the better. Those who are so wise as to speak to the purpose 
 will be so wise as to know when they have said enough of a thing and 
 when it is time to break off. 

 4. For causeless obstinacy. <I>What emboldeneth thee, that thou
 answerest?</I> It is a great piece of confidence, and unaccountable, to 
 charge men with those crimes which we cannot prove upon them, to pass a 
 judgment on men's spiritual state upon the view of their outward 
 condition, and to re-advance those objections which have been again and 
 again answered, as Eliphaz did. 

 5. For the violation of the sacred laws of friendship, doing by his
 brother as he would not have been done by and as his brother would not 
 have done by him. This is a cutting reproof, and very affecting,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 (1.) He desires his friends, in imagination, for a little while, to 
 change conditions with him, to put their souls in his soul's stead, to 
 suppose themselves in misery like him and him at ease like them. This 
 was no absurd or foreign supposition, but what might quickly become 
 true in fact. So strange, so sudden, frequently, are the vicissitudes 
 of human affairs, and such the turns of the wheel, that the spokes soon 
 change places. Whatever our brethren's sorrows are, we ought by 
 sympathy to make them our own, because we know not how soon they may be 
 so. 

 (2.) He represents the unkindness of their conduct towards him, by 
 showing what he could do to them if they were in his condition: <I>I 
 could speak as you do.</I> It is an easy thing to trample upon those 
 that are down, and to find fault with what those say that are in 
 extremity of pain and affliction: "<I>I could heap up words against 
 you,</I> as you do against me; and how would you like it? how would you 
 bear it?" 

 (3.) He shows them what they should do, by telling them what in that 
 case he would do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>"I would strengthen you,</I> and say all I could to assuage your
 grief, but nothing to aggravate it." It is natural to sufferers to 
 think what they would do if the tables were turned. But perhaps our 
 hearts may deceive us; we know not what we should do. We find it easier 
 to discern the reasonableness and importance of a command when we have 
 occasion to claim the benefit of it than when we have occasion to do 
 the duty of it. See what is the duty we owe to our brethren in their 
 affliction.

 [1.] We should say and do all we can to strengthen them, suggesting to 
 them such considerations as are proper to encourage their confidence in 
 God and to support their sinking spirits. Faith and patience are the 
 strength of the afflicted; whatever helps these graces confirms the 
 feeble knees. 

 [2.] To assuage their grief--the causes of their grief, if possible, or 
 at least their resentment of those causes. Good words cost nothing; but 
 they may be of good service to those that are in sorrow, not only as it 
 is some comfort to them to see their friends concerned for them, but as 
 they may be so reminded of that which, through the prevalency of grief, 
 was forgotten. Though hard words (we say) break no bones, yet kind 
 words may help to make broken bones rejoice; and those have the 
 <I>tongue of the learned</I> that know how to <I>speak a word in season 
 to the weary.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and <I>though</I> I
 forbear, what am I eased?
 &nbsp; 7  But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my
 company.
 &nbsp; 8  And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, <I>which</I> is a witness
 <I>against me:</I> and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to
 my face.
 &nbsp; 9  He teareth <I>me</I> in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon
 me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
 &nbsp; 10  They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten
 me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves
 together against me.
 &nbsp; 11  God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over
 into the hands of the wicked.
 &nbsp; 12  I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also
 taken <I>me</I> by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for
 his mark.
 &nbsp; 13  His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins
 asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the
 ground.
 &nbsp; 14  He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me
 like a giant.
 &nbsp; 15  I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in
 the dust.
 &nbsp; 16  My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids <I>is</I> the
 shadow of death;
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job's complaint is here as bitter as any where in all his discourses, 
 and he is at a stand whether to smother it or to give it vent. 
 Sometimes the one and sometimes the other is a relief to the afflicted, 
 according as the temper or the circumstances are; but Job found help by 
 neither, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 1. Sometimes giving vent to grief gives ease; but, "<I>Though I 
 speak</I>" (says Job), "<I>my grief is not assuaged,</I> my spirit is 
 never the lighter for the pouring out of my complaint; nay, what I 
 speak is so misconstrued as to be turned to the aggravation of my 
 grief." 

 2. At other times keeping silence makes the trouble the easier and the
 sooner forgotten; but (says Job) <I>though I forbear</I> I am never the 
 nearer; <I>what am I eased?</I> If he complained he was censured as 
 passionate; if not, as sullen. If he maintained his integrity, that was 
 his crime; if he made no answer to their accusations, his silence was 
 taken for a confession of his guilt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is a doleful representation of Job's grievances. O what reason 
 have we to bless God that we are not making such complaints! He 
 complains,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That his family was scattered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>He hath made me weary,</I> weary of speaking, weary of forbearing,
 weary of my friends, weary of life itself; my journey through the world 
 proves so very uncomfortable that I am quite tired with it." This made 
 it as tiresome as any thing, that all his company was made desolate, 
 his children and servants being killed and the poor remains of his 
 great household dispersed. The company of good people that used to meet 
 at his house for religious worship, was now scattered, and he spent his 
 sabbaths in silence and solitude. He had company indeed, but such as he 
 would rather have been without, for they seemed to triumph in his 
 desolation. If lovers and friends are put far from us, we must see and 
 own God's hand in it, making our company desolate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That his body was worn away with diseases and pains, so that he had 
 become a perfect skeleton, nothing but skin and bones, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 His face was furrowed, not with age, but sickness: <I>Thou hast filled
 me with wrinkles.</I> His flesh was wasted with the running of his sore 
 boils, so that <I>his leanness rose up in him,</I> that is, his bones, 
 that before were not seen, stuck out,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:21"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 21</A>.

 These are called <I>witnesses against him,</I> witnesses of God's
 displeasure against him, and such witnesses as his friends produced 
 against him to prove him a wicked man. Or, "They are witnesses 
 <I>for</I> me, that my complaint is not causeless," or "witnesses 
 <I>to</I> me, that I am a dying man, and must be gone shortly."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That his enemy was a terror to him, threatened him, frightened 
 him, looked sternly upon him, and gave all the indications of rage 
 against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>He tears me in his wrath.</I> But who is this enemy?

 1. Eliphaz, who showed himself very much exasperated against him, and 
 perhaps had expressed himself with such marks of indignation as are 
 here mentioned: at least, what he said tore Job's good name and 
 thundered nothing but terror to him; his eyes were sharpened to spy out 
 matter of reproach against Job, and very barbarously both he and the 
 rest of them used him. Or, 

 2. Satan. He was his enemy that hated him, and perhaps, by the divine
 permission, terrified him with apparitions, as (some think) he 
 terrified our Saviour, which put him into his agonies in the garden; 
 and thus he aimed to make him curse God. It is not improbable that this 
 is the enemy he means. Or,

 (3.) God himself. If we understand it of him, the expressions are
 indeed as rash as any he used. God hates none of his creatures; but 
 Job's melancholy did thus represent to him the terrors of the Almighty: 
 and nothing can be more grievous to a good man than to apprehend God to 
 be his enemy. If the wrath of a king be as messengers of death, what is 
 the wrath of the King of kings!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That all about him were abusive to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 They came upon him with open mouth to devour him, as if they would
 swallow him alive, so terrible were their threats and so scornful was 
 their conduct to him.  They offered him all the indignities they could 
 invent, and even smote him <I>on the cheek;</I> and herein many were 
 confederate. <I>They gathered themselves together against him,</I> even 
 the abjects,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:15">Ps. xxxv. 15</A>.

 Herein Job was a type of Christ, as many of the ancients make him:
 these very expressions are used in the predictions of his sufferings,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:13">Ps. xxii. 13</A>,
 
 <I>They gaped upon me with their mouths;</I> and

 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:1">Mic. v. 1</A>),

 <I>They shall smite the Judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek,</I>
 which was literally fulfilled,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:67">Matt. xxvi. 67</A>.

 How were those increased that troubled him!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That God, instead of delivering him out of their hands, as he hoped, 
 delivered him into their hands 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>He hath turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</I> They could
 have had no power against him if it had not been given them from above. 
 He therefore looks beyond them to God who gave them their commission, 
 as David did when Shimei cursed him; but he thinks it strange, and 
 almost thinks it hard, that those should have power against him who 
 were God's enemies as much as his. God sometimes makes use of wicked 
 men as his sword to one another

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:13">Ps. xvii. 13</A>)

 and his rod to his own children, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:5">Isa. x. 5</A>.

 Herein also Job was a type of Christ, who was delivered into wicked
 hands, to be crucified and slain, by the <I>determinate counsel and 
 fore-knowledge of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:23">Acts ii. 23</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. That God not only delivered him into the hands of the wicked, but 
 took him into his own hands too, into which it is a fearful thing to 
 fall 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>I was at ease</I> in the comfortable enjoyment of the gifts of
 God's bounty, not fretting and uneasy, as some are in the midst of 
 their prosperity, who thereby provoke God to strip them; yet <I>he has 
 broken me asunder,</I> put me upon the rack of pain, and torn me limb 
 from limb." God, in afflicting him, had seemed,

 1. As if he were furious. Though fury is not in God, he thought it was, 
 when he took him <I>by the neck</I> (as a strong man in a passion would 
 take a child) and shook him to pieces, triumphing in the irresistible
 power he had to do what he would with him. 

 2. As if he were partial. "He has distinguished me from the rest of
 mankind by this hard usage of me: <I>He has set me up for his mark,</I> 
 the butt at which he is pleased to let fly all his arrows: at me they 
 are directed, and they come not by chance; against me they are 
 levelled, as if I were the greatest sinner of all the men of the east 
 or were singled out to be made an example." When God set him up for a 
 mark <I>his archers</I> presently <I>compassed him round.</I> God has 
 archers at command, who will be sure to hit the mark that he sets up. 
 Whoever are our enemies, we must look upon them as God's archers, and 
 see him directing the arrow. <I>It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth 
 him good.</I> 

 3. As if he were cruel, and his wrath as relentless as his power was 
 resistless. As if he contrived to touch him in the tenderest part, 
 <I>cleaving his reins asunder</I> with acute pains; perhaps they were 
 nephritic pains, those of the stone, which lie in the region of the 
 kidneys. As if he had no mercy in reserve for him, he does not spare 
 nor abate any thing of the extremity. And as if he aimed at nothing but 
 his death, and his death in the midst of the most grievous tortures: 
 <I>He pours out my gall upon the ground,</I> as when men have taken a 
 wild beast, and killed it, they open it, and pour out the gall with a 
 loathing of it. He thought his blood was poured out, as if it were not 
 only not precious, but nauseous. 

 4. As if he were unreasonable and insatiable in his executions 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):
 
 "<I>He breaketh me with breach upon breach,</I> follows me with one
 wound after another." So his troubles came at first; while one 
 messenger of evil tidings was speaking another came: and so it was 
 still; new boils were rising every day, so that he had no prospect of 
 the end of his troubles. Thus he thought that God ran upon him <I>like 
 a giant,</I> whom he could not possibly stand before or confront; as 
 the giants of old ran down all their poor neighbours, and were too hard 
 for them. Note, Even good men, when they are in great and
 extraordinary troubles, have much ado not to entertain hard thoughts of 
 God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. That he had divested himself of all his honour, and all his 
 comfort, in compliance with the afflicting providences that surrounded 
 him. Some can lessen their own troubles by concealing them, holding 
 their heads as high and putting on as good a face as ever; but Job 
 could not do so: he received the impressions of them, and, as one truly 
 penitent and truly patient, he humbled himself under the mighty hand of 
 God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 1. He now laid aside all his ornaments and soft clothing, consulted not 
 either his ease or finery in his dress, but sewed sackcloth upon his 
 skin; that clothing he thought good enough for such a defiled 
 distempered body as he had. Silks upon sores, such sores, he thought, 
 would be unsuitable; sackcloth would be more becoming. Those are fond 
 indeed of gay clothing that will not be weaned from it by sickness and 
 old age, and, as Job was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 by <I>wrinkles and leanness.</I> He not only put on sackcloth, but
 sewed it on, as one that resolved to continue his humiliation as long 
 as the affliction continued.

 2. He insisted not upon any points of honour, but humbled himself under
 humbling providences: <I>He defiled his horn in the dust,</I> and 
 refused the respect that used to be paid to his dignity, power, and 
 eminency. Note, When God brings down our condition, that should bring 
 down our spirits. Better lay the horn in the dust than lift it up in 
 contradiction to the designs of Providence and have it broken at last.
 Eliphaz had represented Job as high and haughty, and unhumbled under 
 his affliction. "No," says Job, "I know better things; the dust is now 
 the fittest place for me." 

 3. He banished mirth as utterly unseasonable, and set himself to sow in 
 tears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>My face is foul with weeping</I> so constantly for my sins, for
 God's displeasure against me, and for my friends unkindness: this has 
 brought a <I>shadow of death upon my eyelids.</I>" He had not only wept 
 away all his beauty, but almost wept his eyes out.  In this also he was 
 a type of Christ, who was a man of sorrows, and much in tears, and 
 pronounced those blessed that mourn, <I>for they shall be 
 comforted.</I></P>

 Job's condition was very deplorable; but had he nothing to support him, 
 nothing to comfort him? Yes, and he here tells us what it was.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He had the testimony of his conscience for him that he had walked 
 uprightly, and had never allowed himself in any gross sin. None was 
 ever more ready than he to acknowledge his sins of infirmity; but, upon 
 search, he could not charge himself with any enormous crime, for which 
 he should be made more miserable than other men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He had kept a conscience void of offence, 

 (1.) Towards men: "<I>Not for any injustice in my hands,</I> any wealth 
 that I have unjustly got or kept." Eliphaz had represented him as a 
 tyrant and an oppressor. "No," says he, "I never did any wrong to any
 man, but always despised the gain of oppression." 

 (2.) Towards God: <I>Also my prayer is pure;</I> but prayer cannot be 
 pure as long as there is <I>injustice in our hands,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:15">Isa. i. 15</A>.

 Eliphaz had charged him with hypocrisy in religion, but he specifies 
 prayer, the great act of religion, and professes that in that he was 
 pure, though not from all infirmity, yet from reigning and allowed 
 guile: it was not like the prayers of the Pharisees, who looked no 
 further than to be seen of men, and to serve a turn.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This assertion of his own integrity he backs with a solemn 
 imprecation of shame and confusion to himself if it were not true, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 (1.) If there were any injustice in his hands, he wished it might not 
 be concealed: <I>O earth! cover thou not my blood,</I> that is, "the 
 innocent blood of others, which I am suspected to have shed." Murder 
 will out; and "let it," says Job, "if I have ever been guilty if it," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:10,11">Gen. iv. 10, 11</A>.

 The day is coming when <I>the earth shall disclose her blood</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:21">Isa. xxvi. 21</A>),

 and a good man as far from dreading that day.

 (2.) If there were any impurity in his prayers, he wished they might 
 not be accepted: <I>Let my cry have no place.</I> He was willing to be 
 judged by that rule, <I>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will 
 not hear me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:18">Ps. lxvi. 18</A>.

 There is another probable sense of these words, that he does hereby, as
 it were, lay his death upon his friends, who broke his heart with their 
 harsh censures, and charges the guilt of his blood upon them, begging 
 of God to avenge it and that the cry of his blood might have no place 
 in which to lie hid, but might come up to heaven and be heard by him 
 that makes inquisition for blood.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He could appeal to God's omniscience concerning his integrity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The witness in our own bosoms for us will stand us in little stead if
 we have not a witness in heaven for us too; for <I>God is greater than 
 our hearts,</I> and we are not to he our own judges. This therefore is 
 Job's triumph, <I>My witness is in heaven.</I> Note, It is an 
 unspeakable comfort to a good man, when he lies under the censure of 
 his brethren, that there is a God in heaven who knows his integrity and 
 will clear it up sooner or later. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+5:31,37">John v. 31, 37</A>.

 This one witness is instead of a thousand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He had a God to go to before whom he might unbosom himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.
 
 See here,

 1. How the case stood between him and his friends. He knew not how to 
 be free with them, nor could he expect either a fair hearing with them 
 or fair dealing from them. "My friends (so they call themselves) scorn 
 me; they set themselves not only to resist me, but to expose me; they 
 are of counsel against me, and use all their art and eloquence" (so the 
 word signifies) "to run me down." The scorns of friends are more 
 cutting than those of enemies; but we must expect them, and provide 
 accordingly. 

 2. How it stood between him and God. He doubted not but that,

 (1.) God did now take cognizance of his sorrows: <I>My eye pours out 
 tears to God.</I> He had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)

 that he wept much; here he tells us in what channel his tears ran, and
 which way they were directed. His sorrow was not that of the world, but 
 he sorrowed after a godly sort, wept before the Lord, and offered to 
 him the sacrifice of a broken heart. Note, Even tears, when sanctified 
 to God, give ease to troubled spirits; and, if men slight our grief, 
 this may comfort us, that God regards them.

 (2.) That he would in due time clear up his innocency 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>O that one might plead for a man with God!</I> If he could but now
 have the same freedom at God's bar that men commonly have at the bar of 
 the civil magistrate, he doubted not but to carry his cause, for the 
 Judge himself was a witness to his integrity. The language of this wish 
 is like that in 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7,8">Isa. l. 7, 8</A>,

 <I>I know that I shall not be ashamed, for he is near that justifies
 me.</I> Some give a gospel sense of this verse, and the original will 
 very well bear it; <I>and he will plead</I> (that is, there is one that 
 will plead) <I>for man with God, even the Son of man for his friend, or 
 neighbour.</I> Those who pour out tears before God, though they cannot 
 plead for themselves, by reason of their distance and defects, have a 
 friend to plead for them, even the Son of man, and on this we must 
 bottom all our hopes of acceptance with God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He had a prospect of death which would put a period to all his 
 troubles. Such confidence had he towards God that he could take 
 pleasure in thinking of the approach of death, when he should be 
 determined to his everlasting state, as one that doubted not but it 
 would be well with him then: <I>When a few years have come</I> (<I>the 
 years of number</I> which are determined and appointed to me) <I>then I
 shall go the way whence I shall not return.</I> Note, 

 1. To die is to <I>go the way whence we shall not return.</I> It is to 
 go a journey, a long journey, a journey for good and all, to remove 
 from this to another country, from the world of sense to the world of 
 spirits. It is a journey to our long home; there will be no coming back 
 to our state in this world nor any change of our state in the other
 world. 

 2. We must all of us very certainly, and very shortly, go this journey;
 and it is comfortable to those who keep a good conscience to think of 
 it, for it is the crown of their integrity.</P>
