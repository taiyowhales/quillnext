 <HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=50>
 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some call this the soldier's psalm, and think it was penned in the
 camp, when David was hazarding his life in the high places of the
 field, and thus trusted God to cover his head in the day of battle.
 Others call it the traveller's psalm (for there is nothing in it of
 military dangers) and think David penned it when he was going abroad,
 and designed it <I>pro vehiculo--for the carriage,</I> for a good man's
 convoy and companion in a journey or voyage. But we need not thus
 appropriate it; wherever we are, at home or abroad, we are exposed to
 danger more than we are aware of; and this psalm directs and encourages
 us to repose ourselves and our confidence in God, and by faith to put
 ourselves under his protection and commit ourselves to his care, which
 we must do, with an entire resignation and satisfaction, in singing
 this psalm. 
 
 I. David here assures himself of help from God,

 This psalm teaches us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To stay ourselves upon God as a God of power and a God
 all-sufficient for us. David did so and found the benefit of it.

 1. We must not rely upon creatures, upon men and means, instruments and 
 second causes, nor make flesh our arm: "<I>Shall I lift up my eyes to 
 the hills?</I>"--so some read it. "Does my help come thence? Shall I 
 depend upon the powers of the earth, upon the strength of the hills, 
 upon princes and great men, who, like hills, fill the earth, and hold 
 up their heads towards heaven? No; <I>in vain is salvation hoped for
 from hills and mountains,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:23">Jer. iii. 23</A>.

 I never expect help to come from them; my confidence is in God only." 
 <I>We must lift up our eyes above the hills</I> (so some read it); we 
 must look beyond instruments to God, who makes them that to us which 
 they are. 

 2. We must see all our help laid up in God, in his power and goodness, 
 his providence and grace; and from him we must expect it to come: 
 "<I>My help comes from the Lord;</I> the help I desire is what he 
 sends, and from him I expect it in his own way and time. If he do not 
 help, no creature can help; if he do, no creature can hinder, can 
 hurt." 

 3. We must fetch in help from God, by faith in his promises, and a due
 regard to all his institutions: "<I>I will lift up my eyes to the 
 hills</I>" (probably he meant the hills on which the temple was built, 
 Mount Moriah, and the holy hill of Zion, where the ark of the covenant, 
 the oracle, and the altars were); "I will have an eye to the special 
 presence of God in his church, and with his people (his presence by 
 promise) and not only to his common presence." When he was at a 
 distance he would look towards the sanctuary

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:2,42:6">Ps. xxviii. 2; xlii. 6</A>);

 thence <I>comes</I> our <I>help,</I> from the word and prayer, from the 
 secret of his tabernacle. <I>My help cometh from the Lord</I> (so the 
 word is, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+121:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <I>from before the Lord,</I> or <I>from the sight and presence of the 
 Lord.</I> "This (says Dr. Hammond) may refer to Christ incarnate, with 
 whose humanity the Deity being inseparably united, God is always 
 present with him, and, through him, with us, for whom, sitting at God's 
 right hand, he constantly maketh intercession." Christ is called the 
 <I>angel of his presence,</I> that saved his people,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:9">Isa. lxiii. 9</A>.

 4. We must encourage our confidence in God with this that he <I>made
 heaven and earth,</I> and he who did that can do any thing. He made
 the world out of nothing, himself alone, by a word's speaking, in a 
 little time, and <I>all very good,</I> very excellent and beautiful; 
 and therefore, how great soever our straits and difficulties are, he 
 has power sufficient for our succour and relief. He that made heaven 
 and earth is sovereign Lord of all the hosts of both, and can make use 
 of them as he pleases for the help of his people, and restrain them 
 when he pleases from hurting his people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To comfort ourselves in God when our difficulties and dangers are 
 greatest. It is here promised that if we put our trust in God, and keep 
 in the way of our duty, we shall be safe under his protection, so that 
 no real evil, no mere evil, shall happen to us, nor any affliction but 
 what God sees good for us and will do us good by. 

 1. God himself has undertaken to be our protector: <I>The Lord is thy 
 keeper,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+121:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Whatever charge he gives his angels to keep his people, he has not 
 thereby discharged himself, so that, whether every particular saint has 
 an angel for his guardian or no, we are sure he has God himself for his 
 guardian. It is infinite wisdom that contrives, and infinite power that 
 works, the safety of those that have put themselves under God's 
 protection. Those must needs be well kept that have <I>the Lord</I> for 
 their <I>keeper.</I> If, by affliction, they be made his prisoners, yet 
 still he is their keeper. 

 2. The same that is the protector of the church in general is engaged 
 for the preservation of every particular believer, the same wisdom, the 
 same power, the same promises. <I>He that keepeth Israel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+121:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)

 <I>is thy keeper,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+121:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The shepherd of the flock is the shepherd of every sheep, and will take 
 care that not one, even of the little ones, shall perish. 

 3. He is a wakeful watchful keeper: "<I>He that keepeth Israel,</I>
 that keepeth thee, O Israelite! <I>shall neither slumber nor sleep;</I> 
 he never did, nor ever will, for he is never weary; he not only does 
 not sleep, but he does not so much as slumber; he has not the least 
 inclination to sleep." 

 4. He not only protects those whom he is the keeper of, but he 
 refreshes them: He <I>is their shade.</I> The comparison has a great 
 deal of gracious condescension in it; the eternal Being who is infinite 
 substance is what he is in order that he may speak sensible comfort to 
 his people, promises to be their <I>umbra</I>--their <I>shadow,</I> to 
 keep as close to them as the shadow does to the body, and to shelter 
 them from the scorching heat, as <I>the shadow of a great rock in a 
 weary land,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:2">Isa. xxxii. 2</A>.

 Under this shadow they may sit with delight and assurance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:3">Cant. ii. 3</A>.
 
 5. He is always near to his people for their protection and 
 refreshment, and never at a distance; he <I>is</I> their <I>keeper</I> 
 and <I>shade on their right hand;</I> so that he is never far to seek. 
 The right hand is the working hand; let them but turn themselves 
 dexterously to their duty, and they shall find God ready to them, to 
 assist them and give them success, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:8">Ps. xvi. 8</A>.

 6. He is not only at their right hand, but he will also <I>keep the 
 feet of his saints,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:9">1 Sam. ii. 9</A>.

 He will have an eye upon them in their motions: <I>He will not suffer
 thy foot to be moved.</I> God will provide that his people shall not be 
 tempted above what they are able, shall not fall into sin, though they 
 may be very near it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:2,23">Ps. lxxiii. 2, 23</A>),

 shall not fall into trouble, though there be many endeavouring to 
 undermine them by fraud or over throw them by force. He will keep them 
 from being frightened, as we are when we slip or stumble and are ready 
 to fall. 

 7. He will protect them from all the malignant influences of the
 heavenly bodies

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+121:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The sun shall not smite thee</I> with his heat <I>by day nor the 
 moon</I> with her cold and moisture <I>by night.</I> The sun and moon 
 are great blessings to mankind, and yet (such a sad change has sin made 
 in the creation) even the sun and moon, though worshipped by a great 
 part of mankind, are often instruments of hurt and distemper to human 
 bodies; God by them often smites us; but his favour shall interpose so 
 that they shall not damage his people. He will keep them <I>night and 
 day</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:3">Isa. xxvii. 3</A>),

 as he kept Israel in the wilderness by <I>a pillar of cloud by day,</I> 
 which screened them from the heat of the sun, <I>and of fire by 
 night,</I> which probably diffused a genial warmth over the whole camp, 
 that they might not be prejudiced by the cold and damp of the night, 
 their father Jacob having complained 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+31:40">Gen. xxxi. 40</A>)

 that <I>by day the drought consumed him and the frost by night.</I> It 
 may be understood figuratively: "Thou shalt not be hurt either by the 
 open assaults of thy enemies, which are as visible as the scorching 
 beams of the sun, or by their secret treacherous attempts, which are 
 like the insensible insinuations of the cold by night." 

 8. His protection will make them safe in every respect: "<I>The Lord
 shall preserve thee from all evil,</I> the evil of sin and the evil of 
 trouble. He shall prevent the evil thou fearest, and shall sanctify, 
 remove, or lighten, the evil thou feelest. He will keep thee from doing 
 evil

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+13:7">2 Cor. xiii. 7</A>),

 and so far from suffering evil that whatever affliction happens to thee 
 there shall be no evil in it. Even that which kills shall not hurt."

 9. It is the spiritual life, especially, that God will take under his
 protection: <I>He shall preserve thy soul.</I> All souls are his; and 
 the soul is the man, and therefore he will with a peculiar care 
 preserve them, that they be not defiled by sin and disturbed by 
 affliction. He will keep them by keeping us in the possession of them; 
 and he will preserve them from perishing eternally.

 10. He will keep us in all our ways: "<I>He shall preserve thy going
 out and thy coming in.</I> Thou shalt be under his protection in all 
 thy journeys and voyages, outward-bound or homeward-bound, as he kept 
 Israel in the wilderness, in their removes and rests. He will prosper 
 thee in all thy affairs at home and abroad, in the beginning and in the 
 conclusion of them. He will keep thee in life and death, thy going out 
 and going on while thou livest and thy coming in when thou diest, going 
 out to thy labour in the morning of thy days and coming home to thy 
 rest when the evening of old age calls thee in,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:23">Ps. civ. 23</A>.

 11. He will continue his care over us <I>from this time forth and even 
 for evermore.</I> It is a protection for life, never out of date. "He 
 will be thy guide <I>even unto death,</I> and will then hide thee in 
 the grave, hide thee in heaven. He will <I>preserve thee in his 
 heavenly kingdom.</I>" God will protect his church and his saints 
 always, <I>even to the end of the world.</I> The Spirit, who is their 
 preserver and comforter, shall abide with them for ever.</P>
