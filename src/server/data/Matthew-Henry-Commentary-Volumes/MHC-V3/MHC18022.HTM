 Eliphaz here leads on a third attack upon poor Job, in which Bildad 
 followed him, but Zophar drew back, and quitted the field. It was one 
 of the unhappinesses of Job, as it is of many an honest man, to be 
 misunderstood by his friends. He had spoken of the prosperity of wicked 
 men in this world as a mystery of Providence, but they took it for a 
 reflection upon Providence, as countenancing their wickedness; and they 
 reproached him accordingly. In this chapter, 

 I. Eliphaz checks him for his complaints of God, and of his dealings
 with him, as if he thought God had done him wrong, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>.

 II. He charges him with many high crimes and misdemeanours, for which
 he supposes God was now punishing him. 

 1. Oppression and injustice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:5-11">ver.  5-11</A>.

 2. Atheism and infidelity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:12-14">ver.  12-14</A>.

 III. He compares his case to that of the old world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:15-20">ver.  15-20</A>.

 IV. He gives him very good counsel, assuring him that, if he would take 
 it, God would return in mercy to him and he should return to his former 
 prosperity,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
 &nbsp; 2  Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be
 profitable unto himself?
 &nbsp; 3  <I>Is it</I> any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art
 righteous? or <I>is it</I> gain <I>to him,</I> that thou makest thy ways
 perfect?
 &nbsp; 4  Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with
 thee into judgment?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Eliphaz here insinuates that, because Job complained so much of his 
 afflictions, he thought God was unjust in afflicting him; but it was a 
 strained <I>innuendo.</I> Job was far from thinking so. What Eliphaz 
 says here is therefore unjustly applied to Job, but in itself it is 
 very true and good,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That when God does us good it is not because he is indebted to us; 
 if he were, there might be some colour to say, when he afflicts us, "He 
 does not deal fairly with us." But whoever pretends that he has by any 
 meritorious action made God his debtor, let him prove this debt, and he 
 shall be sure not to lose it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:35">Rom. xi. 35</A>.

 <I>Who has given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him again?</I>
 But Eliphaz here shows that the righteousness and perfection of the 
 best man in the world are no real benefit or advantage to God, and 
 therefore cannot be thought to merit any thing from him.

 1. Man's piety is no profit to God, no gain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 If we could by any thing merit from God, it would be by our piety, our 
 being righteous, and making our way perfect.  If that will not merit, 
 surely nothing else will. If a man cannot make God his debtor by his 
 godliness, and honesty, and obedience to his laws, much less can he by 
 his wit, and learning, and worldly policy. Now Eliphaz here asks 
 whether any man can possibly be <I>profitable to God.</I> It is certain 
 that he cannot. By no means. <I>He that is wise may be profitable to 
 himself.</I> Note, Our wisdom and piety are that by which we ourselves 
 are, and are likely to be, great gainers. <I>Wisdom is profitable to 
 direct,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:10">Eccl. x. 10</A>.

 <I>Godliness is profitable to all things,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+4:8">1 Tim. iv. 8</A>.

 <I>If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:12">Prov. ix. 12</A>.

 The gains of religion are infinitely greater than the losses of it, and 
 so it will appear when they are balanced.  But can a man be thus
 profitable to God? No, for such is the perfection of God that he cannot 
 receive any benefit or advantage by men; what can be added to that 
 which is infinite? And such is the weakness and imperfection of man 
 that he cannot offer any benefit or advantage to God. Can the light of 
 a candle be profitable to the sun or the drop of the bucket to the 
 ocean? He that is wise is profitable to himself, for his own direction 
 and defence, his own credit and comfort; he can with his wisdom 
 entertain himself and enrich himself; but can he so be profitable to 
 God? No; God needs not us nor our services. We are undone, for ever 
 undone, without him; but he is happy, for ever happy, without us. <I>Is 
 it any gain to him,</I> any real addition to his glory or wealth, <I>if 
 we make our way perfect?</I> Suppose it were absolutely perfect, yet 
 what is God the better? Much less when it is so far short of being 
 perfect.

 2. It is no pleasure to him. God has indeed expressed himself in his 
 word well pleased with the righteous; his countenance beholds them and 
 his delight is in them and their prayers; but all that adds nothing to 
 the infinite satisfaction and complacency which the Eternal Mind has in 
 itself. God can enjoy himself without us, though we could have but 
 little enjoyment of ourselves without our friends. This magnifies his 
 condescension, in that, though our services be no real profit or 
 pleasure to him, yet he invites, encourages, and accepts them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That when God restrains or rebukes us it is not because he is in 
 danger from us or jealous of us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Will he reprove thee for fear of thee,</I> and take thee down from
 thy prosperity lest thou shouldst grow too great for him, as princes 
 sometimes have thought it a piece of policy to curb the growing 
 greatness of a subject, lest he should become formidable?" Satan indeed 
 suggested to our first parents that God forbade them the tree of 
 knowledge for fear of them, lest they should be as gods, and so become 
 rivals with him; but it was a base insinuation. God rebukes the good 
 because he loves them, but he never rebukes the great because he fears 
 them. He does not <I>enter into judgment</I> with men, that is, pick a 
 quarrel with them and seek occasion against them, through fear lest 
 they should eclipse his honour or endanger his interest. Magistrates 
 punish offenders for fear of them. Pharaoh oppressed Israel because he 
 feared them. It was for fear that Herod slew the children of Bethlehem 
 and that the Jews persecuted Christ and his apostles. But God does not, 
 as they did, pervert justice for fear of any. See

 Eliphaz and his companions had condemned Job, in general, as a wicked 
 man and a hypocrite; but none of them had descended to particulars, nor 
 drawn up any articles of impeachment against him, until Eliphaz did so 
 here, where he positively and expressly charges him with many high 
 crimes and misdemeanours, which, if he had really been guilty of them, 
 might well have justified them in their harsh censures of him. "Come," 
 says Eliphaz, "we have been too long beating about the bush, too tender 
 of Job and afraid of grieving him, which has but confirmed him in his 
 self-justification. It is high time to deal plainly with him. We have 
 condemned him by parables, but that does not answer the end; he is not 
 prevailed with to condemn himself. We must therefore plainly tell him, 
 <I>Thou art the man,</I> the tyrant, the oppressor, the atheist, we 
 have been speaking of all this while. <I>Is not thy wickedness 
 great?</I> Certainly it is, or else thy troubles would not be so great. 
 I appeal to thyself, and thy own conscience; are not <I>thy iniquities 
 infinite,</I> both in number and heinousness?" Strictly taken, nothing 
 is infinite but God; but he means this, that his sins were more than 
 could be counted and more heinous than could be conceived. Sin, being 
 committed against Infinite Majesty, has in it a kind of infinite 
 malignity. But when Eliphaz charges Job thus highly, and ventures to 
 descend to particulars too, laying to his charge that which he knew 
 not, we may take occasion hence, 

 1. To be angry at those who unjustly censure and condemn their
 brethren. For aught I know, Eliphaz, in accusing Job falsely, as he 
 does here, was guilty of as great a sin and as great a wrong to Job as 
 the Sabeans and Chaldeans that robbed him; for a man's good name is 
 more precious and valuable than his wealth. It is against all the laws 
 of justice, charity, and friendship, either to raise or receive 
 calumnies, jealousies, and evil surmises, concerning others; and it is 
 the more base and disingenuous if we thus vex those that are in 
 distress and add to their affliction. Eliphaz could produce no 
 instances of Job's guilt in any of the particulars that follow here, 
 but seems resolved to calumniate boldly, and throw all the reproach he 
 could on Job, not doubting but that some would cleave to him. 

 2. To pity those who are thus censured and condemned. Innocency itself 
 will be no security against a false and foul tongue. Job, whom God 
 himself praised as the best man in the world, is here represented by 
 one of his friends, and he a wise and good man too, as one of the 
 greatest villains in nature. Let us not think it strange if at any time 
 we be thus blackened, but learn how to pass by evil report as well as 
 good, and commit our cause, as Job did his, to him that judgeth 
 righteously.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Let us see the particular articles of this charge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He charged him with oppression and injustice, that, when he was in 
 prosperity, he not only did no good with his wealth and power, but did 
 a great deal of hurt with them. This was utterly false, as appears by 
 the account Job gives of himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:12-17"><I>ch.</I>  xxix. 12</A>,

 &c.) and the character God gave of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:1-3"><I>ch.</I> i.</A>

 And yet,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Eliphaz branches out this charge into divers particulars, with as 
 much assurance as if he could call witnesses to prove upon oath every 
 article of it. He tells him, 

 (1.) That he had been cruel and unmerciful to the poor. As a magistrate 
 he ought to have protected them and seen them provided for; but Eliphaz 
 suspects that he never did them any kindness, but all the mischief his 
 power enabled him to do,--that, for an inconsiderable debt, he 
 demanded, and carried away by violence, a pawn of great value, even 
 from his brother, whose honesty and sufficiency he could not but know 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 <I>Thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought,</I> or, as the
 LXX. reads it, <I>Thou hast taken thy brethren for pledges,</I> and 
 that for nought, imprisoned them, enslaved them, because they had 
 nothing to pay,--that he had taken the very clothes of his insolvent 
 tenants and debtors, so that he had <I>stripped them naked,</I> and 
 left them so (the law of Moses forbade this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+22:26,De+24:13">Exod. xxii. 26, Deut. xxiv. 13</A>),--

 he had not been charitable to the poor, no, not to poor travellers, and
 poor widows: "<I>Thou hast not given</I> so much as a cup of cold 
 <I>water</I> (which would have cost thee nothing) <I>to the weary to 
 drink,</I> when he begged for it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:7"><I>v.</I>  7</A>)

 and was ready to perish for want of it, nay, <I>thou hast withholden
 bread from the hungry</I> in their extremity, hast not only not given 
 it, but hast forbidden the giving of it, which is <I>withholding good 
 from those to whom it is really due,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:27">Prov. iii. 27</A>.

 Poor widows, who while their husbands were living troubled nobody, but
 now were forced to seek relief, thou hast sent away empty from thy 
 doors with a sad heart,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Those who came to thee for justice, thou didst send away unheard, 
 unhelped; nay, though they came to thee full, thou didst squeeze them, 
 and send them away empty; and, worst of all, <I>the arms of the 
 fatherless have been broken;</I> those that could help themselves but 
 little thou hast quite disabled to help themselves." This which is the 
 blackest part of the charge, is but insinuated: <I>The arms of the 
 fatherless have been broken.</I> He does not say, "Thou has broken 
 them," but he would have it understood so, and if they be broken, and 
 those who have power do not relieve them, they are chargeable with it. 
 "They have been broken by those under thee, and thou hast connived at 
 it, which brings thee under the guilt."

 (2.) That he had been partial to the rich and great
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>As for the mighty man,</I> if he was guilty of any crime, he was
 never questioned for it: <I>he had the earth;</I> he <I>dwelt in 
 it.</I> If he brought an action ever so unjustly, or if an action were 
 ever so justly brought against him, yet he was sure to carry his cause 
 in thy courts. The poor were not fed at thy door, while the rich were 
 feasted at thy table." Contrary to this is Christ's rule for 
 hospitality

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+14:12-14">Luke  xiv. 12-14</A>);

 and Solomon says, <I>He that gives to the rich shall come to
 poverty.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He attributes all his present troubles to these supposed sins 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>):

 "Those that are guilty of such practices as these commonly bring
 themselves into just such a condition as thou art now in; and therefore 
 we conclude thou hast been thus guilty."

 (1.) "The providence of God usually crosses and embarrasses such; and 
 <I>snares are,</I> accordingly, <I>round about thee,</I> so that, which 
 way soever thou steppest or lookest, thou findest thyself in distress; 
 and others are as hard upon thee as thou hast been upon the poor." 

 (2.) "Their consciences may be expected to terrify and accuse them. No 
 sin makes a louder cry there than unmercifulness; and, accordingly, 
 <I>sudden fear troubles thee;</I> and, though thou wilt not own it, it 
 is guilt of this kind that creates thee all this terror." Zophar had 
 insinuated this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:19,20"><I>ch.</I> xx. 19, 20</A>.

 (3.) "They are brought to their wits' end, so amazed and bewildered
 that they know not what to do, and that also is thy case; for thou art 
 <I>in darkness that thou canst not see</I> wherefore God contends with 
 thee nor what is the best course for thee to take, <I>for abundance of 
 waters cover thee,</I>" that is, "thou art in a mist, in the midst of 
 dark waters, in the thick clouds of the sky." Note, Those that have not 
 shown mercy may justly be denied the comfortable hope that they shall 
 find mercy; and then what can they expect but snares, and darkness, and 
 continual fear?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He charged him with atheism, infidelity, and gross impiety, and 
 thought this was at the bottom of his injustice and oppressiveness: he 
 that did not fear God did not regard man. He would have it thought that 
 Job was an Epicurean, who did indeed own the being of God, but denied 
 his providence, and fancied that he confined himself to the 
 entertainments of the upper world and never concerned himself in the 
 inhabitants and affairs of this.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Eliphaz referred to an important truth, which he thought, if Job had 
 duly considered it, would have prevented him from being so passionate 
 in his complaints and bold in justifying himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>Is not God in the height of heaven?</I> Yes, no doubt he is. No
 heaven so high but God is there; and in the highest heavens, the 
 heavens of the blessed, the residence of his glory, he is present in a 
 special manner. There he is pleased to manifest himself in a way 
 peculiar to the upper world, and thence he is pleased to manifest 
 himself in a way suited to this lower world. There is his throne; there 
 is his court: he is called <I>the Heavens,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:26">Dan. iv. 26</A>.

 Thus Eliphaz proves that a man cannot be profitable to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that he ought not to contend with God (it is his folly if he does), and
 that we ought always to address ourselves to God with very great 
 reverence; for when we <I>behold the height of the stars, how high they 
 are,</I> we should, at the same time, also consider the transcendent 
 majesty of God, who is above the stars, and how high he is.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He charged it upon Job that he made a bad use of this doctrine, 
 which he might have made so good a use of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 "This is <I>holding the truth in unrighteousness,</I> fighting against 
 religion with its own weapons, and turning its own artillery upon 
 itself: thou art willing to own that <I>God is in the height of 
 heaven</I> but thence thou inferrest, <I>How doth God know?</I>" Bad 
 men expel the fear of God out of their hearts by banishing the eye of 
 God out of the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+8:12">Ezek. viii. 12</A>),

 and care not what they do if they can but persuade themselves that God
 does not know. Eliphaz suspected that Job had such a notion of God as 
 this, that, because he is in the height of heaven, 

 (1.) It is therefore impossible for him to see and hear what is done at 
 so great a distance as this earth, especially since there is a <I>dark 
 cloud</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 many <I>thick clouds</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 that come between him and us, and <I>are a covering to him,</I> so that
 he cannot see, much less can he judge of, the affairs of this lower 
 world; as if God had <I>eyes of flesh,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:4"><I>ch.</I> x. 4</A>.

 The interposing firmament is to him as transparent crystal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+1:22">Ezek. i. 22</A>.

 Distance of place creates no difficulty to him who fills immensity, any
 more than distance of time to him who is eternal. Or, 

 (2.) That it is therefore below him, and a diminution to his glory, to 
 take cognizance of this inferior part of the creation: <I>He walks in 
 the circuit of heaven,</I> and has enough to do to enjoy himself and 
 his own perfections and glory in that bright and quiet world; why 
 should he trouble himself about us? This is gross absurdity, as well as 
 gross impiety, which Eliphaz here fathers upon Job; for it supposes 
 that the administration of government is a burden and disparagement to 
 the supreme governor and that the acts of justice and mercy are a toil 
 to a mind infinitely wise, holy, and good. If the sun, a creature, and 
 inanimate, can with his light and influence reach this earth, and every 
 part of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:6">Ps. xix. 6</A>),

 even from that vast height of the visible heavens in which he is, and
 in the circuit of which he walks, and that through many a thick and 
 dark cloud, shall we question it concerning the Creator?</P>

 Eliphaz, having endeavoured to convict Job, by setting his sins (as he 
 thought) in order before him, here endeavours to awaken him to a sight 
 and sense of his misery and danger by reason of sin; and this he does 
 by comparing his case with that of the sinners of the old world; as if 
 he had said, "Thy condition is bad now, but, unless thou repent, it 
 will be worse, as theirs was--theirs <I>who were overflown with a

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 namely, the Sodomites, who, in comparison of the old world, were but a
 remnant. And these two instances of the wrath of God against sin and 
 sinners are more than once put together, for warning to a careless 
 world, as by our Saviour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:26-30">Luke  xvii. 26</A>,

 &c.) and the apostle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:5,6">2 Pet. ii. 5, 6</A>.

 Eliphaz would have Job to <I>mark the old way which wicked men have
 trodden</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>)

 and see what came of it, what the end of their way was. Note, There is
 an old way which wicked men have trodden. Religion had but newly 
 entered when sin immediately followed it. But though it is an old way, 
 a broad way, a tracked way, it is a dangerous way and it leads to 
 destruction; and it is good for us to mark it, that we may not dare to 
 walk in it. Eliphaz here puts Job in mind of it, perhaps in opposition 
 to what he had said of the prosperity of the wicked; as if he had said, 
 "Thou canst find out here and there a single instance, it may be, of a 
 wicked man ending his days in peace; but what is that to those two 
 great instances of the final perdition of ungodly men--the drowning of 
 the whole world and the burning of Sodom?" destructions by wholesale, 
 in which he thinks Job may, as in a glass, see his own face.  Observe,

 1. The ruin of those sinners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>They were cut down out of time;</I> that is, they were cut off in
 the midst of their days, when, as man's time then went, many of them 
 might, in the course of nature, have lived some hundreds of years 
 longer, which made their immature extirpation the more grievous. They 
 were <I>cut down out of time,</I> to be hurried into eternity. And 
 their foundation, the earth on which they built themselves and all 
 their hopes, was <I>overflown with a flood,</I> the flood which was 
 <I>brought in upon the world of the ungodly,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:5">2 Pet. ii. 5</A>.

 Note, Those who build upon the sand choose a foundation which will be
 <I>overflown</I> when <I>the rains descend and the floods come</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:27">Matt. vii. 27</A>),

 and then their building must needs fall and they perish in the ruins of
 it, and repent of their folly when it is too late. 

 2. The sin of those sinners, which brought that ruin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:17"><I>v.</I>  17</A>):

 <I>They said unto God, Depart from us.</I> Job had spoken of some who
 said so and yet prospered,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:14"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 14</A>.

 "But these did not (says Eliphaz); they found to their cost what it was
 to set God at defiance.  Those who were resolved to lay the reins on 
 the neck of their appetites and passions began with this; they said 
 unto God, <I>Depart;</I> they abandoned all religion, hated the 
 thoughts of it, and desired to live <I>without God in the world;</I> 
 they shunned his word, and silenced conscience, his deputy. <I>And what 
 can the Almighty do for them?</I>" Some make this to denote the 
 justness of their punishment. They said to God, <I>Depart from us;</I> 
 and then <I>what could the Almighty do with them but cut them off?</I> 
 Those who will not submit to God's golden sceptre must expect to be 
 broken to pieces with his iron rod. Others make it to denote the 
 injustice of their sin: But <I>what hath the Almighty done against 
 them?</I> What iniquity have they found in him, or wherein has he 
 wearied them? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:3,Jer+2:5">Mic. vi. 3; Jer. ii. 5</A>.

 Others make it to denote the reason of their sin: They say unto God,
 <I>Depart,</I> asking <I>what the Almighty can do to them.</I> "What 
 has he done to oblige us? What can he do in a way of wrath to make us 
 miserable, or in a way of favour to make us happy?" As they argue,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+1:12">Zeph. i. 12</A>.

 <I>The Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.</I> Eliphaz
 shows the absurdity of this in one word, and that is, calling God 
 <I>the Almighty;</I> for, if he be so, what cannot he do? But it is not 
 strange if those cast off all religion who neither dread God's wrath 
 nor desire his favour. 

 3. The aggravation of this sin: <I>Yet he had filled their houses with
 good things,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:18"><I>v.</I>  18</A>.

 Both those of the old world and those of Sodom had great plenty of all 
 the delights of sense; for <I>they ate, they drank, they bought, they 
 sold,</I> &c.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+17:27">Luke xvii. 27</A>),

 so that they had no reason to ask <I>what the Almighty could do for
 them,</I> for they lived upon his bounty, no reason to bid him depart 
 from them who had been so kind to them. Many have their houses full of 
 goods but their hearts empty of grace, and thereby are marked for ruin. 

 4. The protestation which Eliphaz makes against the principles and
 practices of those wicked people: <I>But the counsel of the wicked is 
 far from me.</I> Job had said so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:16"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 16</A>)

 and Eliphaz will not be behind him. If they cannot agree in their own
 principles concerning God, yet they agree in renouncing the principles 
 of those that live without God in the world. Note, Those that differ 
 from each other in some matters of religion, and are engaged in 
 disputes about them, yet ought unanimously and vigorously to appear 
 against atheism and irreligion, and to take care that their disputes do 
 not hinder either their vigour or unanimity in that common cause of 
 God, that righteous cause. 

 5. The pleasure and satisfaction which the righteous shall have in
 this.

 (1.) In seeing the wicked destroyed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:19"><I>v.</I>  19</A>.

 They shall <I>see it,</I> that is, observe it, and take notice of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:9">Hos.  xiv. 9</A>);

 and they shall be <I>glad,</I> not to see their fellow-creatures
 miserable, or any secular turn of their own served, or point gained,
 but to see God glorified, the word of God fulfilled, the power of
 oppressors broken, and thereby the oppressed relieved--to see sin
 shamed, atheists and infidels confounded, and fair warning given to all
 others to shun such wicked courses. Nay, they shall <I>laugh them to
 scorn,</I> that is, they justly might do it, they shall do it, as God
 does it, in a holy manner, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:4,Pr+1:26">Ps. ii. 4; Prov. i. 26</A>.

 They shall take occasion thence to expose the folly of sinners and show
 how ridiculous their principles are, though they call themselves wits.
 <I>Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength;</I> and see what
 comes of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:7">Ps. lii. 7</A>.

 Some understand this of righteous Noah and his family, who beheld the
 destruction of the old world and rejoiced in it, as he had grieved for 
 their impiety. Lot, who saw the ruin of Sodom, had the same reason to 
 rejoice,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:7,8">2 Pet. ii. 7, 8</A>.

 (2.) In seeing themselves distinguished 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>Whereas our substance is not cut down,</I> as theirs was, and as
 thine is; we continue to prosper, which is a sign that we are the 
 favourites of Heaven, and in the right." The same rule that served him 
 to condemn Job by served him to magnify himself and his companions by.  
 <I>His</I> substance is cut down; therefore he is a wicked man; 
 <I>ours</I> is not; therefore we are righteous. But it is a deceitful 
 rule to judge by; for none knows love or hatred by all that is before 
 him. If others be consumed, and we be not, instead of censuring them 
 and lifting up ourselves, as Eliphaz does here, we ought to be thankful 
 to God and take it for a warning to ourselves to prepare for similar 
 calamities.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Methinks I can almost forgive Eliphaz his hard censures of Job, which 
 we had in the beginning of the chapter, though they were very unjust 
 and unkind, for this good counsel and encouragement which he gives him 
 in these verses with which he closes his discourse, and than which 
 nothing could be better said, nor more to the purpose. Though he 
 thought him a bad man, yet he saw reason to have hopes concerning him, 
 that, for all this, he would be both pious and prosperous. But it is 
 strange that out of the same mouth, and almost in the same breath, both 
 sweet waters and bitter should proceed. Good men, though they may 
 perhaps be put into a heat, yet sometimes will talk themselves into a 
 better temper, and, it may be, sooner than another could talk them into 
 it. Eliphaz had laid before Job the miserable condition of a wicked 
 man, that he might frighten him into repentance. Here, on the other 
 hand, he shows him the happiness which those may be sure of that do 
 repent, that he might allure and encourage him to it. Ministers must 
 try both ways in dealing with people, must speak to them from Mount 
 Sinai by the terrors of the law, and from Mount Sion by the comforts of 
 the gospel, must set before them both life and death, good and evil, 
 the blessing and the curse.  Now here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The good counsel which Eliphaz gives to Job; and good counsel it is 
 to us all, though, as to Job, it was built upon a false supposition 
 that he was a wicked man and now a stranger and enemy to God. 

 1.  <I>Acquaint now thyself with God. Acquiesce in God;</I> so some. It
 is our duty at all times, especially when we are in affliction, to 
 accommodate ourselves to, and quiet ourselves in, all the disposals of 
 the divine Providence. <I>Join thyself to him</I> (so some); fall in 
 with his interests, and act no longer in opposition to him. Our 
 translators render it well, "<I>Acquaint thyself with him;</I> be not 
 such a stranger to him as thou hast made thyself by casting off the 
 fear of him and restraining prayer before him." It is the duty and 
 interest of every one of us to acquaint himself with God. We must get 
 the knowledge of him, fix our affections on him, join ourselves to him 
 in a covenant of friendship, and then set up, and keep up, a constant 
 correspondence with him in the ways he has appointed. It is our honour 
 that we are made capable of this acquaintance, our misery that by sin 
 we have lost it, our privilege that through Christ we are invited to 
 return to it; and it will be our unspeakable happiness to contract and 
 cultivate this acquaintance.  

 2.  "<I>Be at peace,</I> at peace with thyself, not fretful, uneasy, 
 and in confusion; let not thy heart be troubled, but be quiet and calm, 
 and well composed. Be at peace with thy God; be reconciled to him. Do 
 not carry on this unholy war. Thou complainest that God is thy enemy; 
 be thou his friend." It is the great concern of every one of us to make 
 our peace with God, and it is necessary in order to our comfortable 
 acquaintance with him; for <I>how can two walk together except they be 
 agreed?</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+3:3">Amos iii. 3</A>.

 This we must do quickly, now, before it be too late. <I>Agree with thy
 adversary while thou art in the way.</I> This we are earnestly urged to 
 do. Some read it, "Acquaint thyself, <I>I pray thee,</I> with him, and 
 be at peace." God himself beseeches us; ministers, in Christ's stead, 
 pray us to be reconciled. Can we gainsay such entreaties?

 3. <I>Receive the law from his mouth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 "Having made thy peace with God, submit to his government, and resolve 
 to be ruled by him, that thou mayest keep thyself in his love." We 
 receive our being and maintenance from God.  From him we hope to 
 receive our bliss, and from him we must receive law. <I>Lord, what wilt 
 thou have me to do?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:6">Acts ix. 6</A>.

 Which way soever we receive the intimations of his will we must have
 our eye to him; whether he speaks by scripture, ministers, conscience, 
 or Providence, we must take the word as from his mouth and bow our 
 souls to it. Though, in Job's time, we do not know that there was any 
 written word, yet there was a revelation of God's will to be received. 
 Eliphaz looked upon Job as a wicked man, and was pressing him to repent 
 and reform. Herein consists the conversion of a sinner--his receiving 
 the law from God's mouth and no longer from the world and the flesh.  
 Eliphaz, being now in contest with Job, appeals to the word of God for 
 the ending of the controversy.  "Receive that, and be determined by 
 it." <I>To the law and to the testimony.</I>

 4.  <I>Lay up his word in thy heart.</I> It is not enough to receive 
 it, but we must retain it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:18">Prov. iii. 18</A>.

 We must lay it up as a thing of great value, that it may be safe; and
 we must lay it up in our hearts, as a thing of great use, that it may 
 be ready to us when there is occasion and we may neither lose it wholly 
 nor be at a loss for it in a time of need.

 5. <I>Return to the Almighty,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 "Do not only turn from sin, but turn to God and thy duty. Do not only 
 turn towards the Almighty in some good inclinations and good 
 beginnings, but <I>return to him;</I> return home to him, quite to him, 
 so as to reach to the Almighty, by a universal reformation, an 
 effectual thorough change of thy heart and life, and a firm resolution 
 to cleave to him;" so Mr. Poole.

 6. <I>Put away iniquity far from thy tabernacle.</I> This was the
 advice Zophar gave him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:14"><I>ch.</I> xi. 14</A>.

 "<I>Let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacle.</I> Put iniquity far
 off, the further the better, not only from thy heart and hand, but from 
 thy house. Thou must not only not be wicked thyself, but must reprove 
 and restrain sin in those that are under thy charge." Note, Family 
 reformation is needful reformation; we and our house must serve the 
 Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The good encouragement which Eliphaz gives Job, that he shall be 
 very happy, if he will but take this good counsel. In general, 
 "<I>Thereby good shall come unto thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>);

 the good that has now departed from thee, all the good thy heart can
 desire, temporal, spiritual, eternal good, shall come to thee. God 
 shall come to thee, into covenant and communion with thee; and he 
 brings all good with him, all good in him. Thou art now ruined and 
 brought down, but, if thou return to God, <I>thou shalt be built up</I> 
 again, and thy present ruins shall be repaired. Thy family shall be 
 built up in children, thy estate in wealth, and thy soul in holiness 
 and comfort." The promises which Eliphaz here encourages Job with are 
 reducible to three heads:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That his estate should prosper, and temporal blessings should be 
 bestowed abundantly on him; for godliness has the promise of the life 
 that now is. It is promised,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That he shall be very rich 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt lay up gold as dust,</I> in such great abundance, and
 <I>shalt have plenty of silver</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 whereas now thou art poor and stripped of all." Job had been rich.
 Eliphaz suspected he got his riches by fraud and oppression, and 
 therefore they were taken from him: but if he would return to God and 
 his duty,

 [1.] He should have more wealth than ever he had, not only thousands of 
 sheep and oxen, the wealth of farmers, but thousands of gold and 
 silver, the wealth of princes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:15"><I>ch.</I> iii. 15</A>.
 
 Abundantly more riches, true riches, are to be got by the service of
 God than by the service of the world. 

 [2.] He should have it more sure to him: "<I>Thou shalt lay it up</I> 
 in good hands, and hold that which is got by thy piety by a surer 
 tenure than that which thou didst get by thy iniquity." <I>Thou shalt 
 have silver of strength</I> (for so the word is), which, being honestly 
 got, will wear well--silver like steel.  

 [3.] He should, by the grace of God, be kept from setting his heart so 
 much upon it as Eliphaz thought he had done; and then wealth is a 
 blessing indeed when we are not ensnared with the love of it. Thou 
 shalt <I>lay up gold;</I> but how? Not as thy treasure and portion, but 
 <I>as dust,</I> and <I>as the stones of the brooks.</I> So little shalt 
 thou value it or expect from it that thou shalt lay it at thy feet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:35">Acts iv. 35</A>),

 not in thy bosom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That yet he shall be very safe. Whereas men's riches usually 
 expose them to danger, and he had owned that in his prosperity he 
 <I>was not in safety</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:26"><I>ch.</I> iii. 26</A>),

 now he might be secure; for <I>the Almighty shall be thy defender;</I>
 nay, he shall be <I>thy defence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 He <I>shall be thy gold;</I> so it is in the margin, and it is the same 
 word that is used

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>)

 for gold, but it signifies also a strong-hold, because <I>money is a
 defence,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:12">Eccl.  vii. 12</A>.

 Worldlings make gold their god, saints make God their gold; and those
 that are enriched with his favour and grace may truly be said <I>to 
 have abundance of the best gold,</I> and best laid up. We read it, 
 "<I>He shall be thy defence</I> against the incursions of neighbouring 
 spoilers: thy wealth shall not then lie exposed as it did to Sabeans 
 and Chaldeans," which, some think, is the meaning of that, <I>Thou 
 shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacle,</I> taking it as a 
 promise. "The iniquity or wrong designed against thee shall be put off 
 and shall not reach thee." Note, Those must needs be safe that have 
 Omnipotence itself for their defence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+91:1-3">Ps. xci. 1-3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That his soul should prosper, and he should be enriched with 
 spiritual blessings, which are the best blessings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That he should live a life of complacency in God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "<I>For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty;</I> and
 <I>thus</I> the Almighty comes to be thy gold by thy delighting in him, 
 as worldly people delight in their money. He shall be thy wealth, thy 
 defence, thy dignity; for he shall be thy delight." The way to have our 
 heart's desire is to make God our heart's delight, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:4">Ps. xxxvii. 4</A>.

 If God give us himself to be our joy, he will deny us nothing that is
 good for us.  "Now, God is a terror to thee; he is so by thy own 
 confession

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:4,16:9,19:11"><I>ch.</I> vi. 4; xvi. 9; xix. 11</A>);

 but, if thou wilt return to him, then, and not till then, <I>he will be
 thy delight;</I> and it shall be as much a pleasure to thee to think of 
 him as ever it was a pain." No delight is comparable to the delight 
 which gracious souls have in the Almighty; and those that acquaint 
 themselves with him, and submit themselves entirely to him, shall find 
 his favour to be, not only their strength, but their song.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That he should have a humble holy confidence towards God, such as 
 those are said to have <I>whose hearts condemn them not,</I> 1 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:21">John iii. 21</A>.

 "Then <I>shalt</I> thou <I>lift up thy face to God</I> with boldness,
 and not be afraid, as thou now art, to draw near to him. Thy 
 countenance is now fallen, and thou lookest dejected; but, when thou 
 hast made thy peace with God, thou shalt blush no more, tremble no 
 more, and hang thy head no more, as thou dost now, but shalt 
 cheerfully, and with a gracious assurance, show thyself to him, pray 
 before him, and expect blessings from him."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That he should maintain a constant communion with God, "The 
 correspondence, once settled, shall be kept up to thy unspeakable 
 satisfaction. Letters shall be both statedly and occasionally 
 interchanged between thee and heaven," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 [1.] "Thou shalt by prayer send letters to God: <I>Thou shalt make thy
 prayer</I>" (the word is, <I>Thou shalt multiply</I> thy prayers) "unto 
 him, and he will not think thy letters troublesome, though many and 
 long. The oftener we come to the throne of grace the more welcome. 
 Under all thy burdens, in all thy wants, cares, and fears, thou shalt 
 send to heaven for guidance and strength, wisdom, and comfort, and good 
 success." 

 [2.] "He shall, by his providence and grace, answer those letters, and
 give thee what thou askest of him, either in kind or kindness: <I>He 
 shall hear thee,</I> and make it to appear he does so by what he does 
 for thee and in thee." 

 [3.] "Then thou shalt by thy praises reply to the gracious answers 
 which he sent thee: <I>Thou shalt pay thy vows,</I> and that shall be 
 acceptable to him and fetch in further mercy." Note, When God performs 
 that which in our distress we prayed for we must make conscience of 
 performing that which we then promised, else we do not deal honestly. 
 If we promised nothing else we promised to be thankful, and that is 
 enough, for it includes all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:14">Ps. cxvi. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) That he should have inward satisfaction in the management of all
 his outward affairs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 "<I>Thou shalt decree a thing and it shall be established unto
 thee,</I>" that is, "Thou shalt frame all thy projects and purposes 
 with so much wisdom, and grace, and resignation to the will of God, 
 that the issue of them shall be to thy heart's content, just as thou 
 wouldst have it to be. Thou shalt <I>commit thy works unto the Lord</I> 
 by faith and prayer, and then <I>thy thoughts shall be established;</I> 
 thou shalt be easy and pleased, whatever occurs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:3">Prov. xvi. 3</A>.

 This the grace of God shall work in thee; nay, sometimes the providence
 of God shall give thee the very thing thou didst desire and pray for, 
 and give it thee in thy own way, and manner, and time. <I>Be it unto 
 thee even as thou wilt.</I>" When at any time an affair succeeds just 
 according to the scheme we laid, and our measures are in nothing 
 broken, nor are we put upon new counsels, then we must own the 
 performance of this promise, <I>Thou shalt decree a thing and it shall 
 be established unto thee.</I> "Whereas now thou complainest of darkness 
 round about thee, then <I>the light shall shine on thy ways;</I>" that 
 is, "God shall guide and direct thee, and then it will follow, of 
 course, that he shall prosper and succeed thee in all thy undertakings. 
 God's wisdom shall be thy guide, his favour thy comfort, and thy ways 
 shall be so under both those lights that thou shalt have a comfortable 
 enjoyment of what is present and a comfortable prospect of what is 
 future,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:17">Ps. xc. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) That even in times of common calamity and danger he should have 
 abundance of joy and hope 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 "<I>When men are cast down</I> round about thee, cast down in their
 affairs, cast down in their spirits, sinking, desponding, and ready to 
 despair, <I>then shalt thou say, There is lifting up.</I> Thou shalt 
 find that in thyself which will not only bear thee up under thy 
 troubles, and keep thee from fainting, but lift thee up above thy 
 troubles and enable thee to rejoice evermore." When men's <I>hearts 
 fail them for fear,</I> then shall Christ's disciples <I>lift up their 
 heads for joy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:26-28">Luke xxi. 26-28</A>.

 Thus are they made to <I>ride upon the high places of the earth</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:14">Isa. lviii. 14</A>),

 and that which will lift them up is the belief of this, that God will
 save the humble person. Those that humble themselves shall be exalted, 
 not only in honour, but in comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he should be a blessing to his country and an instrument of 
 good to many 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>):

 <I>God shall,</I> in answer to thy prayers, <I>deliver the island of
 the innocent,</I> and have a regard therein to <I>the pureness of thy 
 hands,</I> which is necessary to the acceptableness of our prayers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+2:8">1 Tim. ii. 8</A>.

 But, because we may suppose the innocent not to need deliverance (it
 was guilty Sodom that wanted the benefit of Abraham's intercession), I 
 incline to the marginal reading, <I>The innocent shall deliver the 
 island,</I> by their advice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:14,15">Eccl. ix. 14, 15</A>)

 and by their prayers and their interest in heaven, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:24">Acts xxvii. 24</A>.

 Or, <I>He shall deliver those that are not innocent, and they are
 delivered by the pureness of thy hands;</I> as it may be read, and most 
 probably.  Note, A good man is a public good. Sinners fare the better 
 for saints, whether they are aware of it or no. If Eliphaz intended 
 hereby (as some think he did) to insinuate that Job's prayers were not 
 prevailing, nor his hands pure (for then he would have relieved others, 
 much more himself), he was afterwards made to see his error, when it 
 appeared that Job had a better interest in heaven than he had; for he 
 and his three friends, who in this matter were not innocent, were 
 delivered by <I>the pureness of Job's hands,</I>
