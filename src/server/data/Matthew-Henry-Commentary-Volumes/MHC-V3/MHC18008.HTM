 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job's friends are like Job's messengers: the latter followed one 
 another close with evil tidings, the former followed him with harsh 
 censures: both, unawares, served Satan's design; these to drive him 
 from his integrity, those to drive him from the comfort of it. Eliphaz 
 did not reply to what Job had said in answer to him, but left it to 
 Bildad, whom he knew to be of the same mind with himself in this 
 affair. Those are not the wisest of the company, but the weakest 
 rather, who covet to have all the talk. Let others speak in their turn, 
 and let the first keep silence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:30,31">1 Cor. xiv. 30, 31</A>.

 Eliphaz had undertaken to show that because Job was sorely afflicted he
 was certainly a wicked man. Bildad is much of the same mind, and will 
 conclude Job a wicked man unless God do speedily appear for his relief. 
 In this chapter he endeavours to convince Job, 

 I. That he had spoken too passionately, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:2">ver.  2</A>.

 II. That he and his children had suffered justly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III.  That, if he were a true penitent, God would soon turn his 
 captivity, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:5-7">ver.  5-7</A>.

 IV. That it was a usual thing for Providence to extinguish the joys and
 hopes of wicked men as his were extinguished; and therefore that they 
 had reason to suspect him for a hypocrite, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:8-19">ver. 8-19</A>.

 V. That they would be abundantly confirmed in their suspicion unless 
 God did speedily appear for his relief,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
 &nbsp; 2  How long wilt thou speak these <I>things?</I> and <I>how long shall</I>
 the words of thy mouth <I>be like</I> a strong wind?
 &nbsp; 3  Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert
 justice?
 &nbsp; 4  If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast
 them away for their transgression;
 &nbsp; 5  If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy
 supplication to the Almighty;
 &nbsp; 6  If thou <I>wert</I> pure and upright; surely now he would awake
 for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness
 prosperous.
 &nbsp; 7  Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should
 greatly increase.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. Bildad reproves Job for what he had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 checks his passion, but perhaps (as is too common) with greater
 passion. We thought Job spoke a great deal of good sense and much to 
 the purpose, and that he had reason and right on his side; but Bildad, 
 like an eager angry disputant, turns it all off with this, <I>How long 
 wilt thou speak these things?</I> taking it for granted that Eliphaz 
 had said enough to silence him, and that therefore all he said was 
 impertinent.  Thus (as Caryl observes) reproofs are often grounded upon 
 mistakes.  Men's meaning is not taken aright, and then they are gravely 
 rebuked as if they were evil-doers. Bildad compares Job's discourse to 
 a <I>strong wind.</I> Job had excused himself with this, that his 
 speeches were but <I>as wind</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:26"><I>ch.</I> vi. 26</A>),

 and therefore they should not make such ado about them: "Yea, but"
 (says Bildad) "they are as strong wind, blustering and threatening, 
 boisterous and dangerous, and therefore we are concerned to fence 
 against them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He justifies God in what he had done. This he had no occasion to do 
 at this time (for Job did not condemn God, as he would have it thought 
 he did), or he might at least have done it without reflecting upon 
 Job's children, as he does here. Could he not be an advocate for God 
 but he must be an accuser of the brethren? 

 1. He is right in general, that <I>God doth not pervert judgment,</I> 
 nor ever go contrary to any settled rule of justice, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Far be it from him that he should and from us that we should suspect
 him. He never oppresses the innocent, nor lays a greater load on the 
 guilty than they deserve. He is God, the Judge; and shall not the Judge 
 of all the earth do right? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:25">Gen. xviii. 25</A>.

 If there should be unrighteousness with God, <I>how should he judge the
 world?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:5,6">Rom. iii. 5, 6</A>.

 He is <I>Almighty, Shaddai--all sufficient.</I> Men pervert justice
 sometimes for fear of the power of others (but God is Almighty, and 
 stands in awe of none), sometimes to obtain the favour of others; but 
 God is all-sufficient, and cannot be benefited by the favour of any. It 
 is man's weakness and impotency that he often is unjust; it is God's 
 omnipotence that he cannot be so.

 2. Yet he is not fair and candid in the application. He takes it for
 granted that Job's children (the death of whom was one of the greatest 
 of his afflictions) had been guilty of some notorious wickedness, and 
 that the unhappy circumstances of their death were sufficient evidence 
 that they were sinners above all the children of the east, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Job readily owned that God did not pervert judgment; and yet it did not
 therefore follow either that his children were cast-aways or that they 
 died for some great transgression. It is true that we and our children 
 have sinned against God, and we ought to justify him in all he brings 
 upon us and ours; but extraordinary afflictions are not always the 
 punishment of extraordinary sins, but sometimes the trial of 
 extraordinary graces; and, in our judgment of another's case (unless 
 the contrary appears), we ought to take the more favourable side, as 
 our Saviour directs,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:2-4">Luke xiii. 2-4</A>.

 Here Bildad missed it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He put Job in hope that, if he were indeed upright, as he said he 
 was, he should yet see a good issue of his present troubles: 
 "<I>Although thy children have sinned against him, and are cast away in 
 their transgression</I> (they have died in their own sin), yet if thou 
 be pure and upright thyself, and as an evidence of that wilt now seek 
 unto God and submit to him, all shall be well yet," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.

 This may be taken two ways, either,

 1. As designed to prove Job a hypocrite and a wicked man, though not by 
 the greatness, yet the by the continuance, of his afflictions. "When 
 thou wast impoverished, and thy children were killed, if thou hadst 
 been pure and upright, and approved thyself so in the trial, God would 
 before now have returned in mercy to thee and comforted thee according 
 to the time of thy affliction; but, because he does not so, we have 
 reason to conclude thou art not so <I>pure and upright</I> as thou 
 pretendest to be. If thou hadst conducted thyself well under the former 
 affliction, thou wouldst not have been struck with the latter." Herein 
 Bildad was not in the right; for a good man may be afflicted for his 
 trial, not only very sorely, but very long, and yet, if for life, it is 
 in comparison with eternity but for a moment. But, since Bildad put it 
 to this issue, God was pleased to join issue with him, and proved his 
 servant Job an honest man by Bildad's own argument; for, soon after, he 
 blessed his latter end more than his beginning. Or, 

 2. As designed to direct and encourage Job, that he might not thus run
 himself into despair, and give up all for gone; there might yet be hope 
 if he would take the right course. I am apt to think Bildad here 
 intended to condemn Job, yet would be thought to counsel and comfort 
 him.

 (1.) He gives him good counsel, yet perhaps not expecting he would take
 it, the same that Eliphaz had given him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:8"><I>ch.</I> v. 8</A>),

 to <I>seek unto God,</I> and that <I>betimes</I> (that is, speedily and
 seriously), and not to be dilatory and trifling in his return and 
 repentance. He advises him not to complain, but to petition, to 
 <I>make</I> his <I>supplication to the Almighty</I> with humility and 
 faith, and to see that there was (what he feared had hitherto been 
 wanting) sincerity in his heart ("thou must be <I>pure and 
 upright</I>") and honesty in his house--"that must be <I>the habitation
 of thy righteousness,</I> and not filled with ill-gotten goods, else 
 God will not hear thy prayers," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:18">Ps. lxvi. 18</A>.

 It is only the prayer of the upright that is the acceptable and
 prevailing prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:8">Prov. xv. 8</A>.

 (2.) He gives him good hopes that he shall yet again see good days,
 secretly suspecting, however, that he was not qualified to see them. He 
 assures him that, if he would be early in seeking God, God would awake 
 for his relief, would remember him and return to him, though now he 
 seemed to forget him and forsake him--that if his habitation were 
 righteous it should be prosperity. When we return to God in a way of 
 duty we have reason to hope that he will return to us in a way of 
 mercy. Let not Job object that he had so little left to being the world 
 with again that it was impossible he should ever prosper as he had 
 done; no, "Though thy beginning should be ever so small, a little meal 
 in the barrel and a little oil in the cruse, God's blessing shall 
 multiply that to a great increase." This is God's way of enriching the 
 souls of his people with graces and comforts, not <I>per saltum--as by 
 a bound,</I> but <I>per gradum--step by step.</I> The beginning is 
 small, but the progress is to perfection.  Dawning light grows to 
 noonday, a grain of mustard seed to a great tree. Let us not therefore 
 despise the day of small things, but hope for the day of great 
 things.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare
 thyself to the search of their fathers:

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Bildad here discourses very well on the sad catastrophe of hypocrites 
 and evil-doers and the fatal period of all their hopes and joys. He 
 will not be so bold as to say with Eliphaz that none that were 
 righteous were ever cut off thus 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:7"><I>ch.</I> iv. 7</A>);

 yet he takes it for granted that God, in the course of his providence,
 does ordinarily bring wicked men, who seemed pious and were prosperous, 
 to shame and ruin in this world, and that, by making their prosperity 
 short, he discovers their piety to be counterfeit. Whether this will 
 certainly prove that all who are thus ruined must be concluded to have 
 been hypocrites he will not say, but rather suspect, and thinks the 
 application is easy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He proves this truth, of the certain destruction of all the hopes 
 and joys of hypocrites, by an appeal to antiquity and the concurring 
 sentiment and observation of all wise and good men; and an undoubted 
 truth it is, if we take in the other world, that, if not in this life, 
 yet in the life to come, hypocrites will be deprived of all their 
 trusts and all their triumphs: whether Bildad so meant or no, we must 
 so take it. Let us observe the method of his proof, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He insists not on his own judgment and that of his companions: <I>We 
 are but of yesterday, and know nothing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He perceived that Job had no opinion of their abilities, but thought
 they knew little. "We will own," says Bildad, "that we know nothing, 
 are as ready to confess our ignorance as thou art to condemn it; for we 
 are but of yesterday in comparison, <I>and our days upon earth are</I> 
 short and transient, and hastening away as <I>a shadow.</I> And hence,"

 (1.) "We are not so near the fountain-head of divine revelation" (which
 then for aught that appears, was conveyed by tradition) "as the former 
 age was; and therefore we must enquire what they said and recount what 
 we have been told of their sentiments." Blessed be God, now that we 
 have the word of God in writing, and are directed to search that, we 
 need not <I>enquire of the former age,</I> nor <I>prepare ourselves to 
 the search of their fathers;</I> for, though we ourselves are but of 
 yesterday, the word of God in the scripture is as nigh to us as it was 
 to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:8">Rom. x. 8</A>),

 and it is the <I>more sure word of prophecy, to which we must take
 heed.</I> If we study and keep God's precepts, we may by them 
 <I>understand more than the ancients,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:99,100">Ps. cxix. 99, 100</A>.

 (2.) "We do not live so long as those of the former age did, to make
 observations upon the methods of divine providence, and therefore 
 cannot be such competent judges as they in a cause of this nature." 
 Note, The shortness of our lives is a great hindrance to the 
 improvement of our knowledge, and so are the frailty and weakness of 
 our bodies. <I>Vita brevis, ars longa--life is short, the progress of 
 art boundless.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He refers to the testimony of the ancients and to the knowledge 
 which Job himself had of their sentiments. "Do thou <I>enquire of the 
 former age,</I> and let them tell thee, not only their own judgment in 
 this matter, but the judgment also of <I>their fathers,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 <I>They will teach thee,</I> and inform thee
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 that all along, in their time, the judgments of God followed wicked
 men. This they will <I>utter out of their hearts,</I> that is, as that 
 which they firmly believe themselves, which they are greatly affected 
 with and desirous to acquaint and affect others with." Note,

 (1.) For the right understanding of divine Providence, and the
 unfolding of the difficulties of it, it will be of use to compare the 
 observations and experiences of former ages with the events of our own 
 day; and, in order thereto, to consult history, especially the sacred 
 history, which is the most ancient, infallibly true, and written 
 designedly for our learning.

 (2.) Those that would fetch knowledge from the former ages must search
 diligently, <I>prepare for the search,</I> and take pains for the 
 search.

 (3.) Those words are most likely to reach to the hearts of the learners
 that come from the hearts of the teachers. <I>Those shall teach 
 thee</I> best that <I>utter words out of their heart,</I> that speak by 
 experience, and not by rote, of spiritual and divine things. The 
 learned bishop Patrick suggests that Bildad being a Shuhite, descended 
 from Shuah one of Abraham's sons by Keturah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:2">Gen. xxv. 2</A>),

 in this appeal which he makes to history he has a particular respect to
 the rewards which the blessing of God secured to the posterity of 
 faithful Abraham (who hitherto, and long after, continued in his 
 religion) and to the extirpation of those eastern people, neighbours to 
 Job (in whose country they were settled), for their wickedness, whence 
 he infers that it is God's usual way to prosper the just and root out 
 the wicked, though for a while they may flourish.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He illustrates this truth by some similitudes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The hopes and joys of the hypocrite are here compared to a rush or 
 flag, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:11-13"><I>v.</I> 11-13</A>.

 (1.) It grows up out of the mire and water. The hypocrite cannot gain
 his hope without some false rotten ground or other out of which to 
 raise it, and with which to support it and keep it alive, any more than 
 the rush can grow without mire. He grounds it on his worldly 
 prosperity, the plausible profession he makes of religion, the good 
 opinion of his neighbours, and his own good conceit of himself, which 
 are no solid foundation on which to build his confidence. It is all but 
 mire and water; and the hope that grows out of it is but rush and flag.

 (2.) It may look green and gay for a while (the rush outgrows the
 grass), but it is light and hollow, and empty, and good for nothing. It 
 is green for show, but of no use.

 (3.) It withers presently, <I>before any other herb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 Even <I>while it is in its greenness</I> it is dried away and gone in a
 little time.  Note, The best state of hypocrites and evil-doers borders 
 upon withering; even when it is green it is going. The grass is <I>cut 
 down and withers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:6">Ps. xc. 6</A>);

 but the rush is <I>not cut down</I> and yet <I>withers, withers before
 it grows up</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+129:6">Ps. cxxix. 6</A>):

 as it has no use, so it has no continuance. <I>So are the paths of all
 that forget God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 they take the same way that the rush does, <I>for the hypocrite's hope
 shall perish.</I> Note, 

 [1.] Forgetfulness of God is at the bottom of men's hypocrisy, and of 
 the vain hopes with which they flatter and deceive themselves in their 
 hypocrisy. Men would not be hypocrites if they did not forget that the 
 God with whom they have to do searches the heart and requires truth 
 there, that he is a Spirit and has his eye on our spirits; and 
 hypocrites would have no hope if they did not forget that God is 
 righteous, and will not be mocked with the torn and the lame. 

 [2.] The hope of hypocrites is a great cheat upon themselves, and,
 though it may flourish for a while, it will certainly perish at last, 
 and they with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are here compared <I>to a spider's web,</I> or <I>a spider's 
 house</I> (as it is in the margin), a cobweb, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.

 The hope of the hypocrite,

 (1.) Is woven out of his own bowels; it is the creature of his own
 fancy, and arises merely from a conceit of his own merit and 
 sufficiency. There is a great deal of difference between the work of 
 the bee and that of the spider. A diligent Christian, like the 
 laborious bee, fetches in all his comfort from the heavenly dews of 
 God's word; but the hypocrite, like the subtle spider, weaves his out 
 of a false hypothesis of his own concerning God, as if he were 
 altogether such a one as himself.

 (2.) He is very fond of it, as the spider of her web; pleases himself
 with it, wraps himself in it, calls it his house, <I>leans upon it,</I> 
 and <I>holds it fast.</I> It is said of the spider that <I>she takes 
 hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:28">Prov. xxx. 28</A>.

 So does a carnal worldling hug himself in the fulness and firmness of
 his outward prosperity; he prides himself in that house as his palace, 
 fortifies himself in it as his castle, and makes use of it as the 
 spider of her web, to ensnare those he has a mind to prey upon. So does 
 a formal professor; he flatters himself in his own eyes, doubts not of 
 his salvation, is secure of heaven, and cheats the world with his vain 
 confidences.

 (3.) It will easily and certainly be swept away, as the cobweb with the
 besom, when God shall come to purge his house. The prosperity of 
 worldly people will fail them when they expect to find safety and 
 happiness in it.  They seek to hold fast their estates, but God is 
 plucking them out of their hands; and whose shall all those things be, 
 which they have provided? or what the better they will be for them? The 
 confidences of hypocrites will fail them. <I>I tell you, I know you 
 not.</I> The house built on the sand will fall in the storm, when the 
 builder most needs it and promised himself the benefit of it. <I>When a 
 wicked man dies his expectation perishes.</I> The ground of his hopes 
 will prove false; he will be disappointed of the thing he hoped for, 
 and his foolish hope with which he buoyed himself up will be turned 
 into endless despair; and thus his hope will be cut off, his web, that 
 refuge of lies, swept away, and he crushed in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The hypocrite is here compared to a flourishing and well-rooted 
 tree, which, though it do not wither of itself, yet will easily be cut 
 down and its place know it no more. The secure and prosperous sinner may
 think himself wronged when he is compared to a rush and a flag; he 
 thinks he has a better root. "We will allow him his conceit," says 
 Bildad, "and give him all the advantage he can desire, and bring him in 
 suddenly cut off." He is here represented as Nebuchadnezzar was in his 
 own dream 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:10">Dan. iv. 10</A>)

 by a great tree.

 (1.) See this tree fair and flourishing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>)
 
 like a <I>green bay-tree</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:35">Ps. xxxvii. 35</A>),

 <I>green before the sun,</I> it keeps its greenness in defiance of the
 scorching sun-beams, and <I>his branch shoots forth</I> under the 
 protection of his garden-wall and with the benefit of his garden-soil. 
 See it fixed, and taking deep root, never likely to be overthrown by 
 stormy winds, <I>for his roots are interwoven with the stones</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 it grows in firm ground, not, as the rush, of mire and water. Thus does
 a wicked man, when he prospers in the world, think himself secure; his 
 wealth is a <I>high wall in his own conceit.</I>

 (2.) See this tree felled and forgotten notwithstanding, <I>destroyed
 from his place</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 and so entirely extirpated that there shall remain no sign or token
 where it grew. The very place say, <I>I have not seen thee;</I> and the 
 standers by shall say the same. <I>I sought him, but he could not be 
 found,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:36">Ps. xxxvi. 36</A>.

 He made a great show and a great noise for a time, but he is gone of a
 sudden, and <I>neither root nor branch is left him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:1">Mal. iv. 1</A>.

 <I>This is the joy</I> (that is, this is the end and conclusion) <I>of
 the wicked man's way</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>);

 this is that which all his joy comes to. <I>The way of the ungodly
 shall perish,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:6">Ps. i. 6</A>.

 His hope, he thought, would in the issue be turned into joy; but this
 is the issue, this is the joy. <I>The harvest shall be a heap in the 
 day of grief and of desperate sorrow,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:11">Isa. xvii. 11</A>.

 This is the best of it; and what then is the worst of it? But shall he
 not leave a family behind him to enjoy what he has? No, <I>out of the 
 earth</I> (not out of his roots) <I>shall others grow,</I> that are 
 nothing akin to him, and shall fill up his place, and rule over that 
 for which he labored. Others (that is, others of the same spirit and 
 disposition) shall grow up in his place, and be as secure as ever he 
 was, not warned by his fall. The way of worldlings is their folly, and 
 yet there is a race of those that <I>approve their sayings,</I>

 Bildad here, in the close of his discourse, sums up what he has to say 
 in a few words, setting before Job life and death, the blessing and the 
 curse, assuring him that as he was so he should fare, and therefore 
 they might conclude that as he fared so he was. 

 1. On the one hand, if he were a perfect upright man, God would not
 <I>cast him away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Though now he seemed forsaken of God, he would yet return to him, and
 by degrees would <I>turn his mourning into dancing</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:11">Ps. xxx. 11</A>)

 and comforts should flow in upon him so plentifully that his
 <I>mouth</I> should be <I>filled with laughing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>.

 So affecting should the happy change be, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:2">Ps. cxxvi. 2</A>.

 Those that loved him would rejoice with him; but those that hated him,
 and had triumphed in his fall, would be ashamed of their insolence, 
 when they should see him restored to his former prosperity. Now it is 
 true that <I>God will not cast away an upright man;</I> he may be cast 
 down for a time, but he shall not be cast away for ever. It is true 
 that, if not in this world, yet in another, the mouth of the righteous 
 shall be <I>filled with rejoicing.</I> Though their sun should set 
 under a cloud, yet it shall rise again clear, never more to be clouded; 
 though they go mourning to the grave, that shall not hinder their 
 entrance into the joy of their Lord. It is true that the enemies of the 
 saints will be <I>clothed with shame</I> when they see them crowned 
 with honour. But it does not therefore follow that, if Job were not 
 perfectly restored to his former prosperity, he would forfeit the
 character of a perfect man.  

 2. On the other hand, if he were a wicked man and an evil-doer, God
 would not help him, but leave him to perish in his present distresses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),
 
 and his <I>dwelling-place</I> should <I>come to nought,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 And here also it is true that God <I>will not help the evil-doers;</I>
 they throw themselves out of his protection, and forfeit his favour. He 
 <I>will not take the ungodly by the hand</I> (so it is in the margin), 
 will not have fellowship and communion with them; for <I>what 
 communion</I> can there be <I>between light and darkness?</I> He will 
 not lend them his hand to pull them out of the miseries, the eternal 
 miseries, into which they have plunged themselves; they will then 
 stretch out their hand to him for help, but it will be too late: he 
 will not take them by the hand. <I>Between us and you there is a great 
 gulf fixed.</I> It is true that <I>the dwelling-place of the 
 wicked,</I> sooner or later, <I>will come to nought.</I> Those only 
 <I>who make God their dwelling-place</I> are safe for ever,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:1,91:1">Ps. xc. 1; xci. 1</A>.

 Those who make other things their refuge will be disappointed.  Sin
 brings ruin on persons and families. Yet to argue (as Bildad, I doubt, 
 slyly does) that because Job's family was sunk, and he himself at 
 present seemed helpless, therefore he certainly was an ungodly wicked 
 man, was neither just nor charitable, as long as there appeared no 
 other evidence of his wickedness and ungodliness. Let us <I>judge 
 nothing before the time,</I> but wait till the secrets of all hearts 
 shall be made manifest, and the present difficulties of Providence be 
 solved to universal and everlasting satisfaction, when the <I>mystery 
 of God shall be finished.</I></P>
