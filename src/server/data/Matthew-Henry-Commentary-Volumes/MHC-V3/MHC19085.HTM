 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Interpreters are generally of the opinion that this psalm was penned 
 after the return of the Jews out of their captivity in Babylon, when 
 they still remained under some tokens of God's displeasure, which they 
 here pray for the removal of. And nothing appears to the contrary, but 
 that it might be penned then, as well as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:1-9">Ps. cxxxvii.</A>

 They are the public interests that lie near the psalmist's heart here,
 and the psalm is penned for the great congregation. The church was here
 in a deluge; above were clouds, below were waves; every thing was dark
 and dismal.  The church is like Noah in the ark, between life and
 death, between hope and fear; being so,

 I. Here is the dove sent forth in prayer. The petitions are against sin
 and wrath

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:4">ver. 4</A>)

 and for mercy and grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:7">ver.  7</A>.

 The pleas are taken from former favours

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>)

 and present distresses,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 II. Here is the dove returning with an olive branch of peace and good
 tidings; the psalmist expects her return

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:8">ver.  8</A>)

 and then recounts the favours to God's Israel which by the spirit of
 prophecy he gave assurance of to others, and by the spirit of faith he
 took the assurance of to himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>.

 In singing this psalm we may be assisted in our prayers to God both for 
 his church in general and for the land of our nativity in particular.  
 The former part will be of use to direct our desires, the latter to 
 encourage our faith and hope in those prayers.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. A psalm for the sons of Korah.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thou hast been favourable unto
 thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
 &nbsp; 2  Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast
 covered all their sin. Selah.
 &nbsp; 3  Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned
 <I>thyself</I> from the fierceness of thine anger.
 &nbsp; 4  Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward
 us to cease.
 &nbsp; 5  Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine
 anger to all generations?
 &nbsp; 6  Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in
 thee?
 &nbsp; 7  show us thy mercy, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and grant us thy salvation.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The church, in affliction and distress, is here, by direction from God, 
 making her application to God. So ready is God to hear and answer the 
 prayers of his people that by his Spirit in the word, and in the heart, 
 he indites their petitions and puts words into their mouths. The people 
 of God, in a very low and weak condition, are here taught how to 
 address themselves to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They are to acknowledge with thankfulness the great things God had 
 done for them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:1-3"><I>v.</I> 1-3</A>):

 "Thou has done so and so for us and our fathers." Note, The sense of 
 present afflictions should not drown the remembrance of former mercies; 
 but, even when we are brought very low, we must call to remembrance 
 past experiences of God's goodness, which we must take notice of with 
 thankfulness, to his praise. They speak of it here with pleasure, 

 1.  That God had shown himself propitious to their land, and had smiled
 upon it as his own: "<I>Thou hast been favourable to thy land,</I> as 
 thine, with distinguishing favours." Note, The favour of God is the 
 spring-head of all good, and the fountain of happiness, to nations, as 
 well as to particular persons. It was by the favour of God that Israel 
 got and kept possession of Canaan

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:3">Ps. xliv. 3</A>);

 and, if he had not continued very favourable to them, they would have
 been ruined many a time. 

 2. That he had rescued them out of the hands of their enemies and 
 restored them to their liberty: "<I>Thou hast brought back the 
 captivity of Jacob,</I> and settled those in their own land again that 
 had been driven out and were strangers in a strange land, prisoners in 
 the land of their oppressors." The captivity of Jacob, though it may 
 continue long, will be brought back in due time.  

 3. That he had not dealt with them according to the desert of their
 provocations

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people,</I> and not punished 
 them as in justice thou mightest. <I>Thou hast covered all their 
 sin.</I>" When God forgives sin he covers it; and, when he covers the 
 sin of his people, he covers it all. The bringing back of their 
 captivity was <I>then</I> an instance of God's favour to them, when it 
 was accompanied with the pardon of their iniquity. 

 4. That he had not continued his anger against them so far, and so 
 long, as they had reason to fear

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "Having <I>covered all their sin,</I> thou hast <I>taken away all thy 
 wrath;</I>" for when sin is set aside God's anger ceases; God is 
 pacified if we are purified.  See what the pardon of sin is: <I>Thou 
 hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people,</I> that is, "<I>Thou hast 
 turned thy anger from waxing hot,</I> so as to consume us in the flame 
 of it. In compassion to us thou hast not stirred up all thy wrath, but, 
 when an intercessor has stood before thee in the gap, thou hast turned 
 away thy anger."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They are taught to pray to God for grace and mercy, in reference to 
 their present distress; this is inferred from the former: "Thou hast 
 done well for our fathers; do well for us, for we are the children of 
 the same covenant." 

 1. They pray for converting grace: "<I>Turn us, O God of our
 salvation!</I> in order to the turning of our captivity; turn us from 
 iniquity; turn us to thyself and to our duty; turn us, and we shall be 
 turned." All those whom God will save sooner or later he will turn. If 
 no conversion, no salvation. 

 2. They pray for the removal of the tokens of God's displeasure which 
 they were under: "<I>Cause thine anger towards us to cease,</I> as thou 
 didst many a time cause it to cease in the days of our fathers, when 
 thou didst take away thy wrath from them." Observe the method, "First 
 turn us to thee, and then cause thy anger to turn from us." When we are 
 reconciled to God, then, and not till then, we may expect the comfort 
 of his being reconciled to us. 

 3.  They pray for the manifestation of God's good-will to them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Show us thy mercy, O Lord!</I> show thyself merciful to us; not 
 only have mercy on us, but let us have the comfortable evidences of 
 that mercy; let us know that thou hast mercy on us and mercy in store 
 for us." 

 4. They pray that God would, graciously to them and gloriously to 
 himself, appear on their behalf: "<I>Grant us thy salvation;</I> grant 
 it by thy promise, and then, no doubt, thou wilt work it by thy 
 providence." Note, The vessels of God's mercy are the heirs of his 
 salvation; he shows mercy to those to whom he grants salvation; for 
 salvation is of mere mercy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They are taught humbly to expostulate with God concerning their
 present troubles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.
 
 Here observe,

 1. What they dread and deprecate: "<I>Wilt thou be angry with us for
 ever?</I> We are undone if thou art, but we hope thou wilt not. <I>Wilt 
 thou draw out thy anger unto all generations?</I> No; thou art 
 gracious, slow to anger, and swift to show mercy, and wilt not contend 
 for ever. Thou wast not angry with our fathers for ever, but didst soon 
 turn thyself from the fierceness of thy wrath; why then wilt thou be 
 angry with us for ever?  Are not thy mercies and compassions as 
 plentiful and powerful as ever they were? Impenitent sinners God will 
 be angry with for ever; for what is hell but the wrath of God drawn out 
 unto endless generations? But shall a hell upon earth be the lot of thy 
 people?" 

 2. What they desire and hope for: "<I>Wilt thou not revive us again</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 revive us with comforts spoken to us, revive us with deliverances 
 wrought for us?  Thou hast been favourable to thy land formerly, and 
 that revived it; wilt thou not again be favourable, and so revive it 
 again?" God had granted to the children of the captivity <I>some 
 reviving in their bondage,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:8">Ezra ix. 8</A>.

 Their return out of Babylon was as <I>life from the dead,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+37:11,12">Eze. xxxvii. 11, 12</A>.

 Now, Lord (say they), <I>wilt thou not revive us again,</I> and <I>put
 thy hand again the second time</I> to gather us in?

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+126:1,4,Ps+126:1,4">Ps. cxxvi. 1, 4</A>.

 <I>Revive thy work in the midst of the years,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:2">Hab. iii. 2</A>.

 "Revive us again," 

 (1.) "That thy people may rejoice; and so we shall have the comfort of 
 it,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:7">Ps. xiv. 7</A>.

 Give them life, that they may have joy. 

 (2.) "That they may rejoice in thee; and so thou wilt have the glory of 
 it." If God be the fountain of all our mercies, he must be the centre 
 of all our joys.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  I will hear what God the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will speak: for he will speak
 peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn
 again to folly.
 &nbsp; 9  Surely his salvation <I>is</I> nigh them that fear him; that glory
 may dwell in our land.
 &nbsp; 10  Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace
 have kissed <I>each other.</I>
 &nbsp; 11  Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall
 look down from heaven.
 &nbsp; 12  Yea, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall give <I>that which is</I> good; and our land
 shall yield her increase.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an answer to the prayers and expostulations in the
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:1-7">foregoing verses</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. In general, it is an answer of peace. This the psalmist is soon 
 aware of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 for he <I>stands upon his watch-tower</I> to <I>hear what God will say
 unto him,</I> as the prophet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:1,2">Hab. ii. 1, 2</A>.

 <I>I will hear what God the Lord will speak.</I> This intimates, 

 1. The stilling of his passions--his grief, his fear--and the tumult of
 his spirit which they occasioned: "Compose thyself, O my soul! in a 
 humble silence to attend upon God and wait his motions. I have spoken 
 enough, or too much; now I will hear what God will speak, and welcome 
 his holy will.  <I>What saith my Lord unto his servant?</I>" If we 
 would have God to hear what we say to him by prayer, we must be ready 
 to hear what he says to us by his word. 

 2. The raising of his expectation; now that he has been at prayer he 
 looks for something very great, and very kind, from the God that hears 
 prayer. When we have prayed we should look after our prayers, and stay 
 for an answer. Now observe here,

 (1.) What it is that he promises himself from God, in answer to his 
 prayers: <I>He will speak peace to his people, and to his saints.</I> 
 There are a people in the world who are God's people, set apart for 
 him, subject to him, and who shall be saved by him. All his people are 
 his saints, sanctified by his grace and devoted to his glory; these may 
 sometimes want peace, when without are fightings and within are fears; 
 but, sooner or later, God will speak peace to them; if he do not 
 command outward peace, yet he will suggest inward peace, speaking that 
 to their hearts by his Spirit which he has spoken to their ears by his 
 word and ministers and making them to hear joy and gladness. 

 (2.) What use he makes of this expectation. 

 [1.] He takes the comfort of it; and so must we: "<I>I will hear what 
 God the Lord will speak,</I> hear the assurances he gives of peace, in 
 answer to prayer." When God speaks peace we must not be deaf to it, but 
 with all humility and thankfulness receive it.

 [2.] He cautions the saints to do the duty which this calls for: <I>But 
 let them not turn again to folly;</I> for it is on these terms, and no 
 other, that peace is to be expected. To those, and those only, peace is 
 spoken, who turn from sin; but, if they return to it again, it is at 
 their peril. All sin is folly, but especially backsliding; it is 
 egregious folly to turn to sin after we have seemed to turn from it, to 
 turn to it after God has spoken peace.  God is for peace, but, when he 
 speaks, such are for war.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here are the particulars of this answer of peace. He doubts not but 
 all will be well in a little time, and therefore gives us the pleasing 
 prospect of the flourishing estate of the church in the 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:9-13">last five verses</A>

 of the psalm, which describe the peace and prosperity that God, at
 length, blessed the children of the captivity with, when, after a great 
 deal of toil and agitation, at length they gained a settlement in their 
 own land. But it may be taken both as a promise also to all who fear 
 God and work righteousness, that they shall be easy and happy, and as a 
 prophecy of the kingdom of the Messiah and the blessings with which 
 that kingdom should be enriched. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Help at hand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Surely his salvation is nigh,</I> nigh to us, nigher than we think 
 it is: it will soon be effected, how great soever our difficulties and 
 distresses are, when God's time shall come, and that time is not far 
 off." When the tale of bricks is doubled, then Moses comes. It is nigh 
 to all who fear him; when trouble is nigh salvation is nigh, for God is 
 a very present help in time of trouble to all who are his; whereas 
 <I>salvation is far from the wicked,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:155">Ps.  cxix. 155</A>.

 This may fitly be applied to Christ the author of eternal salvation: it
 was the comfort of the Old-Testament saints that, though they lived not 
 to see that redemption in Jerusalem which they waited for, yet they 
 were sure it was nigh, and would be welcome, to all that fear God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Honour secured: "<I>That glory may dwell in our land,</I> that we 
 may have the worship of God settled and established among us; for that 
 is the glory of a land. When that goes, <I>Ichabod--the glory has
 departed;</I> when that stays glory dwells." This may refer to the 
 Messiah, who was to be <I>the glory of his people Israel,</I> and who 
 came and dwelt among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:4">John i. 4</A>),

 for which reason their land is called <I>Immanuel's land,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:8">Isa. viii. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Graces meeting, and happily embracing 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>):

 <I>Mercy and truth, righteousness and peace, kiss each other.</I> This 
 may be understood, 

 (1.) Of the reformation of the people and of the government, in the 
 administration of which all those graces should be conspicuous and 
 commanding. The rulers and ruled shall all be merciful and true, 
 righteous and peaceable. When there is no truth nor mercy all goes to 
 ruin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:1,Isa+59:14,15">Hos. iv. 1; Isa. lix. 14, 15</A>);

 but when these meet in the management of all affairs, when these give 
 aim, when these give law, when there is such plenty of truth that it 
 sprouts up like the grass of the earth, and of righteousness that it is 
 showered down like rain from heaven, then things go well. When in every 
 congress mercy and truth meet, in every embrace righteousness and peace 
 kiss, and common honesty is indeed common, then glory dwells in a land, 
 as the sin of reigning dishonesty is a reproach to any people. 

 (2.) Of the return of God's favour, and the continuance of it, 
 thereupon. When a people return to God and adhere to him in a way of 
 duty he will return to them and abide with them in a way of mercy. So 
 some understand this, man's truth and God's mercy, man's righteousness 
 and God's peace, meet together. If God find us true to him, to one 
 another, to ourselves, we shall find him merciful. If we make 
 conscience of righteousness, we shall have the comfort of peace. If 
 <I>truth spring out of the earth,</I> that is (as Dr. Hammond expounds 
 it), out of the hearts of men, the proper soil for it to grow in, 
 righteousness (that is, God's mercy) shall look down from heaven, as 
 the sun does upon the world when it sheds its influences on the 
 productions of the earth and cherishes them. 

 (3.) Of the harmony of the divine attributes in the Messiah's 
 undertaking. In him who is both our salvation and our glory <I>mercy 
 and truth have met together;</I> God's mercy and truth, and his 
 <I>righteousness and peace, have kissed each other;</I> that is, the 
 great affair of our salvation is so well contrived, so well concerted, 
 that God may have mercy upon poor sinners, and be at peace with them, 
 without any wrong to his truth and righteousness. He is true to the 
 threatening, and just in his government, and yet pardons sinners and 
 takes them into covenant with himself. Christ, as Mediator, brings 
 heaven and earth together again, which sin had set at variance; through 
 him <I>truth springs out of the earth,</I> that truth which God 
 <I>desires in the inward part,</I> and then <I>righteousness looks down 
 from heaven;</I> for God is <I>just, and the justifier of those who 
 believe in Jesus.</I> Or it may denote that in the kingdom of the 
 Messiah these graces shall flourish and prevail and have a universal 
 command.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Great plenty of every thing desirable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>The Lord shall give that which is good,</I> every thing that he sees 
 to be good for us. All good comes from God's goodness; and when mercy, 
 truth, and righteousness, have a sovereign influence on men's hearts 
 and lives, all good may be expected. If we thus <I>seek the 
 righteousness of God's kingdom, other things shall be added;</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:33">Matt. vi. 33</A>.

 When the glory of the gospel dwells in our land, then it shall yield
 its increase, for soul-prosperity will either bring outward prosperity
 along with it or sweeten the want of it. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:6">Ps.  lxvii. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. A sure guidance in the good way 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+85:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>The righteousness</I> of his promise which he has made to us, 
 assuring us of happiness, and the righteousness of sanctification, that 
 good work which he has wrought in us, these shall go before him to 
 prepare his way, both to raise our expectations of his favour and to 
 qualify us for it; and these shall go before us also, and be our guide 
 to <I>set us in the way of his steps,</I> that is, to encourage our 
 hopes and guide our practice, that we may go forth to meet him when he 
 is coming towards us in ways of mercy. Christ, the sun of 
 righteousness, shall bring us to God, and put us into the way that 
 leads to him. John Baptist, a preacher of righteousness, shall go 
 before Christ to prepare his way.  Righteousness is a sure guide both 
 in meeting God and in following him.</P>
