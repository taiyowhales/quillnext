 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some of the Jewish doctors are of opinion that this is the most 
 excellent of all the psalms of David; and a very pious devout 
 meditation it is upon the doctrine of God's omniscience, which we 
 should therefore have our hearts fixed upon and filled with in singing 
 this psalm. 

 I. This doctrine is here asserted, and fully laid down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:1-6">ver.  1-6</A>.

 II.  It is confirmed by two arguments:--

 1. God is every where present; therefore he knows all, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:7-12">ver. 7-12</A>.

 2. He made us, therefore he knows us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:13-16">ver. 13-16</A>.

 III. Some inferences are drawn from this doctrine.  

 1. It may fill us with pleasing admiration of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:17,18">ver. 17, 18</A>.

 2. With a holy dread and detestation of sin and sinners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:19-22">ver. 19-22</A>.

 3.  With a holy satisfaction in our own integrity, concerning which we 
 may appeal to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:23,24">ver. 23, 24</A>.

 This great and self-evident truth, That God knows our hearts, and the 
 hearts of all the children of men, if we did but mix faith with it and 
 seriously consider it and apply it, would have a great influence upon 
 our holiness and upon our comfort.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, thou
 hast searched me, and known <I>me.</I>
 &nbsp; 2  Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou
 understandest my thought afar off.
 &nbsp; 3  Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted
 <I>with</I> all my ways.
 &nbsp; 4  For <I>there is</I> not a word in my tongue, <I>but,</I> lo, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 thou knowest it altogether.
 &nbsp; 5  Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand
 upon me.
 &nbsp; 6  <I>Such</I> knowledge <I>is</I> too wonderful for me; it is high, I
 cannot <I>attain</I> unto it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here lays down this great doctrine, That the God with whom we 
 have to do has a perfect knowledge of us, and that all the motions and 
 actions both of our inward and of our outward man are naked and open 
 before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He lays down this doctrine in the way of an address to God; he says 
 it to him, acknowledging it to him, and giving him the glory of it. 
 Divine truths look fully as well when they are prayed over as when they 
 are preached over, and much better than when they are disputed over. 
 When we speak of God to him himself we shall find ourselves concerned 
 to speak with the utmost degree both of sincerity and reverence, which 
 will be likely to make the impressions the deeper.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He lays it down in a way of application to himself, not, "Thou hast 
 known <I>all,</I>" but, "Thou hast known <I>me;</I> that is it which I 
 am most concerned to believe and which it will be most profitable for 
 me to consider." <I>Then</I> we know these things for our good when we 
 know them <I>for ourselves,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:27">Job v. 27</A>.

 When we acknowledge, "Lord, all souls are thine," we must add, "My soul 
 is thine; thou that hatest all sin hatest my sin; thou that art good to 
 all, good to Israel, art good to me." So here, "<I>Thou hast searched 
 me, and known me;</I> known me as thoroughly as we know that which we 
 have most diligently and exactly searched into." David was a king, and 
 <I>the hearts of kings are unsearchable</I> to their subjects 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:3">Prov.  xxv. 3</A>),
 
 but they are not so to their Sovereign.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He descends to particulars: "Thou knowest me wherever I am and 
 whatever I am doing, me and all that belongs to me." 

 1. "<I>Thou knowest</I> me and all my motions, <I>my down-sitting</I>
 to rest, <I>my up-rising</I> to work, with what temper of mind I 
 compose myself when I sit down and stir up myself when I rise up, what 
 my soul reposes itself in as its stay and support, what it aims at and 
 reaches towards as its felicity and end. Thou knowest me when I come 
 home, how I walk before my house, and when I go abroad, on what errands 
 I go." 

 2. "Thou knowest all my imaginations. Nothing is more close and quick
 than thought; it is always unknown to others; it is often unobserved by 
 ourselves, and yet <I>thou understandest my thought afar off.</I> 
 Though my thoughts be ever so foreign and distant from one another, 
 thou understandest the chain of them, and canst make out their 
 connexion, when so many of them slip my notice that I myself cannot." 
 Or, "<I>Thou understandest them afar off,</I> even before I think them, 
 and long after I have thought them and have myself forgotten them." Or, 
 "<I>Thou understandest them from afar;</I> from the height of heaven 
 thou seest into the depths of the heart,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:14">Ps. xxxiii. 14</A>.

 3. "Thou knowest me and all my designs and undertakings; <I>thou 
 compassest</I> every particular <I>path; thou siftest</I> (or 
 <I>winnowest</I>) <I>my path</I>" (so some), "so as thoroughly to
 distinguish between the good and evil of what I do," as by sifting we 
 separate between the corn and the chaff. All our actions are ventilated 
 by the judgment of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:3">Ps.  xvii. 3</A>.

 God takes notice of every step we take, every right step and every 
 by-step. He is <I>acquainted with all</I> our <I>ways,</I> intimately 
 acquainted with them; he knows what rule we walk by, what end we walk 
 towards, what company we walk with.  

 4. "<I>Thou knowest</I> me in all my retirements; thou knowest <I>my
 lying down;</I> when I am withdrawn from all company, and am reflecting 
 upon what has passed all day and composing myself to rest, thou knowest 
 what I have in my heart and with what thought I go to bed." 

 5. "Thou knowest me, and all I say

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):
 
 <I>There is not a word in my tongue,</I> not a vain word, nor a good 
 word, <I>but thou knowest it altogether,</I> knowest what it meant, 
 from what thought it came, and with what design it was uttered.  There 
 is not a word at my tongue's end, ready to be spoken, yet checked and 
 kept in, but thou knowest it." <I>When there is not a word in my 
 tongue, O Lord! thou knowest all</I> (so some read it); for thoughts 
 are words to God. 

 6. "Thou knowest me in every part of me: <I>Thou hast beset me behind
 and before,</I> so that, go which way I will, I am under thy eye and 
 cannot possibly escape it. Thou hast <I>laid thy hand upon me,</I> and 
 I can not run away from thee." Wherever we are we are under the eye and 
 hand of God. Perhaps it is an allusion to the physician's laying his
 hand upon his patient to feel how his pulse beats or what temper he is 
 in. God knows us as we know not only what we see, but what we feel and 
 have our hands upon. <I>All his saints are in his hand.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He speaks of it with admiration 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>It is too wonderful for me; it is high.</I> 

 1. "Thou hast such a knowledge of me as I have not of myself, nor can
 have. I cannot take notice of all my own thoughts, nor make such a 
 judgment of myself as thou makest of me." 

 2. "It is such a knowledge as I cannot comprehend, much less describe. 
 That thou knowest all things I am sure, but how I cannot tell." We 
 cannot by searching find out how God searches and finds out us; nor do 
 we know how we are known.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee
 from thy presence?
 &nbsp; 8  If I ascend up into heaven, thou <I>art</I> there: if I make my
 bed in hell, behold, thou <I>art there.</I>
 &nbsp; 9  <I>If</I> I take the wings of the morning, <I>and</I> dwell in the
 uttermost parts of the sea;
 &nbsp; 10  Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall
 hold me.
 &nbsp; 11  If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night
 shall be light about me.
 &nbsp; 12  Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night
 shineth as the day: the darkness and the light <I>are</I> both alike
 <I>to thee.</I>
 &nbsp; 13  For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my
 mother's womb.
 &nbsp; 14  I will praise thee; for I am fearfully <I>and</I> wonderfully
 made: marvellous <I>are</I> thy works; and <I>that</I> my soul knoweth
 right well.
 &nbsp; 15  My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in
 secret, <I>and</I> curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
 &nbsp; 16  Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in
 thy book all <I>my members</I> were written, <I>which</I> in continuance
 were fashioned, when <I>as yet there was</I> none of them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is of great use to us to know the certainty of the things wherein we 
 have been instructed, that we may not only believe them, but be able to 
 tell why we believe them, and to give a reason of the hope that is in 
 us. David is sure that God perfectly knows him and all his ways,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Because he is always under his eye. If God is omnipresent, he must 
 needs be omniscient; but he is omnipresent; this supposes the infinite 
 and immensity of his being, from which follows the ubiquity of his 
 presence; heaven and earth include the whole creation, and the Creator 
 fills both 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:24">Jer. xxiii. 24</A>);

 he not only knows both, and governs both, but he fills both. Every part 
 of the creation is under God's intuition and influence. David here 
 acknowledges this also with application and sees himself thus open 
 before God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. No flight can remove us out of God's presence: "<I>Whither shall I 
 go from thy Spirit, from thy presence,</I> that is, from thy spiritual 
 presence, from thyself, who art a Spirit?" <I>God is a Spirit,</I> and 
 therefore it is folly to think that because we cannot see him he cannot 
 see us: <I>Whither shall I flee from thy presence?</I> Not that he 
 desired to go away from God; no, he desired nothing more than to be 
 near him; but he only puts the case, "Suppose I should be so foolish as 
 to think of getting out of thy sight, that I might shake off the awe of 
 thee, suppose I should think of revolting from my obedience to thee, or 
 of disowning a dependence on thee and of shifting for myself, alas! 
 whither can I go?" A heathen could say, <I>Quocunque te flexeris, ibi 
 Deum videbis occurrentem tibi--Whithersoever thou turnest thyself, thou
 wilt see God meeting thee.</I> Seneca. He specifies the most remote and 
 distant places, and counts upon meeting God in them. 

 (1.) In heaven: "<I>If I ascend</I> thither, as I hope to do shortly,
 <I>thou art there,</I> and it will be my eternal bliss to be with thee 
 there." Heaven is a vast large place, replenished with an innumerable 
 company, and yet there is no escaping God's eye there, in any corner, 
 or in any crowd.  The inhabitants of that world have as necessary a 
 dependence upon God, and lie as open to his strict scrutiny, as the 
 inhabitants of this.

 (2.) <I>In hell</I>--in <I>Sheol,</I> which may be understood of the 
 depth of the earth, the very centre of it. Should we dig as deep as we 
 can under ground, and think to hide ourselves there, we should be 
 mistaken; God knows that path which the vulture's eye never saw, and to 
 him the earth is all surface. Or it may be understood of the state of 
 the dead. When we are removed out of the sight of all living, yet not 
 out of the sight of the living God; from his eye we cannot hide 
 ourselves in the grave. Or it maybe understood of the place of the 
 damned: <I>If I make my bed in hell</I> (an uncomfortable place to make 
 a bed in, where there is no rest day or night, yet thousands will make 
 their bed for ever in those flames), <I>behold, thou art there,</I> in 
 thy power and justice. God's wrath is the fire which will there burn 
 everlastingly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:10">Rev. xiv. 10</A>.

 (3.) In the remotest corners of this world: "<I>If I take the wings of
 the morning,</I> the rays of the morning-light (called the wings of the 
 sun, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+4:2">Mal. iv. 2</A>),

 than which nothing more swift, and flee upon them to <I>the uttermost 
 parts of the sea,</I> or of the earth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:12,13">Job xxxviii. 12, 13</A>),

 should I flee to the most distant and obscure islands (the <I>ultima 
 Thule,</I> the <I>Terra incognita</I>), I should find thee there; 
 <I>there shall thy hand lead me,</I> as far as I go, <I>and thy right 
 hand hold me,</I> that I can go no further, that I cannot go out of thy 
 reach." God soon arrested Jonah when <I>he fled to Tarshish from the 
 presence of the Lord.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. No veil can hide us from God's eye, no, not that of the thickest 
 darkness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 "<I>If I say,</I> Yet <I>the darkness shall cover me,</I> when nothing 
 else will, alas! I find myself deceived; the curtains of the evening 
 will stand me in no more stead than the wings of the morning; <I>even 
 the night shall be light about me.</I> That which often favours the 
 escape of a pursued criminal, and the retreat of a beaten army, will do 
 me no kindness in fleeing from them." When God divided between the 
 light and darkness it was with a reservation of this prerogative, that 
 to himself <I>the darkness and the light</I> should still be <I>both 
 alike. "The darkness</I> darkeneth <I>not from thee,</I> for there is 
 no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide 
 themselves." No hypocritical mask or disguise, how specious soever, can 
 save any person or action from appearing in a true light before God. 
 Secret haunts of sin are as open before God as the most open and 
 barefaced villanies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Because he is the work of his hands. He that framed the engine 
 knows all the motions of it. God made us, and therefore no doubt he 
 knows us; he saw us when we were in the forming, and can we be hidden 
 from him now that we are formed? This argument he insists upon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:13-16"><I>v.</I> 13-16</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast possessed my reins;</I> thou art Master of my most secret 
 thoughts and intentions, and the innermost recesses of my soul; thou 
 not only knowest, but governest, them, as we do that which we have 
 possession of; and the possession thou hast of my reins is a rightful 
 possession, <I>for thou coveredst me in my mother's womb,</I> that is, 
 thou madest me 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:11">Job x. 11</A>),

 thou madest me in secret. The soul is concealed form all about us. 
 <I>Who knows the things of a man, save the spirit of a man?</I>" 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:11">1 Cor. ii. 11</A>.

 Hence we read of <I>the hidden man of the heart.</I> But it was God 
 himself that thus covered us, and therefore he can, when he pleases, 
 discover us; when he hid us from all the world he did not intend to 
 hide us from himself. Concerning the formation of man, of each of 
 us,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The glory of it is here given to God, entirely to him; <I>for it is 
 he that has made us and not we ourselves. "I will praise thee,</I> the 
 author of my being; my parents were only the instruments of it." It was 
 done, 

 (1.) Under the divine inspection: <I>My substance,</I> when hid in the
 womb, nay, when it was yet but <I>in fieri--in the forming,</I> an 
 unshapen embryo, <I>was not hidden from thee; thy eyes did see my 
 substance.</I>

 (2.) By the divine operation. As the eye of God saw us then, so his 
 hand wrought us; we were his work.

 (3.) According to the divine model: <I>In thy book all my members were 
 written.</I> Eternal wisdom formed the plan, and by that almighty power 
 raised the noble structure.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Glorious things are here said concerning it. The generation of man 
 is to be considered with the same pious veneration as his creation at 
 first. Consider it, 

 (1.) As a great marvel, a great miracle we might call it, but that it
 is done in the ordinary course of nature. We are <I>fearfully and 
 wonderfully made;</I> we may justly be astonished at the admirable 
 contrivance of these living temples, the composition of every part, and 
 the harmony of all together.

 (2.) As a great mystery, a mystery of nature: <I>My soul knows right
 well</I> that it is marvellous, but how to describe it for any one else 
 I know not; for <I>I was made in secret, and curiously wrought</I> in 
 the womb as <I>in the lowest parts of the earth,</I> so privately, and 
 so far out of sight.

 (3.) As a great mercy, that all our members <I>in continuance were
 fashioned,</I> according as they were written in the book of God's wise 
 counsel, <I>when as yet there was none of them;</I> or, as some read 
 it, <I>and none of them was left out.</I> If any of our members had 
 been wanting in God's book, they would have been wanting in our bodies, 
 but, through his goodness, we have all our limbs and sense, the want of 
 any of which might have made us burdens to ourselves. See what reason 
 we have then to praise God for our creation, and to conclude that he 
 who saw our substance when it was unfashioned sees it now that it is 
 fashioned.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great
 is the sum of them!

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here the psalmist makes application of the doctrine of God's 
 omniscience, divers ways.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He acknowledges, with wonder and thankfulness, the care God had 
 taken of him all his days, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 God, who knew him, thought of him, and his thoughts towards him were 
 thoughts of love, <I>thoughts of good, and not of evil,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:11">Jer. xxix. 11</A>.

 God's omniscience, which might justly have watched over us to do us 
 hurt, has been employed for us, and has watched over us to do us good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:28">Jer. xxxi. 28</A>.

 God's counsels concerning us and our welfare have been, 

 1.  Precious to admiration: <I>How precious</I> are they! They are deep
 in themselves, such as cannot possibly be fathomed and comprehended.  
 Providence has had a vast reach in its dispensations concerning us, and 
 has brought things about for our good quite beyond our contrivance and 
 foresight.  They are dear to us; we must think of them with a great 
 deal of reverence, and yet with pleasure and thankfulness. Our thoughts 
 concerning God must be delightful to us, above any other thoughts. 

 2.  Numerous to admiration: <I>How great is the sum of them!</I> We
 cannot conceive how many God's kind counsels have been concerning us, 
 how many good turns he has done us, and what variety of mercies we have 
 received from him. <I>If</I> we would <I>count them,</I> the heads of 
 them, much more the particulars of them, <I>they are more in number 
 than the sand,</I> and yet every one great and very considerable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:5">Ps. xl. 5</A>.

 We cannot conceive the multitude of God's compassions, which are all 
 new every morning. 

 3.  Constant at all times: "<I>When I awake,</I> every morning, <I>I am
 still with thee,</I> under thy eye and care, safe and easy under thy 
 protection." This bespeaks also the continual devout sense David had of 
 the eye of God upon him: <I>When I awake I am with thee,</I> in my 
 thoughts; and it would help to keep us in the fear of the Lord all the 
 day long if, when we awake in the morning, our first thoughts were of 
 him and we did then set him before us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He concludes from this doctrine that ruin will certainly be the end 
 of sinners. God knows all the wickedness of the wicked, and therefore 
 he will reckon for it: "<I>Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God!</I> 
 for all their wickedness is open before thee, however it may be 
 artfully disguised and coloured over, to hide it from the eye of the 
 world. However thou suffer them to prosper for a while, <I>surely thou 
 wilt slay</I> them at last." Now observe, 

 1. The reason why God will punish them, because they daringly affront
 him and set him at defiance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>They speak against thee wickedly;</I> they <I>set their mouth 
 against the heavens</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:9">Ps. lxxiii. 9</A>),

 and shall be called to account for the hard speeches they have 
 <I>spoken against him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:15">Jude 15</A>.

 They are his <I>enemies,</I> and declare their enmity by <I>taking his
 name in vain,</I> as we show our contempt of a man if we make a by-word
 of his name, and never mention him but in a way of jest and banter.
 Those that profane the sacred forms of swearing or praying by using
 them in an impertinent irreverent manner take God's name in vain, and
 thereby show themselves enemies to him. Some make it to be a
 description of hypocrites: "They speak of thee for mischief; they talk
 of God, pretending to piety, but it is with some ill design, for a 
 cloak of maliciousness; and, being enemies to God, while they pretend 
 friendship, they <I>take</I> his <I>name in vain;</I> they swear 
 falsely." 

 2. The use David makes of this prospect which he has of the ruin of the
 wicked.

 (1.) He defies them: "<I>Depart from me, you bloody men;</I> you shall
 not debauch me, for I will not admit your friendship nor have 
 fellowship with you; and you cannot destroy me, for, being under God's 
 protection, he shall force you to depart from me."

 (2.) He detests them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>):

 "Lord, thou knowest the heart, and canst witness for me; <I>do not I 
 hate those that hate thee,</I> and for that reason, because they hate 
 thee? I hate them because I love thee, and hate to see such affronts 
 and indignities put upon thy blessed name.  <I>Am not I grieved with 
 those that rise up against thee,</I> grieved to see their rebellion and 
 to foresee their ruin, which it will certainly end in?" Note, Sin is 
 hated, and sinners are lamented, by all that fear God. "<I>I hate 
 them</I>" (that is, "<I>I hate the work of them that turn aside,</I>" 
 as he explains himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:3">Ps. ci. 3</A>)

 "<I>with a</I> sincere and <I>perfect hatred; I count those</I> that 
 are enemies to God as enemies to me, and will not have any intimacy 
 with them," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:8">Ps.  lxix. 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He appeals to God concerning his sincerity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+139:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 1. He desires that as far as he was in the wrong God would discover it 
 to him. Those that are upright can take comfort in God's omniscience as 
 a witness of their uprightness, and can with a humble confidence beg of 
 him to search and try them, to discover them to themselves (for a good 
 man desires to know the worst of himself) and to discover them to 
 others. He that means honestly could wish he had a window in his breast 
 that any man may look into his heart: "Lord, I hope I am not in a 
 wicked way, but <I>see if there be any wicked way in me,</I> any 
 corrupt inclination remaining; let me see it; and root it out of me, 
 for I do not allow it." 

 2. He desires that, as far as he was in the right, he might be
 forwarded in it, which he that knows the heart knows how to do 
 effectually: <I>Lead me in the way everlasting.</I> Note,

 (1.) The way of godliness is an everlasting way; it is everlastingly
 true and good, pleasing to God and profitable to us, and will end in 
 everlasting life. <I>It is the way of antiquity</I> (so some), <I>the 
 good old way.</I> 

 (2.) All the saints desire to be kept and led in this way, that they 
 may not miss it, turn out of it, nor tire in it.</P>
