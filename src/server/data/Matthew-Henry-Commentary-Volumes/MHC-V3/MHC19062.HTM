 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm has nothing in it directly either of prayer or praise, nor 
 does it appear upon what occasion it was penned, nor whether upon any 
 particular occasion, whether mournful or joyful. But in it, 

 I. David with a great deal of pleasure professes his own confidence in
 God and dependence upon him, and encourages himself to continue waiting 
 on him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. With a great deal of earnestness he excites and encourages others
 to trust in God likewise, and not in any creature, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:8-12">ver.  8-12</A>.

 In singing it we should stir up ourselves to wait on God.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician, to Jeduthun. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him <I>cometh</I>
 my salvation.
 &nbsp; 2  He only <I>is</I> my rock and my salvation; <I>he is</I> my defence; I
 shall not be greatly moved.
 &nbsp; 3  How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be
 slain all of you: as a bowing wall <I>shall ye be, and as</I> a
 tottering fence.
 &nbsp; 4  They only consult to cast <I>him</I> down from his excellency:
 they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse
 inwardly. Selah.
 &nbsp; 5  My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation <I>is</I>
 from him.
 &nbsp; 6  He only <I>is</I> my rock and my salvation: <I>he is</I> my defence; I
 shall not be moved.
 &nbsp; 7  In God <I>is</I> my salvation and my glory: the rock of my
 strength, <I>and</I> my refuge, <I>is</I> in God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David's profession of dependence upon God, and upon him only, for 
 all good 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Truly my soul waiteth upon God. Nevertheless</I> (so some) or
 "<I>However it be,</I> whatever difficulties or dangers I may meet 
 with, though God frown upon me and I meet with discouragements in my 
 attendance on him, yet still my soul waits upon God" (or <I>is silent 
 to God,</I> as the word is), "Says nothing against what he does, but 
 quietly expects what he will do." We are in the way both of duty and 
 comfort when our souls wait upon God, when we cheerfully refer 
 ourselves, and the disposal of all our affairs, to his will and wisdom, 
 when we acquiesce in and accommodate ourselves to all the dispensations 
 of his providence, and patiently expect a doubtful event, with an 
 entire satisfaction in his righteousness and goodness, <I>however it 
 be. Is not my soul subject to God?</I> So the LXX. So it, certainly so
 it ought to be; our wills must be melted into his will.  <I>My soul has 
 respect to God, for from him cometh my salvation.</I> He doubts not but 
 his salvation will come, though now he was threatened and in danger, 
 and he expects it to come from God, and from him only; for <I>in vain 
 is it hoped for from hills and mountains,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+3:23,Ps+121:1,2">Jer. iii. 23; Ps. cxxi. 1, 2</A>.
 
 "From him I know it will come, and therefore on him will I patiently
 wait till it does come, for his time is the best time." We may apply it 
 to our eternal salvation, which is called <I>the salvation of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:23">Ps. l. 23</A>);

 from him it comes; he prepared it for us, he prepares us for it, and
 preserves us to it, and therefore let our souls wait on him, to be 
 conducted through this world to that eternal salvation, in such way as 
 he thinks fit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The ground and reason of this dependence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence.</I>

 1. "He has been so many a time; in him I have found shelter, and
 strength, and succour. He has by his grace supported me and borne me up 
 under my troubles, and by his providence defended me from the insults 
 of my enemies and delivered me out of the troubles into which I was
 plunged; and therefore <I>I trust he will deliver me,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:10">2 Cor. i. 10</A>.

 2. "He only can be my rock and my salvation.  Creatures are
 insufficient; they are nothing without him, and therefore I will look
 above them to him."

 3. "He has by covenant undertaken to be so. Even he that is the rock of
 ages is my rock; he that is the God of salvation is my salvation; he 
 that is the Most High is my high place; and therefore I have all the 
 reason in the world to confide in him."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The improvement he makes of his confidence in God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Trusting in God, his heart is fixed. "If God is my strength and 
 mighty deliverer, <I>I shall not be greatly moved</I> (that is, I shall
 not be undone and ruined); I may be shocked, but I shall not be sunk." 
 Or, "I shall not be much disturbed and disquieted in my own breast. I 
 may be put into some fright, but I shall not be afraid with any 
 amazement, nor so as to be put out of the possession of my own soul. I 
 may be perplexed, but not in despair," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:8">2 Cor. iv. 8</A>.

 This hope in God will be an anchor of the soul, sure and stedfast.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His enemies are slighted, and all their attempts against him looked 
 upon by him with contempt, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 If God be for us, we need not fear what man can do against us, though 
 ever so mighty and malicious. He here,

 (1.) Gives a character of his enemies: <I>They imagine mischief,</I> 
 design it with a great deal of the serpent's venom and contrive it with 
 a great deal of the serpent's subtlety, and this <I>against a man,</I> 
 one of their own kind, against one single man, that is not an equal 
 match for them, for they are many; they continued their malicious 
 persecution though Providence had often defeated their mischievous 
 designs. "<I>How long will you</I> do it? Will you never be convinced 
 of your error? Will your malice never have spent itself?" They are 
 unanimous in their consultations to cast an excellent man <I>down from 
 his excellency,</I> to draw an honest man from his integrity, to 
 entangle him in sin, which is the only thing that can effectually cast 
 us down from our excellency, to thrust a man, whom God has exalted, 
 down from his dignity, and so to fight against God. Envy was at the 
 bottom of their malice; they were grieved at David's advancement, and 
 therefore plotted, by diminishing his character and blackening that 
 (which was casting him down from his excellency) to hinder his 
 preferment. In order to this they calumniate him, and love to hear such 
 bad characters given of him and such bad reports raised and spread 
 concerning him as they themselves know to be false: <I>They delight in 
 lies.</I> And as they make no conscience of lying concerning him, to do 
 him a mischief, so they make no conscience of lying to him, to conceal 
 the mischief they design, and accomplish it the more effectually: 
 <I>They bless with their mouth</I> (they compliment David to his face), 
 <I>but they curse inwardly;</I> in their hearts they wish him all 
 mischief, and privately they are plotting against him and in their 
 cabals carrying on some evil design or other, by which they hope to 
 ruin him. It is dangerous putting our trust in men who are thus false; 
 but God is faithful. 

 (2.) He reads their doom, pronounces a sentence of death upon them, not 
 as a king, but as a prophet: <I>You shall be slain all of you,</I> by 
 the righteous judgments of God. Saul and his servants were slain by the 
 Philistines on Mount Gilboa, according to this prediction. Those who 
 seek the ruin of God's chosen are but preparing ruin for themselves. 
 God's church is built upon a rock which will stand, but those that 
 fight against it, and its patrons and protectors, shall be <I>as a 
 bowing wall and a tottering fence,</I> which, having a rotten 
 foundation, sinks with its own weight, falls of a sudden, and buries 
 those in the ruins of it that put themselves under the shadow and 
 shelter of it. David, having put his confidence in God, thus foresees 
 the overthrow of his enemies, and, in effect, sets them at defiance and 
 bids them do their worst.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He is himself encouraged to continue waiting upon God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>):
 
 <I>My soul, wait thou only upon God.</I> Note, The good we do we should
 stir up ourselves to continue doing, and to do yet more and more, as 
 those that have, through grace, experienced the comfort and benefit of 
 it. We have found it good to wait upon God, and therefore should charge 
 our souls, and even charm them, into such a constant dependence upon 
 him as may make us always easy. He had said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>From him cometh my salvation;</I> he says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 <I>My expectation is from him.</I> His salvation was the principal
 matter of his expectation; let him have that from God, and he expects 
 no more. His salvation being from God, all his other expectations are 
 from him. "If God will save my soul, as to every thing else let him do 
 what he pleases with me, and I will acquiesce in his disposals, knowing 
 they shall <I>all turn to my salvation,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:19">Phil. i. 19</A>.
 
 He repeats 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 what he had said concerning God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 as one that was not only assured of it, but greatly pleased with it,
 and that dwelt much upon it in his thoughts: <I>He only is my rock and 
 my salvation; he is my defence,</I> I know he is; but there he adds, 
 <I>I shall not be greatly moved,</I> here, <I>I shall not be moved at 
 all.</I> Note, The more faith is acted the more active it is. 
 <I>Crescit eundo--It grows by being exercised.</I> The more we meditate 
 upon God's attributes and promises, and our own experience, the more 
 ground we get of our fears, which, like Haman, when they begin to fall, 
 shall fall before us, and we shall be <I>kept in perfect peace,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:3">Isa. xxvi. 3</A>.

 And, as David's faith in God advances to an unshaken stayedness, so his
 joy in God improves itself into a holy triumph 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>In God is my salvation and my glory.</I> Where our salvation is
 there our glory is; for what is our salvation but the glory to be 
 revealed, the eternal weight of glory? And there our glorying must be. 
 In God let us boast all the day long. "The <I>rock of my strength</I> 
 (that is, my strong rock, on which I build my hopes and stay myself) 
 <I>and my refuge,</I> to which I flee for shelter when I am pursued, 
 <I>is in God,</I> and in him only. I have no other to flee to, no other 
 to trust to; the more I think of it the better satisfied I am in the 
 choice I have made." Thus does he <I>delight himself in the Lord, and 
 then ride upon the high places of the earth,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Trust in him at all times; <I>ye</I> people, pour out your heart
 before him: God <I>is</I> a refuge for us. Selah.
 &nbsp; 9  Surely men of low degree <I>are</I> vanity, <I>and</I> men of high

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here we have David's exhortation to others to trust in God and wait 
 upon him, as he had done. Those that have found the comfort of the ways 
 of God themselves will invite others into those ways; there is enough 
 in God for all the saints to draw from, and we shall have never the 
 less for others sharing with us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He counsels all to wait upon God, as he did, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. To whom he gives this good counsel: <I>You people</I> (that is, all 
 people); all shall be welcome to trust in God, for he is <I>the 
 confidence of all the ends of the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:5">Ps. lxv. 5</A>.

 <I>You people of the house of Israel</I> (so the Chaldee); they are
 especially engaged and invited to trust in God, for he is the God of 
 Israel; and should not a people seek unto their God?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What the good counsel is which he gives. 

 (1.) To confide in God: "<I>Trust in him;</I> deal with him, and be 
 willing to deal upon trust; depend upon him to perform all things for 
 you, upon his wisdom and goodness, his power and promise, his 
 providence and grace. Do this <I>at all times.</I>" We must have an 
 habitual confidence in God always, must live a life of dependence upon 
 him, must so trust in him at all times as not at any time to put that 
 confidence in ourselves, or in any creature, which is to be put in him 
 only; and we must have an actual confidence in God upon all occasions, 
 trust in him upon every emergency, to guide us when we are in doubt, to 
 protect us when we are in danger, to supply us when we are in want, to 
 strengthen us for every good word and work. 

 (2.) To converse with God: <I>Pour out your heart before him.</I> The 
 expression seems to allude to the pouring out of the drink-offerings 
 before the Lord. When we make a penitent confession of sin our hearts 
 are therein <I>poured out before God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:6">1 Sam. vii. 6</A>.

 But here it is meant of prayer, which, if it be as it should be, is the 
 pouring out of the heart before God. We must lay our grievances before 
 him, offer up our desires to him with all humble freedom, and then 
 entirely refer ourselves to his disposal, patiently submitting our 
 wills to his: this is pouring out our hearts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What encouragement he gives us to take this good counsel: <I>God is 
 a refuge for us,</I> not only my refuge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 but a refuge for us all, even as many as will flee to him and take
 shelter in him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He cautions us to take heed of misplacing our confidence, in which, 
 as much as in any thing, <I>the heart is deceitful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:5-9">Jer. xvii. 5-9</A>.
 
 Those that trust in God truly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 will trust in him only,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 1.  Let us not trust in the men of this world, for they are broken
 reeds 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Surely men of low degree are vanity,</I> utterly unable to help us,
 and <I>men of high degree are a lie,</I> that will deceive us if we 
 trust to them. Men of low degree, one would think, might be relied on 
 for their multitude and number, their bodily strength and service, and 
 men of high degree for their wisdom, power, and influence; but neither 
 the one nor the other are to be depended on.  Of the two, men of high 
 degree are mentioned as the more deceiving; for they are <I>a lie,</I> 
 which denotes not only vanity, but iniquity. We are not so apt to 
 depend upon men of low degree as upon the king and the captain of the 
 host, who, by the figure they make, tempt us to trust in them, and so, 
 when they fail us, prove a lie.  But lay them <I>in the balance,</I> 
 the balance of the scripture, or rather make trial of them, see how 
 they will prove, whether they will answer your expectations from them 
 or no, and you will write <I>Tekel</I> upon them; they are alike 
 <I>lighter than vanity;</I> there is no depending upon their wisdom to 
 advise us, their power to act for us, their good-will to us, no, nor 
 upon their promises, in comparison with God, nor otherwise than in 
 subordination to him.

 2. Let us not trust in the wealth of this world, let not that be made 
 our strong city 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Trust not in oppression;</I> that is, in riches got by fraud and
 violence, because where there is a great deal it is commonly got by 
 indirect scraping or saving (our Saviour calls it the <I>mammon of 
 unrighteousness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+16:9">Luke xvi. 9</A>),

 or in the arts of getting riches.  "Think not, either because you have
 got abundance or are in the way of getting, that therefore you are safe 
 enough; for this is becoming <I>vain in robbery,</I> that is, cheating 
 yourselves while you think to cheat others." He that <I>trusted in the 
 abundance of his riches strengthened himself in his wickedness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:7">Ps. lii. 7</A>);

 but at his end he will be a fool, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:11">Jer. xvii. 11</A>.

 Let none be so stupid as to think of supporting themselves in their
 sin, much less of supporting themselves in this sin. Nay, because it is 
 hard to have riches and not to trust in them, if they increase, though 
 by lawful and honest means, we must take heed lest we let out our 
 affections inordinately towards them: "<I>Set not your heart upon 
 them;</I> be not eager for them, do not take a complacency in them as 
 the rest of your souls, nor put a confidence in them as your portion; 
 be not over-solicitous about them; do not value yourselves and others 
 by them; make not the wealth of the world your chief good and highest 
 end: in short, do not make an idol of it." This we are most in danger 
 of doing when riches increase. When the grounds of the rich man brought 
 forth plentifully, then he said to his soul, <I>Take thy ease</I> in 
 these things,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:19">Luke xii. 19</A>.

 It is a smiling world that is most likely to draw the heart away from
 God, on whom only it should be set.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He gives a very good reason why we should make God our confidence, 
 because he is a God of infinite power, mercy, and righteousness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 This he himself was well assured of and would have us be assured of it: 
 <I>God has spoken once; twice have I heard this;</I> that is,

 1.  "God has spoken it, and I have heard it, once, yea, twice. He has
 spoken it, and I have heard it by the light of reason, which easily 
 infers it from the nature of the infinitely perfect Being and from his 
 works both of creation and providence. He has spoken it, and I have 
 heard once, yea, twice (that is, many a time), by the events that have 
 concerned me in particular. He has spoken it and I have heard it by the 
 light of revelation, by dreams and visions

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:15">Job xiii. 15</A>),

 by the glorious manifestation of himself upon Mount Sinai" (to which,
 some think, it does especially refer), "and by the written word." God 
 has often told us what a great and good God he is, and we ought as 
 often to take notice of what he has told us. Or, 

 2.  "Though God spoke it but once, I heard it twice, heard it 
 diligently, not only with my outward ears, but with my soul and mind." 
 To some God speaks twice and they will not hear once; but to others he 
 speaks but once, and they hear twice. Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:14">Job xxxiii. 14</A>.

 Now what is it which is thus spoken and thus heard? 

 (1.) That the God with whom we have to do is infinite in power. 
 <I>Power belongs to God;</I> he is almighty, and can do every thing; 
 with him nothing is impossible. All the powers of all the creatures are 
 derived form him, depend upon him, and are used by him as he pleases. 
 His is the power, and to him we must ascribe it. This is a good reason 
 why we should trust in him at all times and live in a constant 
 dependence upon him; for he is able to do all that for us which we 
 trust in him for.  

 (2.) That he is a God of infinite goodness. Here the psalmist turns his 
 speech to God himself, as being desirous to give him the glory of his 
 goodness, which is his glory: <I>Also unto thee, O Lord! belongeth 
 mercy.</I> God is not only the greatest, but the best, of beings. Mercy 
 is with him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+130:4,7">Ps. cxxx. 4, 7</A>.

 He is merciful in a way peculiar to himself; he is the <I>Father of
 mercies,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:3">2 Cor. i. 3</A>.

 This is a further reason why we should trust in him, and answers the
 objections of our sinfulness and unworthiness; though we deserve 
 nothing but his wrath, yet we may hope for all good from his mercy, 
 which is over all his works. 

 (3.) That he never did, nor ever will do, any wrong to any of his 
 creatures: <I>For thou renderest to every man according to his 
 work.</I> Though he does not always do this visibly in this world, yet 
 he will do it in the day of recompence. No service done him shall go 
 unrewarded, nor any affront given him unpunished, unless it be repented 
 of. By this it appears that power and mercy belong to him. If he were 
 not a God of power, there are sinners that would be too great to be 
 punished. And if he were not a God of mercy there are services that 
 would be too worthless to be rewarded. This seems especially to bespeak 
 the justice of God in judging upon appeals made to him by wronged 
 innocency; he will be sure to judge according to truth, in giving 
 redress to the injured and avenging them on those that have been
