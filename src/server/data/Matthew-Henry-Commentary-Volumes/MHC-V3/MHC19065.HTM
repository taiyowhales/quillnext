 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this psalm we are directed to give to God the glory of his power and 
 goodness, which appear, 

 I. In the kingdom of grace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:1">ver. 1</A>),
 
 hearing prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:2">ver. 2</A>),
 
 pardoning sin
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:3">ver. 3</A>),
 
 satisfying the souls of the people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:4">ver. 4</A>),

 protecting and supporting them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:5">ver. 5</A>.

 II. In the kingdom of Providence, fixing the mountains 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:6">ver. 6</A>),

 calming the sea 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:7">ver. 7</A>),

 preserving the regular succession of day and night 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:8">ver. 8</A>),

 and making the earth fruitful, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:9-13">ver. 9-13</A>.

 These are blessings we are all indebted to God for, and therefore we 
 may easily accommodate this psalm to ourselves in singing it.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. A psalm <I>and</I> song of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the
 vow be performed.
 &nbsp; 2  O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
 &nbsp; 3  Iniquities prevail against me: <I>as for</I> our transgressions,
 thou shalt purge them away.
 &nbsp; 4  Blessed <I>is the man whom</I> thou choosest, and causest to
 approach <I>unto thee, that</I> he may dwell in thy courts: we shall
 be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, <I>even</I> of thy holy
 temple.
 &nbsp; 5  <I>By</I> terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O
 God of our salvation; <I>who art</I> the confidence of all the ends of
 the earth, and of them that are afar off <I>upon</I> the sea:
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist here has no particular concern of his own at the throne of 
 grace, but begins with an address to God, as the master of an assembly 
 and the mouth of a congregation; and observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he gives glory to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 1. By humble thankfulness: <I>Praise waiteth for thee, O God! in
 Zion,</I> waits till it arrives, that it may be received with 
 thankfulness at its first approach. When God is coming towards us with 
 his favours we must go forth to meet him with our praises, and wait 
 till the day dawn. "Praise waits, with an entire satisfaction in thy 
 holy will and dependence on thy mercy." When we stand ready in every 
 thing to give thanks, then praise waits for God. "Praise waits thy 
 acceptance" the <I>Levites</I> by night <I>stood in the house of the 
 Lord,</I> ready to sing their songs of praise at the hour appointed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+134:1,2">Ps. cxxxiv. 1, 2</A>),

 and thus their praise waited for him. <I>Praise is silent unto thee</I>
 (so the word is), as wanting words to express the great goodness of 
 God, and being struck with a silent admiration at it. As there are holy 
 <I>groanings which cannot be uttered,</I> so there are holy adorings 
 which cannot be uttered, and yet shall be accepted by him that 
 <I>searches the heart and knows what is the mind of the spirit.</I> Our 
 praise is silent, that the praises of the blessed angels, who excel in 
 strength, may be heard. Let it not be told him that I speak, for if a 
 man offer to <I>speak forth all God's praise surely he shall be 
 swallowed up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+37:20">Job xxxvii. 20</A>.

 <I>Before thee praise is reputed as silence</I> (so the Chaldee), so 
 far exalted is God above all our blessing and praise. Praise is due to 
 God from all the world, but it waits for him in Zion only, in his 
 church, among his people. All his works praise him (they minister 
 matter for praise), but only his saints bless him by actual adorations. 
 The redeemed church sing their new song upon Mount Zion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:1,3">Rev. xiv. 1, 3</A>.

 In Zion was God's dwelling-place,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:2">Ps. lxxvi. 2</A>.

 Happy are those who dwell with him there, for they will be still
 praising him. 

 2. By sincere faithfulness: <I>Unto thee shall the vow be 
 performed,</I> that is, the sacrifice shall be offered up which was 
 vowed. We shall not be accepted in our thanksgivings to God for the 
 mercies we have received unless we make conscience of paying the vows 
 which we made when we were in pursuit of the mercy; for better it is 
 not to vow than to vow and not to pay.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What he gives him glory for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. For hearing prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Praise waits for thee;</I> and why is it so ready?

 (1.) "Because thou art ready to grant our petitions. <I>O thou that 
 hearest prayer!</I> thou canst answer every prayer, for thou art able 
 to do for us more than we are able to ask or think 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:20">Eph. iii. 20</A>),

 and thou wilt answer every prayer of faith, either in kind or
 kindness." It is much for the glory of God's goodness, and the 
 encouragement of ours, that he is a God hearing prayer, and has taken 
 it among the titles of his honour to be so; and we are much wanting to 
 ourselves if we do not take all occasions to give him his title.

 (2.) Because, for that reason, we are ready to run to him when we are 
 in our straits. "<I>Therefore,</I> because thou art a God hearing
 prayer, <I>unto thee shall all flesh come;</I> justly does every man's 
 praise wait for thee, because every man's prayer waits on thee when he 
 is in want or distress, whatever he does at other times. Now only the 
 seed of Israel come to thee, and the proselytes to their religion; but, 
 when thy <I>house shall be called a house of prayer to all people,</I> 
 then unto thee shall all flesh come, and be welcome," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:12,13">Rom. x. 12, 13</A>.
 
 To him let us come, and come boldly, because he is a God that hears
 prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. For pardoning sin. In this <I>who is a God like unto him?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+7:18">Micah vii. 18</A>.

 By this he proclaims his name
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+34:7">Exod. xxxiv. 7</A>),

 and therefore, upon this account, praise waits for him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 "Our sins reach to the heavens, <I>iniquities prevail against</I> us,
 and appear so numerous, so heinous, that when they are set in order 
 before us we are full of confusion and ready to fall into despair. They 
 prevail so against us that we cannot pretend to balance them with any 
 righteousness of our own, so that when we appear before God our own 
 consciences accuse us and we have no reply to make; and yet, <I>as for 
 our transgressions, thou shalt,</I> of thy own free mercy and for the 
 sake of a righteousness of thy own providing, <I>purge them away,</I> 
 so that we shall not come into condemnation for them." Note, The 
 greater our danger is by reason of sin the more cause we have to admire 
 the power and riches of God's pardoning mercy, which can invalidate the 
 threatening force of our manifold transgressions and our mighty 
 sins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. For the kind entertainment he gives to those that attend upon him 
 and the comfort they have in communion with him. Iniquity must first be 
 purged away 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)
 
 and then we are welcome to compass God's altars,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Those that come into communion with God shall certainly find true 
 happiness and full satisfaction in that communion.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) They are blessed. Not only blessed is the nation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:12">Ps. xxxiii. 12</A>),

 but <I>blessed is the man,</I> the particular person, how mean soever,
 <I>whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may 
 dwell in thy courts;</I> he is a happy man, for he has the surest token 
 of the divine favour and the surest pledge and earnest of everlasting 
 bliss. Observe here, 

 [1.] What it is to come into communion with God, in order to this 
 blessedness. <I>First,</I> It is to approach to him by laying hold on 
 his covenant, setting our best affections upon him, and letting out our 
 desires towards him; it is to converse with him as one we love and 
 value. <I>Secondly,</I> It is to dwell in his courts, as the priests 
 and Levites did, that were at home in God's house; it is to be constant 
 in the exercises of religion, and apply ourselves closely to them as we 
 do to that which is the business of our dwelling-place.

 [2.] How we come into communion with God, not recommended by any merit 
 of our own, nor brought in by any management of our own, but by God's 
 free choice: "<I>Blessed is the man whom thou choosest,</I> and so 
 distinguishest from others who are left to themselves;" and it is by 
 his effectual special grace pursuant to that choice; whom he chooses he 
 causes to approach, not only invites them, but inclines and enables 
 them, to draw nigh to him. He draws them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:44">John vi. 44</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) They shall be satisfied. Here the psalmist changes the person, 
 not, <I>He</I> shall be satisfied (the man whom thou choosest), but, 
 <I>We</I> shall, which teaches us to apply the promises to ourselves 
 and by an active faith to put our own names into them: <I>We shall be 
 satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.</I> 
 Note, 

 [1.] God's holy temple is his house; there he dwells, where his 
 ordinances are administered.

 [2.] God keeps a good house. There is abundance of goodness in his 
 house, righteousness, grace, and all the comforts of the everlasting 
 covenant; there is enough for all, enough for each; it is ready, always 
 ready; and all on free cost, without money and without price.

 [3.] In those things there is that which is satisfying to a soul, and 
 with which all gracious souls will be satisfied. Let them have the 
 pleasure of communion with God, and that suffices them; they have 
 enough, they desire no more.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. For the glorious operations of his power on their behalf 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 <I>By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of
 our salvation!</I> This may be understood of the rebukes which God in 
 his providence sometimes gives to his own people; he often answers them 
 by terrible things, for the awakening and quickening of them, but 
 always in righteousness; he neither does them any wrong nor means them 
 any hurt, for even then he is the God of their salvation. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:15">Isa. xlv. 15</A>.

 But it is rather to be understood of his judgments upon their enemies;
 God answers his people's prayers by the destructions made, for their 
 sakes, among the heathen, and the recompence he renders to their proud 
 oppressors, as a righteous God, the God to whom vengeance belongs, and 
 as the God that protects and saves his people. By <I>wonderful</I> 
 things (so some read it), things which are very surprising, and which 
 we looked not for,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:3">Isa. lxiv. 3</A>.

 Or, "By things which strike an awe upon us thou wilt answer us." The
 holy freedom that we are admitted to in God's courts, and the nearness 
 of our approach to him, must not at all abate our reverence and godly 
 fear of him; for he is <I>terrible in his holy places.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. For the care he takes of all his people, however distressed, and 
 whithersoever dispersed. He is <I>the confidence of all the ends of the 
 earth</I> that is, of all the saints all the world over and not theirs 
 only that were of the seed of Israel; for he is the God of the Gentiles 
 as well as of the Jews, the confidence <I>of those that are afar 
 off</I> from his holy temple and its courts, that dwell in the islands 
 of the Gentiles, or that are in distress <I>upon the sea.</I> They 
 trust in thee, and cry to thee, when they are at their wits' end, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:27,28">Ps. cvii. 27, 28</A>.

 By faith and prayer we may keep up our communion with God, and fetch in
 comfort from him, wherever we are, not only in the solemn assemblies of 
 his people, but also afar off upon the sea.</P>

 girded with power:

 waves, and the tumult of the people.
 &nbsp; 8  They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy
 tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to
 rejoice.
 &nbsp; 9  Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly
 enrichest it with the river of God, <I>which</I> is full of water:
 thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.
 &nbsp; 10  Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest
 the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou
 blessest the springing thereof.
 &nbsp; 11  Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop
 fatness.
 &nbsp; 12  They drop <I>upon</I> the pastures of the wilderness: and the
 little hills rejoice on every side.
 &nbsp; 13  The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are
 covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 That we may be the more affected with the wonderful condescensions of 
 the God of grace, it is of use to observe his power and sovereignty as 
 the God of nature, the riches and bounty of his providential 
 kingdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He establishes the earth and it abides, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:90">Ps. cxix. 90</A>.

 <I>By his</I> own <I>strength</I> he <I>setteth fast the mountains</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 did set them fast at first and still keeps them firm, though they are

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hence they are called <I>everlasting mountains,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:6">Hab. iii. 6</A>.

 Yet God's covenant with his people is said to stand more firmly than 
 they,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:10">Isa. liv. 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He stills the sea, and it is quiet, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The sea in a storm makes a great noise, which adds to its threatening 
 terror; but, when God pleases, he commands silence among the waves and 
 billows, and lays them to sleep, turns the storm into a calm quickly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:29">Ps. cvii. 29</A>.

 And by this change in the sea, as well as by the former instance of the
 unchangeableness of the earth, it appears that he whose the sea and the 
 dry land are is girded with power. And by this our Lord Jesus gave a 
 proof of his divine power, that he <I>commanded the winds and waves, 
 and they obeyed him.</I> To this instance of the quieting of the sea he 
 adds, as a thing much of the same nature, that he stills <I>the tumult 
 of the people,</I> the common people. Nothing is more unruly and 
 disagreeable than the insurrections of the mob, the insults of the 
 rabble; yet even these God can pacify, in secret ways, which they 
 themselves are not aware of. Or it may be meant of the outrage of the 
 people that were enemies to Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1">Ps. ii. 1</A>.

 God has many ways to still them and will for ever silence their
 tumults.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He renews the morning and evening, and their revolution is 
 constant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 This regular succession of day and night may be considered,

 1. As an instance of God's great power, and so it strikes an awe upon
 all: <I>Those that dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth are afraid 
 at thy</I> signs or <I>tokens;</I> they are by them convinced that 
 there is a supreme deity, a sovereign monarch, before whom they ought 
 to fear and tremble; for in these things the invisible things of God 
 are clearly seen; and therefore they are said to be <I>set for 
 signs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:14">Gen. i. 14</A>.

 Many of those that dwell in the remote and dark corners of the earth
 were so afraid at these tokens that they were driven to worship them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:19">Deut. iv. 19</A>),

 not considering that they were God's tokens, undeniable proofs of his
 power and godhead, and therefore they should have been led by them to 
 worship him. 

 2. As an instance of God's great goodness, and so it brings comfort to 
 all: <I>Thou makest the outgoings of the morning,</I> before the sun 
 rises, <I>and of the evening,</I> before the sun sets, <I>to 
 rejoice.</I> As it is God that scatters the light of the morning and 
 draws the curtains of the evening, so he does both in favour to man, 
 and makes both to rejoice, gives occasion to us to rejoice in both; so 
 that how contrary soever light and darkness are to each other, and how 
 inviolable soever the partition between them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:4">Gen. i. 4</A>),

 both are equally welcome to the world in their season. It is hard to
 say which is more welcome to us, the light of the morning, which 
 befriends the business of the day, or the shadows of the evening, which 
 befriend the repose of the night. Does the watchman wait for the
 morning? So does the hireling earnestly desire the shadow. Some 
 understand it of the morning and evening sacrifice, which good people 
 greatly rejoiced in and in which God was constantly honoured. Thou 
 makest them to <I>sing</I> (so the word is); for every morning and 
 every evening songs of praise were sung by the Levites; it was that 
 which the duty of every day required. We are to look upon our daily 
 worship, alone and with our families, to be both the most needful of 
 our daily occupations and the most delightful of our daily comforts; 
 and, if therein we keep up our communion with God, the outgoings both 
 of the morning and of the evening are thereby made truly to 
 rejoice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He waters the earth and makes it fruitful. On this instance of 
 God's power and goodness he enlarges very much, the psalm being 
 probably penned upon occasion either of a more than ordinarily 
 plentiful harvest or of a seasonable rain after long drought. How much 
 the fruitfulness of this lower part of the creation depends upon the 
 influence of the upper is easy to observe; if the heavens be as brass, 
 the earth is as iron, which is a sensible intimation to a stupid world 
 that every good and perfect gift is from above, <I>omnia desuper--all
 from above;</I> we must lift up our eyes above the hills, lift them up 
 to the heavens, where the original springs of all blessings are, out of 
 sight, and thither must our praises return, as the first-fruits of the 
 earth were in the heave-offerings lifted up towards heaven by way of 
 acknowledgment that thence they were derived. All God's blessings, even 
 spiritual ones, are expressed by his raining righteousness upon us. Now 
 observe how the common blessing of rain from heaven and fruitful 
 seasons is here described.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How much there is in it of the power and goodness of God, which is 
 here set forth by a great variety of lively expressions. 

 (1.) God that made the earth hereby visits it, sends to it, gives proof 
 of his care of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 It is a visit in mercy, which the inhabitants of the earth ought to 
 return in praises.

 (2.) God, that made it dry land, hereby waters it, in order to its 
 fruitfulness. Though the productions of the earth flourished before God 
 had caused it to rain, yet even then there was a mist which answered 
 the intention, and <I>watered the whole face of the ground,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:5,6">Gen. ii. 5, 6</A>.

 Our hearts are dry and barren unless God himself be as the dew to us
 and water us; and the plants of his own planting he will water and make 
 them to increase.

 (3.) Rain is <I>the river of God, which is full of water;</I> the 
 clouds are the springs of this river, which do not flow at random, but 
 in the channel which God cuts out for it. The showers of rain, as the 
 rivers of water, he turns which way soever he pleases.

 (4.) This river of God enriches the earth, which without it would 
 quickly be a poor thing. The riches of the earth, which are produced 
 out of its surface, are abundantly more useful and serviceable to man 
 than those which are hidden in its bowels; we might live well enough 
 without silver and gold, but not without corn and grass.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How much benefit is derived from it to the earth and to man upon it. 
 
 (1.) To the earth itself. The rain in season gives it a new face; 
 nothing is more reviving, more refreshing, than the <I>rain upon the 
 new-mown grass,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:6">Ps. lxxii. 6</A>.

 Even <I>the ridges</I> of the earth, off which the rain seems to slide,
 are watered <I>abundantly,</I> for they drink in the rain which comes 
 often upon them; <I>the furrows</I> of it, which are turned up by the 
 plough, in order to the seedness, are settled by the rain and made fit 
 to receive the seed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 they are settled by being made soft. That which makes the soil of the
 heart tender settles it; for the heart is established with that grace. 
 Thus the springing of the year is blessed; and if the spring, that 
 first quarter of the year, be blessed, that is an earnest of a blessing 
 upon the whole year, which God is therefore said to <I>crown with his 
 goodness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 to compass it on every side as the head is compassed with a crown, and
 to complete the comforts of it as the end of a thing is said to crown 
 it. And his paths are said to <I>drop fatness;</I> for whatever fatness 
 there is in the earth, which impregnates its productions, it comes from 
 the out-goings of the divine goodness. Wherever God goes he leaves the 
 tokens of his mercy behind him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:13,14">Joel ii. 13, 14</A>)

 and makes his path thus to shine after him. These communications of
 God's goodness to this lower world are very extensive and diffusive

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness,</I> and not merely
 upon the pastures of the inhabited land. The deserts, which man takes
 no care of and receives no profit from, are under the care of the 
 divine Providence, and the profits of them redound to the glory of God, 
 as the great benefactor of the whole creation, though not immediately 
 to the benefit of man; and we ought to be thankful not only for that 
 which serves us, but for that which serves any part of the creation, 
 because thereby it turns to the honour of the Creator. The wilderness, 
 which makes not such returns as the cultivated grounds do, receives as 
 much of the rain of heaven as the most fruitful soil; for God does good 
 to the evil and unthankful. So extensive are the gifts of God's bounty 
 that in them the hills, <I>the little hills, rejoice on every side,</I> 
 even the north side, that lies most from the sun. Hills are not above 
 the need of God's providence; little hills are not below the cognizance 
 of it. But as, when he pleases, he can make them tremble

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:6">Ps. cxiv. 6</A>),

 so when he pleases he can make them rejoice. 

 (2.) To man upon the earth. God, by providing rain for the earth, 
 prepares corn for man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 <I>As for the earth, out of it comes bread</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:5">Job xxviii. 5</A>),

 for out of it comes corn; but every grain of corn that comes out of it
 God himself prepared; and therefore he provides rain for the earth, 
 that thereby he may prepare corn for man, under whose feet he has put 
 the rest of the creatures and for whose use he has fitted them. When we 
 consider that the yearly produce of the corn is not only an operation 
 of the same power that raises the dead, but an instance of that power 
 not much unlike it (as appears by that of our Saviour,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:24">John xii. 24</A>),

 and that the constant benefit we have from it is an instance of that
 goodness which endures for ever, we shall have reason to think that it 
 is no less than a God that prepares corn for us. Corn and cattle are 
 the two staple commodities with which the husbandman, who deals 
 immediately in the fruits of the earth, is enriched; and both are owing 
 to the divine goodness in watering the earth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 To this it is owing that the pastures are clothed with flocks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 So well stocked are the pastures that they seem to be covered over with 
 the cattle that are laid in them, and yet the pasture not overcharged; 
 so well fed are the cattle that they are the ornament and the glory of 
 the pastures in which they are fed. The valleys are so fruitful that 
 they seem to be <I>covered over with corn,</I> in the time of harvest. 
 The lowest parts of the earth are commonly the most fruitful, and one 
 acre of the humble valleys is worth five of the lofty mountains. But 
 both corn-ground and pasture-ground, answering the end of their 
 creation, are said to <I>shout for joy and sing,</I> because they are
 serviceable to the honour of God and the comfort of man, and because 
 they furnish us with matter for joy and praise: as there is no earthly 
 joy above the joy of harvest, so there was none of the feasts of the 
 Lord, among the Jews, solemnized with greater expressions of 
 thankfulness than the <I>feast of in-gathering at the end of the 
 year,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:16">Exod. xxiii. 16</A>.

 Let all these common gifts of the divine bounty, which we yearly and
 daily partake of, increase our love to God as the best of beings, and 
 engage us to glorify him with our bodies, which he thus provides so 
 well for.</P>
