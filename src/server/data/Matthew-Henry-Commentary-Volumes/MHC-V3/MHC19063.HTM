 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm has in it as much of warmth and lively devotion as any of 
 David's psalms in so little a compass. As the sweetest of Paul's 
 epistles were those that bore date out of a prison, so some of the 
 sweetest of David's psalms were those that were penned, as this was, in 
 a wilderness. That which grieved him most in his banishment was the 
 want of public ordinances; these he here longs to be restored to the 
 enjoyment of; and the present want did but whet his appetite. Yet it is 
 not the ordinances, but the God of the ordinances, that his heart is 
 upon. And here we have, 
 
 I. His desire towards God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. His esteem of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III. His satisfaction in God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:5">ver. 5</A>.

 IV. His secret communion with God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:6">ver. 6</A>.

 V. His joyful dependence upon God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:7-8">ver.  7, 8</A>.

 IV. His holy triumph in God over his enemies and in the assurance of
 his own safety, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:9-11">
 ver. 9-11</A>.

 A devout and pious soul has little need of direction how to sing this 
 psalm, so naturally does it speak its own genuine language; and an 
 unsanctified soul, that is unacquainted and unaffected with divine 
 things, is scarcely capable of singing it with understanding.</P>

 <P>A psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O God, thou <I>art</I> my God; early will I seek thee: my soul
 thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
 thirsty land, where no water is;
 &nbsp; 2  To see thy power and thy glory, so <I>as</I> I have seen thee in
 the sanctuary.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The title tells us when the psalm was penned, when David was <I>in the 
 wilderness of Judah;</I> that is, <I>in the forest of Hareth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+22:5">1 Sam. xxii. 5</A>)

 or in <I>the wilderness of Ziph,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:15">1 Sam. xxiii. 15</A>.

 1. Even in Canaan, though a fruitful land and the people numerous, yet
 there were wildernesses, places less fruitful and less inhabited than 
 other places. It will be so in the world, in the church, but not in 
 heaven; there it is all city, all paradise, and no desert ground; 
 <I>the wilderness</I> there <I>shall blossom as the rose.</I> 

 2. The best and dearest of God's saints and servants may sometimes have 
 their lot cast in a wilderness, which speaks them lonely and solitary, 
 desolate and afflicted, wanting, wandering, and unsettled, and quite at 
 a loss what to do with themselves. 

 3. All the straits and difficulties of a wilderness must not put us out
 of tune for sacred songs; but even then it is our duty and interest to 
 keep up a cheerful communion with God.  There are psalms proper for a 
 wilderness, and we have reason to thank God that it is the wilderness 
 of Judah we are in, not the wilderness of Sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, in these verses, <I>stirs up himself to take hold on 
 God,</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By a lively active faith: <I>O God! thou art my God.</I> Note, In 
 all our addresses to God we must eye him as God, and our God, and this 
 will be our comfort in a wilderness-state. We must acknowledge that God 
 is, that we speak to one that really exists and is present with us, 
 when we say, <I>O God!</I> which is a serious word; pity it should ever 
 be used as a by-word. And we must own his authority over us and 
 propriety in us, and our relation to him: "<I>Thou art my God,</I> mine 
 by creation and therefore my rightful owner and ruler, mine by covenant 
 and my own consent." We must speak it with the greatest pleasure to 
 ourselves, and thankfulness to God, as those that are resolved to abide 
 by it: <I>O God! thou art my God.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. By pious and devout affections, pursuant to the choice he had made 
 of God and the covenant he had made with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He resolves to seek God, and his favour and grace: <I>Thou art my 
 God,</I> and therefore <I>I will seek thee;</I> for <I>should not a 
 people seek unto their God?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:19">Isa. viii. 19</A>.

 We must seek him; we must covet his favour as our chief good and
 consult his glory as our highest end; we must seek acquaintance with him 
 by his word and seek mercy from him by prayer. We must seek him, 

 (1.) Early, with the utmost care, as those that are afraid of missing 
 him; we must begin our days with him, begin every day with him: 
 <I>Early will I seek thee.</I> 

 (2.) Earnestly: "<I>My soul thirsteth for thee</I> and <I>my flesh 
 longeth for thee</I> (that is, my whole man is affected with this 
 pursuit) here <I>in a dry and thirsty land.</I>" Observe, 

 [1.] His complaint in the want of God's favourable presence.  He was in 
 a dry and thirsty land; so he reckoned it, not so much because it was a 
 wilderness as because it was at a distance from the ark, from the word 
 and sacraments. This world is a <I>weary land</I> (so the word is); it 
 is so to the worldly that have their portion in it--it will yield them 
 no true satisfaction; it is so to the godly that have their passage 
 through it--it is a valley of Baca; they can promise themselves little 
 from it. 

 [2.] His importunity for that presence of God: <I>My soul thirsteth, 
 longeth, for thee.</I> His want quickened his desires, which were very 
 intense; he thirsted as the hunted hart for the water-brooks; he would 
 take up with nothing short of it. His desires were almost impatient; he 
 longed, he languished, till he should be restored to the liberty of 
 God's ordinances. Note, Gracious souls look down upon the world with a 
 holy disdain and look up to God with a holy desire.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He longs to enjoy God. What is it that he does so passionately wish 
 for? What is his petition and what is his request? It is this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),
 
 <I>To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
 sanctuary.</I> That is, 

 (1.) "To see it here in this wilderness as I have seen it in the 
 tabernacle, to see it in secret as I have seen it in the solemn 
 assembly." Note, When we are deprived of the benefit of public 
 ordinances we should desire and endeavour to keep up the same communion 
 with God in our retirements that we have had in the great congregation. 
 A closet may be turned into a little sanctuary. Ezekiel had the visions 
 of the Almighty in Babylon, and John in the isle of Patmos. When we are 
 alone we may have the Father with us, and that is enough. 

 (2.) "To see it again in the sanctuary as I have formerly seen it 
 there." He longs to be brought out of the wilderness, not that he might 
 see his friends again and be restored to the pleasures and gaieties of 
 the court, but that he might have access to the sanctuary, not to see 
 the priests there, and the ceremony of the worship, but <I>to see thy 
 power and glory</I> (that is, thy glorious power, or thy powerful 
 glory, which is put for all God's attributes and perfections), "that I 
 may increase in my acquaintance with them and have the agreeable 
 impressions of them made upon my heart"--so to <I>behold the glory of
 the Lord</I> as to <I>be changed into the same image,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:18">2 Cor. iii. 18</A>.

 "That I may see thy power and glory," he does not say, as I have seen
 them, but "as I have seen <I>thee.</I>" We cannot see the essence of 
 God, but we see him in seeing by faith his attributes and perfections. 
 These sights David here pleases himself with the remembrance of. Those 
 were precious minutes which he spent in communion with God; he loved to 
 think them over again; these he lamented the loss of, and longed to be 
 restored to. Note, That which has been the delight and is the desire of 
 gracious souls, in their attendance on solemn ordinances, is to see God 
 and his power and glory in them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  Because thy lovingkindness <I>is</I> better than life, my lips
 shall praise thee.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 How soon are David's complaints and prayers turned into praises and 
 thanksgivings! After 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:1,2">two verses</A>

 that express his desire in seeking God, here are some that express his
 joy and satisfaction in having found him. Faithful prayers may quickly 
 be turned into joyful praises, if it be not our own fault. <I>Let the 
 hearts of those rejoice that seek the Lord</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:3">Ps. cv. 3</A>),

 and let them praise him for working those desires in them, and giving
 them assurance that he will satisfy them. David was now in a 
 wilderness, and yet had his heart much enlarged in blessing God. Even 
 in affliction we need not want matter for praise, if we have but a 
 heart to it.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What David will praise God for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Because thy lovingkindness is better than life,</I> than
 <I>lives,</I> life and all the comforts of life, life in its best 
 estate, long life and prosperity. God's lovingkindness is in itself, 
 and in the account of all the saints, better than life. It is our 
 spiritual life, and that is better than temporal life,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:5">Ps. xxx. 5</A>.

 It is better, a thousand times, to die in God's favour than to live
 under his wrath. David in the wilderness finds, by comfortable 
 experience, that God's lovingkindness is better than life; and 
 <I>therefore</I> (says he) <I>my lips shall praise thee.</I> Note, 
 Those that have their hearts refreshed with the tokens of God's favour 
 ought to have them enlarged in his praises. A great deal of reason we 
 have to bless God that we have better provisions and better possessions 
 than the wealth of this world can afford us, and that in the service of 
 God, and in communion with him, we have better employments and better 
 enjoyments than we can have in the business and converse of this 
 world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he will praise God, and how long, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 He resolves to live a life of thankfulness to God and dependence on 
 him. Observe,

 1. His manner of blessing God: "<I>Thus will I bless thee,</I> thus as
 I have now begun; the present devout affections shall not pass away, 
 like the morning cloud, but shine more and more, like the morning sun." 
 Or, "I will bless thee with the same earnestness and fervency with 
 which I have prayed to thee." 

 2. His continuance and perseverance therein: <I>I will bless thee while 
 I live.</I> Note, Praising God must be the work of our whole lives; we 
 must always retain a grateful sense of his former favours and repeat 
 our thanksgivings for them. We must every day give thanks to him for 
 the benefits with which we are daily loaded. We must in every thing 
 give thanks, and not be put out of frame for this duty by any of the 
 afflictions of this present time. Whatever days we live to see, how 
 dark and cloudy soever, though the days come of which we say, <I>We 
 have no pleasure in them,</I> yet still every day must be a 
 thanksgiving-day, even to our dying-day. In this work we must spend our 
 time because in this work we hope to spend a blessed eternity. 

 3.  His constant regard to God upon all occasions, which should
 accompany his praises of him: <I>I will lift up my hands in thy 
 name.</I> We must have an eye to God's name (to all that by which he 
 has made himself known) in all our prayers and praises, which we are 
 taught to begin with,--<I>Hallowed be thy name,</I> and to conclude 
 with,--<I>Thine is the glory.</I> This we must have an eye to in our 
 work and warfare; we must lift up our hands to our duty and against our 
 special enemies in God's name, that is, in the strength of his Spirit 
 and grace,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:16,Zec+10:12">Ps. lxxi. 16; Zech. x. 12</A>.

 We must make all our vows in God's name; to him we must engage
 ourselves and in a dependence upon his grace. And when we lift up the 
 hands that hang down, in comfort and joy, it must be in God's name; 
 from him our comforts must be fetched, and to him they must be devoted. 
 <I>In thee do we boast all the day long.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. With what pleasure and delight he would praise God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 1. With inward complacency: <I>My soul shall be satisfied as with
 marrow and fatness,</I> not only as with bread, which is nourishing, 
 but as with marrow, which is pleasant and delicious,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+25:6">Isa. xxv. 6</A>.

 David hopes he shall return again to the enjoyment of God's ordinances,
 and then he shall thus be satisfied, and the more for his having been 
 for a time under restraint. Or, if not, yet in God's loving kindness, 
 and in conversing with him in solitude, he shall be thus satisfied. 
 Note, There is that in a gracious God, and in communion with him, which 
 gives abundant satisfaction to a gracious soul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:8,65:4">Ps. xxxvi. 8; lxv. 4</A>.

 And there is that in a gracious soul which takes abundant satisfaction
 in God and communion with him. The saints have a contentment with God; 
 they desire no more than his favour to make them happy: and they have a 
 transcendent complacency in God, in comparison with which all the 
 delights of sense are sapless and without relish, as puddle-water in 
 comparison with the wine of this consolation. 

 2. With outward expressions of this satisfaction; he will praise God 
 <I>with joyful lips.</I> He will praise him,

 (1.) Openly. His mouth and lips shall praise God. When with the heart 
 man believes and is thankful, with the mouth confession must be made of 
 both, to the glory of God; not that the performances of the mouth are 
 accepted without the heart

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+15:8">Matt. xv. 8</A>),

 but out of the abundance of the heart the mouth must speak 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:1">Ps. xlv. 1</A>),

 both for the exciting of our own devout affections and for the 
 edification of others. 

 (2.) Cheerfully. We must praise God with joyful lips; we must address 
 ourselves to that and other duties of religion with great cheerfulness, 
 and speak forth the praises of God from a principle of holy joy. 
 Praising lips must be joyful lips.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How he would entertain himself with thoughts of God when he was 
 most retired 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 I will praise thee <I>when I remember thee upon my bed.</I> We must
 praise God upon every remembrance of him. Now that David was shut out 
 from public ordinances he abounded the more in secret communion with 
 God, and so did something towards making up his loss. Observe here,

 1. How David employed himself in thinking of God.  God was in all his
 thoughts, which is the reverse of the wicked man's character,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:4">Ps. x. 4</A>.

 The thoughts of God were ready to him: "<I>I remember thee;</I> that
 is, when I go to think, I find thee at my right hand, present to my 
 mind." This subject should first offer itself, as that which we cannot 
 forget or overlook. And they were fixed in him: "<I>I meditate on 
 thee.</I>" Thoughts of God must not be transient thoughts, passing 
 through the mind, but abiding thoughts, dwelling in the mind. 

 2. When David employed himself thus--<I>upon his bed</I> and in the 
 night-watches. David was now wandering and unsettled, but, wherever he 
 came, he brought his religion along with him. Upon my <I>beds</I> (so 
 some); being hunted by Saul, he seldom lay two nights together in the 
 same bed; but wherever he lay, if, as Jacob, upon the cold ground and 
 with a stone for his pillow, good thoughts of God lay down with him.  
 David was so full of business all day, shifting for his own safety, 
 that he had scarcely leisure to apply himself solemnly to religious 
 exercises, and therefore, rather than want time for them, he denied 
 himself his necessary sleep. He was now in continual peril of his life, 
 so that we may suppose care and fear many a time held his eyes waking 
 and gave him wearisome nights; but then he entertained and comforted 
 himself with thoughts of God. Sometimes we find David in tears upon his 
 bed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+6:6">Ps. vi. 6</A>),

 but thus he wiped away his tears. When sleep departs from our eyes
 (through pain, or sickness of body, or any disturbance in the mind) our 
 souls, by remembering God, may be at ease, and repose themselves.  
 Perhaps an hour's pious meditation will do us more good than an hour's 
 sleep would have done. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:7,17:3,Ps+4:4,119:62">Ps. xvi. 7; 
 xvii. 3; iv. 4; cxix. 62</A>.

 There were night-watches kept in the tabernacle for praising God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+134:1">Ps. cxxxiv. 1</A>),

 in which, probably, David, when he had liberty, joined with the
 Levites; and now that he could not keep place with them he kept time 
 with them, and wished himself among them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, having expressed his desires towards God and his praises of him, 
 here expresses his confidence in him and his joyful expectations from 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>In the shadow of thy wings I will rejoice,</I> alluding either to
 the wings of the cherubim stretched out over the ark of the covenant, 
 between which God is said to dwell ("I will rejoice in thy oracles, and 
 in covenant and communion with thee"), or to the wings of a fowl,
 under which the helpless young ones have shelter, as the eagle's young 
 ones

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:4,De+32:11">Exod. xix. 4, Deut. xxxii. 11</A>),

 which speaks the divine power, and the young ones of the common hen

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:37">Matt. xxiii. 37</A>),

 which speaks more of divine tenderness. It is a phrase often used in
 the psalms 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:8,36:7,57:1,61:4,91:4">Ps.  xvii. 8; 
 xxxvi. 7; lvii. 1; lxi. 4; xci. 4</A>),

 and no where else in this sense, except 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+2:12">Ruth ii. 12</A>,

 where Ruth, when she became a proselyte, is said to <I>trust under the
 wings of the God of Israel.</I> It is our duty to <I>rejoice in the 
 shadow of God's wings,</I> which denotes our recourse to him by faith 
 and prayer, as naturally as the chickens, when they are cold or 
 frightened, run by instinct under the wings of the hen. It intimates 
 also our reliance upon him as able and ready to help us and our 
 refreshment and satisfaction in his care and protection.  Having 
 committed ourselves to God, we must be easy and pleased, and quiet from 
 the fear of evil. Now let us see further,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What were the supports and encouragements of David's confidence in 
 God. Two things were as props to that hope which the word of God was 
 the only foundation of:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His former experiences of God's power in relieving him: "<I>Because 
 thou hast been my help</I> when other helps and helpers failed me, 
 therefore I will still rejoice in thy salvation, will trust in thee for 
 the future, and will do it with delight and holy joy. Thou hast been 
 not only my helper, but my help;" for we could never have helped 
 ourselves, nor could any creature have been helpful to us, but by him. 
 Here we may set up our Ebenezer, saying, <I>Hitherto the Lord has 
 helped us,</I> and must therefore resolve that we will never desert 
 him, never distrust him, nor ever droop in our walking with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The present sense he had of God's grace carrying him on in these 
 pursuits 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>My soul follows hard after thee,</I> which speaks a very earnest
 desire and a serious vigorous endeavour to keep up communion with God; 
 if we cannot always have God in our embraces, yet we must always have 
 him in our eye, reaching forth towards him as our prize, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:14">Phil. iii. 14</A>.

 To press hard after God is to follow him closely, as those that are
 afraid of losing the sight of him, and to follow him swiftly, as those 
 that long to be with him. This David did, and he owns, to the glory of 
 God, <I>Thy right hand upholds me.</I> God upheld him,

 (1.) Under his afflictions, that he might not sink under them.  
 <I>Underneath are the everlasting arms.</I> 

 (2.) In his devotions. God upheld him in his holy desires and pursuits, 
 that he might not grow weary in well-doing. Those that follow hard 
 after God would soon fail and faint if God's right hand did not uphold 
 them. It is he that strengthens us in the pursuit of him, quickens our 
 good affections, and comforts us while we have not yet attained what we 
 are in the pursuit of. It is by the power of God (that is his right 
 hand) that we are kept from falling. Now this was a great encouragement 
 to the psalmist to hope that he would, in due time, give him that which 
 he so earnestly desired, because he had by his grace wrought in him 
 those desires and kept them up.</P>

 II. What it was that David triumphed in the hopes of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That his enemies should be ruined, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 There were those that <I>sought his soul to destroy it,</I> not only 
 his life (which they struck at, both to prevent his coming to the crown 
 and because they envied and hated him for his wisdom, piety, and 
 usefulness), but his soul, which they sought to destroy by banishing 
 him from God's ordinances, which are the nourishment and support of the 
 soul (so doing what they could to starve it), and by sending him to 
 serve other gods, so doing what they could to poison it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+26:19">1 Sam. xxvi. 19</A>.

 But he foresees and foretels, 

 (1.) That they shall <I>go into the lower parts of the earth,</I> to 
 the grave, to hell; their enmity to David would be their death and 
 their damnation, their ruin, their eternal ruin. 

 (2.) That they shall fall by the sword, by the sword of God's wrath and 
 his justice, by the sword of man,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:28,29">Job xix. 28, 29</A>.

 They shall die a violent death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:10">Rev. xiii. 10</A>.

 This was fulfilled in Saul, who fell by the sword, his own sword; David 
 foretold this, yet he would not execute it when it was in the power of 
 his hand, once and again; for precepts, not prophecies, are our rule. 
 
 (3.) That <I>they shall be a portion for foxes;</I> either their dead
 bodies shall be a prey to ravenous beasts (Saul lay a good while 
 unburied) or their houses and estates shall be a habitation for wild 
 beasts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:14">Isa. xxxiv. 14</A>.

 Such as this will be the doom of Christ's enemies, that oppose his
 kingdom and interest in the world; <I>Bring them forth and slay them 
 before me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:27">Luke  xix. 27</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he himself should gain his point at last 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 that he should be advanced to the throne to which he had been anointed:
 <I>The king shall rejoice in God.</I>

 (1.) He calls himself <I>the king,</I> because he knew himself to be so 
 in the divine purpose and designation; thus Paul, while yet in the 
 conflict, writes himself <I>more than a conqueror,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:37">Rom. viii. 37</A>.
 
 Believers are made kings, though they are not to have the dominion till
 the morning of the resurrection. 

 (2.) He doubts not but that though he was now sowing in tears he should 
 reap in joy. <I>The king shall rejoice.</I> 

 (3.) He resolves to make God the Alpha and Omega of all his joys. He 
 shall <I>rejoice in God.</I> Now this is applicable to the glories and 
 joys of the exalted Redeemer.  Messiah the Prince shall rejoice in God; 
 he has already entered into the joy set before him, and his glory will 
 be completed at his second coming. Two things would be the good effect 
 of David's advancement:--

 [1.] It would be the consolation of his friends. <I>Every one that 
 swears to him</I> (that is, to David), that comes into his interest and 
 takes an oath of allegiance to him, <I>shall glory</I> in his success; 
 or <I>every one that swears by him</I> (that is, by the blessed name of 
 God, and not by any idol,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:13">Deut. vi. 13</A>),

 and then it means all good people, that make a sincere and open
 profession of God's name; they shall glory in God; they shall glory in 
 David's advancement.  <I>Those that fear thee will be glad when they 
 see me.</I> Those that heartily espouse the cause of Christ shall glory 
 in its victory at last. <I>If we suffer with him, we shall reign with 
 him.</I> 

 [2.] It would be the confutation of his enemies: <I>The mouth of those 
 that speak lies,</I> of Saul, and Doeg, and others that misrepresented 
 David and insulted over him, as if his cause was desperate, <I>shall 
 be</I> quite <I>stopped;</I> they shall not have one word more to say 
 against him, but will be for ever silenced and shamed. Apply this to 
 Christ's enemies, to those that speak lies to him, as all hypocrites 
 do, that tell him they love him while their hearts are not with him; 
 their mouth shall be stopped with that word, <I>I know you not whence 
 you are;</I> they shall be for ever speechless,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+22:12">Matt. xxii. 12</A>.

 The mouths of those also that speak lies against him, that <I>pervert
 the right ways of the Lord</I> and speak ill of his holy religion, will 
 be stopped in that day when the Lord shall come to reckon for all the 
 hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. Christ's 
 second coming will be the everlasting triumph of all his faithful 
 friends and followers, who may therefore now triumph in the believing 
 hopes of it.</P>
