 In this chapter, 

 I. Christ speaks both concerning himself and concerning his church, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The church speaks,

 1. Remembering the pleasure and satisfaction she has in communion with
 Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 2. Entertaining herself with the present tokens of his favour and
 taking care that nothing happen to intercept them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 3. Triumphing in his approaches towards her,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>.

 4. Repeating the gracious calls he had given her to go along with him a
 walking, invited by the pleasures of the returning spring 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:10-13">ver. 10-13</A>),

 out of her obscurity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:14">ver. 14</A>),

 and the charge he had given to the servants to destroy that which would
 be hurtful to his vineyard,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:15">ver. 15</A>.

 5. Rejoicing in her interest in him,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:16">ver. 16</A>.

 6. Longing for his arrival, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:17">ver. 17</A>.

 Those whose hearts are filled with love to Christ, and hope of heaven,
 know best what these things mean.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I <I>am</I> the rose of Sharon, <I>and</I> the lily of the valleys.

 daughters.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 I. What Christ is pleased to compare himself to; and he condescends 
 very much in the comparison. He that is the Son of the Highest, the 
 bright and morning star, calls and owns himself <I>the rose of Sharon, 
 and the lily of the valleys,</I> to express his presence with his 
 people in this world, the easiness of their access to him, and the 
 beauty and sweetness which they find in him, and to teach them to adorn 
 themselves with him, as shepherds and shepherdesses, when they appeared 
 gay, were decked with roses and lilies, garlands and chaplets of 
 flowers. <I>The rose,</I> for beauty and fragrance, is the chief of 
 flowers, and our Saviour prefers the clothing of <I>the lily</I> before 
 that of <I>Solomon in all his glory.</I> Christ is <I>the rose of 
 Sharon,</I> where probably the best roses grew and in most plenty, 
 <I>the rose of the field</I> (so some), denoting that the gospel 
 salvation is a common salvation; it lies open to all; whoever will may 
 come and gather the rose-buds of privileges and comforts that grow in 
 the covenant of grace. He is not a rose locked up in a garden, but all 
 may come and receive benefit by him and comfort in him. He is a 
 <I>lily</I> for whiteness, a <I>lily of the valleys</I> for sweetness, 
 for those which we call so yield a strong perfume. He is a <I>lily of 
 the valleys,</I> or <I>low places,</I> in his humiliation, exposed to 
 injury. Humble souls see most beauty in him. Whatever he is to others, 
 to those that are in the <I>valleys</I> he is a <I>lily.</I> He is the 
 <I>rose, the lily;</I> there is none besides. Whatever excellence is in 
 Christ, it is in him singularly and in the highest degree.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What he is pleased to compare his church to, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 1. She is <I>as a lily;</I> he himself is <I>the lily</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 she is <I>as the lily.</I> The beauty of believers consists in their 
 conformity and resemblance to Jesus Christ. They are his love, and so 
 they are as lilies, for those are made like Christ in whose hearts his 
 <I>love is shed abroad.</I>

 2. <I>As a lily among thorns, as a lily</I> compared with 
 <I>thorns.</I> The church of Christ as far excels all other societies 
 as a bed of roses excels a bush of thorns. <I>As a lily</I> compassed 
 with <I>thorns.</I> The wicked, the <I>daughters</I> of this world, 
 such as have no love to Christ, are as <I>thorns,</I> worthless and 
 useless, good for nothing but to stop a gap; nay, they are noxious and 
 hurtful; they came in with sin and are a fruit of the curse; they choke 
 good seed, and hinder good fruit, and their <I>end is to be burned.</I> 
 God's people are <I>as lilies among</I> them, scratched and torn, 
 shaded and obscured, by them; they are dear to Christ, and yet exposed 
 to hardships and troubles in the world; they must expect it, for they 
 are planted <I>among thorns</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+2:6">Ezek. ii. 6</A>),

 but they are nevertheless dear to him; he does not overlook nor
 undervalue any of his lilies for their being <I>among thorns,</I> When 
 they are <I>among thorns</I> they must still be <I>as lilies,</I> must 
 maintain their innocency and purity, and, though they are <I>among 
 thorns,</I> must not be turned into <I>thorns,</I> must <I>not render 
 railing for railing,</I> and, if they thus preserve their character, 
 they shall be still owned as conformable to Christ. Grace in the soul 
 is a <I>lily among thorns;</I> corruptions are <I>thorns in the 
 flesh</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:7">2 Cor. xii. 7</A>),

 are as Canaanites to God's Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+23:13">Josh. xxiii. 13</A>);

 but <I>the lily</I> that is now <I>among thorns</I> shall shortly be
 transplanted out of this wilderness into that paradise where there is
 no <I>pricking brier</I> nor <I>grieving thorn,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so <I>is</I> my
 beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great
 delight, and his fruit <I>was</I> sweet to my taste.
 &nbsp; 4  He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me
 <I>was</I> love.
 &nbsp; 5  Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I <I>am</I> sick
 of love.
 &nbsp; 6  His left hand <I>is</I> under my head, and his right hand doth
 embrace me.
 &nbsp; 7  I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and
 by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake <I>my</I>
 love, till he please.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The spouse commends her beloved and prefers him before all others: 
 <I>As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood,</I> which perhaps 
 does not grow so high, nor spread so wide, as some other trees, yet is 
 useful and serviceable to man, yielding pleasant and profitable fruit, 
 while the other trees are of little use, no, not the cedars themselves, 
 till they are cut down, <I>so is my beloved among the sons,</I> so far 
 does he excel them all,--all <I>the sons</I> of God, the angels (that 
 honour was put upon him which was never designed for them, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:4">Heb. i. 4</A>),

 --all <I>the sons</I> of men; he is <I>fairer</I> than them all, fairer
 than the choicest of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:2">Ps. xlv. 2</A>.

 Name what creature you will, and you will find Christ has the
 pre-eminence above them all. The world is a barren tree to a soul; 
 Christ is a fruitful one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. She remembers the abundant comfort she has had in communion with
 him: She <I>sat down</I> by him <I>with great delight,</I> as shepherds 
 sometimes repose themselves, sometimes converse with one another, under 
 a tree. A double advantage she found in sitting down so near the Lord 
 Jesus:--

 1. A refreshing shade: <I>I sat down under his shadow,</I> to be
 sheltered by him from the scorching heat of the sun, to be cooled, and 
 so to take some rest. Christ is to believers <I>as the shadow</I> of a 
 great tree, nay, <I>of a great rock in a weary land,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:2,Isa+25:4">Isa. xxxii. 2; xxv. 4</A>.

 When a poor soul is parched with convictions of sin and the terrors of
 the law, as David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+32:4">Ps. xxxii. 4</A>),

 when fatigued with the troubles of this world, as Elijah when he <I>sat
 down under a juniper tree</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:4">1 Kings xix. 4</A>),

 they find that in Christ, in his name, his graces, his comforts, and
 his undertaking for poor sinners, which revives them and keeps them 
 from fainting; those that <I>are weary and heavily laden</I> may find 
 <I>rest</I> in Christ. It is not enough to pass by this <I>shadow,</I>
 but we must <I>sit down under</I> it (<I>here will I dwell, for I have 
 desired it</I>); and we shall find it not like Jonah's gourd, that soon 
 withered, and left him in a heat, both inward and outward, but like the 
 tree of life, the leaves whereof were not only for shelter, but for the 
 healing of the nations. We must <I>sit down under this shadow with 
 delight,</I> must put an entire confidence in the protection of it (as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+9:15">Judges ix. 15</A>),

 and take an entire complacency in the refreshment of it. But that is
 not all:

 2. Here is pleasing nourishing food. This tree drops its fruits to 
 those that <I>sit down under its shadow,</I> and they are welcome to 
 them, and will find them <I>sweet unto their taste,</I> whatever they 
 are to others. Believers have tasted that the Lord Jesus is 
 <I>gracious</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:3">1 Pet. ii. 3</A>);

 his <I>fruits</I> are all the precious privileges of the new covenant,
 purchased by his blood and communicated by his Spirit. Promises are
 sweet to a believer, yea, and precepts too. <I>I delight in the law of 
 God after the inward man.</I> Pardons are sweet, and peace of 
 conscience is sweet, assurances of God's love, joys of the Holy Ghost, 
 the hopes of eternal life, and the present earnests and foretastes of 
 it are sweet, all sweet to those that have their spiritual senses 
 exercised. If our mouths be put out of taste for the pleasure of sin, 
 divine consolations will be <I>sweet to our taste, sweeter than honey 
 and the honeycomb.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. She owns herself obliged to Jesus Christ for all the benefit and 
 comfort she had in communion with him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>I sat down under</I> the apple-tree, glad to be there, but he 
 admitted me, nay, he pressed me, to a more intimate communion with him: 
 <I>Come in, thou blessed of the Lord, why standest thou without?</I> 
 <I>He brought me to the house</I> of wine, the place where he 
 entertains his special friends, from lower to higher measures and 
 degrees of comfort, from the fruit of the <I>apple tree</I> to the more 
 generous fruit of the vine." <I>To him that</I> values the divine joys 
 he <I>has more shall be given.</I> One of the rabbin by <I>the 
 banqueting-house</I> understands the <I>tabernacle of the congregation, 
 where the interpretation of the law was given;</I> surely we may apply 
 it to Christian assemblies, where the gospel is preached and 
 gospel-ordinances are administered, particularly the Lord's supper, 
 that <I>banquet of wine,</I> especially to the inside of those 
 ordinances, communion with God in them. Observe,

 1. How she was introduced: "<I>He brought me,</I> wrought in me an
 inclination to draw nigh to God, helped me over my discouragements, 
 took me by the hand, guided and led me, and gave me an <I>access</I> 
 with boldness to God as a <I>Father,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:18">Eph. ii. 18</A>.

 We should never have come <I>into the banqueting-house,</I> never have
 been acquainted with spiritual pleasures, if Christ had not brought us, 
 by opening for us a new and living way and opening in us a new and 
 living fountain.

 2. How she was entertained: <I>His banner over me was love; he brought 
 me</I> in with a banner displayed over my head, not as one he triumphed 
 over, but as one he triumphed in, and whom he always caused to triumph 
 with him and in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+2:14">2 Cor. ii. 14</A>.

 The gospel is compared to a <I>banner</I> or <I>ensign</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:12">Isa. xi. 12</A>),

 and that which is represented in the banner, written in it in letters
 of gold, letters of blood, is <I>love, love;</I> and this is the 
 entertainment in <I>the banqueting-house.</I> Christ is the <I>captain 
 of our salvation,</I> and he enlists all his soldiers under the 
 <I>banner of love;</I> in that they centre; to that they must 
 continually have an eye, and be animated by it. <I>The love of 
 Christ</I> must <I>constrain</I> them to fight manfully. When a city 
 was taken the conqueror set up his standard in it. "He has conquered me 
 with his love, overcome me with kindness, and that is the <I>banner 
 over me.</I>" This she speaks of as what she had formerly had 
 experience of, and she remembers it with delight. Eaten bread must not
 be forgotten, but remembered with thankfulness to that God who has fed 
 us with manna in this wilderness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. She professes her strong affection and most passionate love to 
 Jesus Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>I am sick of love,</I> overcome, overpowered, by it. David explains 
 this when he says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:20">Ps. cxix. 20</A>),

 <I>My soul breaks for the longing that it has unto thy judgments,</I>
 and

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:81"><I>v.</I> 81</A>),

 <I>My soul faints for thy salvation,</I> languishing with care to make 
 it sure and fear of coming short of it. The spouse was now absent 
 perhaps from her beloved, waiting for his return, and cannot bear the 
 grief of distance and delay. Oh how much better it is with the soul 
 when it is <I>sick of love</I> to Christ than when it is surfeited with 
 the love of this world! She cries out for cordials: "Oh <I>stay me with 
 flagons,</I> or <I>ointments,</I> or <I>flowers,</I> any thing that is 
 reviving; <I>comfort me with apples,</I> with the fruits of that 
 <I>apple-tree,</I> Christ 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 with the merit and meditation of Christ and the sense of his love to my 
 soul." Note, Those that are <I>sick of love</I> to Christ shall not 
 want spiritual supports, while they are yet waiting for spiritual 
 comforts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. She experiences the power and tenderness of divine grace, relieving 
 her in her present faintings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Though he seemed to have withdrawn, yet he was even then a very present 
 help,

 1. To sustain the love-sick soul, and to keep it from fainting away: 
 "<I>His left hand is under my head,</I> to bear it up, nay, as a pillow 
 to lay it easy." David experienced God's hand upholding him then when 
 <I>his soul was following hard after God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:8">Ps. lxiii. 8</A>),

 and Job in a state of desertion yet found that God <I>put strength</I>
 into him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:6">Job xxiii. 6</A>.

 <I>All his saints are in his hand,</I> which tenderly holds their
 aching heads.

 2. To encourage the love-sick soul to continue waiting till he returns: 
 "For, in the mean time, <I>his right hand embraces me,</I> and thereby 
 gives me an unquestionable assurance of his love." Believers owe all 
 their strength and comfort to the supporting left hand and embracing 
 right hand of the Lord Jesus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Finding her beloved thus nigh unto her she is in great care that 
 her communion with him be not interrupted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>I charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem.</I> Jerusalem, the 
 mother of us all, charges all her daughters, the church charges all her 
 members, the believing soul charges all its powers and faculties, the 
 spouse charges herself and all about her, not to <I>stir up, or awake, 
 her love until he please,</I> now that he is asleep in her arms, as she 
 was borne up in his, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 She gives them this charge <I>by the roes and the hinds of the 
 field,</I> that is, by every thing that is amiable in their eyes, and 
 dear to them, <I>as the loving hind and the pleasant roe.</I> "My love 
 is to me dearer than those can be to you, and will be disturbed, like 
 them, with a very little noise." Note,

 1. Those that experience the sweetness of communion with Christ, and 
 the sensible manifestations of his love, cannot but desire the 
 continuance of these blessed views, these blessed visits. Pester would 
 make tabernacles upon the holy mount, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+17:4">Matt. xvii. 4</A>.

 2. Yet Christ will, when he pleases, withdraw those extraordinary 
 communications of himself, for he is a free-agent, and the Spirit, as 
 <I>the wind, blows where</I> and when <I>it listeth,</I> and in his 
 pleasure it becomes us to acquiesce. But, 

 3. Our care must be that we do nothing to provoke him to withdraw and
 to hide his face, that we carefully watch over our own hearts and 
 suppress every thought that may grieve his good Spirit. Let those that
 have comfort be afraid of sinning it away.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the
 mountains, skipping upon the hills.
 &nbsp; 9  My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth
 behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, showing himself
 through the lattice.
 &nbsp; 10  My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my
 fair one, and come away.
 &nbsp; 11  For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over <I>and</I> gone;
 &nbsp; 12  The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing <I>of
 birds</I> is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The church is here pleasing herself exceedingly with the thoughts of 
 her further communion with Christ after she has recovered from her 
 fainting fit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. She rejoices in his approach, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 1. She hears him speak: "It is <I>the voice of my beloved,</I> calling 
 me to tell me he is coming." Like one of his own sheep, she <I>knows 
 his voice</I> before she sees him, and can easily distinguish it from 
 the <I>voice of a stranger</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+10:4,5">John x. 4, 5</A>),

 and, like a faithful friend of the bridegroom, she <I>rejoices greatly
 because of the bridegroom's voice,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:29">John iii. 29</A>.

 With what an air of triumph and exultation does she cry out, "<I>It is
 the voice of my beloved,</I> it can be the voice of no other, for none 
 besides can speak to the heart and make that burn."

 2. She sees him come, sees the goings of <I>our God, our King,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:24">Ps. xlviii. 24</A>.

 <I>Behold, he comes.</I> This may very well be applied to the prospect
 with the Old-Testament saints had of Christ's coming in the flesh.
 <I>Abraham saw his day</I> at a distance, <I>and was glad.</I> The 
 nearer the time came the clearer discoveries were made of it; and those 
 that waited for the consolation of Israel with an eye of faith saw him 
 come, and triumphed in the sight: <I>Behold, he comes;</I> for they had 
 heard him say

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:7">Ps. xl. 7</A>),

 <I>Lo, I come,</I> to which their faith here affixes its seal:
 <I>Behold, he comes</I> as he has promised.

 (1.) He comes cheerfully and with great alacrity; he comes leaping and
 skipping <I>like a roe</I> and like <I>a young hart</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 as one pleased with his own undertaking, and that had his heart upon it 
 and his delights with the sons of men. When he came to be baptized with 
 the baptism of blood, how was he <I>straitened till it was 
 accomplished!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:50">Luke xii. 50</A>.

 (2.) He comes slighting and surmounting all the difficulties that lay 
 in his way; he comes <I>leaping over the mountains, skipping over the 
 hills</I> (so some read it), making nothing of the discouragements he 
 was to break through; the curse of the law, the death of the cross, 
 must be undergone, all the powers of darkness must be grappled with, 
 but, before the resolutions of his love, these great mountains become 
 plains. Whatever opposition is given at any time to the deliverance of
 God's church, Christ will break through it, will get over it. 

 (3.) He comes speedily, <I>like a roe</I> or <I>a young hart;</I> they 
 thought the time long (every day a year), but really he hastened; as 
 now, so then, <I>surely he comes quickly; he that shall come will come, 
 and will not tarry.</I> When he comes for the deliverance of his people 
 he <I>flies upon a cloud,</I> and never stays beyond his time, which is 
 the best time. We may apply it to particular believers, who find that 
 even when Christ has withdrawn sensible comforts, and seems to forsake, 
 yet it is but for a small moment, and he will soon return with 
 everlasting loving-kindness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. She pleases herself with the glimpses she has of him, and the 
 glances she has of his favour: "He <I>stands behind our wall;</I> I 
 know he is there, for sometimes <I>he looks forth at the window,</I> or 
 <I>looks in</I> at it, and displays <I>himself through the 
 lattice.</I>" Such was the state of the Old-Testament church while it 
 was in expectation of the coming of the Messiah. The ceremonial law is 
 called <I>a wall of partition</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:14">Eph. ii. 14</A>),
 
 <I>a veil</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:13">2 Cor. iii. 13</A>);

 but Christ stood behind that wall. They had him near them; they had him
 with them, though they could not see him clearly. He that was the 
 substance was not far off from the shadows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:17">Col. ii. 17</A>.

 They saw him looking through the windows of the ceremonial institutions
 and smiling through those lattices; in their sacrifices and 
 purifications Christ discovered himself to them, and gave them 
 intimations and earnests of his grace, both to engage and to encourage 
 their longings for his coming. Such is our present state in comparison 
 with what it will be at Christ's second coming. We now <I>see him 
 through a glass darkly</I> (the body is a wall between us and him, 
 through the windows of which we now and then get a sight of him), but 
 not <I>face to face,</I> as we hope to see him shortly. In the
 sacraments Christ is near us, but it is <I>behind the wall</I> of 
 external signs, through <I>those lattices</I> he manifests himself to 
 us; but we shall shortly <I>see him as he is.</I> Some understand this 
 of the state of a believer when he is under a cloud; Christ is out of 
 sight and yet not far off. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+34:14">Job xxxiv. 14</A>,
 
 and compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:8-10">Job xxiii. 8-10</A>.

 She calls the wall that interposed between her and her beloved <I>our
 wall,</I> because it is sin, and nothing else, that separates between 
 us and God, and that is a wall of our own erecting

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:1">Isa. lix. 1</A>);

 behind that he stands, as <I>waiting to be gracious,</I> and ready to
 be reconciled, upon our repentance. Then <I>he looks in at the 
 window,</I> observes the frame of our hearts and the working of our 
 souls; he looks forth at the window, and shows himself in giving them 
 some comfort, that they may continue hoping for his return.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. She repeats the gracious invitation he had given her to come a 
 walking with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:10-13"><I>v.</I> 10-13</A>.

 She remembers what her beloved said to her, for it had made a very 
 pleasing and powerful impression upon her, and the <I>word that 
 quickens us</I> we shall <I>never forget.</I> She relates it for the 
 encouragement of others, telling them what he had said to her soul and 
 <I>done for her soul,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:16">
 Ps. lxvi. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He called her his love and his fair one. Whatever she is to others, 
 to him she is acceptable, and in his eyes she is amiable. Those that 
 take Christ for their beloved, he will own as his; never was any love 
 lost that was bestowed upon Christ. Christ, by expressing his love to
 believers, invites and encourages them to follow him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He called her to <I>rise and come away,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>,
 
 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 The repetition denotes backwardness in her (we have need to be often 
 called to come away with Jesus Christ; <I>precept must be upon precept 
 and line upon line</I>), but it denotes earnestness in him; so much is 
 his heart set upon the welfare of precious souls that he importunes 
 them most pressingly to that which is for their own good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He gave for a reason the return of the spring, and the pleasantness 
 of the weather.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The season is elegantly described in a great variety of 
 expressions. 

 [1.] <I>The winter is past,</I> the dark, cold, and barren winter. Long 
 winters and hard ones pass away at last; they do no endure always. And 
 the spring would not be so pleasant as it is if it did not succeed the 
 winter, which is a foil to its beauty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:14">Eccl. vii. 14</A>.

 Neither the face of the heavens nor that of the earth is always the
 same, but subject to continual vicissitudes, diurnal and annual. <I>The 
 winter is past,</I> but has not passed away for ever; it will come 
 again, and we must provide for it in summer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:6,8">Prov. vi. 6, 8</A>.

 We must weep in winter, and rejoice in summer, as though we wept and
 rejoiced not, for both are passing.

 [2.] <I>The rain is over and gone,</I> the winter-rain, the cold stormy 
 rain; it is over now, and <I>the dew is as the dew of herbs.</I> Even 
 the rain that drowned the world was over and gone at last 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:1-3">Gen. viii. 1-3</A>),

 and God promised to drown the world no more, which was a type and
 figure of the covenant of grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:9">Isa. liv. 9</A>.

 [3.] <I>The flowers appear on the earth.</I> All winter they are dead 
 and buried in their roots, and there is no sign of them; but in the 
 spring they revive, and show themselves in a wonderful variety and 
 verdure, and, like the dew that produces them, <I>tarry not for 
 man,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+5:7">Mic. v. 7</A>.

 They appear, but they will soon disappear again, and man in herein like
 <I>the flower of the field,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:2">Job xiv. 2</A>.

 [4.] <I>The time of singing of birds has come.</I> The little birds, 
 which all the winter lie hid in their retirements and scarcely live, 
 when the spring returns forget all the calamities of the winter, and to 
 the best of their capacity chant forth the praises of their Creator. 
 Doubtless he who understands the birds that cry for want 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:9">Ps. cxlvii. 9</A>)
 
 takes notice of those that <I>sing for joy</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:12">Ps. civ. 12</A>.

 The singing of the birds may shame our silence in God's praises, who
 are better fed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:26">Matt. vi. 26</A>),
 
 and better taught
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:11">Job xxxv. 11</A>),

 and are of <I>more value than many sparrows.</I> They live without
 inordinate care

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:26">Matt. vi. 26</A>)
 
 and therefore they sing, while we murmur.

 [5.] <I>The voice of the turtle is heard in our land,</I> which is one 
 of the season-birds mentioned 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:7">Jer. viii. 7</A>,

 that observe the time of their coming and the time of their singing,
 and so shame us who <I>know not the judgment of the Lord,</I> 
 understand not the times, nor do that which is <I>beautiful in its 
 season,</I> do not sing in singing time.

 [6.] <I>The fig-tree puts forth her green figs,</I> by which <I>we know 
 that summer is nigh</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:32">Matt. xxiv. 32</A>),

 when the green figs will be ripe figs and fit for use; and the <I>vines
 with the tender grape give a good smell.</I> The earth produces not 
 only <I>flowers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 but <I>fruits;</I> and the smell of the fruits, which are profitable, 
 is to be preferred far before that of the flowers, which are only for 
 show and pleasure. Serpents, they say, are driven away by the smell of
 the vines; and who is the old serpent, and who the true vine, we know 
 very well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Now this description of the returning spring, as a reason for 
 coming away with Christ, is applicable 

 [1.] To the introducing of the gospel in the room of the Old-Testament 
 dispensation, during which it had been winter time with the church.
 Christ's gospel warms that which was cold, makes that fruitful which 
 before was dead and barren; when it comes to any place it puts a beauty 
 and glory upon that place 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+3:7,8">2 Cor. iii. 7, 8</A>)

 and furnishes occasion for joy. Spring-time is pleasant time, and so is
 gospel-time. <I>Aspice venturo l&aelig;tentur ut omnia 
 seclo</I>--<I>Behold what joy the dawning age inspires!</I> said 
 Virgil, from the Sibyls, perhaps with more reference to the setting up 
 of the Messiah's kingdom at that time than he himself thought of. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:11">Ps. xcvi. 11</A>.

 <I>Arise then,</I> and improve this spring-time. <I>Come away</I> from
 the world and the flesh, come into <I>fellowship with Christ,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:9">1 Cor. i. 9</A>.

 [2.] To the delivering of the church from the power of persecuting 
 enemies, and the restoring of liberty and peace to it, after a severe 
 winter of suffering and restraint. When the storms of trouble are over 
 and gone, when the <I>voice of the turtle,</I> the joyful sound of the 
 gospel of Christ, is again heard, and ordinances are enjoyed with 
 freedom, then <I>arise and come away</I> to improve the happy juncture. 
 Walk in the light of the Lord; sing in the ways of the Lord. When the 
 churches had rest, then were they edified, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:31">Acts ix. 31</A>.

 [3.] To the conversion of sinners from a state of nature to a state of 
 grace. That blessed change is like the return of the spring, a 
 universal change and a very comfortable one; it is a new creation; it 
 is being born again. The soul that was hard, and cold, and frozen, and
 unprofitable, like the earth in winter, becomes fruitful, like the 
 earth in spring, and by degrees, like it, brings its fruits to 
 perfection. This blessed change is owing purely to the approaches and 
 influences of the sun of righteousness, who calls to us from heaven to 
 <I>arise and come away;</I> come, gather in summer.

 [4.] To the consolations of the saints after a state of inward 
 dejection and despondency. A child of God, under doubts and fears, is 
 like the earth in winter, its nights long, its days dark, good 
 affections chilled, nothing done, nothing got, the hand sealed up. But 
 comfort will return; the birds shall sing again, and the flowers 
 appear. Arise therefore, poor drooping soul, and <I>come away</I> with 
 thy beloved. <I>Arise, and shake thyself from the dust,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:2">Isa. lii. 2</A>.
 
 <I>Arise, shine, for thy light has come</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:1">Isa. lx. 1</A>);

 <I>walk in that light,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:5">Isa. ii. 5</A>.

 [5.] To the resurrection of the body at the last day, and the glory to 
 be revealed. The bones that lay in the grave, as the roots of the 
 plants in the ground during the winter, shall then <I>flourish as a 
 herb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+66:14,Isa+26:19">Isa. lxvi. 14; xxvi. 19</A>.

 That will be an eternal farewell to winter and a joyful entrance upon
 an everlasting spring.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. The encouraging invitation which Christ gives to the church, and 
 every believing soul, to come into communion with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. His love is now his <I>dove;</I> David had called the church God's 
 <I>turtle-dove</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:19">Ps. lxxxiv. 19</A>),

 and so she is here called; a dove for beauty, her <I>wings covered with
 silver</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:13">Ps. xviii. 13</A>),

 for innocence and inoffensiveness; a gracious spirit is a dove-like
 spirit, harmless, loving quietness and cleanliness, and faithful to 
 Christ, as the turtle to her mate. The Spirit descended <I>like a 
 dove</I> on Christ, and so he does on all Christians, making them of a 
 <I>meek and quiet spirit.</I> She is Christ's <I>dove,</I> for he owns 
 her and delights in her; she can find no rest but in him and his ark, 
 and therefore to him, as her Noah, she returns.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. This dove is <I>in the clefts of the rock and in the secret places 
 of the stairs.</I> This speaks either, 

 (1.) Her praise. Christ is the rock, to whom she flies for shelter and 
 in whom alone she can think herself safe and find herself easy, as a 
 dove in the hole of a rock, when struck at by the birds of prey, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+48:28">Jer. xlviii. 28</A>.

 Moses was hid in a cleft of the rock, that he might behold something of
 God's glory, which otherwise he could not have borne the brightness of. 
 She retires <I>into the secret places of the stairs,</I> where she may 
 be alone, undisturbed, and may the better commune with her own heart. 
 Good Christians will find time to be private. Christ often withdrew to 
 a mountain <I>himself alone, to pray.</I> Or,

 (2.) her blame. She crept into the <I>clefts of the rock,</I> and the 
 <I>secret places,</I> for fear and shame, any where to hide her head, 
 being heartless and discouraged, and shunning even the sight of her 
 beloved. Being conscious to herself of her own unfitness and 
 unworthiness to come into his presence, and speak to him, she drew 
 back, and was <I>like a silly dove without heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:11">Hos. vii. 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Christ graciously calls her out of her retirements: Come, <I>let me 
 see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice.</I> She was <I>mourning 
 like a dove</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:14">Isa. xxxviii. 14</A>),

 bemoaning herself like the <I>doves of the valleys,</I> where they are
 near the clefts of the impending rocks, <I>mourning for her 
 iniquities</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:16">Ezek. vii. 16</A>)

 and refusing to be comforted. But Christ calls her to <I>lift up her
 face without spot,</I> being purged from an evil conscience

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+11:15,22:26">Job xi. 15; xxii. 26</A>),

 to <I>come boldly to the throne of grace,</I> having a great <I>high
 priest</I> there

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:16">Heb. iv. 16</A>),

 to tell what her petition is and what her request: Let me <I>hear thy
 voice,</I> hear what thou hast to say; <I>what would you that I should 
 do unto you?</I> Speak freely, speak up, and fear not a slight or 
 repulse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. For her encouragement, he tells her the good thoughts he had of her, 
 whatever she thought of herself: <I>Sweet is thy voice;</I> thy praying 
 voice, though thou canst but <I>chatter like a crane or a swallow</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:14">Isa. xxxviii. 14</A>);

 it is music in God's ears. He has assured us that <I>the prayer of the
 upright is his delight;</I> he smelled a sweet savour from Noah's 
 sacrifice, and the <I>spiritual sacrifices</I> are no less 
 <I>acceptable,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:5">1 Pet. ii. 5</A>.

 This does not so much commend our services as God's gracious
 condescension in making the best of them, and the efficacy of the 
 <I>much incense</I> which is <I>offered with the prayers of saints,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+8:3">Rev. viii. 3</A>.

 "That countenance of thine, which thou art ashamed of, is comely,
 though now mournful, much more will it be so when it becomes cheerful." 
 <I>Then</I> the voice of prayer is sweet and acceptable to God when the 
 countenance, the conversation in which we show ourselves before men, is 
 holy, and so comely, and agreeable to our profession. Those that are 
 sanctified have the best comeliness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The charge which Christ gives to his servants to oppose and 
 suppress that which is a terror to his church and drives her, like a 
 poor frightened dove, into the clefts of the rock, and which is an 
 obstruction and prejudice to the interests of his kingdom in this world 
 and in the heart 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>Take us the foxes</I> (take them for us, for it is good service both 
 to Christ and the church), <I>the little foxes,</I> that creep in 
 insensibly; for, though they are little, they do great mischief, they 
 <I>spoil the vines,</I> which they must by no means be suffered to do 
 at any time, especially now when our vines have <I>tender grapes</I> 
 that must be preserved, or the vintage will fail. Believers are as
 vines, weak but useful plants; their fruits are as <I>tender crops</I> 
 at first, which must have time to come to maturity. This charge to
 <I>take the foxes</I> is,

 1. A charge to particular believers to mortify their own corruptions, 
 their sinful appetites and passions, which are as <I>foxes, little 
 foxes,</I> that destroy their graces and comforts, quash good motions, 
 crush good beginnings, and prevent their coming to perfection. Seize 
 the <I>little foxes,</I> the first risings of sin, the little ones of 
 Babylon 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:9">Ps. cxxxvii. 9</A>),

 those sins that seem little, for they often prove very dangerous.
 Whatever we find a hindrance to us in that which is good we must put 
 away.

 2. A charge to all in their places to oppose and prevent the spreading 
 of all such opinions and practices as tend to corrupt men's judgments, 
 debauch their consciences, perplex their minds, and discourage their 
 inclinations to virtue and piety. Persecutors are foxes
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:32">Luke xiii. 32</A>);
 
 false prophets are foxes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+13:4">Eze. xiii. 4</A>.

 Those that sow the tares of heresy or schism, and, like Diotrephes,
 trouble the peace of the church and obstruct the progress of the 
 gospel, they are the <I>foxes, the little foxes,</I> which must not be 
 knocked on the head (<I>Christ came not to destroy men's lives</I>), 
 but taken, that they may be tamed, or else restrained from doing 
 mischief.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The believing profession which the church makes of her relation to 
 Christ, and the satisfaction she takes in her interest in him and
 communion with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He had called her to <I>rise</I> and <I>come away</I> with him, to let 
 him see her face and hear her voice; now this is her answer to that 
 call, in which, though at present in the dark and at a distance,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. She comforts herself with the thoughts of the mutual interest and 
 relation that were between her and her beloved: <I>My beloved to me</I> 
 and <I>I to him,</I> so the original reads it very emphatically; the 
 conciseness of the language speaks the largeness of her affection: 
 "What he is to me and I to him may better be conceived than expressed." 
 Note, 
 
 (1.) It is the unspeakable privilege of true believers that
 Christ is theirs: <I>My beloved is mine;</I> this denotes not only 
 propriety ("I have a title to him") but possession and tenure--"I
 receive from his fulness." Believers are partakers of Christ; they have 
 not only an interest in him, but the enjoyment of him, are taken not 
 only in the covenant, but into communion with him. All the benefits of 
 his glorious undertaking, as Mediator, are made over to them. He is 
 that to them which the world neither is nor can be, all that which they 
 need and desire, and which will make a complete happiness for them. All 
 he is is theirs, and all he has, all he has done, and all he is doing; 
 all he has promised in the gospel, all he has prepared in heaven, all 
 is yours. 

 (2.) It is the undoubted character of all true believers that they are 
 Christ's, and then, and then only, he is theirs. They have given their 
 own selves to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+8:5">2 Cor. viii. 5</A>);

 they receive his doctrine and obey his laws; they bear his image and
 espouse his interest; they belong to Christ. If we be his, his wholly, 
 his only, his for ever, we may take the comfort of his being ours.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She comforts herself with the thoughts of the communications of his 
 grace to his people: <I>He feeds among the lilies.</I> When she wants 
 the tokens of his favour to her in particular, she rejoices in the 
 assurance of his presence with all believers in general, who are lilies 
 in his eyes. He <I>feeds</I> among them, that is, he takes as much 
 pleasure in them and their assemblies as a man does in his table or in 
 his garden, for he <I>walks in the midst of the golden 
 candlesticks;</I> he delights to converse with them, and to do them 
 good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The church's hope and expectation of Christ's coming, and her 
 prayer grounded thereupon. 

 1. She doubts not but that the <I>day will break</I> and the 
 <I>shadows</I> will <I>flee away.</I> The gospel-day will dawn, and the 
 shadows of the ceremonial law will flee away. This was the comfort of 
 the Old-Testament church, that, after the long night of that dark 
 dispensation, the <I>day-spring from on high would</I> at length 
 <I>visit them,</I> to <I>give light to those that sit in darkness.</I> 
 When the sun rises the shades of the night vanish, so do the shadows of 
 the day when the substance comes. The day of comfort will come after a 
 night of desertion. Or it may refer to the second coming of Christ, and 
 the eternal happiness of the saints; the shadows of our present state 
 will flee away, our darkness and doubts, our griefs and all our 
 grievances, and a glorious day shall dawn, a morning when the 
 <I>upright shall have dominion,</I> a day that shall have no night 
 after it. 

 2. She begs the presence of her beloved, in the mean time, to support 
 and comfort her: "<I>Turn, my beloved,</I> turn to me, come and visit 
 me, come and relieve me, <I>be with me always to the end of the 
 age.</I> In the day of my extremity, make haste to help me, <I>make no 
 long tarrying.</I> Come over even <I>the mountains of division,</I> 
 interposing time and days, with some gracious anticipations of that 
 light and love." 

 3. She begs that he would not only turn to her for the present, but
 hasten his coming to fetch her to himself. <I>"Even so, come, Lord
 Jesus, come quickly.</I> Though there be mountains in the way, thou 
 canst, <I>like a roe, or a young hart,</I> step over them with ease. 
 <I>O show thyself to me, or take me up to thee.</I>"</P>
