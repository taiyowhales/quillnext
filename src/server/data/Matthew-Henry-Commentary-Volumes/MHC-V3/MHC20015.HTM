 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up
 anger.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon, as conservator of the public peace, here tells us, 

 1. How the peace may be kept, that we may know how in our places to 
 keep it; it is by soft words. If wrath be risen like a threatening 
 cloud, pregnant with storms and thunder, <I>a soft answer</I> will 
 disperse it and turn it away. When men are provoked, speak gently to 
 them, and give them good words, and they will be pacified, as the 
 Ephraimites were by Gideon's mildness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:1-3">Judg. viii. 1-3</A>);

 whereas, upon a like occasion, by Jephthah's roughness, they were
 exasperated, and the consequences were bad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+12:1-3">Judg. xii. 1-3</A>.

 Reason will be better spoken, and a righteous cause better pleaded,
 with meekness than with passion; hard arguments do best with soft
 words. 

 2. How the peace will be broken, that we, for our parts, may do nothing 
 towards the breaking of it. Nothing stirs up anger, and sows discord, 
 like <I>grievous words,</I> calling foul names, as <I>Raca,</I> and 
 <I>Thou fool,</I> upbraiding men with their infirmities and 
 infelicities, their extraction or education, or any thing that lessens 
 them and makes them mean; scornful spiteful reflections, by which men 
 affect to show their wit and malice, stir up the anger of others, which 
 does but increase and inflame their own anger. Rather than lose a jest 
 some will lose a friend and make an enemy.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_2"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth
 of fools poureth out foolishness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. A good heart by the tongue becomes very useful. He that has 
 knowledge is not only to enjoy it, for his own entertainment, but to 
 use it, to use it aright, for the edification of others; and it is 
 <I>the tongue</I> that must make use of it in pious profitable 
 discourse, in giving suitable and seasonable instructions, counsels, 
 and comforts, with all possible expressions of humility and love, and 
 then <I>knowledge is used aright;</I> and to him that has, and thus 
 uses what he has, more shall be given. 

 2. A wicked heart by the tongue becomes very hurtful; for <I>the mouth 
 of fools belches out foolishness,</I> which is very offensive; and the 
 corrupt communication which proceeds from an evil treasure within (the 
 filthiness, and foolish talking, and jesting) corrupts the good manners 
 of some and debauches them, and grieves the good hearts of others and 
 disturbs them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  The eyes of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>are</I> in every place, beholding the evil
 and the good.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The great truths of divinity are of great use to enforce the precepts 
 of morality, and none more than this--That the eye of God is always upon
 the children of men. 

 1. An eye to discern all, not only from which nothing can be concealed, 
 but by which every thing is actually inspected, and nothing overlooked 
 or looked slightly upon: <I>The eyes of the Lord are in every 
 place;</I> for he not only sees all from on high

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:13">Ps. xxxiii. 13</A>),

 but he is every where present. Angels are <I>full of eyes</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+4:8">Rev. iv. 8</A>),

 but God is all eye. It denotes not only his omniscience, that he sees
 all, but his universal providence, that he upholds and governs all. 
 Secret sins, services, and sorrows, are under his eye. 

 2. An eye to distinguish both persons and actions. He <I>beholds the
 evil and the good,</I> is displeased with the evil and approves of the 
 good, and will judge men according to the sight of his eyes,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:6,11:4">Ps. i. 6; xi. 4</A>.

 The wicked shall not go unpunished, nor the righteous unrewarded, for
 God has his eye upon both and knows their true character; this speaks 
 as much comfort to saints as terror to sinners.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_4"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  A wholesome tongue <I>is</I> a tree of life: but perverseness
 therein <I>is</I> a breach in the spirit.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. A good tongue is healing, healing to wounded consciences by 
 comforting them, to sin-sick souls by convincing them, to peace and 
 love when it is broken by accommodating differences, compromising 
 matters in variance, and reconciling parties at variance; this is the 
 healing of the tongue, which <I>is a tree of life,</I> the leaves of 
 which have a sanative virtue,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:2">Rev. xxii. 2</A>.

 He that knows how to discourse will make the place he lives in a 
 paradise. 

 2. An evil tongue is wounding (<I>perverseness,</I> passion, falsehood, 
 and filthiness <I>there, are a breach in the spirit</I>); it wounds the 
 conscience of the evil speaker, and occasions either guilt or grief to 
 the hearers, and both are to be reckoned <I>breaches in the spirit.</I> 
 Hard words indeed break no bones, but many a heart has been broken by 
 them.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_5"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that
 regardeth reproof is prudent.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hence, 

 1. Let superiors be admonished to give instruction and reproof to those 
 that are under their charge, as they will answer it in the day of 
 account. They must not only instruct with the light of knowledge, but 
 reprove with the heat of zeal; and both these must be done with the 
 authority and affection of a father, and must be continued, though the 
 desired effect be not immediately perceived. If the instruction be 
 despised, give reproof, and rebuke sharply. It is indeed against the 
 grain with good-humoured men to find fault, and make those about them 
 uneasy; but better so than to suffer them to go on undisturbed in the 
 way to ruin. 

 2. Let inferiors be admonished, not only to submit to instruction and 
 reproof (even hardships must be submitted to), but to value them as 
 favours and not despise them, to make use of them for their direction, 
 and always to have a regard to them; this will be an evidence that they 
 are wise and a means of making them so; whereas he that slights his 
 good education is a fool and is likely to live and die one.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  In the house of the righteous <I>is</I> much treasure: but in the
 revenues of the wicked is trouble.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Where righteousness is riches are, and the comforts of them: <I>In 
 the house of the righteous is much treasure.</I> Religion teaches men 
 to be diligent, temperate, and just, and by these means, ordinarily, 
 the estate is increased. But that is not all: God <I>blesses the 
 habitation of the just,</I> and that blessing makes rich without 
 trouble. Or, if there be not much of this world's goods, yet where 
 there is grace there is true treasure; and those who have but little, 
 if they have a heart to be therewith content, and to enjoy the comfort 
 of that little, it is enough; it is all riches. The righteous perhaps 
 are not themselves enriched, but there is treasure in their house, a 
 blessing in store, which their children after them may reap the benefit 
 of. A wicked worldly man is only for having his belly filled with those 
 treasures, his own sensual appetite gratified

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps. xvii. 14</A>);

 but a righteous man's first care is for his soul and then for his seed, 
 to have treasure in his heart and then in his house, which his 
 relations and those about him may have the benefit of. 

 2. Where wickedness is, though there may be riches, yet there is 
 vexation of spirit with them: <I>In the revenues of the wicked,</I> the 
 great incomes they have, <I>there is trouble;</I> for there is guilt 
 and a curse; there is pride and passion, and envy and contention; and 
 those are troublesome lusts, which rob them of the joy of their 
 revenues and make them troublesome to their neighbours.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_7"> </A>
 
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the
 foolish <I>doeth</I> not so.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is to the same purport with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>,

 and shows what a blessing a wise man is and what a burden a fool is to 
 those about him. Only here observe further,

 1. That we then use knowledge aright when we disperse it, not confine
 it to a few of our intimates, and grudge it to others who would make as 
 good use of it, but <I>give a portion</I> of this spiritual alms <I>to 
 seven and also to eight,</I> not only be communicative, but diffusive, 
 of this good, with humility and prudence. We must take pains to spread
 and propagate useful knowledge, must teach some that they may teach 
 others, and so it is dispersed. 

 2. That it is not only a fault to <I>pour out foolishness,</I> but it 
 is a shame not to <I>disperse knowledge,</I> at least not to drop some 
 wise word or other: <I>The heart of the foolish does not so;</I> it has 
 nothing to disperse that is good, or, if it had, has neither skill nor 
 will to do good with it and therefore is little worth.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  The sacrifice of the wicked <I>is</I> an abomination to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 but the prayer of the upright <I>is</I> his delight.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. God so hates wicked people, whose hearts are malicious and their 
 lives mischievous, that even their <I>sacrifices are an abomination 
 to</I> him. God has sacrifices brought him even by wicked men, to stop 
 the mouth of conscience and to keep up their reputation in the world, 
 as malefactors come to a sanctuary, not because it is a holy place, but 
 because it shelters them from justice; but their sacrifices, though 
 ever so costly, are not accepted of God, because not offered in 
 sincerity nor from a good principle; they dissemble with God, and in 
 their conversations give the lie to their devotions, and for that 
 reason they are <I>an abomination</I> to him, because they are made a 
 cloak for sin,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+7:14"><I>ch.</I> vii. 14</A>.
 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+1:11">Isa. i. 11</A>.

 2. God has such a love for upright good people that, though they are
 not at the expense of a sacrifice (he himself has provided that), their 
 <I>prayer is a delight</I> to him. Praying graces are his own gift, and 
 the work of his own Spirit in them, with which he is well pleased. He 
 not only answers their prayers, but delights in their addresses to him, 
 and in doing them good.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  The way of the wicked <I>is</I> an abomination unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: but
 he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is a reason of what was said in the foregoing verse.

 1. <I>The sacrifices of the wicked are an abomination to God,</I> not
 for want of some nice points of ceremony, but because <I>their way,</I> 
 the whole course and tenour of their conversation, is wicked, and 
 consequently an abomination to him. Sacrifices for sin were not 
 accepted of those that resolved to go on in sin, and were to the 
 highest degree abominable if intended to obtain a connivance at sin and 
 a permission to go on in it.

 2. Therefore <I>the prayer of the upright is his delight,</I> because
 he is a friend of God, and <I>he loves him who,</I> though he have not 
 yet attained, is <I>following after righteousness,</I> aiming at it and 
 pressing towards it, as St. Paul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+3:13">Phil. iii. 13</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_10"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Correction <I>is</I> grievous unto him that forsaketh the way:
 <I>and</I> he that hateth reproof shall die.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This shows that those who cannot bear to be corrected must expect to be 
 destroyed. 

 1. It is common for those who have known the way of righteousness, but 
 have forsaken it, to reckon it a great affront to be reproved and 
 admonished. They are very uneasy at reproof; they cannot, they will 
 not, bear it; nay, because they hate to be reformed, they hate to be 
 reproved, and hate those who deal faithfully and kindly with them. Of 
 all sinners, reproofs are worst resented by apostates. 

 2. It is certain that those who will not be reproved will be ruined: 
 <I>He that hates reproof,</I> and hardens his heart against it, is 
 joined to his idols; let him alone. He <I>shall die,</I> and perish for 
 ever, in his sins, since he would not be parted from his sins.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+25:15">2 Chron. xxv. 15</A>,

 <I>I know that God has determined to destroy thee,</I> because thou 
 couldst not bear to be reproved; see also 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:1"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 1</A>.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_11"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Hell and destruction <I>are</I> before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: how much more
 then the hearts of the children of men?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This confirms what was said 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+15:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 concerning God's omnipresence, in order to his judging of evil and 
 good.

 1. God knows all things, even those things that are hidden from the 
 eyes of all living: <I>Hell and destruction are before the Lord,</I> 
 not only the centre of the earth, and its subterraneous caverns, but 
 the grave, and all the dead bodies which are there buried out of our 
 sight; they are all <I>before the Lord,</I> all under his eye, so that 
 none of them can be lost or be to seek when they are to be raised 
 again. He knows where every man lies buried, even Moses, even those 
 that are buried in the greatest obscurity; nor needs he any monument 
 with a <I>Hic jacet--Here he lies,</I> to direct him. The place of the 
 damned in particular, and all their torments, which are inexpressible, 
 the state of separate souls in general, and all their circumstances, 
 are under God's eye. The word here used for <I>destruction</I> is 
 <I>Abaddon,</I> which is one of the devil's names,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+9:11">Rev. ix. 11</A>.

 That destroyer, though he deceives us, cannot evade or elude the divine 
 cognizance. God examines him whence he comes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:7">Job i. 7</A>),

 and sees through all his disguises though he is sly, and subtle, and 
 swift, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:6">Job xxvi. 6</A>.

 2. He knows particularly <I>the hearts of the children of men.</I> If 
 he sees through the depths and wiles of Satan himself, <I>much more</I> 
 can he search men's hearts, though they be deceitful, since they 
 learned all their fraudulent arts of Satan. <I>God is greater than our
 hearts,</I> and knows them better than we know them ourselves, and 
 therefore is an infallible Judge of every man's character, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:13">Heb. iv. 13</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he
 go unto the wise.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 A scorner is one that not only makes a jest of God and religion, but 
 bids defiance to the methods employed for his conviction and 
 reformation, and, as an evidence of that, 

 1. He cannot endure the checks of his own conscience, nor will he 
 suffer it to deal plainly with him: <I>He loves not to reprove him</I> 
 (so some read it); he cannot endure to retire into his own heart and 
 commune seriously with that, will not admit of any free thought or fair 
 reasoning with himself, nor let his own heart smite him, if he can help 
 it. That man's case is sad who is afraid of being acquainted and of 
 arguing with himself. 

 2. He cannot endure the advice and admonitions of his friends: <I>He 
 will not go unto the wise,</I> lest they should give him wise counsel. 
 We ought not only to bid the wise welcome when they come to us, but to 
 go to them, as beggars to the rich man's door for an alms; but this the 
 scorner will not do, for fear of being told of his faults and prevailed 
 upon to reform.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow
 of the heart the spirit is broken.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 1. Harmless mirth is recommended to us, as that which contributes to 
 the health of the body, making men lively and fit for business, and to 
 the acceptableness of the conversation, making the face to shine and 
 rendering us pleasant one to another. A cheerful spirit, under the
 government of wisdom and grace, is a great ornament to religion, puts a 
 further lustre upon the beauty of holiness, and makes men the more 
 capable of doing good. 

 2. Hurtful melancholy is what we are cautioned against, as a great 
 enemy to us, both in our devotion and in our conversation: <I>By sorrow 
 of the heart,</I> when it has got dominion and plays the tyrant, as it 
 will be apt to do it if be indulged awhile, <I>the spirit is broken</I> 
 and sunk, and becomes unfit for the service of God. <I>The sorrow of 
 the world works death.</I> Let us therefore <I>weep as though we wept 
 not,</I> in justice to ourselves, as well as in conformity to God and 
 his providence.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>14  The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge:
 but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are two things to be wondered at:--

 1. A wise man not satisfied with his wisdom, but still seeking the 
 increase of it; the more he has the more he would have: <I>The heart of 
 him that has understanding,</I> rejoices so in the knowledge it has 
 attained to that it is still coveting more, and in the use of the means 
 of knowledge is still labouring for more, <I>growing in grace, and in 
 the knowledge of Christ. Si dixisti, Sufficit, periisti--If you say, I
 have enough, you are undone.</I> 

 2. A fool well satisfied with his folly and not seeking the cure of it. 
 While a good man hungers after the solid satisfactions of grace, a 
 carnal mind feasts on the gratifications of appetite and fancy. Vain 
 mirth and sensual pleasures are its delight, and with these it can rest 
 contented, flattering itself in these foolish ways.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_15"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  All the days of the afflicted <I>are</I> evil: but he that is of
 a merry heart <I>hath</I> a continual feast.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here what a great difference there is between the condition and 
 temper of some and others of the children of men. 

 1. Some are much in affliction, and of a sorrowful spirit, and all 
 their days are evil days, like those of old age, and days of which they 
 say they <I>have no pleasure in them.</I> They <I>eat in darkness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:17">Eccl. v. 17</A>)

 and never <I>eat with pleasure,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:25">Job xxi. 25</A>.

 How many are the afflictions of the afflicted in this world! Such are 
 not to be censured or despised, but pitied and prayed for, succoured 
 and comforted. It might have been our own lot, or may be yet, merry as 
 we are at present.

 2. Others enjoy great prosperity and are of a cheerful spirit; and
 they have not only good days, but have <I>a continual feast;</I> and if 
 in the abundance of all things they serve God with gladness of heart, 
 and it is oil to the wheels of their obedience (all this, and heaven 
 too), then they serve a good Master. But let not such feast without
 fear; a sudden change may come; therefore <I>rejoice with 
 trembling.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Better <I>is</I> little with the fear of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> than great
 treasure and trouble therewith.
 &nbsp; 17  Better <I>is</I> a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled
 ox and hatred therewith.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon had said in the foregoing verse that he who has not a large
 estate, or a great income, but a cheerful spirit, has <I>a continual
 feast;</I> Christian contentment, and joy in God, make the life easy
 and pleasant; now here he tells us what is necessary to that
 cheerfulness of spirit which will furnish a man with <I>a continual
 feast,</I> though he has but little in the world--holiness and love.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Holiness. <I>A little,</I> if we manage it and enjoy it in <I>the 
 fear of the Lord,</I> if we keep a good conscience and go on in the way 
 of duty, and serve God faithfully with the little we have, will be more 
 comfortable, and turn to a better account, <I>than great treasure and 
 trouble therewith.</I> Observe here, 

 1. It is often the lot of those that fear God to have but a little of 
 this world. <I>The poor receive the gospel,</I> and poor they still 
 are,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:5">Jam. ii. 5</A>.

 2. Those that have <I>great treasure</I> have often great <I>trouble 
 therewith;</I> it is so far from making them easy that it increases 
 their care and hurry. <I>The abundance of the rich will not suffer
 them to sleep.</I> 

 3. If great treasure bring trouble with it, it is for want of the fear
 of God. If those that have great estates would do their duty with them, 
 and then trust God with them, their treasure would not have so much 
 trouble attending it. 

 4. It is therefore far better, and more desirable, to have but a little 
 of the world and to have it with a good conscience, to keep up 
 communion with God, and enjoy him in it, and live by faith, than to 
 have the greatest plenty and live without God in the world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Love. Next to the fear of God, peace with all men is necessary to 
 the comfort of this life. 

 1. If <I>brethren dwell together in unity,</I> if they are friendly, 
 and hearty, and pleasant, both in their daily meals and in more solemn 
 entertainments, that will make <I>a dinner of herbs</I> a feast 
 sufficient; though the fare be coarse, and the estate so small that 
 they can afford no better, yet love will sweeten it and they may be as 
 merry over it as if they had all dainties. 

 2. If there be mutual enmity and strife, though there be a whole ox for 
 dinner, a fat ox, there can be no comfort in it; the leaven of malice, 
 of hating and being hated, is enough to sour it all. Some refer it to
 him that makes the entertainment; better have a slender dinner and be 
 heartily welcome than a table richly spread with a grudging evil 
 eye.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but <I>he that is</I> slow to
 anger appeaseth strife.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. Passion the great make-bate. Thence <I>come wars and fightings.</I> 
 Anger strikes the fire which sets cities and churches into a flame: 
 <I>A wrathful man,</I> with his peevish passionate reflections, 
 <I>stirs up strife,</I> and sets people together by the ears; he gives 
 occasion to others to quarrel, and takes the occasion that others give, 
 though ever so trifling. When men carry their resentments too far, one 
 quarrel still produces another. 

 2. Meekness the great peace-maker: <I>He that is slow to anger</I> not 
 only <I>prevents</I> strife, that it be not kindled, but 
 <I>appeases</I> it if it be already kindled, brings water to the flame, 
 unites those again that have fallen out, and by gentle methods brings 
 them to mutual concessions for peace-sake.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_19"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  The way of the slothful <I>man is</I> as an hedge of thorns: but
 the way of the righteous <I>is</I> made plain.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. Whence those difficulties arise which men pretend to meet with in 
 the way of their duty, and to be insuperable; they arise not from any 
 thing in the nature of the duty, but from the slothfulness of those 
 that have really no mind to it. Those that have no heart to their work
 pretend that their way is hedged up with thorns, and they cannot do 
 their work at all (as if God were a hard Master, reaping where he had 
 not sown), at least that their way is strewed with thorns, that they
 cannot do their work without a great deal of hardship and danger; and 
 therefore they go about it with as much reluctance as if they were to 
 go barefoot through a thorny hedge. 

 2. How these imaginary difficulties may be conquered. An honest desire 
 and endeavour to do our duty will, by the grace of God, make it easy, 
 and we shall find it strewed with roses: <I>The way of the righteous is 
 made plain;</I> it is easy to be trodden and not rough, easy to be 
 found, and not intricate.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_20"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth
 his mother.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 

 1. To the praise of good children, that they are the joy of their 
 parents, who ought to have joy of them, having taken so much care and 
 pains about them. And it adds much to the satisfaction of those that 
 are good if they have reason to think that they have been a comfort to 
 their parents in their declining years, when evil days come.

 2. To the shame of wicked children, that by their wickedness they put 
 contempt upon their parents, slight their authority, and make an ill 
 requital for their kindness: <I>A foolish son despises his mother,</I> 
 that had most sorrow with him and perhaps had too much indulged him, 
 which makes his sin in despising her the more sinful and her sorrow the 
 more sorrowful.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_21"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>21  Folly <I>is</I> joy to <I>him that is</I> destitute of wisdom: but a
 man of understanding walketh uprightly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is the character of a wicked man that he takes pleasure in sin; 
 he has an appetite to the bait, and swallows it greedily, and has no 
 dread of the hook, nor feels from it when he has swallowed it: <I>Folly 
 is joy to him;</I> the folly of others is so, and his own much more. He 
 sins, not only without regret, but with delight, not only repents not 
 of it, but makes his boast of it. This is a certain sign of one that is 
 graceless. 

 2. It is the character of a wise and good man that he makes conscience 
 of his duty. A fool lives at large, walks at all adventures, by no 
 rule, acts with no sincerity or steadiness; <I>but a man of 
 understanding,</I> the eyes of whose understanding are enlightened by 
 the Spirit (and those that have not a good understanding have no 
 understanding), <I>walks uprightly,</I> lives a sober, orderly, regular 
 life, and studies in every thing to conform himself to the will of God; 
 and this is a constant pleasure and <I>joy to him.</I> But what 
 foolishness remains in him, or proceeds from him at any time, is a 
 grief to him, and he is ashamed of it. By these characters we may try 
 ourselves.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_22"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the
 multitude of counsellors they are established.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. Of what ill consequence it is to be precipitate and rash, and to act 
 without advice: Men's <I>purposes are disappointed,</I> their measures 
 broken, and they come short of their point, gain not their end, because 
 they would not ask counsel about the way. If men will not take time and 
 pains to deliberate with themselves, or are so confident of their own 
 judgment that they scorn to consult with others, they are not likely to 
 bring any thing considerable to pass; circumstances defeat them which, 
 with a little consultation, might have been foreseen and obviated. It 
 is a good rule, both in public and domestic affairs, to do nothing 
 rashly and of one's own head. <I>Plus vident oculi quam oculus--Many 
 eyes see more than one.</I> That often proves best which was least our 
 own doing. 

 2. How much it will be for our advantage to ask the advice of our 
 friends: <I>In the multitude of counsellors</I> (provided they be 
 discreet and honest, and will not give counsel with a spirit of 
 contradiction) <I>purposes are established.</I> Solomon's son made no 
 good use of this proverb when he acquiesced not in the counsel of the 
 old men, but because he would have a <I>multitude of counsellors,</I> 
 regarding number more than weight, advised with the young men.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_23"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word
 <I>spoken</I> in due season, how good <I>is it!</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. We speak wisely when we speak seasonably: <I>The answer of the 
 mouth</I> will be our credit and joy when it is pertinent and to the 
 purpose, and is <I>spoken in due season,</I> when it is needed and will 
 be regarded, and, as we say, hits the joint. Many a good word comes 
 short of doing the good it might have done, for want of being 
 well-timed. Nor is any thing more the beauty of discourse than to have 
 a proper answer ready off-hand, just when there is occasion for it, and 
 it comes in well. 

 2. If we speak wisely and well, it will redound to our own comfort and
 to the advantage of others: <I>A man has joy by the answer of his 
 mouth;</I> he may take a pleasure, but may by no means take a pride, in 
 having spoken so acceptably and well that the hearers admire him and 
 say, "<I>How good is it,</I> and how much good does it do!"</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_24"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  The way of life <I>is</I> above to the wise, that he may depart
 from hell beneath.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The way of wisdom and holiness is here recommended to us, 

 1. As very safe and comfortable: It is <I>the way of life,</I> the way 
 that leads to eternal life, in which we shall find the joy and 
 satisfaction which will be the life of the soul, and at the end of 
 which we shall find the perfection of blessedness. Be wise and live. It 
 is the way to escape that misery which we cannot but see ourselves 
 exposed to, and in danger of. It is to <I>depart from hell beneath,</I> 
 from the snares of hell, the temptations of Satan, and all his wiles, 
 from the pains of hell, that everlasting destruction which our sins 
 have deserved. 

 2. As very sublime and honourable: It <I>is above.</I> A good man sets 
 his <I>affections on things above,</I> and deals in those things. His
 <I>conversation is in heaven;</I> his way leads directly thither; there 
 his treasure is, <I>above,</I> out of the reach of enemies, above the 
 changes of this lower world. A good man is truly noble and great; his 
 desires and designs are high, and he lives above the common rate of 
 other men. It is above the capacity and out of the sight of foolish 
 men.</P>

 establish the border of the widow.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note,

 1. Those that are elevated God delights to abase, and commonly does it 
 in the course of his providence: <I>The proud,</I> that magnify 
 themselves, bid defiance to the God above them and trample on all about 
 them, are such as God resists and <I>will destroy,</I> not them only, 
 but <I>their houses,</I> which they are proud of and are confident of 
 the continuance and perpetuity of. Pride is the ruin of multitudes. 

 2. Those that are dejected God delights to support, and often does it
 remarkably: <I>He will establish the border of the poor widow,</I> 
 which proud injurious men break in upon, and which the poor widow is 
 not herself able to defend and make good. It is the honour of God to 
 protect the weak and appear for those that are oppressed.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>26  The thoughts of the wicked <I>are</I> an abomination to the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>:
 but <I>the words</I> of the pure <I>are</I> pleasant words.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The former part of this verse speaks of thoughts, the latter of words, 
 but they come all to one; for thoughts are words to God, and words are 
 judged of by the thoughts from which they proceed, so that, 

 1. <I>The thoughts</I> and words <I>of the wicked,</I> which are, like 
 themselves, wicked, which aim at mischief, and have some ill tendency 
 or other, <I>are an abomination to the Lord;</I> he is displeased at 
 them and will reckon for them. The thoughts of wicked men, for the most 
 part, are such as God hates, and are an offence to him, who not only 
 knows the heart and all that passes and repasses there, but requires 
 the innermost and uppermost place in it. 

 2. The thoughts and <I>words of the pure,</I> being pure like 
 themselves, clean, honest, and sincere, <I>are pleasant words</I> and 
 pleasant thoughts, well-pleasing to the holy God, who delights in 
 purity. It may be understood both of their devotions to God (<I>the 
 words of their mouth and the meditations of their heart,</I> in prayer 
 and praise, are <I>acceptable to God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:14,69:13">Ps. xix. 14; lxix. 13</A>)

 and of their discourses with men, tending to edification. Both are 
 pleasant when they come from a pure, a purified, heart.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_27"> </A>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>27  He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he
 that hateth gifts shall live.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Those that are covetous entail trouble upon their families: <I>He 
 that is greedy of gain,</I> and therefore makes himself a slave to the 
 world, rises up early, sits up late, and eats the bread of carefulness, 
 in pursuit of it--he that hurries, and puts himself and all about him 
 upon the stretch, in business, frets and vexes at every loss and 
 disappointment, and quarrels with every body that stands in the way of 
 his profit--he <I>troubles his own house,</I> is a burden and vexation 
 to his children and servants. He that, in his greediness of gain, takes 
 bribes, and uses unlawful ways of getting money, leaves a curse with 
 what he gets to those that come after him, which sooner or later will 
 bring trouble into the house,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:9,10">Hab. ii. 9, 10</A>.

 2. Those that are generous as well as righteous entail a blessing upon 
 their families: <I>He that hates gifts,</I> that shakes his hands from 
 holding the bribes that are thrust into his hand to pervert justice and 
 abhors all sinful indirect ways of getting money--that hates to be 
 paltry and mercenary, and is willing, if there be occasion, to do good 
 gratis--he shall live; he shall have the comfort of life, shall live in 
 prosperity and reputation; his name and family shall live and 
 continue.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth
 of the wicked poureth out evil things.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A good man proved to be a wise man by this, that he governs his 
 tongue well; he that does so <I>the same is a perfect man,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+3:2">Jam. iii. 2</A>.

 It is part of the character of a righteous man that being convinced of 
 the account he must give of his words, and of the good and bad 
 influence of them upon others, he makes conscience of speaking truly 
 (it is his <I>heart</I> that <I>answers,</I> that is, he speaks as he 
 thinks, and dares not do otherwise, he <I>speaks the truth in his 
 heart,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+15:2">Ps. xv. 2</A>),

 and of speaking pertinently and profitably, and therefore he <I>studies 
 to answer,</I> that his speech may be with grace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:4,5:7">Neh. ii. 4; v. 7</A>.

 2. A wicked man is proved to be a fool by this, that he never heeds 
 what he says, but his <I>mouth pours out evil things,</I> to the 
 dishonour of God and religion, his own reproach, and the hurt of 
 others. Doubtless that is an evil heart which thus overflows with 
 evil.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_29"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>29  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer
 of the righteous.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. God sets himself at a distance from those that set him at defiance: 
 <I>The wicked say to the Almighty, Depart from us,</I> and he is, 
 accordingly, <I>far from</I> them; he does not manifest himself to 
 them, has no communion with them, will not hear them, will not help 
 them, no, not in the time of their need. They shall be for ever 
 banished from his presence and he will behold them afar off. <I>Depart 
 from me, you cursed.</I> 

 2. He will draw nigh to those in a way of mercy who draw nigh to him in 
 a way of duty: <I>He hears the prayer of the righteous,</I> accepts it, 
 is well pleased with it, and will grant an answer of peace to it. It is 
 <I>the prayer of a righteous man</I> that <I>avails much,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:16">Jam. v. 16</A>.

 <I>He is nigh to them,</I> a present help, <I>in all that they call 
 upon him for.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>30  The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: <I>and</I> a good
 report maketh the bones fat.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things are here pronounced pleasant:--

 1. It is pleasant to have a good prospect to see the light of the sun 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:7">Eccl. xi. 7</A>)

 and by it to see the wonderful works of God, with which this lower 
 world is beautified and enriched. Those that want the mercy know how to 
 value it; how would <I>the light of the eyes rejoice their hearts!</I> 
 The consideration of this should make us thankful for our eyesight. 

 2. It is more pleasant to have <I>a good name,</I> a name for good
 things with God and good people; this <I>is as precious ointment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:1">Eccl. vii. 1</A>.

 <I>It makes the bones fat;</I> it gives a secret pleasure, and that 
 which is strengthening. It is also very comfortable to hear (as some 
 understand it) <I>a good report</I> concerning others; a good man has 
 no greater joy than to hear that his friends walk in the truth.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_31"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>31  The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the
 wise.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is the character of a wise man that he is very willing to be 
 reproved, and therefore chooses to converse with those that, both by 
 their words and example, will show him what is amiss in him: <I>The ear 
 that</I> can take <I>the reproof</I> will love the reprover. Faithful 
 friendly reproofs are here called <I>the reproofs of life,</I> not only 
 because they are to be given in a lively manner, and with a prudent 
 zeal (and we must reprove by our lives as well as by our doctrine), but 
 because, where they are well-taken, they are means of spiritual life, 
 and lead to eternal life, and (as some think) to distinguish them from 
 rebukes and reproaches for well-doing, which are rather reproofs of 
 death, which we must not regard nor be influenced by. 

 2. Those that are so wise as to bear reproof well will hereby be
 <I>made wiser</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:9"><I>ch.</I> ix. 9</A>),

 and come at length to be numbered among the wise men of the age, and
 will have both ability and authority to reprove and instruct others. 
 Those that learn well, and obey well, are likely in time to teach well 
 and rule well.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_32"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>32  He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he
 that heareth reproof getteth understanding.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. The folly of those that will not be taught, that <I>refuse 
 instruction,</I> that will not heed it, but turn their backs upon it, 
 or will not hear it, but turn their hearts against it. They <I>refuse 
 correction</I> (margin); they will not <I>take it,</I> no, not from God 
 himself, but kick against the pricks. Those that do so <I>despise their 
 own souls;</I> they show that they have a low and mean opinion of them, 
 and are in little care and concern about them, considered as rational 
 and immortal, instruction being designed to cultivate reason and 
 prepare for the immortal state. The fundamental error of sinners is 
 undervaluing their own souls; therefore they neglect to provide for 
 them, abuse them, expose them, prefer the body before the soul, and 
 wrong the soul to please the body. 

 2. The wisdom of those that are willing, not only to be taught, but to 
 be reproved: <I>He that hears reproof,</I> and amends the faults he is 
 reproved for, <I>gets understanding,</I> by which his soul is secured 
 from bad ways and directed in good ways, and thereby he both evidences 
 the value he has for his own soul and puts true honour upon it.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr15_33"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>33  The fear of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> the instruction of wisdom; and
 before honour <I>is</I> humility.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here how much it is our interest, as well as duty, 

 1. To submit to our God, and keep up a reverence for him: <I>The fear 
 of the Lord,</I> as it is <I>the beginning of wisdom,</I> so it is 
 <I>the instruction</I> and correction <I>of wisdom;</I> the principles 
 of religion, closely adhered to, will improve our knowledge, rectify 
 our mistakes, and be the best and surest guide of our way. An awe of 
 God upon our spirits will put us upon the wisest counsels and chastise 
 us when we say or do unwisely. 

 2. To stoop to our brethren, and keep up a respect for them. Where
 there is humility there is a happy presage of honour and preparative 
 for it. Those that humble themselves shall be exalted here and 
 hereafter.</P>
