 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David seems to have been in a great strait when he penned this psalm, 
 and, upon some account or other, very uneasy; for it is with some 
 difficulty that he conquers his passion, and composes his spirit 
 himself to take that good counsel which he had given to others 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+37:1-40">xxxvii.</A>)

 to rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him, without fretting; for
 it is easier to give the good advice than to give the good example of 
 quietness under affliction. What was the particular trouble which gave 
 occasion for the conflict David was now in does not appear. Perhaps it 
 was the death of some dear friend or relation that was the trial of his 
 patience, and that suggested to him these meditations of morality; and 
 at the same time, it should seem too, he himself was weak and ill, and 
 under some prevailing distemper. His enemies likewise were seeking 
 advantages against him, and watched for his halting, that they might 
 have something to reproach him for. Thus aggrieved,

 I. He relates the struggle that was in his breast between grace and
 corruption, between passion and patience,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39+1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. He meditates upon the doctrine of man's frailty and mortality, and
 prays to God to instruct him in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39+4-6">ver. 4-6</A>.

 III. He applies to God for the pardon of his sons, the removal of his
 afflictions, and the lengthening out of his life till he was ready for 
 death, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39+7-13">ver. 7-13</A>.

 This is a funeral psalm, and very proper for the occasion; in singing 
 it we should get our hearts duly affected with the brevity, 
 uncertainty, and calamitous state of human life; and those on whose 
 comforts God has, by death, made breaches, will find this psalm of 
 great use to them, in order to their obtaining what we ought much to 
 aim at under such an affliction, which is to get it sanctified to us 
 for our spiritual benefit and to get our hearts reconciled to the holy 
 will of God in it.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician, <I>even</I> to Jeduthun. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with
 my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked
 is before me.
 &nbsp; 2 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, <I>even</I> from good;
 and my sorrow was stirred.
 &nbsp; 3 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire
 burned: <I>then</I> spake I with my tongue,
 &nbsp; 4 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days,
 what it <I>is; that</I> I may know how frail I <I>am.</I>
 &nbsp; 5 Behold, thou hast made my days <I>as</I> a handbreadth; and mine
 age <I>is</I> as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best
 state <I>is</I> altogether vanity. Selah.
 &nbsp; 6 Surely every man walketh in a vain show: surely they are
 disquieted in vain: he heapeth up <I>riches,</I> and knoweth not who
 shall gather them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here recollects, and leaves upon record, the workings of his 
 heart under his afflictions; and it is good for us to do so, that what 
 was thought amiss may be amended, and what was well thought of may be 
 improved the next time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He remembered the covenants he had made with God to walk 
 circumspectly, and to be very cautious both of what he did and what he 
 said. When at any time we are tempted to sin, and are in danger of 
 falling into it, we must call to mind the solemn vows we have made 
 against sin, against the particular sin we are upon the brink of. God 
 can, and will, remind us of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:20">Jer. ii. 20</A>,

 <I>Thou saidst, I will not transgress</I>), and therefore we ought to
 remind ourselves of them. So David did here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He remembers that he had resolved, in general, to be very cautious 
 and circumspect in his walking 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>I said, I will take heed to my ways;</I> and it was well said, and
 what he would never unsay and therefore must never gainsay. Note,

 (1.) It is the great concern of every one of us to take heed to our 
 ways, that is, to walk circumspectly, while others walk at all 
 adventures. 

 (2.) We ought stedfastly to resolve that we will take heed to our ways, 
 and frequently to renew that resolution. Fast bind, fast find. 

 (3.) Having resolved to take heed to our ways, we must, upon all 
 occasions, remind ourselves of that resolution, for it is a covenant 
 never to be forgotten, but which we must be always mindful of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He remembers that he had in particular covenanted against
 tongue-sins--that he would not sin with his tongue, that he would not
 speak amiss, either to offend God or <I>offend the generation of the 
 righteous,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:15">Ps. lxxiii. 15</A>.
 
 It is not so easy as we could wish not to sin
 in thought; but, if an evil thought should arise in his mind, he would 
 lay his hand upon his mouth, and suppress it, that it should go no 
 further: and this is so great an attainment that, <I>if any offend not 
 in word, the same is a perfect man;</I> and so needful a one that of 
 him who <I>seems to be religious, but bridles not his tongue,</I> it is 
 declared <I>His religion is vain.</I> David had resolved, 

 (1.) That he would at all times watch against tongue-sins: "<I>I will
 keep a bridle,</I> or muzzle, <I>upon my mouth.</I>" He would keep a 
 bridle upon it, as upon the head; watchfulness in the act and exercise 
 is the hand upon the bridle. He would keep a muzzle upon it, as upon an
 unruly dog that is fierce and does mischief; by particular stedfast 
 resolution corruption is restrained from breaking out at the lips, and 
 so is muzzled. 

 (2.) That he would double his guard against them when there was most 
 danger of scandal--<I>when the wicked is before me.</I> When he was in 
 company with the wicked he would take heed of saying any thing that 
 might harden them or give occasion to them to blaspheme. If good men 
 fall into bad company, they must take heed what they say. Or, <I>when 
 the wicked is before me,</I> in my thoughts. When he was contemplating 
 the pride and power, the prosperity and flourishing estate, of 
 evil-doers, he was tempted to speak amiss; and therefore then he would 
 take special care what he said. Note, The stronger the temptation to a 
 sin is the stronger the resolution must be against it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Pursuant to these covenants he made a shift with much ado to bridle 
 his tongue 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>I was dumb with silence; I held my peace even from good.</I> His
 silence was commendable; and the greater the provocation was the more 
 praiseworthy was his silence. Watchfulness and resolution, in the 
 strength of God's grace, will do more towards the bridling of the 
 tongue than we can imagine, though it be an unruly evil. But what shall 
 we say of his keeping silence <I>even from good?</I> Was it his wisdom 
 that he refrained from good discourse when the wicked were before him, 
 because he would not cast pearls before swine? I rather think it was 
 his weakness; because he might not say any thing, he would say nothing, 
 but ran into an extreme, which was a reproach to the law, for that 
 prescribes a mean between extremes. The same law which forbids all 
 corrupt communication requires <I>that which is good and to the use of 
 edifying,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:29">Eph. iv. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The less he spoke the more he thought and the more warmly. Binding 
 the distempered part did but draw the humour to it: <I>My sorrow was 
 stirred, my heart was hot within me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He could bridle his tongue, but he could not keep his passion under;
 though he suppressed the smoke, that was as a fire in his bones, and, 
 while he was musing upon his afflictions and upon the prosperity of the 
 wicked, the fire burned. Note, Those that are of a fretful discontented 
 spirit ought not to pore much, for, while they suffer their thoughts to 
 dwell upon the causes of the calamity, the fire of their discontent is 
 fed with fuel and burns the more furiously. Impatience is a sin that 
 has its ill cause within ourselves, and that is musing, and its ill 
 effects upon ourselves, and that is no less than burning. If therefore 
 we would prevent the mischief of ungoverned passions, we must redress 
 the grievance of ungoverned thoughts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. When he did speak, at last, it was to the purpose: <I>At the last I 
 spoke with my tongue.</I> Some make what he said to be the breach of 
 his good purpose, and conclude that, in what he said, he sinned with 
 his tongue; and so they make what follows to be a passionate wish 
 <I>that he might die,</I> like Elijah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+19:4">1 Kings xix. 4</A>)
 
 and Job,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:8,9"><I>ch.</I> vi. 8, 9</A>.

 But I rather take it to be, not the breach of his good purpose, but the 
 reformation of his mistake in carrying it too far; he had kept silence 
 from good, but now he would so keep silence no longer. He had nothing 
 to say to the wicked that were before him, for to them he knew not how 
 to place his words, but, after long musing, the first word he said was 
 a prayer, and a devout meditation upon a subject which it will be good 
 for us all to think much of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He prays to God to make him sensible of the shortness and 
 uncertainty of life and the near approach of death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Lord, make me to know my end and the measure of my days.</I> He does
 not mean, "Lord, let me know how long I shall live and when I shall 
 die." We could not, in faith, pray such a prayer; for God has nowhere 
 promised to let us know, but has, in wisdom, locked up that knowledge 
 among the secret things which belong not to us, nor would it be good 
 for us to know it. But, <I>Lord, make me to know my end,</I> means, 
 "Lord, give me wisdom and grace to consider it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:29">Deut. xxxii. 29</A>)

 and to improve what I know concerning it." <I>The living know that they
 shall die</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:5">Eccl. ix. 5</A>),

 but few care for thinking of death; we have therefore need to pray that
 God by his grace would conquer that aversion which is in our corrupt
 hearts to the thoughts of death. "Lord, make me to consider,"

 (1.) "What death is. It is my end, the end of my life, and all the 
 employments and enjoyments of life. It is the end of all men,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:2">Eccl. vii. 2</A>.

 It is a final period to our state of probation and preparation, and an
 awful entrance upon a state of recompence and retribution. To the 
 wicked man it is the end of all joys; to a godly man it is the end of 
 all griefs. "Lord, give me to know my end, to be better acquainted with 
 death, to make it more familiar to me 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+17:14">Job xvii. 14</A>),

 and to be more affected with the greatness of the change. Lord, give me
 to consider what a serious thing it is to die." 

 (2.) "How near it is. Lord, give me to consider the measure of my
 days, that they are measured in the counsel of God" (the end is a fixed 
 end, so the word signifies; <I>my days are determined,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:5">Job xiv. 5</A>)

 "and that the measure is but short: My days will soon be numbered and 
 finished." When we look upon death as a thing at a distance we are 
 tempted to adjourn the necessary preparations for it; but, when we 
 consider how short life is, we shall see ourselves concerned to do what 
 our hand finds to do, not only with all our might, but with all 
 possible expedition. 

 (3.) That it is continually working in us: "Lord, give me to consider 
 how frail I am, how scanty the stock of life is, and how faint the 
 spirits which are as the oil to keep that lamp burning." We find by 
 daily experience that the earthly house of this tabernacle is 
 mouldering and going to decay: "Lord, make us to consider this, that we 
 may secure mansions in the house not made with hands."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He meditates upon the brevity and vanity of life, pleading them with 
 God for relief under the burdens of life, as Job often, and pleading 
 them with himself for his quickening to the business of life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Man's life on earth is short and of no continuance, and that is a 
 reason why we should sit loose to it and prepare for the end of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Behold, thou hast made my days as a hand-breadth,</I> the breadth of
 four fingers, a certain dimension, a small one, and the measure whereof 
 we have always about us, always before our eyes. We need no rod, no 
 pole, no measuring line, wherewith to take the dimension of our days, 
 nor any skill in arithmetic wherewith to compute the number of them. 
 No; we have the standard of them at our fingers' end, and there is no 
 multiplication of it; it is but one hand-breadth in all. Our time is 
 short, and God has made it so; for <I>the number of our months is with 
 him.</I> It is short, and he knows it to be so: It <I>is as nothing 
 before thee.</I> he remembers <I>how short our time is,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:47">lxxxix. 47</A>.

 <I>It is nothing in comparison with thee;</I> so some. All time is
 nothing to God's eternity, much less our share of time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Man's life on earth is vain and of no value, and therefore it is 
 folly to be fond of it and wisdom to make sure of a better life. Adam 
 is Abel--<I>man is vanity,</I> in his present state. He is not what he
 seems to be, has not what he promised himself. He and all his comforts 
 lie at a continual uncertainty; and if there were not another life 
 after this, all things considered, he were made in vain. He is vanity; 
 he is mortal, he is mutable. Observe, 

 [1.] How emphatically this truth is expressed here. <I>First, Every man 
 is vanity,</I> without exception; high and low, rich and poor, all meet 
 in this. <I>Secondly,</I> He is <I>so at his best estate,</I> when he
 is young, and strong, and healthful, in wealth and honour, and the 
 height of prosperity; when he is most easy, and merry, and secure, and 
 thinks his mountain stands strong. <I>Thirdly,</I> He is <I>altogether 
 vanity,</I> as vain as you can imagine. <I>All man is all vanity</I> 
 (so it may be read); every thing about him is uncertain; nothing is 
 substantial and durable but what relates to the new man. <I>Fourthly, 
 Verily</I> he is so. This is a truth of undoubted certainty, but which 
 we are very unwilling to believe and need to have solemnly attested to 
 us, as indeed it is by frequent instances. <I>Fifthly, Selah</I> is
 annexed, as a note commanding observation. "Stop here, and pause 
 awhile, that you may take time to consider and apply this truth, that 
 every man is vanity." We ourselves are so. 

 [2.] For the proof of the vanity of man, as mortal, he here mentions 
 three things, and shows the vanity of each of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 <I>First,</I> The vanity of our joys and honours: <I>Surely every man 
 walks</I> (even when he walks in state, when he walks in pleasure) in a
 shadow, in an image, <I>in a vain show.</I> When he makes a figure his
 fashion passes away, and his great pomp is but great fancy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+25:23">Acts xxv. 23</A>.

 It is but a show, and therefore a vain show, like the rainbow, the 
 gaudy colours of which must needs vanish and disappear quickly when the 
 substratum is but a cloud, a vapour; such is life 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+4:14">Jam. iv. 14</A>),

 and therefore such are all the gaieties of it. <I>Secondly,</I> The
 vanity of our griefs and fears. <I>Surely they are disquieted in
 vain.</I> Our disquietudes are often groundless (we vex ourselves 
 without any just cause, and the occasions of our trouble are often the 
 creatures of our own fancy and imagination), and they are always 
 fruitless; we disquiet ourselves in vain, for we cannot, with all our 
 disquietment, alter the nature of things nor the counsel of God; things 
 will be as they are when we have disquieted ourselves ever so much 
 about them. <I>Thirdly,</I> The vanity of our cares and toils. Man
 takes a great deal of pains to <I>heap up riches,</I> and they are but 
 like heaps of manure in the furrows of the field, good for nothing 
 unless they be spread. But, when he has filled his treasures with his
 trash, he <I>knows not who shall gather them,</I> nor to whom they 
 shall descend when he is gone; for he shall not take them away with 
 him. He asks not, <I>For whom do I labour?</I> and that is his folly, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+4:8">Eccl. iv. 8</A>.

 But, if he did ask, he could not tell whether he should be a wise man
 or a fool, a friend or a foe, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:19">Eccl. ii. 19</A>.

 <I>This is vanity.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist, having meditated on the shortness and uncertainty of 
 life, and the vanity and vexation of spirit that attend all the 
 comforts of life, here, in these verses, turns his eyes and heart
 heaven-ward. When there is no solid satisfaction to be had in the 
 creature it is to be found in God, and in communion with him; and to 
 him we should be driven by our disappointments in the world. David here 
 expresses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His dependence on God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Seeing all is vanity, and man himself is so,

 1. He despairs of a happiness in the things of the world, and disclaims
 all expectations from it: "<I>Now, Lord, what wait I for?</I> Even 
 nothing from the things of sense and time; I have nothing to wish for, 
 nothing to hope for, from this earth." Note, The consideration of the 
 vanity and frailty of human life should deaden our desires to the 
 things of this world and lower our expectations from it. "If the world 
 be such a thing as this, God deliver me from having, or seeking, my 
 portion in it." We cannot reckon upon constant health and prosperity, 
 nor upon comfort in any relation; for it is all as uncertain as our 
 continuance here. "Though I have sometimes foolishly promised myself 
 this and the other from the world, I am now of another mind." 

 2. He takes hold of happiness and satisfaction in God: <I>My hope is in 
 thee.</I> Note, When creature-confidences fail, it is our comfort that 
 we have a God to go to, a God to trust to, and we should thereby be 
 quickened to take so much the faster hold of him by faith.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His submission to God, and his cheerful acquiescence in his holy 
 will, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 If our hope be in God for a happiness in the other world, we may well 
 afford to reconcile ourselves to all the dispensations of his 
 providence concerning us in this world: "<I>I was dumb; I opened not my 
 mouth</I> in a way of complaint and murmuring." He now again recovered 
 that serenity and sedateness of mind which were disturbed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Whatever comforts he is deprived of, whatever crosses he is burdened 
 with, he will be easy. "<I>Because thou didst it;</I> it did not come 
 to pass by chance, but according to thy appointment." We may here see,

 1. A good God doing all, and ordering all events concerning us. Of
 every event we may say, "This is the finger of God; it is the Lord's 
 doing," whoever were the instruments. 

 2. A good man, for that reason, saying nothing against it. He is dumb, 
 he has nothing to object, no question to ask, no dispute to raise upon 
 it. All that God does is well done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His desire towards God, and the prayers he puts up to him. <I>Is 
 any afflicted? let him pray,</I> as David here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. For the pardoning of his sin and the preventing of his shame, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Before he prays 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),
 
 <I>Remove thy stroke from me,</I> he prays
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 "<I>Deliver me from all my offences,</I> from the guilt I have
 contracted, the punishment I have deserved, and the power of corruption 
 by which I have been enslaved." When God forgives our sins he delivers 
 us from them, he delivers us from them all. He pleads, <I>Make me not a 
 reproach to the foolish.</I> Wicked people are foolish people; and they 
 then show their folly most when they think to show their wit, by 
 scoffing at God's people. When David prays that God would pardon his 
 sins, and not make him a reproach, it is to be taken as a prayer for 
 peace of conscience ("Lord, leave me not to the power of melancholy, 
 which the foolish will laugh at me for"), and as a prayer for grace,
 that God would never leave him to himself, so far as to do any thing 
 that might make him a reproach to bad men. Note, This is a good reason 
 why we should both watch and pray against sin, because the credit of 
 our profession is nearly concerned in the preservation of our 
 integrity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. For the removal of his affliction, that he might speedily be eased 
 of his present burdens 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Remove thy stroke away from me.</I> Note, When we are under the
 correcting hand of God our eye must be to God himself, and not to any 
 other, for relief. He only that inflicts the stroke can remove it; and 
 we may then in faith, and with satisfaction, pray that our afflictions 
 may be removed, when our sins are pardoned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+38:17">Isa. xxxviii. 17</A>),

 and when, as here, the affliction is sanctified and has done its work,
 and we are humbled under the hand of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He pleads the great extremity he was reduced to by his affliction, 
 which made him the proper object of God's compassion: <I>I am consumed 
 by the blow of thy hand.</I> His sickness prevailed to such a degree 
 that his spirits failed, his strength was wasted, and his body 
 emaciated. "The blow, or conflict, of thy hand has brought me even to 
 the gates of death." Note, The strongest, and boldest, and best of men 
 cannot bear up under, much less make head against, the power of God's 
 wrath. It was not his case only, but any man will find himself an 
 unequal match for the Almighty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 When God, at any time, contends with us, when with rebukes he corrects 
 us,

 [1.] We cannot impeach the equity of his controversy, but must 
 acknowledge that he is righteous in it; for, whenever he corrects man, 
 it is for iniquity. Our ways and our doings procure the trouble to 
 ourselves, and we are beaten with a rod of our own making. It is the 
 yoke of our transgressions, though it be <I>bound with his hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:14">Lam. i. 14</A>.

 [2.] We cannot oppose the effects of his controversy, but he will be
 too hard for us. As we have nothing to move in arrest of his judgment, 
 so we have no way of escaping the execution. God's rebukes make man's 
 <I>beauty to consume away like a moth;</I> we often see, we sometimes 
 feel, how much the body is weakened and decayed by sickness in a little 
 time; the countenance is changed; where are the ruddy cheek and lip, 
 the sprightly eye, the lively look, the smiling face? It is the reverse 
 of all this that presents itself to view. What a poor thing is beauty; 
 and what fools are those that are proud of it, or in love with it, when 
 it will certainly, and may quickly, be consumed thus! Some make the
 moth to represent man, who is as easily crushed as a moth with the 
 touch of a finger, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:19">Job iv. 19</A>.

 Others make it to represent the divine rebukes, which silently and
 insensibly waste and consume us, as the moth does the garment. All this 
 abundantly proves what he had said before, that surely every man is 
 vanity, weak and helpless; so he will be found when God comes to 
 contend with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He pleads the good impressions made upon him by his affliction. He 
 hoped that the end was accomplished for which it was sent, and that 
 therefore it would be removed in mercy; and unless an affliction has 
 done its work, though it may be removed, it is not removed in mercy. 
 
 [1.] It had set him a weeping, and he hoped God would take notice of
 that. When the Lord God called to mourning, he answered the call and 
 accommodated himself to the dispensation, and therefore could, in 
 faith, pray, <I>Lord, hold not thy peace at my tears,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He that does not willingly afflict and grieve the children of men, much 
 less his own children, will not hold his peace at their tears, but will 
 either speak deliverance for them (and, if he speak, it is done) or in 
 the mean time speak comfort to them and make them to hear joy and 
 gladness.

 [2.] It had set him a praying; and afflictions are sent to stir up 
 prayer. If they have that effect, and when we are afflicted we pray 
 more, and pray better, than before, we may hope that God will hear our 
 prayer and give ear to our cry; for the prayer which by his providence 
 he gives occasion for, and which by his Spirit of grace he indites, 
 shall not return void. 

 [3.] It had helped to wean him from the world and to take his 
 affections off from it. Now he began, more than ever, to look upon 
 himself as <I>a stranger and sojourner</I> here, like all his fathers, 
 not at home in this world, but travelling through it to another, to a 
 better, and would never reckon himself at home till he came to heaven. 
 He pleads it with God: "Lord, take cognizance of me, and of my wants 
 and burdens, for I am a stranger here, and therefore meet with strange 
 usage; I am slighted and oppressed as a stranger; and whence should I 
 expect relief but from thee, from that other country to which I 
 belong?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He prays for a reprieve yet a little longer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>O spare me,</I> ease me, raise me up from this illness that I may
 recover strength both in body and mind, that I may get into a more calm 
 and composed frame of spirit, and may be better prepared for another 
 world, <I>before I go hence</I> by death, <I>and</I> shall <I>be no 
 more</I> in this world." Some make this to be a passionate wish that 
 God would send him help quickly or it would be too late, like that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+10:20,21">Job x. 20, 21</A>.

 But I rather take it as a pious prayer that God would continue him here
 till by his grace he had made him fit to go hence, and that he might 
 finish the work of life before his life was finished. <I>Let my soul
 live, and it shall praise thee.</I></P>
