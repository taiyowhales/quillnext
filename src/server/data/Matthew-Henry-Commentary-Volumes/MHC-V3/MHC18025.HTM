 Bildad here makes a very short reply to Job's last discourse, as one 
 that began to be tired of the cause. He drops the main question 
 concerning the prosperity of wicked men, as being unable to answer the 
 proofs Job had produced in the foregoing chapter: but, because he 
 thought Job had made too bold with the divine majesty in his appeals to 
 the divine tribunal 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:1-17"><I>ch.</I> xxiii.</A>),

 he in a few words shows the infinite distance there is between God and
 man, teaching us, 

 I. To think highly and honourably of God,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+25:2,3,5">ver. 2, 3, 5</A>.

 II. To think meanly of ourselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+25:4,6">ver. 4, 6</A>.

 These, however misapplied to Job, are two good lessons for us all to
 learn.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
 &nbsp; 2  Dominion and fear <I>are</I> with him, he maketh peace in his high
 places.
 &nbsp; 3  Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his
 light arise?
 &nbsp; 4  How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be
 clean <I>that is</I> born of a woman?
 &nbsp; 5  Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars
 are not pure in his sight.
 &nbsp; 6  How much less man, <I>that is</I> a worm? and the son of man,
 <I>which is</I> a worm?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Bildad is to be commended here for two things:--

 1. For speaking no more on the subject about which Job and he differed.
 Perhaps he began to think Job was in the right, and then it was justice 
 to say no more concerning it, as one that contended for truth, not for 
 victory, and therefore, for the finding of truth, would be content to 
 lose the victory; or, if he still thought himself in the right, yet he 
 knew when he had said enough, and would not wrangle endlessly for the 
 last word. Perhaps indeed one reason why he and the rest of them let
 fall this debate was because they perceived that Job and they did not 
 differ so much in opinion as they thought: they owned that wicked 
 people might prosper a while, and Job owned they would be destroyed at 
 last; how little then was the difference! If disputants would 
 understand one another better, perhaps they would find themselves 
 nearer one another than they imagined.

 2. For speaking so well on the matter about which Job and he were
 agreed. If we would all get our hearts filled with awful thoughts of 
 God and humble thoughts of ourselves, we should not be so apt as we are 
 to fall out about matters of doubtful disputation, which are trifling 
 or intricate.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two ways Bildad takes here to exalt God and abase man:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He shows how glorious God is, and thence infers how guilty and 
 impure man is before him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+25:2-4"><I>v.</I> 2-4</A>.
 
 Let us see then,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What great things are here said of God, designed to possess Job with 
 a reverence of him, and to check his reflections upon him and upon his 
 dealings with him: 

 (1.) God is the sovereign Lord of all, and <I>with him is terrible 
 majesty. Dominion and fear are with him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+25:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 He that gave being has an incontestable authority to give laws, and can 
 enforce the laws he gives. He that made all has a right to dispose of 
 all according to his own will, with an absolute sovereignty. Whatever 
 he will do he does, and may do; and none can say unto him, <I>What 
 doest thou?</I> or <I>Why doest thou so?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:35">Dan. iv. 35</A>.

 His having dominion (or being <I>Dominus</I>--<I>Lord</I>) bespeaks him
 both owner and ruler of all the creatures. They are all his, and they 
 are all under his direction and at his disposal. Hence it follows that 
 he is to be feared (that is, reverenced and obeyed), that he is feared 
 by all that know him (the seraphim cover their faces before him), and 
 that, first or last, all will be made to fear him. Men's dominion is 
 often despicable, often despised, but God is always terrible.

 (2.) The glorious inhabitants of the upper world are all perfectly 
 observant of him and entirely acquiesce in his will: <I>He maketh peace 
 in his high places.</I> He enjoys himself in a perfect tranquillity. 
 The holy angels never quarrel with him, nor with one another, but 
 entirely acquiesce in his will, and unanimously execute it without 
 murmuring or disputing. Thus the will of God is done in heaven; and 
 thus we pray that it may be done by us and others on earth. The sun, 
 moon, and stars, keep their courses, and never clash with one another: 
 nay, even in this lower region, which is often disturbed with storms 
 and tempests, yet when God pleases he commands peace, by <I>making the 
 storm a calm,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:29,Ps+65:7">Ps. cvii. 29; lxv. 7</A>.

 Observe, The high places are <I>his</I> high places; for <I>the heaven,
 even the heavens, are the Lord's</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:16">Ps. cxv. 16</A>)

 in a peculiar manner. Peace is God's work; where it is made it is he
 that makes it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:19">Isa. lvii. 19</A>.

 In heaven there is perfect peace; for there is perfect holiness, and
 there is God, who is love.

 (3.) He is a God of irresistible power: <I>Is there any number of his 
 armies?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+25:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The greatness and power of princes are judged of by their armies.

 God is not only himself almighty, but he has numberless numbers of 
 armies at his beck and disposal,--standing armies that are never
 disbanded,--regular troops, and well disciplined, that are never to
 seek, never at a loss, that never mutiny,--veteran troops, that have
 been long in his service,--victorious troops, that never failed of
 success nor were ever foiled. All the creatures are his hosts, angels 
 especially. He is Lord of all, Lord of hosts. He has numberless armies, 
 and yet makes peace. He could make war upon us, but is willing to be at 
 peace with us; and even the heavenly hosts were sent to proclaim 
 <I>peace on earth</I> and <I>good will towards men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:14">Luke ii. 14</A>.

 (4.) His providence extends itself to all: <I>Upon whom does not his
 light arise?</I> The light of the sun is communicated to all parts of 
 the world, and, take the year round, to all equally. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:6">Ps. xix. 6</A>.

 That is a faint resemblance of the universal cognizance and care God
 takes of the whole creation,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:45">Matt. v. 45</A>.

 All are under the light of his knowledge and are naked and open before
 him. All partake of the light of his goodness: it seems especially to 
 be meant of <I>that.</I> He is good to all; the earth is full of his 
 goodness. He is <I>Deus optimus--God, the best of beings,</I> as well 
 as <I>maximus--the greatest:</I> he has power to destroy; but his 
 pleasure is to show mercy. All the creatures live upon his bounty.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What low things are here said of man, and very truly and justly 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+25:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>How then can man be justified with God? Or how can he be clean?</I>
 Man is not only mean, but vile, not only earthly, but filthy; he cannot 
 be justified, he cannot be clean,

 (1.) In comparison with God. Man's righteousness and holiness, at the 
 best, are nothing to God's, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:6">Ps. lxxxix. 6</A>.

 (2.) In debate with God. He that will quarrel with the word and 
 providence of God must unavoidably go by the worst. God will be 
 justified, and then man will be condemned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+51:4,Ro+3:4">Ps. li. 4; Rom. iii. 4</A>.

 There is no error in God's judgment, and therefore there lies no
 exception against it, nor appeal from it.

 (3.) In the sight of God. If God is so great and glorious, how can man, 
 who is guilty and impure, appear before him? Note,

 [1.] Man, by reason of his actual transgressions, is obnoxious to God's 
 justice and cannot in himself be justified before him: he can neither 
 plead <I>Not guilty,</I> nor plead any merit of his own to balance or 
 extenuate his guilt. The scripture has concluded all under sin.

 [2.] Man, by reason of his original corruption, as he is born of a 
 woman, is odious to God's holiness, and cannot be clean in his sight. 
 God sees his impurity, and it is certain that by it he is rendered 
 utterly unfit for communion and fellowship with God in grace here and 
 for the vision and fruition of him in glory hereafter. We have need 
 therefore to be born again of water and of the Holy Ghost, and to be 
 bathed again and again in the blood of Christ, that fountain 
 opened.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He shows how dark and defective even the heavenly bodies are in the 
 sight of God, and in comparison with him, and thence infers how little, 
 and mean, and worthless, man is. 

 1. The lights of heaven, though beauteous creatures, are before God as
 clods of earth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+25:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Behold even to the moon,</I> walking in brightness, and the stars,
 those glorious lamps of heaven, which the heathen were so charmed with 
 the lustre of that they worshipped them--yet, in God's sight, in 
 comparison with him, they shine not, they are not pure; they have no 
 glory, by reason of the glory which excelleth, as a candle, though it 
 burn, yet does not shine when it is set in the clear light of the sun. 
 The glory of God, shining in his providences, eclipses the glory of the 
 brightest creatures, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+24:23">Isa. xxiv. 23</A>.

 <I>The moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of
 hosts shall reign in Mount Sion.</I> The heavenly bodies are often 
 clouded; we plainly see spots in the moon, and, with the help of 
 glasses, may sometimes discern spots upon the sun too: but God sees 
 spots in them that we do not see. How durst Job then so confidently 
 appeal to God, who would discover that amiss in him which he was not 
 aware of in himself?

 2. The children of men, though noble creatures, are before God but as 
 worms of the earth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+25:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 <I>How much less</I> does <I>man</I> shine in honour, how much less is
 he pure in righteousness <I>that is a worm, and the son of man,</I> 
 whoever he be, <I>that is a worm!--a vermin</I> (so some), not only mean
 and despicable, but noxious and detestable; <I>a mite</I> (so others), 
 the smallest animal, which cannot be discerned with the naked eye, but 
 through a magnifying glass. Such a thing is man. 

 (1.) So mean, and little, and inconsiderable, in comparison with God 
 and with the holy angels: so worthless and despicable, having his 
 original in corruption, and hastening to corruption. What little reason 
 has man to be proud, and what great reason to be humble! 

 (2.) So weak and impotent, and so easily crushed, and therefore a very 
 unequal match for Almighty God. Shall man be such a fool as to contend
 with his Maker, who can tread him to pieces more easily than we can a 
 worm? 

 (3.) So sordid and filthy. Man is not pure for he is a worm, hatched in 
 putrefaction, and therefore odious to God. Let us therefore wonder at 
 God's condescension in taking such worms as we are into covenant and 
 communion with himself, especially at the condescension of the Son of 
 God, in emptying himself so far as to say, <I>I am a worm, and no 
 man,</I>
