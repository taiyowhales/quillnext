 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It seems by this, and many other psalms, that even in times of the 
 greatest trouble and distress David never hung his harp upon the 
 willow-trees, never unstrung it or laid it by; but that when his 
 dangers and fears were greatest he was still in tune for singing God's 
 praises. He was in imminent peril when he penned this psalm, at least 
 when he meditated it; yet even then his meditation of God was sweet. 

 I. He complains of the malice of his enemies, and begs mercy for
 himself and justice against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:1,2,5-7">ver. 1, 2, 5-7</A>.

 II. He confides in God, being assured that he took his part, comforting
 himself with this, that therefore he was safe and should be victorious,
 and that while he lived he should praise God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:3,4,8-13">ver. 3, 4, 8-13</A>.

 How pleasantly may a good Christian, in singing this psalm, rejoice in 
 God, and praise him for what he will do, as well as for what he has 
 done.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician upon Jonath-elem-rechokim, 
 <BR>Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Be merciful unto
 me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily
 oppresseth me.
 &nbsp; 2  Mine enemies would daily swallow <I>me</I> up: for <I>they be</I> many
 that fight against me, O thou most High.
 &nbsp; 3  What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
 &nbsp; 4  In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I
 will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
 &nbsp; 5  Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts <I>are</I>
 against me for evil.
 &nbsp; 6  They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they
 mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.
 &nbsp; 7  Shall they escape by iniquity? in <I>thine</I> anger cast down the
 people, O God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, in this psalm, by his faith throws himself into the hands of 
 God, even when he had by his fear and folly thrown himself into the 
 hands of the Philistines; it was when they took him in Gath, whither he 
 fled for fear of Saul, forgetting the quarrel they had with him for 
 killing Goliath; but they soon put him in mind of it,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:10,11">1 Sam. xxi. 10, 11</A>.

 Upon that occasion he changed his behaviour, but with so little ruffle
 to his temper that then he penned both this psalm and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+34:1-22">the 34th</A>. 

 This is called <I>Michtam--a golden psalm.</I> So some other psalms are
 entitled, but this has something peculiar in the title; it is upon 
 <I>Jonath-elem-rechokim,</I> which signifies <I>the silent dove afar 
 off.</I> Some apply this to David himself, who wished for the wings of 
 a dove on which to fly away. He was innocent and inoffensive, mild and 
 patient, as a dove, was at this time driven from his nest, from the 
 sanctuary 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:3">Ps. lxxxiv. 3</A>),

 was forced to wander afar off, to seek for shelter in distant 
 countries; there he was like the doves of the valleys, mourning and 
 melancholy; but silent, neither murmuring against God nor railing at 
 the instruments of his trouble; herein a type of Christ, who was as a 
 sheep, dumb before the shearers, and a pattern to Christians, who, 
 wherever they are and whatever injuries are done them, ought to be as 
 silent doves. In this former part of the psalm,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He complains to God of the malice and wickedness of his enemies, to 
 show what reason he had to fear them, and what cause, what need, there 
 was that God should appear against them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>Be merciful unto me, O God!</I> That petition includes all the good
 we come to the throne of grace for; if we obtain mercy there, we obtain 
 all we can desire, and need no more to make us happy. It implies 
 likewise our best plea, not our merit, but God's mercy, his free rich 
 mercy. He prays that he might find mercy with God, for with men he 
 could find no mercy. When he fled from the cruel hands of Saul he fell 
 into the cruel hands of the Philistines. "Lord" (says he), "be thou 
 merciful to me now, or I am undone." The mercy of God is what we may 
 flee to and trust to, and in faith pray for, when we are surrounded on 
 all sides with difficulties and dangers. He complains,

 1. That his enemies were very numerous 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>They are many that fight against me,</I> and think to overpower me
 with numbers; take notice of this, <I>O thou Most High!</I> and make it 
 to appear that wherein they deal proudly thou art above them." It is a 
 point of honour to come in to the help of one against many. And, if God 
 be on our side, how many soever they are that fight against us, we may, 
 upon good grounds, boast that there are more with us; for (as that 
 great general said) "How many do we reckon him for?"

 2. That they were very barbarous: they would <I>swallow him up,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>
 
 and again

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 They sought to devour him; no less would serve; they came upon him with
 the utmost fury, like beasts of prey, to eat up his flesh,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:2">Ps. xxvii. 2</A>.

 <I>Man</I> would swallow him up, those of his own kind, from whom he 
 might have expected humanity. The ravenous beasts prey not upon those 
 of their own species; yet a bad man would devour a good man if he 
 could. "They are men, weak and frail; make them to know that they are 
 so," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:20">Ps. ix. 20</A>.

 3. That they were very unanimous 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>They gather themselves together;</I> though they were many, and of
 different interests among themselves, yet they united and combined 
 against David, as Herod and Pilate against the Son of David.

 4. That they were very powerful, quite too hard for him if God did not 
 help him: "<I>They fight against me</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>);

 <I>they oppress me,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 I am almost overcome and borne down by them, and reduced to the last
 extremity." 

 5. That they were very subtle and crafty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>They hide themselves;</I> they industriously cover their designs,
 that they may the more effectually prosecute and pursue them. They hide 
 themselves as a lion in his den, that they may mark my steps;" that is, 
 "they observe every thing I say and do with a critical eye, that they 
 may have something to accuse me of" (thus Christ's enemies watched him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+20:20">Luke xx. 20</A>),

 or "they have an eye upon all my motions, that they may gain an
 opportunity to do me a mischief, and may lay their snares for me." 

 6. That they were very spiteful and malicious. They put invidious
 constructions upon every thing he said, though ever so honestly meant 
 and prudently expressed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>They wrest my words,</I> put them upon the rack, to extort that out
 of them which was never in them;" and so they made him an offender for 
 a word

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:21">Isa. xxix. 21</A>),

 misrepresenting it to Saul, and aggravating it, to incense him yet more
 against him. They made it their whole business to ruin David; all
 their thoughts were against him for evil, which put evil 
 interpretations upon all his words. 

 7. That they were very restless and unwearied. They continually waited
 for his soul; it was the life, the precious life, they hunted for; it 
 was his death they longed for,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 They fought daily against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 and would daily swallow him up
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 and every day they wrested his words, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Their malice would not admit the least cessation of arms, or the acts 
 of hostility, but they were continually pushing at him. Such as this is 
 the enmity of Satan and his agents against the kingdom of Christ and 
 the interests of his holy religion, which if we cordially espouse, we 
 must not think it strange to meet with such treatment as this, as 
 though some strange thing happened to us. Our betters have been thus 
 used. So persecuted they the prophets.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He encourages himself in God, and in his promises, power, and 
 providence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>

 In the midst of his complaints, and before he has said what he has to 
 say of his enemies, he triumphs in the divine protection.

 1. He resolves to make God his confidence, then when dangers were most
 threatening and all other confidences failed: "<I>What time I am 
 afraid,</I> in the day of my fear, when I am most terrified from 
 without and most timorous within, then <I>I will trust in thee,</I> and 
 thereby my fears shall be silenced." Note, There are some times which 
 are, in a special manner, times of fear with God's people; in these 
 times it is their duty and interest to trust in God as their God, and 
 to know whom they have trusted. This will fix the heart and keep it in 
 peace. 

 2. He resolves to make God's promises the matter of his praises, and so 
 we have reason to make them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>In God I will praise,</I> not only his work which he has done, but
 <I>his word</I> which he has spoken; I will give him thanks for a 
 promise, though not yet performed. <I>In God</I> (in his strength and
 by his assistance) I will both glory in his word and give him the glory 
 of it." Some understand by <I>his word</I> his providences, every event 
 that he orders and appoints: "When I speak well of God I will with him 
 speak well of every thing that he does."

 3. Thus supported, he will bid defiance to all adverse powers: "<I>When
 in God I have put my trust,</I> I am safe, I am easy, and <I>I will not 
 fear what flesh can do unto me;</I> it is but flesh, and cannot do 
 much; nay, it can do nothing but by divine permission." As we must not 
 trust to an arm of flesh when it is engaged for us, so we must not be 
 afraid of an arm of flesh when it is stretched out against us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He foresees and foretels the fall of those that fought against 
 him, and of all others that think to establish themselves in and by any 
 wicked practices 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Shall they escape by iniquity?</I> They hope to escape God's
 judgments, as they escape men's, by violence and fraud, and the arts of 
 injustice and treachery; but shall they escape? No, certainly they
 shall not. The sin of sinners will never be their security, nor will 
 either their impudence or their hypocrisy bring them off at God's bar; 
 God will in his anger cast down and cast out such people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:3">Rom. ii. 3</A>.
 
 None are raised so high, or settled so firmly, but that the justice of 
 God can bring them down, both from their dignities and from their 
 confidences. <I>Who knows the power of God's anger,</I> how high it can 
 reach, and how forcibly it can strike?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Several things David here comforts himself with in the day of his 
 distress and fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That God took particular notice of all his grievances and all his 
 griefs, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 1. Of all the inconveniences of his state: <I>Thou tellest my
 wanderings,</I> my <I>flittings,</I> so the old translation. David was
 now but a young man (under thirty) and yet he had had many removes, from
 his father's house to the court, thence to the camp, and now driven out
 to sojourn where he could find a place, but not allowed to rest any 
 where; he was hunted like a partridge upon the mountains; continual 
 terrors and toils attended him; but this comforted him, that God kept a 
 particular account of all his motions, and numbered all the weary steps 
 he took, by night or by day. Note, God takes cognizance of all the 
 afflictions of his people; and he does not cast out from his care and 
 love those whom men have cast out from their acquaintance and converse. 

 2. Of all the impressions thus made upon his spirit. When he was 
 wandering he was often weeping, and therefore prays, "<I>Put thou my 
 tears into thy bottle,</I> to be preserved and looked upon; nay, I know 
 they are <I>in thy book,</I> the book of thy remembrance." God has a 
 bottle and a book for his people's tears, both those for their sins and 
 those for their afflictions. This intimates,

 (1.) That he observes them with compassion and tender concern; he is 
 afflicted in their afflictions, and knows their souls in adversity. As 
 the blood of his saints, and their deaths, are precious in the sight of 
 the Lord, so are their tears, not one of them shall fall to the ground.
 <I>I have seen thy tears,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ki+20:5">2 Kings xx. 5</A>.

 <I>I have heard Ephraim bemoaning himself,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:18">Jer. xxxi. 18</A>.

 (2.) That he will remember them and review them, as we do the accounts
 we have booked. Paul was mindful of Timothy's tears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:4">2 Tim. i. 4</A>),

 and God will not forget the sorrows of his people. The tears of God's
 persecuted people are bottled up and sealed among God's treasures; and, 
 when these books come to be opened, they will be found vials of wrath, 
 which will be poured out upon their persecutors, whom God will surely 
 reckon with for all the tears they have forced from his people's eyes; 
 and they will be breasts of consolation to God's mourners, whose 
 sackcloth will be turned into garments of praise. God will comfort his 
 people according to the time wherein he has afflicted them, and give to 
 those to reap in joy who sowed in tears. What was sown a tear will come 
 up a pearl.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That his prayers would be powerful for the defeat and discomfiture 
 of his enemies, as well as for his own support and encouragement 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>When I cry unto thee, then shall my enemies turn back;</I> I need
 no other weapons than prayers and tears; <I>this I know, for God is for 
 me,</I> to plead my cause, to protect and deliver me; and, if God be 
 for me, who can be against me so as to prevail?" The saints have God 
 for them; they may know it; and to him they must cry when they are 
 surrounded with enemies; and, if they do this in faith, they shall find 
 a divine power exerted and engaged for them; their enemies shall be 
 made to turn back, their spiritual enemies, against whom we fight best 
 upon our knees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:18">Eph. vi. 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That his faith in God would set him above the fear of man, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.
 
 Here he repeats, with a strong pathos, what he had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 "<I>In God will I praise his word;</I> that is, I will firmly depend
 upon the promise for the sake of him that made it, who is true and 
 faithful, and has wisdom, power, and goodness enough to make it good." 
 When we give credit to a man's bill we honour him that drew it; so when 
 we do, and suffer, for God, in a dependence upon his promise, not 
 staggering at it, we give glory to God, we praise his word, and so give 
 praise to him. Having thus put his trust in God, he looks with a holy 
 contempt upon the threatening power of man: "<I>In God have I put my 
 trust,</I> and in him only, and therefore <I>I will not be afraid what 
 man can do unto me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 though I know very well what he would do if he could,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 This triumphant word, so expressive of a holy magnanimity, the apostle 
 puts into the mouth of every true believer, whom he makes a Christian 
 hero, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:6">Heb. xiii. 6</A>.

 We may each of us boldly say, <I>The Lord is my helper,</I> and then
 <I>I will not fear what man shall do unto me;</I> for he has no power 
 but what he has given him from above.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That he was in bonds to God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>Thy vows are upon me, O God!</I>--not upon me as a burden which I
 am loaded with, but as a badge which I glory in, as that by which I am 
 known to be thy menial servant--not upon me as fetters that hamper me 
 (such are superstitious vows), but upon me as a bridle that restrains 
 me from what would be hurtful to me, and directs me in the way of my 
 duty. Thy vows are upon me, the vows I have made to thee, to which thou 
 art not only a witness, but a party, and which thou hast commanded and 
 encouraged me to make." It is probably that he means especially those 
 vows which he had made to God in the day of his trouble and distress, 
 which he would retain the remembrance of, and acknowledge the 
 obligations of, when his fright was over. Note, It ought to be the 
 matter of our consideration and joy that <I>the vows of God are upon 
 us</I>--our baptismal vows renewed at the Lord's table, our occasional 
 vows under convictions, under corrections, by these we are bound to 
 live to God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That he should still have more and more occasion to praise him: <I>I 
 will render praises unto thee.</I> This is part of the performance of 
 his vows; for vows of thankfulness properly accompany prayers for 
 mercy, and when the mercy is received must be made good. When we study 
 what we shall render this is the least we can resolve upon, to render 
 praises to God--poor returns for rich receivings! Two things he will
 praise God for:--
 
 1. For what he had done for him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+56:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>Thou has delivered my soul,</I> my life, <I>from death,</I> which
 was just ready to seize me." If God have delivered us from sin, either 
 from the commission of it by preventing grace or from the punishment of 
 it by pardoning mercy, we have reason to own that he has thereby 
 delivered our souls from death, which is the wages of sin. If we, who 
 were by nature dead in sin, are quickened together with Christ, and are 
 made spiritually alive, we have reason to own that God has delivered 
 our souls from death.

 2. For what he would do for him: "<I>Thou hast delivered my soul from 
 death,</I> and so hast given me a new life, and thereby hast given me 
 an earnest of further mercy, that thou wilt <I>deliver my feet from 
 falling;</I> thou hast done the greater, and therefore thou wilt do the 
 less; thou hast begun a good work, and therefore thou wilt carry it on 
 and perfect it." This may be taken either as the matter of his prayer, 
 pleading his experience, or as the matter of his praise, raising his 
 expectations; and those that know how to praise in faith will give God 
 thanks for mercies in promise and prospect, as well as in possession. 
 See here,

 (1.) What David hopes for, that God would deliver his feet from falling 
 either into sin, which would wound his conscience, or into the 
 appearance of sin, from which his enemies would take occasion to wound 
 his good name. Those that think they stand must take heed lest they
 fall, because the best stand no longer than God is pleased to uphold 
 them. We are weak, our way is slippery, many stumbling-blocks are in 
 it, our spiritual enemies are industrious to thrust us down, and 
 therefore we are concerned by faith and prayer to commit ourselves to 
 his care who <I>keeps the feet of his saints.</I> 

 (2.) What he builds this hope upon: "<I>Thou hast delivered my soul 
 from death,</I> and therein hast magnified thy power and goodness, and 
 put me into a capacity of receiving further mercy from thee; and now 
 wilt thou not secure and crown thy own work?" God never brought his 
 people out of Egypt to slay them in the wilderness. He that in
 conversion delivers the soul from so great a death as sin is will not 
 fail <I>to preserve it to his heavenly kingdom.</I> 

 (3.) What he designs in these hopes: <I>That I may walk before God in 
 the light of the living,</I> that is,

 [1.] "That I may get to heaven, the only land of light and life; for in 
 this world darkness and death reign." 

 [2.] "That I may do my duty while this life lasts." Note, This we 
 should aim at, in all our desires and expectations of deliverance both 
 from sin and trouble, that we may do God so much the better 
 service--<I>that, being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we 
 may serve him without fear.</I></P>
