 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is of the same nature and scope with six or seven foregoing 
 psalms; they are all filled with David's complaints of the malice of 
 his enemies and of their cursed and cruel designs against him, his 
 prayers and prophecies against them, and his comfort and confidence in 
 God as his God. The first is the language of nature, and may be 
 allowed; the second of a prophetical spirit, looking forward to Christ 
 and the enemies of his kingdom, and therefore not to be drawn into a 
 precedent; the third of grace and a most holy faith, which ought to be 
 imitated by every one of us. In this psalm, 

 I. He prays to God to defend and deliver him from his enemies,
 representing them as very bad men, barbarous, malicious, and 
 atheistical, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 II. He foresees and foretels the destruction of his enemies, which he
 would give to God the glory of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:8-17">ver. 8-17</A>.

 As far as it appears that any of the particular enemies of God's people
 fall under these characters, we may, in singing this psalm, read their 
 doom and foresee their ruin.</P>

 <CENTER> <P>To the chief musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David, 
 <BR>when Saul sent and they watched the house to kill him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 Deliver me
 from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up
 against me.
 &nbsp; 2  Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from
 bloody men.

 gathered against me; not <I>for</I> my transgression, nor <I>for</I> my
 sin, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 4  They run and prepare themselves without <I>my</I> fault: awake to
 help me, and behold.
 &nbsp; 5  Thou therefore, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake
 to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked
 transgressors. Selah.
 &nbsp; 6  They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go
 round about the city.
 &nbsp; 7  Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords <I>are</I> in
 their lips: for who, <I>say they,</I> doth hear?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The title of this psalm acquaints us particularly with the occasion on 
 which it was penned; it was when Saul sent a party of his guards to 
 beset David's house in the night, that they might seize him and kill 
 him; we have the story 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+19:11">1 Sam. xix. 11</A>.

 It was when his hostilities against David were newly begun, and he had
 but just before narrowly escaped Saul's javelin. These first eruptions 
 of Saul's malice could not but put David into disorder and be both 
 grievous and terrifying, and yet he kept up his communion with God, and 
 such a composure of mind as that he was never out of frame for prayer 
 and praises; happy are those whose intercourse with heaven is not 
 intercepted nor broken in upon by their cares, or griefs, or fears, or 
 any of the hurries (whether outward or inward) of an afflicted state. 
 In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David prays to be delivered out of the hands of his enemies, and 
 that their cruel designs against him might be defeated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>):
 
 "<I>Deliver me from my enemies, O my God!</I> thou art <I>God,</I> and 
 cast deliver me, <I>my</I> God, under whose protection I have put 
 myself; and thou hast promised me to be a God all-sufficient, and 
 therefore, in honour and faithfulness, thou wilt deliver me. Set me on 
 high out of the reach of the power and malice of those that rise up 
 against me, and above the fear of it. Let me be safe, and see myself 
 so, safe and easy, safe and satisfied. O deliver me! and save me." He 
 cries out as one ready to perish, and that had his eye to God only for 
 salvation and deliverance. He prays 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 "<I>Awake to help me,</I> take cognizance of my case, behold that with 
 an eye of pity, and exert thy power for my relief." Thus the disciples, 
 in the storm, awoke Christ, saying, <I>Master, save us, we perish.</I> 
 And thus earnestly should we pray daily to be defended and delivered 
 from our spiritual enemies, the temptations of Satan, and the
 corruptions of our own hearts, which war against our spiritual 
 life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He pleads for deliverance. Our God gives us leave not only to pray, 
 but to plead with him, to order our cause before him and to fill our 
 mouth with arguments, not to move him, but to move ourselves. David 
 does so here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He pleads the bad character of his enemies. They are <I>workers of 
 iniquity,</I> and therefore not only his enemies, but God's enemies; 
 they are <I>bloody men,</I> and therefore not only his enemies, but 
 enemies to all mankind. "Lord, let not the workers of iniquity prevail 
 against one that is a worker of righteousness, nor bloody men against a 
 merciful man."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He pleads their malice against him, and the imminent danger he was 
 in from them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 "Their spite is great; they aim at my soul, my life, my better part.
 They are subtle and very politic: <I>They lie in wait,</I> taking an 
 opportunity to do me a mischief. They are all mighty, men of honour and 
 estates, and interest in court and country.  They are in a confederacy; 
 they are united by league, and actually <I>gathered</I> together 
 <I>against me,</I> combined both in consultation and action. They are 
 very ingenious in their contrivances, and very industrious in the 
 prosecution of them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>They run and prepare themselves,</I> with the utmost speed and fury, 
 to do me a mischief." He takes particular notice of the brutish conduct 
 of the messengers that Saul sent to take him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>They return at evening</I> from the posts assigned them in the day, 
 to apply themselves to their works of darkness (their night-work, which 
 may well be their day-shame), and then <I>they make a noise like a 
 hound</I> in pursuit of the hare." Thus did David's enemies, when they 
 came to take him, raise an out cry against him as a rebel, and traitor, 
 a man not fit to live; with this clamour they went <I>round about the 
 city,</I> to bring a bad reputation upon David, if possible to set the 
 mob against him, at least to prevent their being incensed against them, 
 which otherwise they had reason to fear they would be, so much was 
 David their darling. Thus the persecutors of our Lord Jesus, who are 
 compared to dogs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:16">Ps.  xxii. 16</A>),

 ran him down with noise; for else they could not have taken him, at
 least <I>not on the feast-day, for there would have been an uproar among
 the people. They belch out with their mouth</I> the malice that boils 
 in their hearts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 <I>Swords are in their lips;</I> that is, reproaches that would my
 heart with grief

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:10">Ps.  xlii. 10</A>),

 and slanders that stab and wound my reputation. They were continually 
 suggesting that which drew and whetted Saul's sword against him, and 
 the fault is laid upon the false accusers. The sword perhaps would not 
 have been in Saul's hand if it had not been first in their lips.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He pleads his own innocency, not as to God (he was never backward to 
 own himself guilty before him), but as to his persecutors; what they
 charged him with was utterly false, nor had he ever said or done any 
 thing to deserve such treatment from them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Lord!</I> thou knowest, 
 who knowest all things." And again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 <I>without my fault.</I> Note,

 (1.) The innocency of the godly will not secure them from the malignity 
 of the wicked. Those that are harmless like doves, yet, for Christ's 
 sake, are hated of all men, as if they were noxious like serpents, and 
 obnoxious accordingly. 

 (2.) Though our innocency will not secure us from troubles, yet it will 
 greatly support and comfort us under our troubles. The testimony of our 
 conscience for us that we have behaved ourselves well towards those 
 that behave themselves ill towards us will be very much our rejoicing 
 in the day of evil. 

 (3.) If we are conscious to ourselves of our innocency, we may with 
 humble confidence appeal to God and beg of him to plead our injured 
 cause, which he will do in due time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He pleads that his enemies were profane and atheistical, and 
 bolstered themselves up in their enmity to David, with the contempt of 
 God: <I>For who,</I> say they, <I>doth hear?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.
 
 Not God himself,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:11,94:7">Ps. x. 11; xciv. 7</A>.

 Note, It is not strange if those regard not what they say who have made 
 themselves believe that God regards not what they say.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He refers himself and his cause to the just judgment of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 "The Lord, the Judge, be Judge between me and my persecutors." In this
 appeal to God he has an eye to him as <I>the Lord of hosts,</I> that 
 has power to execute judgment, having all creatures, even hosts of 
 angels, at his command; he views him also as <I>the God of Israel,</I> 
 to whom he was, in a peculiar manner, King and Judge, not doubting that 
 he would appear on the behalf of those that were upright, that were 
 Israelites indeed. When Saul's hosts persecuted him, he had recourse to 
 God as <I>the Lord of all hosts;</I> when those maligned him who in 
 spirit were strangers to the commonwealth of Israel he had recourse to 
 God as <I>the God of Israel.</I> He desires (that is, he is very sure) 
 that God will <I>awake to visit all the nations,</I> will make an early 
 and exact enquiry into the controversies and quarrels that are among 
 the children of men; there will be a day of visitation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+10:3">Isa. x. 3</A>),

 and to that day David refers himself, with this solemn appeal, <I>Be
 not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah--Mark that.</I>

 1. If David had been conscious to himself that he was a wicked
 transgressor, he would not have expected to find mercy; but, as to his 
 enemies, he would say he was no transgressor at all 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>):

 "<I>Not for my transgression,</I> and therefore thou wilt appear for 
 me." As to God, he could say he was no <I>wicked</I> transgressor; for, 
 though he had transgressed, he was a penitent transgressor, and did not 
 obstinately persist in what he had done amiss.

 2. He knew his enemies were wicked transgressors, wilful, malicious, 
 and hardened in their transgressions both against God and man, and 
 therefore he sues for justice against them, judgment without mercy. Let 
 not those expect to find mercy who never showed mercy, for such are 
 wicked transgressors.</P>

 defence, <I>and</I> the God of my mercy.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here encourages himself, in reference to the threatening power of 
 his enemies, with a pious resolution to wait upon God and a believing 
 expectation that he should yet praise him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He resolves to wait upon God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Because of his strength</I>" (either the strength of his enemies, 
 the fear of which drove him to God, or because of God's strength, the 
 hope of which drew him to God) "<I>Will I wait upon thee,</I> with a 
 believing dependence upon thee and confidence in thee." It is our 
 wisdom and duty, in times of danger and difficulty, to wait upon God; 
 for he is our defence, our high place, in whom we shall be safe. He 
 hopes,

 1. That God will be to him a God of mercy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:10"><I>v.</I>  10</A>):

 "<I>The God of my mercy shall prevent me</I> with the blessings of his 
 goodness and the gifts of his mercy, prevent my fears, prevent my 
 prayers, and be better to me than my own expectations." It is very 
 comfortable to us, in prayer, to eye God, not only as the God of mercy, 
 but as the God of our mercy, the author of all good in us and the giver
 of all good to us.  Whatever mercy there is in God, it is laid up for 
 us, and is ready to be laid out upon us.  Justly does the psalmist call 
 God's mercy <I>his mercy,</I> for all the blessings of the new covenant 
 are called <I>the sure mercies of David</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:3">Isa. lv. 3</A>);

 and they are <I>sure to all the seed.</I>

 2.  That he will be to his persecutors a God of vengeance.  His 
 expectation of this he expresses partly by way of prediction and partly 
 by way of petition, which come all to one; for his prayer that it might 
 be so amounts to a prophecy that it shall be so. Here are several 
 things which he foretels concerning his enemies, or observers, that 
 sought occasions against him and opportunity to do him a mischief, in 
 all which he should see his desire, not a passionate or revengeful 
 desire, but a believing desire upon them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 (1.) He foresees that God would expose them to scorn, as they had 
 indeed made themselves ridiculous, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 "They think <I>God does not hear them,</I> does not heed them; <I>but
 thou, O Lord! shalt laugh at them</I> for their folly, to think that he 
 who planted the ear shall not hear, and <I>thou shalt have</I> not them 
 only, but all such other heathenish people that live without God in the 
 world, <I>in derision.</I>" Note, Atheists and persecutors are worthy 
 to be laughed at and had in derision. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:4,Pr+1:26,Isa+37:22">Ps.  ii. 4; 
 Prov. i. 26; Isa. xxxvii. 22</A>.

 (2.) That God would make them standing monuments of his justice 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>Slay them not;</I> let them not be killed outright, <I>lest my 
 people forget.</I> If the execution be soon done, the impressions of it 
 will not be deep, and therefore will not be durable, but will quickly
 wear off. Swift destructions startle men for the present, but they are 
 soon forgotten, for which reason he prays that this might be gradual: 
 "<I>Scatter them by thy power,</I> and let them carry about with them, 
 in their wanderings, such tokens of God's displeasure as may spread the 
 notice of their punishment to all parts of the country." Thus Cain 
 himself, though a murderer, was not slain, lest the vengeance should be 
 forgotten, but was sentenced to be <I>a fugitive and a vagabond.</I> 
 Note, When we think God's judgments come slowly upon sinners we must 
 conclude that God has wise and holy ends in the gradual proceedings of 
 his wrath. "So scatter them as that they may never again unite to do 
 mischief, <I>bring them down, O Lord, our shield!</I>" If God has 
 undertaken the protection of his people as their shield, he will 
 doubtless humble and abase all those that fight against them.

 (3.) That they might be dealt with according to their deserts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>For the sin of their mouth, even for the words of their lips</I> 
 (for every word they speak has sin in it), <I>let them</I> for this 
 <I>be taken in their pride,</I> even for their cursing others and 
 themselves (a sin Saul was subject to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:28">1 Sam. xiv. 28, 44</A>),

 and lying. Note, There is a great deal of malignity in tongue-sins,
 more than is commonly thought of. Note, further, Cursing, and lying, 
 and speaking proudly, are some of the worst of the sins of the tongue; 
 and that man is truly miserable whom God deals with according to the 
 deserts of these, <I>making his own tongue to fall on him.</I> 

 (4.) That God would glorify himself, as Israel's God and King, in their 
 destruction 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>Consume them in wrath, consume them;</I> that is, follow them with 
 one judgment after another, till they be utterly ruined; let them be 
 sensibly, but gradually wasted, that they themselves, while they are in 
 the consuming, may know, and that the standers-by may likewise draw 
 this inference from it, <I>That God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of
 the earth.</I>" Saul and his party think to rule and carry all before 
 them, but they shall be made to know that there is a higher than they, 
 that there is one who does and will overrule them. The design of God's 
 judgments is to convince men that the Lord reigns, that he fulfils his 
 own counsels, gives law to all the creatures, and disposes all things 
 to his own glory, so that the greatest of men are under his check, and 
 he makes what use he pleases of them. He <I>rules in Jacob;</I> for 
 there he keeps his court; there it is known, and his name is great. But 
 he <I>rules to the end of the earth;</I> for all nations are within the 
 territories of his kingdom.  He <I>rules to the ends of the earth,</I> 
 even over those that know him not, but he <I>rules for Jacob</I> (so it 
 may be read); he has an eye to the good of his church in the government 
 of the world; the administrations of that government, even to the ends 
 of the earth, are <I>for Jacob his servant's sake and for Israel's his 
 elect,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:4">Isa.  xlv. 4</A>.

 (5.) That he would make their sin their punishment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>,

 compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:6"><I>v.</I>  6</A>.

 Their sin was their hunting for David to make a prey of him; their
 punishment should be that they should be reduced to such extreme 
 poverty that they should hunt about for meat to satisfy their hunger, 
 and should miss of it as they missed of David. Thus they should be, not 
 cut off at once, but scattered

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 and gradually consumed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);
 
 those that die by famine die by inches, and feel themselves die,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:9">Lam. iv. 9</A>.

 He foretels that they should be forced to beg their bread from door to 
 door.

 [1.] That they should do it with the greatest regret and reluctancy
 imaginable. <I>To beg they are ashamed</I> (which makes it the greater 
 punishment to them), and therefore they do it at evening, when it 
 begins to be dark, that they may not be seen, at the time when other 
 beasts of prey creep forth,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:20">Ps. civ. 20</A>.

 [2.] That yet they should be very clamorous and loud in their 
 complaints, which would proceed from a great indignation at their 
 condition, which they cannot in the least degree reconcile themselves 
 to: <I>They shall make a noise like a dog.</I> When they were in quest 
 of David they made a noise like an angry dog snarling and barking; now, 
 when they are in quest of meat, they shall make a noise like a hungry 
 dog howling and wailing. Those that repent of their sins <I>mourn,</I> 
 when in trouble, <I>like doves;</I> those whose hearts are hardened 
 make a noise, when in trouble, like dogs, <I>like a wild bull in a net, 
 full of the fury of the Lord.</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+7:14">
 Hos. vii. 14</A>, 

 <I>They have not cried unto me with their heart when they howled on
 their beds for corn and wine.</I>

 [3.] That they should meet with little relief, but the hearts of people 
 should be very much hardened towards them, so that they should <I>go 
 round about the city,</I> and <I>wander up and down for meat</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:15"><I>v.</I>  15</A>),

 and should get nothing but by dint of importunity (according to our 
 marginal reading, <I>If they be not satisfied, they will tarry all 
 night</I>), so that what people do give them is not with good-will, but 
 only to get rid of them, lest by their continual coming they weary 
 them.

 [4.] That they should be insatiable, which is the greatest misery of 
 all in a poor condition. <I>They are greedy dogs which can never have 
 enough</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+56:11">Isa. lvi. 11</A>),

 and <I>they grudge if they be not satisfied.</I> A contented man, if he
 has not what he would have, yet does not grudge, does not quarrel with 
 Providence, nor fret within himself; but those whose God is their 
 belly, if that be not filled and its appetites gratified, fall out both 
 with God and themselves. It is not poverty, but discontent, that makes 
 a man unhappy.</P>

 II. He expects to praise God, that God's providence would find him 
 matter for praise and that God's grace would work in him a heart for 
 praise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he would praise God for. 

 (1.) He would praise his power and his mercy; both should be the 
 subject-matter of his song. Power, without mercy, is to be dreaded; 
 mercy, without power, is not what a man can expect much benefit from; 
 but God's power by which he is able to help us, and his mercy by which 
 he is inclined to help us, will justly be the everlasting praise of all 
 the saints. 

 (2.) He would praise him because he had, many a time, and all along, 
 found him his defence and his refuge in the day of trouble.  God brings 
 his people into trouble, that they may experience his power and mercy 
 in protecting and sheltering them, and may have occasion to praise him. 
 
 (3.) He would praise him because he had still a dependence upon him and 
 a confidence in him, as his strength to support him and carry him on in 
 his duty, his defence to keep him safe from evil, and the God of his 
 mercy to make him happy and easy. He that is all this to us is 
 certainly worthy of our best affections, praises, and services.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he would praise God. 

 (1.) He would <I>sing.</I> As that is a natural expression of joy, so 
 it is an instituted ordinance for the exerting and exciting of holy joy 
 and thankfulness. 

 (2.) He would <I>sing aloud,</I> as one much affected with the glory of 
 God, that was not ashamed to own it, and that desired to affect others 
 with it. He will sing of God's power, but he will sing aloud of his 
 mercy; the consideration of that raises his affections more than any 
 thing else.  

 (3.) He would sing aloud <I>in the morning,</I> when his spirits were 
 most fresh and lively. God's compassions are new every morning, and 
 therefore it is fit to begin the day with his praises.  

 (4.) He would <I>sing unto God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 to his honour and glory, and with him in his eye. As we must direct our 
 prayers to God, so to him we must direct our praises, and must look up, 
 making melody to the Lord.</P>
