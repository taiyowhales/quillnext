 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm does so particularly describe the destruction of Jerusalem 
 and the temple, by Nebuchadnezzar and the army of the Chaldeans, and 
 can so ill be applied to any other event we meet with in the Jewish 
 history, that interpreters incline to think that either it was penned 
 by David, or Asaph in David's time, with a prophetical reference to 
 that sad event (which yet is not so probable), or that it was penned by 
 another Asaph, who lived at the time of the captivity, or by Jeremiah 
 (for it is of a piece with his Lamentations,) or some other prophet, 
 and, after the return out of captivity, was delivered to the sons of 
 Asaph, who were called by his name, for the public service of the 
 church. That was the most eminent family of the singers in Ezra's time.
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+2:41,3:10,Ne+11:17,22,12:35,46">Ezra ii. 41; iii. 10; 
 Neh. xi. 17, 22; xii. 35, 46</A>.

 The deplorable case of the people of God at that time is here spread
 before the Lord, and left with him. The prophet, in the name of the 
 church

 I. Puts in complaining pleas of the miseries they suffered, for the
 quickening of their desires in prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:1-11">ver. 1-11</A>.

 II. He puts in comfortable pleas for the encouraging of their faith in
 prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:12-17">ver. 12-17</A>.

 III. He concludes with divers petitions to God for deliverances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:18-23">ver. 18-23</A>.

 In singing it we must be affected with the former desolations of the
 church, for we are members of the same body, and may apply it to any 
 present distresses or desolations of any part of the Christian 
 church.</P>

 <P> Maschil of Asaph.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O God, why hast thou cast <I>us</I> off for
 ever? <I>why</I> doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy
 pasture?
 &nbsp; 2  Remember thy congregation, <I>which</I> thou hast purchased of
 old; the rod of thine inheritance, <I>which</I> thou hast redeemed;
 this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
 &nbsp; 3  Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; <I>even</I> all
 <I>that</I> the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
 &nbsp; 4  Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they
 set up their ensigns <I>for</I> signs.
 &nbsp; 5  <I>A man</I> was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon
 the thick trees.
 &nbsp; 6  But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with
 axes and hammers.
 &nbsp; 7  They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled <I>by
 casting down</I> the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.
 &nbsp; 8  They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they
 have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
 &nbsp; 9  We see not our signs: <I>there is</I> no more any prophet: neither
 <I>is there</I> among us any that knoweth how long.
 &nbsp; 10  O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the
 enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
 &nbsp; 11  Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck
 <I>it</I> out of thy bosom.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is entitled <I>Maschil--a psalm to give instruction,</I> for
 it was penned in a day of affliction, which is intended for 
 instruction; and this instruction in general it gives us, That when we 
 are, upon any account, in distress, it is our wisdom and duty to apply 
 to God by faithful and fervent prayer, and we shall not find it in vain 
 to do so. Three things the people of God here complain of:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The displeasure of God against them, as that which was the cause and 
 bitterness of all their calamities. They look above the instruments of 
 their trouble, who, they knew, could have no power against them unless 
 it were given them from above, and keep their eye upon God, by whose 
 determined counsel they were delivered up into the hands of wicked and 
 unreasonable men. Observe the liberty they take to expostulate with God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 we hope not too great a liberty, for Christ himself, upon the cross, 
 cried out, <I>My God my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</I> So the 
 church here, <I>O God! why hast thou forsaken us for ever?</I> Here 
 they speak according to their present dark and melancholy 
 apprehensions; for otherwise, <I>Has God cast away his people? God
 forbid,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:1">Rom. xi. 1</A>.

 The people of God must not think that because they are cast down they
 are therefore cast off, that because men cast them off therefore God 
 does, and that because he seems to cast them off for a time therefore 
 they are really cast off for ever: yet this expostulation intimates 
 that they dreaded God's casting them off more than any thing, that they 
 desired to be owned of him, whatever they suffered from men, and were 
 desirous to know wherefore he thus contended with them: <I>Why does thy 
 anger smoke?</I> that is, why does it rise up to such a degree that all 
 about us take notice of it, and ask, <I>What means the heat of this
 great anger?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:24">Deut. xxix. 24</A>.

 Compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>,

 where the anger of the Lord and his jealousy are said to smoke against
 sinners. Observe what they plead with God, now that they lay under the 
 tokens and apprehensions of his wrath. 

 1. They plead their relation to him: "We are <I>the sheep of thy
 pasture,</I> the sheep wherewith thou hast been pleased to stock the 
 pasture, thy peculiar people whom thou art pleased to set apart for 
 thyself and design for thy own glory. That the wolves worry the sheep 
 is not strange; but was ever any shepherd thus displeased at his own 
 sheep? <I>Remember,</I> we are <I>thy congregation</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 incorporated by thee and for thee, and devoted to thy praise; we are 
 <I>the rod,</I> or tribe, <I>of thy inheritance,</I> whom thou hast 
 been pleased to claim a special property in above other people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:9">
 Deut. xxxii. 9</A>),

 and from whom thou hast received the rents and issues of praise and
 worship more than from the neighbouring nations. Nay, a man's 
 inheritance may lie at a great distance, but we are pleading for 
 <I>Mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt,</I> which has been the place of 
 thy peculiar delight and residence, thy demesne and mansion." 

 2. They plead the great things God had done for them and the vast
 expense he had been at upon them: "It is <I>thy congregation,</I> which 
 thou hast not only made with a word's speaking, but <I>purchased of 
 old</I> by many miracles of mercy when they were first formed into a 
 people; it is <I>thy inheritance, which thou hast redeemed</I> when 
 they were sold into servitude." God <I>gave Egypt</I> to ruin <I>for 
 their ransom, gave men for them,</I> and <I>people for their life,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:3,4">Isa. xliii. 3, 4</A>.
 
 "Now, Lord, wilt thou now abandon a people that cost thee so dear, and
 has been so dear to thee?" And, if the redemption of Israel out of 
 Egypt was an encouragement to hope that he would not cast them off, 
 much more reason have we to hope that God will not cast off any whom 
 Christ has redeemed with his own blood; but the people of his purchase 
 shall be for ever the people of his praise. 

 3. They plead the calamitous state that they were in

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Lift up thy feet;</I> that is, come with speed to repair the 
 desolations that are made in thy sanctuary, which otherwise will be 
 perpetual an irreparable." It has been sometimes said that the divine 
 vengeance strikes with iron hands, yet it comes with leaden feet; and 
 then those who wait for the day of the Lord, cry, <I>Lord, lift up thy 
 feet; exalt thy steps;</I> magnify thyself in the outgoing of thy 
 providence. When the desolations of the sanctuary have continued long 
 we are tempted to think they will be perpetual; but it is a temptation;
 for God will avenge his own elect, will avenge them speedily, though he 
 bear long with their oppressors and persecutors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They complain of the outrage and cruelty of their enemies, not so 
 much, no, not at all, of what they had done to the prejudice of their 
 secular interests; here are no complaints of the burning of their 
 cities and ravaging of their country, but only what they had done 
 against the sanctuary and the synagogue. The concerns of religion 
 should lie nearer our hearts and affect us more than any worldly 
 concern whatsoever. The desolation of God's house should grieve us more 
 than the desolation of our own houses; for the matter is not great what 
 becomes of us and our families in this world provided God's name may be 
 sanctified, his kingdom may come, and his will be done.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The psalmist complains of the desolations of the sanctuary, as 
 Daniel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:17"><I>ch.</I> ix. 17</A>.

 The temple at Jerusalem was the <I>dwelling-place of God's name,</I>
 and therefore the <I>sanctuary,</I> or <I>holy place,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 In this the enemies did wickedly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 for they destroyed it in downright contempt of God and affront to him.

 (1.) They <I>roared in the midst of God's congregations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 There where God's faithful people attended on him with a humble
 reverent silence, or softly speaking, they roared in a riotous 
 revelling manner, being elated with having made themselves masters of 
 that sanctuary of which they had sometimes heard formidable things. 
 
 (2.) <I>They set up their ensigns for signs.</I> The banners of their 
 army they set up in the temple (Israel's strongest castle, as long as 
 they kept closely to God) as trophies of their victory. There, where 
 the signs of God's presence used to be, now the enemy had set up their 
 ensigns. This daring defiance of God and his power touched his people 
 in a tender part. 

 (3.) They took a pride in destroying <I>the carved work</I> of the 
 temple. As much as formerly men thought it an honour to lend a hand to
 the building of the temple, and he was thought famous that helped to 
 fell timber for that work, so much now they valued themselves upon 
 their agency in destroying it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 Thus, as formerly those were celebrated for wise men that did service
 to religion, so now those are applauded as wits that help to run it 
 down. Some read it thus: <I>They show themselves, as one that lifts up
 axes on high in a thicket of trees,</I> for so do they break down the 
 carved work of the temple they make no more scruple of breaking down 
 the rich wainscot of the temple than woodcutters do of hewing trees in 
 the forest; such indignation have they at the sanctuary that the most 
 curious carving that ever was seen is beaten down by the common 
 soldiers without any regard had to it, either as a dedicated thing or 
 as a piece of exquisite art.

 (4.) They set fire to it, and so violated or <I>destroyed it to the 
 ground,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The Chaldeans burnt the house of God, that stately costly fabric,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+36:19">2 Chron. xxxvi. 19</A>.

 And the Romans <I>left not there one stone upon another</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:2">Matt. xxiv. 2</A>),

 rasing it, rasing it, even to the foundations, till Zion, the holy
 mountain, was, by Titus Vespasian, ploughed as a field.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He complains of the desolations of the synagogues, or schools of the 
 prophets, which, before the captivity, were in use, though much more 
 afterwards. There God's word was read and expounded, and his name 
 praised and called upon, without altars or sacrifices. These also they 
 had a spite to 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Let us destroy them together;</I> not only the temple, but all the 
 places of religious worship and the worshippers with them. <I>Let us 
 destroy them together;</I> let them be consumed in the same flame.
 Pursuant to this impious resolve they <I>burnt up all the synagogues of 
 God in the land</I> and laid them all waste. So great was their rage 
 against religion that the religious houses, because religious, were all 
 levelled with the ground, that God's worshippers might not glorify God, 
 and edify one another, by meeting in solemn assemblies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The great aggravation of all these calamities was that they had no 
 prospect at all of relief, nor could they foresee an end of them 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "We see our enemy's sign set up in the sanctuary, but <I>we see not our 
 signs,</I> none of the tokens of God's presence, no hopeful indications 
 of approaching deliverance. <I>There is no more any prophet</I> to tell 
 us how long the trouble will last and when things concerning us shall 
 have an end, that the hope of an issue at last may support us under our 
 troubles." In the captivity in Babylon they had prophets, and had been 
 told how long the captivity should continue, but the day was cloudy and 
 dark

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+34:12">Ezek. xxxiv. 12</A>),

 and they had not as yet the comfort of these gracious discoveries. God
 spoke once, yea, twice, good words and comfortable words, but they 
 perceived them not. Observe, They do not complain, "We see not our 
 armies; there are no men of war to command our forces, nor any to go 
 forth with our hosts;" but, "no prophets, none to tell us how long." 
 This puts them upon expostulating with God, as delaying, 

 1. To assert his honour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>How long shall the adversary reproach and blaspheme thy name?</I> In 
 the desolations of the sanctuary our chief concern should be for the 
 glory of God, that it may not be injured by the blasphemies of those 
 who persecute his people for his sake, because they are his; and 
 therefore our enquiry should be, not "How long shall we be troubled?" 
 but "How long shall God be blasphemed?" 
 
 2. To exert his power
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):
 
 "<I>Why withdrawest thou thy hand,</I> and dost not stretch it out, to 
 deliver thy people and destroy thy enemies? <I>Pluck it out of thy 
 bosom,</I> and be not <I>as a man astonished, as a mighty man that 
 cannot save,</I> or will not," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+14:9">Jer. xiv. 9</A>.

 When the power of enemies is most threatening it is comfortable to fly
 to the power of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The lamenting church fastens upon something here which she calls to 
 mind, and <I>therefore hath she hope</I> (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:21">Lam. iii. 21</A>),

 with which she encourages herself and silences her own complaints. Two
 things quiet the minds of those that are here sorrowing for the solemn 
 assembly:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That God is the God of Israel, a God in covenant with his people 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>God is my King of old.</I> This comes in both as a plea in prayer to 
 God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+44:4">Ps. xliv. 4</A>,

 <I>thou art my King, O God!</I>) and as a prop to their own faith and
 hope, to encourage themselves to expect deliverance, considering the 
 <I>days of old,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:5">Ps. lxxvii. 5</A>.

 The church speaks as a complex body, the same in every age, and
 therefore calls God, "My King, my King of old," or, "from antiquity;" 
 he of old put himself into that relation to them and appeared and acted 
 for them in that relation. As Israel's King, he wrought salvation in 
 the midst of the nations of the earth; for what he did, in the 
 government of the world, tended towards the salvation of his church. 
 Several things are here mentioned which God had done for his people as 
 their King of old, which encouraged them to commit themselves to him 
 and depend upon him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He had divided the sea before them when they came out of Egypt, not 
 by the strength of Moses or his rod, but by his own strength; and he 
 that could do that could do any thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He had destroyed Pharaoh and the Egyptians. Pharaoh was the 
 <I>leviathan;</I> the Egyptians were <I>the dragons,</I> fierce and 
 cruel. Observe, 

 (1.) The victory obtained over these enemies. God broke their heads, 
 baffled their politics, as when Israel, the more they were afflicted by 
 them, multiplied the more. God crushed their powers, though 
 complicated, ruined their country by ten plagues, and at last drowned 
 them all in the Red Sea. <I>This is Pharaoh and all his multitude,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+31:18">Ezek. xxxi. 18</A>.

 It was the Lord's doing; none besides could do it, and he did it with a
 strong hand and an outstretched arm. This was typical of Christ's 
 victory over Satan and his kingdom, pursuant to the first promise, that 
 the seed of the woman should break the serpent's head. 

 (2.) The improvement of this victory for the encouragement of the 
 church: <I>Thou gavest him to be meat to the people</I> of Israel, now 
 going to <I>inhabit the wilderness.</I> The spoil of the Egyptians 
 enriched them; they stripped their slain, and so got the Egyptians' 
 arms and weapons, as before they had got their jewels. Or, rather, this 
 providence was meat to their faith and hope, to support and encourage 
 them in reference to the other difficulties they were likely to meet 
 with in the wilderness. It was part of the spiritual meat which they
 were all made to eat of. Note, The breaking of the heads of the 
 church's enemies is the joy and strength of the hearts of the church's 
 friends. Thus the companions make a banquet even of leviathan, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:6">Job xli. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. God had both ways altered the course of nature, both in fetching 
 streams out of the rock and turning streams into rock, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 (1.) He had dissolved the rock into waters: <I>Thou didst bring out the 
 fountain and the flood</I> (so some read it); and every one knows 
 whence it was brought, out of the rock, out of the flinty rock. Let 
 this never be forgotten, but let it especially be remembered that the 
 rock was Christ, and the waters out of it were spiritual drink. 

 (2.) He had congealed the waters into rock: <I>Thou driedst up 
 mighty</I> rapid <I>rivers,</I> Jordan particularly at the time when it 
 overflowed all its banks. He that did these things could now deliver 
 his oppressed people, and break the yoke of the oppressors, as he had 
 done formerly; nay, he would do it, for his justice and goodness, his 
 wisdom and truth, are still the same, as well as his power.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the God of Israel is the God of nature, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:16,17"><I>v.</I> 16, 17</A>.

 It is he that orders the regular successions and revolutions, 

 1. Of day and night. He is the Lord of all time. The evening and the
 morning are of his ordaining. It is he that opens the eyelids of the 
 morning light, and draws the curtains of the evening shadow. <I>He has 
 prepared the moon and the sun</I> (so some read it), the two great 
 lights, to rule by day and by night alternately. The preparing of them 
 denotes their constant readiness and exact observance of their time, 
 which they never miss a moment. 

 2. Of summer and winter: "Thou hast <I>appointed all the bounds of the
 earth,</I> and the different climates of its several regions, for 
 <I>thou hast made summer and winter,</I> the frigid and the torrid 
 zones; or, rather, the constant revolutions of the year and its several 
 seasons." Herein we are to acknowledge God, from whom all the laws and 
 powers of nature are derived; but how does this come in here?

 (1.) He that had power at first to settle, and still to preserve, this 
 course of nature by the diurnal and annual motions of the heavenly 
 bodies, has certainly all power both to save and to destroy, and with 
 him nothing is impossible, nor are any difficulties or oppositions 
 insuperable.

 (2.) He that is faithful to his covenant with the day and with the 
 night, and preserves the ordinances of heaven inviolable will certainly 
 make good his promise to his people and never cast off those whom he 
 has chosen, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:36,33:20,21">Jer. xxxi. 35, 36; xxxiii. 20, 21</A>.

 His covenant with Abraham and his seed is as firm as that with Noah and
 his sons,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:21">Gen. viii. 21</A>.

 (3.) Day and night, summer and winter, being counterchanged in the 
 course of nature, throughout all the borders of the earth, we can 
 expect no other than that trouble and peace, prosperity and adversity, 
 should be, in like manner, counterchanged in all the borders of the 
 church. We have as much reason to expect affliction as to expect night 
 and winter. But we have then no more reason to despair of the return of 
 comfort than we have to despair of day and summer.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  Remember this, <I>that</I> the enemy hath reproached, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 <I>that</I> the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
 &nbsp; 19  O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude
 <I>of the wicked:</I> forget not the congregation of thy poor for
 ever.
 &nbsp; 20  Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the
 earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
 &nbsp; 21  O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and
 needy praise thy name.
 &nbsp; 22  Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the
 foolish man reproacheth thee daily.
 &nbsp; 23  Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those
 that rise up against thee increaseth continually.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist here, in the name of the church, most earnestly begs that 
 God would appear for them against their enemies, and put an end to
 their present troubles. To encourage his own faith, he interests God in 
 this matter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Arise, O God! plead thy own cause.</I> This we may be sure he will
 do, for he is jealous for his own honour; whatever is his own cause he 
 will plead it with a strong hand, will appear against those that oppose 
 it and with and for those that cordially espouse it. He will arise and 
 plead it, though for a time he seems to neglect it; he will stir up 
 himself, will manifest himself, will do his own work in his own time. 
 Note, The cause of religion is God's own cause and he will certainly 
 plead it. Now, to make it out that the cause is God's, he pleads,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the persecutors are God's sworn enemies: "Lord, they have not 
 only abused us, but they have been, and are, abusive to thee; what is 
 done against us, for thy sake, does, by consequence, reflect upon thee.
 But that is not all; they have directly and immediately reproached 
 thee, and <I>blasphemed thy name,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 This was that which they roared in the sanctuary; they triumphed as if
 they had now got the mastery of the God of Israel, of whom they had
 heard such great things. As nothing grieves the saints more than to
 hear God's name blasphemed, so nothing encourages them more to hope 
 that God will appear against their enemies than when they have arrived 
 at such a pitch of wickedness as to reproach God himself; this fills 
 the measure of their sins apace and hastens their ruin. The psalmist 
 insists much upon this: "We dare not answer their reproaches; Lord, do 
 thou answer them. Remember that the <I>foolish people have blasphemed 
 thy name</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>)

 and that still <I>the foolish man reproaches thee daily.</I>" Observe 
 the character of those that reproach God; they are foolish. As atheism 
 is folly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:1">Ps. xiv. 1</A>),

 profaneness and blasphemy are no less so. Perhaps those are cried up as
 the wits of the age that ridicule religion and sacred things; but 
 really they are the greatest fools, and will shortly be made to appear 
 so before all the world. And yet see their malice--They reproach God 
 daily, as constantly as his faithful worshippers pray to him and praise 
 him; see their impudence--They do not hide their blasphemous thoughts 
 in their own bosoms, but proclaim them with a loud voice (<I>forget not 
 the voice of thy enemies,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 and this with a daring defiance of divine justice; they <I>rise up
 against thee,</I> and by their blasphemies even wage war with heaven 
 and take up arms against the Almighty. Their noise and <I>tumult ascend 
 continually</I> (so some), as the cry of Sodom came up before God,
 calling for vengeance, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:21">Gen. xviii. 21</A>.

 <I>It increases continually</I> (so we read it); they grow worse and
 worse, and are hardened in their impieties by their successes. Now, 
 Lord, <I>remember this; do not forget it.</I> God needs not to be put 
 in remembrance by us of what he has to do, but thus we must show our 
 concern for his honour and believe that he will vindicate us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the persecuted are his covenant-people. 

 1. See what distress they are in. They have fallen into the hands of 
 <I>the multitude of the wicked,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 <I>How are those increased that trouble them!</I> There is no standing
 before an enraged multitude, especially like these, armed with power; 
 and, as they are numerous, so they are barbarous: <I>The dark places of 
 the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</I> The land of the 
 Chaldeans, where there was none of the light of the knowledge of the 
 true God (though otherwise it was famed for learning and arts), was 
 indeed a dark place; the inhabitants of it were <I>alienated from the 
 life of God through the ignorance that was in them,</I> and therefore 
 they were cruel: where there was no true divinity there was scarcely to 
 be found common humanity. They were especially cruel to the people of 
 God; certainly those have no knowledge who <I>eat them up,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:4">Ps. xiv. 4</A>.

 They are oppressed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>)

 because they are poor and unable to help themselves; they are 
 oppressed, and so impoverished and made poor. 

 2. See what reason they had to hope that God would appear for their
 relief and not suffer them to be always thus trampled upon. Observe how 
 the psalmist pleads with God for them.

 (1.) "It is <I>thy turtle-dove</I> that is ready to be swallowed up by 
 the multitude of the wicked," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The church is a dove for harmlessness and mildness, innocency and
 inoffensiveness, purity and fruitfulness, a dove for mournfulness in a 
 day of distress, a turtle-dove for fidelity and the constancy of love: 
 turtle-doves and pigeons were the only fowls that were offered in 
 sacrifice to God. "Shall thy turtle-dove, that is true to thee and
 devoted to thy honour, be delivered, its life and soul and all, into 
 the <I>hand of the multitude of the wicked,</I> to whom it will soon 
 become an easy and acceptable prey? Lord, it will be thy honour to help 
 the weak, especially to help thy own."

 (2.) "It is <I>the congregation of thy poor,</I> and they are not the 
 less thine for their being poor (for God has <I>chosen the poor of this 
 world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+2:5">Jam. ii. 5</A>),

 but they have the more reason to expect thou wilt appear for them
 because they are many: it is <I>the congregation of thy poor;</I> let 
 them not be abandoned and forgotten for ever."

 (3.) "They are in covenant with thee; and wilt thou not <I>have respect 
 unto the covenant?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Wilt thou not perform the promises thou hast, in thy covenant, made to
 them? Wilt thou not own those whom thou hast brought into the bond of 
 the covenant?" When God delivers his people it is <I>in remembrance of 
 his covenant,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:42">Lev. xxvi. 42</A>.

 "Lord, though we are unworthy to be respected, yet have respect to the
 covenant."

 (4.) "They trust in thee, and boast of their relation to thee and 
 expectations from thee. O let not them return ashamed of their hope 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+74:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>),

 as they will be if they be disappointed."

 (5.) "If thou deliver them, they will praise thy name and give thee the 
 glory of their deliverance. Appear, Lord, for those that will praise 
 thy name, against those that blaspheme it."</P>
