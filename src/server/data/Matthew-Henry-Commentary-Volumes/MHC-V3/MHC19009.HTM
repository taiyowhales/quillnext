 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this psalm, 

 I. David praises God for pleading his cause, and giving him victory
 over his enemies and the enemies of his country 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>),

 and calls upon others to join with him in his songs of praise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:11,12">ver. 11, 12</A>.

 II. He prays to God that he might have still further occasion to praise
 him, for his own deliverances and the confusion of his enemies,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:13,14,19,20">ver. 13, 14, 19, 20</A>.

 III. He triumphs in the assurance he had of God's judging the world

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>),
 
 protecting his oppressed people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:9,10,18">ver. 9, 10, 18</A>),

 and bringing his and their implacable enemies to ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:15-17">ver. 15-17</A>.

 This is very applicable to the kingdom of the Messiah, the enemies of 
 which have been in part destroyed already, and shall be yet more and 
 more till they all be made his footstool, which we are to assure 
 ourselves of, that God may have the glory and we may take the 
 comfort.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician upon Muth-labben. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I will praise <I>thee,</I> O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, with my whole heart; I will show
 forth all thy marvellous works.
 &nbsp; 2  I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy
 name, O thou most High.
 &nbsp; 3  When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish
 at thy presence.
 &nbsp; 4  For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest
 in the throne judging right.
 &nbsp; 5  Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the
 wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
 &nbsp; 6  O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and
 thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
 &nbsp; 7  But the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his
 throne for judgment.
 &nbsp; 8  And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall
 minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
 &nbsp; 9  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in
 times of trouble.
 &nbsp; 10  And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee:
 for thou, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The title of this psalm gives a very uncertain sound concerning the
 occasion of penning it. It is upon <I>Muth-labben,</I> which some make
 to refer to the death of Goliath, others of Nabal, others of Absalom;
 but I incline to think it signifies only some tone, or some musical
 instrument, to which this psalm was intended to be sung; and that the
 enemies David is here triumphing in the defeat of are the Philistines,
 and the other neighbouring nations that opposed his settlement in the
 throne, whom he contested with and subdued in the beginning of his
 reign, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:8">2 Sam. v. 8</A>.

 In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David excites and engages himself to praise God for his mercies and 
 the great things he had of late done for him and his government, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 
 Note,

 1. God expects suitable returns of praise from those for whom
 he has done marvellous works. 

 2. If we would praise God acceptably, we must praise him in sincerity, 
 with our hearts, and not only with our lips, and be lively and fervent 
 in the duty, with our <I>whole heart.</I> 

 3. When we give thanks for some one particular mercy we should take
 occasion thence to remember former mercies and so to <I>show forth all 
 his marvellous works.</I> 

 4.  Holy joy is the life of thankful praise, as thankful praise is the
 language of holy joy: <I>I will be glad and rejoice in thee.</I> 

 5.  Whatever occurs to make us glad, our joy must pass through it, and 
 terminate in God only: <I>I will be glad and rejoice in thee,</I> not 
 in the gift so much as in the giver. 

 6. Joy and praise are properly expressed by singing psalms. 

 7.  When God has shown himself to be above the proud enemies of the
 church we must take occasion thence to give glory to him as the <I>Most 
 High.</I> 

 8. The triumphs of the Redeemer ought to be the triumphs of the 
 redeemed; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:10,19:5,Re+15:3,4">Rev. xii. 10; 
 xix. 5; xv. 3, 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He acknowledges the almighty power of God as that which the 
 strongest and stoutest of his enemies were no way able to contest with 
 or stand before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 But,

 1. They are forced to turn back. Their policy and their courage fail
 them, so that they cannot, they dare not, push forward in their 
 enterprises, but retire with precipitation. 

 2.  When once they turn back, they fall and perish; even their retreat 
 will be their ruin, and they will save themselves no more by flying 
 than by fighting. If Haman begin to fall before Mordecai, he is a lost 
 man, and shall prevail no more; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+6:13">Esther vi. 13</A>.

 3. The presence of the Lord, and the glory of his power, are sufficient
 for the destruction of his and his people's enemies. That is easily 
 done which a man does with his very presence; with <I>that</I> God 
 confounds his enemies, such a presence has he.  This was fulfilled when 
 our Lord Jesus, with one word, <I>I am he,</I> made his enemies to 
 <I>fall back at his presence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+18:6">John xviii. 6</A>)

 and he could, at the same time, have made them perish. 

 4.  When the enemies of God's church are put to confusion we must
 ascribe their discomfiture to the power, not of instruments, but of his 
 presence, and give him all the glory.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He gives to God the glory of his righteousness, in his appearing 
 on his behalf 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast maintained my right and my cause,</I> that is, my 
 righteous cause; when that came on, <I>thou satest in the throne, 
 judging right.</I>" Observe,

 1. God sits in the throne of judgment. To him it belongs to decide 
 controversies, to determine appeals, to avenge the injured, and to 
 punish the injurious; for he has said, <I>Vengeance is mine.</I> 

 2. We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth and that 
 with him there is no unrighteousness. Far be it from God that he should 
 pervert justice. If there seem to us to be some irregularity in the 
 present decisions of Providence, yet these, instead of shaking our 
 belief of God's justice, may serve to strengthen our belief of the 
 judgment to come, which will set all to-rights. 

 3. Whoever disown and desert a just and injured cause, we may be sure
 that the righteous God will maintain it and plead it with jealousy, and 
 will never suffer it to be run down.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He records, with joy, the triumphs of the God of heaven over all
 the powers of hell and attends those triumphs with his praises, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 By three steps the power and justice of God had proceeded against the
 heathen, and wicked people, who were enemies to the king God had lately 
 set up upon his holy hill of Zion. 

 1. He had checked them: "<I>Thou hast rebuked the heathen,</I> hast 
 given them real proofs of thy displeasure against them." This he did 
 before he destroyed them, that they might take warning by the rebukes 
 of Providence and so prevent their own destruction. 

 2. He had cut them off: <I>Thou hast destroyed the wicked.</I> The 
 wicked are marked for destruction, and some are made monuments of God's 
 vindictive justice and destructive power in this world. 

 3. He had buried them in oblivion and perpetual infamy, had put out
 their name for ever, that they should never be remembered with any 
 respect.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He exults over the enemy whom God thus appears against 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Thou hast destroyed cities.</I> Either, "Thou, O enemy! hast
 destroyed our cities, at least in intention and imagination," or "Thou,
 O God! hast destroyed their cities by the desolation brought upon their
 country." It may be taken either way; for the psalmist will have the
 enemy to know,

 1. That their destruction is just and that God was but reckoning with
 them for all the mischief which they had done and designed against his
 people. The malicious and vexatious neighbours of Israel, as the
 Philistines, Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, and Syrians, had made
 incursions upon them (when there was no king in Israel to fight their
 battles), had destroyed their cities and done what they could to make
 their memorial perish with them. But now the wheel was turned upon
 them; their destructions of Israel had come to a perpetual end; they
 shall now cease to spoil and must themselves be spoiled,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:1,2">Isa.  xxxiii. 1</A>.

 2. That it is total and final, such a destruction as should make a
 perpetual end of them, so that the very memorial of their cities should 
 perish with them, So devouring a thing is time, and much more such 
 desolations do the righteous judgments of God make upon sinners, that 
 great and populous cities have been reduced to such ruins that their 
 very memorial has perished, and those who have sought them could not 
 find where they stood; but we look for a city that has stronger 
 foundations.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He comforts himself and others in God, and pleases himself with the 
 thoughts of him. 

 1. With the thoughts of his eternity. On this earth we see nothing 
 durable, even strong cities are buried in rubbish and forgotten; <I>but 
 the Lord shall endure for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 There is no change of his being; his felicity, power, and perfection,
 are out of the reach of all the combined forces of hell and earth; they 
 may put an end to our liberties, our privileges, our lives, but our God 
 is still the same, and sits even upon the floods, unshaken, 
 undisturbed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+29:10,93:2">Ps.  xxix. 10; xciii. 2</A>.

 2. With the thoughts of his sovereignty both in government and
 judgment: <I>He has prepared his throne,</I> has fixed it by his 
 infinite wisdom, has fixed it by his immutable counsel. It is the great 
 support and comfort of good people, when the power of the church's 
 enemies is threatening and the posture of its affairs melancholy and 
 perplexed, that God now rules the world and will shortly judge the 
 world. 

 3. With the thoughts of his justice and righteousness in all the
 administrations of his government. He does all every day, he will do 
 all at the last day, according to the eternal unalterable rules of 
 equity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>He shall judge the world,</I> all persons and all controversies, 
 <I>shall minister judgment to the people</I> (shall determine their lot 
 both in this and in the future state) in righteousness and <I>in 
 uprightness,</I> so that there shall not be the least colour of 
 exception against it.

 4. With the thoughts of that peculiar favour which God bears to his own 
 people and the special protection which he takes them under. The Lord, 
 who endures for ever, is their everlasting strength and protection; he 
 that judges the world will be sure to judge for them, when at any time 
 they are injured or distressed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>He will be a refuge for the oppressed,</I> a high place, a strong 
 place, for the oppressed, <I>in times of trouble.</I> It is the lot of 
 God's people to be oppressed in this world and to have troublous times 
 appointed to them. Perhaps God may not immediately appear for them as 
 their deliverer and avenger; but, in the midst of their distresses, 
 they may by faith flee to him as their refuge and may depend upon his 
 power and promise for their safety, so that no real hurt shall be done 
 them.

 5. With the thoughts of that sweet satisfaction and repose of mind
 which those have that make God their refuge 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>Those that know thy name will put their trust in thee,</I> as I 
 have done" (for the grace of God is the same in all the saints), "and 
 then they will find, as I have found, that thou dost not forsake those 
 that seek thee;" for the favour of God is the same towards all the 
 saints. Note,

 (1.) The better God is known the more he is trusted. Those who know him 
 to be a God of infinite wisdom will trust him <I>further than they can 
 see him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:14">Job xxxv. 14</A>);

 those who know him to be a God of almighty power will trust him when
 creature-confidences fail and they have nothing else to trust to

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:12">2 Chron. xx. 12</A>);

 and those who know him to be a God of infinite grace and goodness will
 trust him <I>though he slay them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:15">Job xiii. 15</A>.

 Those who know him to be a God of inviolable truth and faithfulness
 will rejoice in his word of promise, and rest upon that, though the 
 performance be deferred and intermediate providences seem to contradict 
 it. Those who know him to be the Father of spirits, and an everlasting 
 Father, will trust him with their souls as their main care and trust in 
 him at all times, even to the end. 

 (2.) The more God is trusted the more he is sought unto. If we trust 
 God we shall seek him by faithful and fervent prayer, and by a constant 
 care to approve ourselves to him in the whole course of our 
 conversations. 

 (3.) God never did, nor ever will, disown or desert any that duly seek 
 to him and trust in him.  Though he afflict them, he will not leave 
 them comfortless; though he seem to forsake them for a while, yet he 
 will gather them with everlasting mercies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David, having praised God himself, calls upon and invites others to 
 praise him likewise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Those who believe God is greatly to be praised not only desire to do
 that work better themselves, but desire that others also may join with 
 them in it and would gladly be instrumental to bring them to it: 
 <I>Sing praises to the Lord who dwelleth in Zion.</I> As the special 
 residence of his glory is in heaven, so the special residence of his 
 grace is in his church, of which Zion was a type. There he meets his 
 people with his promises and graces, and there he expects they should 
 meet him with their praises and services. In all our praises we should 
 have an eye to God as dwelling in Zion, in a special manner present in 
 the assemblies of his people, as their protector and patron. He 
 resolved himself to show forth God's marvellous works

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and here he calls upon others to <I>declare among the people his 
 doings.</I> He commands his own subjects to do it, for the honour of 
 God, of their country, and of their holy religion; he courts his 
 neighbours to do it, to sing praises, not, as hitherto, to their false 
 gods, but to Jehovah who dwelleth in Zion, to the God of Israel, and to 
 own among the heathen that <I>the Lord has done great things for his 
 people Israel,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:3,4">Ps. cxxvi. 3, 4</A>.

 Let them particularly take notice of the justice of God in avenging the
 blood of his people Israel on the Philistines and their other wicked 
 neighbours, who had, in making war upon them, used them barbarously and 
 given them no quarter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 When God comes to <I>make inquisition for blood</I> by his judgments on
 earth, before he comes to do it by the judgment of the great day, <I>he 
 remembers them,</I> remembers every drop of the innocent blood which
 they have shed, and will return it sevenfold upon the head of the 
 blood-thirsty; he will give them blood to drink, for they are worthy. 
 This assurance he might well build upon that word

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:43">Deut. xxxii. 43</A>),

 <I>He will avenge the blood of his servants.</I> Note, There is a day
 coming when God will make inquisition for blood, when he will discover 
 what has been shed secretly, and avenge what has been shed unjustly; 
 see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:21,Jer+51:35">Isa. xxvi. 21; Jer. li. 35</A>.

 In that day it will appear how precious the blood of God's people is to
 him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:14">Ps. lxxii. 14</A>),

 when it must all be accounted for. It will then appear that he has not
 forgotten <I>the cry of the humble,</I> neither the cry of their blood 
 nor the cry of their prayers, but that both are sealed up among his 
 treasures.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. David, having praised God for former mercies and deliverances, 
 earnestly prays that God would still appear for him; for he sees not 
 all things put under him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He prays, 

 (1.) That God would be compassionate to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>Have mercy upon me,</I> who, having misery only, and no merit, to 
 speak for me, must depend upon mercy for relief."

 (2.) That he would be concerned for him. He is not particular in his 
 request, lest he should seem to prescribe to God; but submits himself 
 to the wisdom and will of God in this modest request, "<I>Lord, 
 consider my trouble,</I> and do for me as thou thinkest fit."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He pleads, 

 (1.) The malice of his enemies, the trouble which he suffered from 
 those that hated him, and hatred is a cruel passion. 

 (2.) The experience he had had of divine succours and the expectation 
 he now had of the continuance of them, as the necessity of his case 
 required: "<I>O thou that liftest me up,</I> that canst do it, that 
 hast done it, that wilt do it, whose prerogative it is to lift up thy 
 people <I>from the gates of death!</I>" We are never brought so low, so 
 near to death, but God can raise us up. If he has saved us from 
 spiritual and eternal death, we may thence take encouragement to hope 
 that in all our distresses he will be a very present help to us. 

 (3.) His sincere purpose to praise God when his victories should be 
 completed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "Lord, save me, not that I may have the comfort and credit of the 
 deliverance, but that thou mayest have the glory, <I>that I may show 
 forth all thy praise,</I> and that publicly, <I>in the gates of the 
 daughter of Zion;</I>" there God was said to dwell 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>)

 and there David would attend him, with joy in God's salvation, typical 
 of the great salvation which was to be wrought out by the Son of 
 David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. David by faith foresees and foretels the certain ruin of all 
 wicked people, both in this world and in that to come.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In this world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 God executes judgment upon them when the measure of their iniquities is 
 full, and does it,

 (1.) So as to put shame upon them and make their fall inglorious; for 
 they sink into the pit which they themselves digged 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+7:15">Ps.  vii. 15</A>),

 they are taken in the net which they themselves laid for the ensnaring 
 of God's people, and they are snared in the work of their own hands. In 
 all the struggles David had with the Philistines they were the 
 aggressors,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+5:17,22">2 Sam. v. 17, 22</A>.

 And other nations were subdued by those ward in which they embroiled
 themselves. The overruling providence of God frequently so orders it 
 that persecutors and oppressors are brought to ruin by those very 
 projects which they intended to be destructive to the people of God.  
 Drunkards kill themselves; prodigals beggar themselves; the contentious 
 bring mischief upon themselves. Thus men's sins may be read in their 
 punishment, and it becomes visible to all that the destruction of 
 sinners is not only meritoriously, but efficiently, of themselves, 
 which will fill them with the utmost confusion. 

 (2.) So as to get honour to himself: <I>The Lord is known,</I> that is, 
 he makes himself known, by these judgments which he executes. It is 
 known that there is a God who judges in the earth, that he is a 
 righteous God, and one that hates sin and will punish it. In these 
 judgments the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all 
 ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. The psalmist therefore adds 
 here a note extraordinary, commanding special regard, <I>Higgaion;</I> 
 it is a thing to be carefully observed and meditated upon. What we see 
 of present judgments, and what we believe of the judgment to come, 
 ought to be the subject of our frequent and serious meditations.</P>

 2. In the other world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>The wicked shall be turned into hell,</I> as captives into the 
 prison-house, even <I>all the nations that forget God.</I> Note,

 (1.) Forgetfulness of God is the cause of all the wickedness of the 
 wicked. 

 (2.) There are nations of those that forget God, multitudes that live 
 without God in the world, many great and many mighty nations, that 
 never regard him nor desire the knowledge of his ways. 

 (3.) Hell will, at last, be the portion of such, a state of everlasting 
 misery and torment--<I>Sheol,</I> a pit of destruction, in which they 
 and all their comforts will be for ever lost and buried.  Though there 
 be nations of them, yet they shall be turned into hell, like sheep into 
 the slaughter-house 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:14">Ps. xlix. 14</A>),

 and their being so numerous will not be any security or ease to them, 
 nor any loss to God or the least impeachment of his goodness.</P>

 IV. David encourages the people of God to wait for his salvation, 
 though it should be long deferred, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 The needy may think themselves, and others may think them, forgotten
 for a while, and their expectation of help from God may seem to have 
 perished and to have been for ever frustrated. But he that believes 
 does not make haste; the vision is for an appointed time, and at the 
 end it shall speak. We may build upon it as undoubtedly true that God's 
 people, God's elect, shall not always be forgotten, nor shall they be 
 disappointed of their hopes from the promise. God will not only 
 remember them, at last, but will make it to appear that he never did 
 forget them; it is impossible he should, though a woman may forget her 
 sucking child.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He concludes with prayer that God would humble the pride, break the 
 power, and blast the projects, of all the wicked enemies of his church: 
 "<I>Arise, O Lord!</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 stir up thy self, exert thy power, take thy seat, and deal with all 
 these proud and daring enemies of thy name, and cause, and people."

 1. "Lord, restrain them, and set bounds to their malice: <I>Let not man 
 prevail;</I> consult thy own honour, and let not weak and mortal men 
 prevail against the kingdom and interest of the almighty and immortal 
 God. <I>Shall mortal man be too hard for God, too strong for his 
 Maker?</I>" 

 2. "Lord, reckon with them: <I>Let the heathen be judges in thy 
 sight,</I> that is, let them be plainly called to an account for all 
 the dishonour done to thee and the mischief done to thy people." 
 Impenitent sinners will be punished in God's sight; and, when their day 
 of grace is over, the bowels even of infinite mercy will not relent 
 towards them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:10">Rev. xiv. 10</A>.

 3. "Lord, frighten them: <I>Put them in fear, O Lord!</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),
 
 strike a terror upon them, make them afraid with thy judgments." God 
 knows how to make the strongest and stoutest of men to tremble and to 
 flee when none pursues, and thereby he makes them know and own that 
 they are but men; they are but weak men, unable to stand before the 
 holy God--sinful men, the guilt of whose consciences make them subject 
 to alarms. Note, It is a very desirable thing, much for the glory of 
 God and the peace and welfare of the universe, that men should know and 
 consider themselves to be but men, depending creatures, mutable, 
 mortal, and accountable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this psalm we must give to God the glory of his justice in 
 pleading his people's cause against his and their enemies, and 
 encourage ourselves to wait for the year of the redeemed and the year
 of recompences for the controversy of Zion, even the final destruction 
 of all anti-christian powers and factions, to which many of the 
 ancients apply this psalm.</P>
