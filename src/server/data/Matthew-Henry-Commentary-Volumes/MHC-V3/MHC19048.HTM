 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm, as the two former, is a triumphant song; some think it was 
 penned on occasion of Jehoshaphat's victory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:1-30">2 Chron. xx.</A>),

 others of Sennacherib's defeat, when his army laid siege to Jerusalem
 in Hezekiah's time; but, for aught I know, it might be penned by David
 upon occasion of some eminent victory obtained in his time; yet not so
 calculated for that but that it might serve any other similar occasion
 in aftertimes, and be applicable also to the glories of the gospel
 church, of which Jerusalem was a type, especially when it shall come to
 be a church triumphant, the "heavenly Jerusalem" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22">Heb. xii. 22</A>),

 "the Jerusalem which is above,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:26">Gal. iv. 26</A>.

 Jerusalem is here praised, 

 I. For its relation to God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.
 
 II.  For God's care of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:3">ver. 3</A>.
 
 III.  For the terror it strikes upon its enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>.

 IV. For the pleasure it gives to its friends, who delight to think, 

 1.  Of what God has done, does, and will do for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:3">ver.  3</A>.

 2. Of the gracious discoveries he makes of himself in and for that holy 
 city, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:9,10">ver.  9, 10</A>.

 3. Of the effectual provision which is made for its safety, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:11-13">ver.  11-13</A>.
 
 4. Of the assurance we have of the perpetuity of God's covenant with 
 the children of Zion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:14">ver. 14</A>.

 In singing this psalm we must be affected with the privilege we have as
 members of the gospel church, and must express and excite our sincere 
 good-will to all its interests.</P>

 <P>A song <I>and</I> psalm for the sons of Korah.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Great <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and greatly 
 to be praised in the city of our God, <I>in</I> the
 mountain of his holiness.
 &nbsp; 2  Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, <I>is</I>
 mount Zion, <I>on</I> the sides of the north, the city of the great
 King.
 &nbsp; 3  God is known in her palaces for a refuge.
 &nbsp; 4  For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.
 &nbsp; 5  They saw <I>it, and</I> so they marvelled; they were troubled,
 <I>and</I> hasted away.
 &nbsp; 6  Fear took hold upon them there, <I>and</I> pain, as of a woman in

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist is designing to praise Jerusalem and to set forth the 
 grandeur of that city; but he begins with the praises of God and his 
 greatness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and ends with the praises of God and his goodness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:14"><I>v.</I>  14</A>.

 For, whatever is the subject of our praises, God must be both the Alpha 
 and Omega of them. And, particularly, whatever is said to the honour of 
 the church must redound to the honour of the church's God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What is here said to the honour of Jerusalem is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That the King of heaven owns it: it is <I>the city of our God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 which he chose out of all the cities of Israel to put his name there.
 Of Zion he said kinder things than ever he said of place upon earth. 
 <I>This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell, for I have desired 
 it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:13,14">Ps. cxxxii. 13, 14</A>.

 It is <I>the city of the great King</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 the King of all the earth, who is pleased to declare himself in a
 special manner present there. This our Saviour quotes to prove that to 
 swear by Jerusalem is profanely to swear by God himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:35">Matt. v. 35</A>),
 
 <I>for it is the city of the great King,</I> who has chosen it for the
 special residence of his grace, as heaven is of his glory. 

 1. It is enlightened with the knowledge of God. <I>In Judah God is
 known, and his name is great,</I> but especially in Jerusalem, the 
 head-quarters of the priests, whose lips were to keep this knowledge. 
 In Jerusalem <I>God is great</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)

 who in other places was made little of, was made nothing of. Happy the
 kingdom, the city, the family, the heart, in which God is great, in 
 which he is uppermost, in which he is all. There <I>God is known</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 and where he is known he will be great; none contemn God but those that
 are ignorant of him.

 2. It is devoted to the honour of God. It is therefore called <I>the
 mountain of his holiness,</I> for <I>holiness to the Lord</I> is 
 written upon it and all the furniture of it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+14:20">Zech. xiv. 20, 21</A>.

 This is the privilege of the church of Christ, that it is <I>a holy
 nation, a peculiar people;</I> Jerusalem, the type of it, is called 
 <I>the holy city,</I> bad as it was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:53">Matt. xxvii. 53</A>),

 till that was set up, but never after. 

 3. It is the place appointed for the solemn service and worship of God; 
 there he is greatly praised, and <I>greatly to be praised,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Note, The clearer discoveries are made to us of God and his greatness
 the more it is expected that we should abound in his praises. Those 
 that from all parts of the country brought their offerings to Jerusalem 
 had reason to be thankful that God would not only permit them thus to 
 attend him, but promise to accept them, and meet them with a blessing, 
 and reckon himself praised and honoured by their services. Herein 
 Jerusalem typified the gospel church; for what little tribute of praise 
 God has from this earth arises from that church upon earth, which is 
 therefore his tabernacle among men. 

 4. It is taken under his special protection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 He is <I>known for a refuge;</I> that is, he has approved himself such
 a one, and as such a one he is there applied to by his worshippers. 
 Those that know him will <I>trust in him, and seek to him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:10">Ps. ix. 10</A>.

 God was known, not only in the streets, but even in the palaces of
 Jerusalem, for a refuge; the great men had recourse to God and 
 acquaintance with him. And then religion was likely to flourish in the 
 city when it reigned in the palaces. 

 5. Upon all these accounts, Jerusalem, and especially Mount Zion, on
 which the temple was built, were universally beloved and 
 admired--<I>beautiful for situation,</I> and <I>the joy of the whole 
 earth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The situation must needs be every way agreeable, when Infinite Wisdom 
 chose it for the place of the sanctuary; and that which made it 
 beautiful was that it was the mountain of holiness, for there is a 
 beauty in holiness. This earth is, by sin, covered with deformity, and 
 therefore justly might that spot of ground which was thus beautified 
 with holiness he called <I>the joy of the whole earth,</I> that is, 
 what the whole earth had reason to rejoice in, that God would thus in 
 very deed dwell with man upon the earth. Mount Zion was on the north 
 side of Jerusalem, and so was a shelter to the city from the cold and 
 bleak winds that blew from that quarter; or, if fair weather was 
 expected out of the north, they were thus directed to look Zion-ward 
 for it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That the kings of the earth were afraid of it. That God was known 
 in their palaces for a refuge they had had a late instance, and a very 
 remarkable one. Whatever it was, 

 1. They had had but too much occasion to fear their enemies; for <I>the
 kings were assembled,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The neighbouring princes were confederate against Jerusalem; their
 heads and horns, their policies and powers, were combined for its ruin; 
 they were assembled with all their forces; they passed, advanced, and 
 marched on together, not doubting but they should soon make themselves 
 masters of that city which should have been the joy, but was the envy 
 of the whole earth.

 2.  God made their enemies to fear them. The very sight of Jerusalem 
 struck them into a consternation and gave check to their fury, as the 
 sight of the tents of Jacob frightened Balaam from his purpose to curse
 Israel 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:2">Num. xxiv. 2</A>):
 
 <I>They saw it and marvelled, and hasted away,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Not <I>Veni, vidi, vici--I came, I saw, I conquered;</I> but, on the
 contrary, <I>Veni vidi victus sum--I came, I saw, I was defeated.</I> 
 Not that there was any thing to be seen in Jerusalem that was so very 
 formidable; but the sight of it brought to mind what they had heard 
 concerning the special presence of God in that city and the divine 
 protection it was under, and God impressed such terrors on their minds 
 thereby as made them retire with precipitation.  Though they were 
 kings, though they were many in confederacy, yet they knew themselves 
 an unequal match for Omnipotence, and therefore <I>fear came upon them, 
 and pain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Note, God can dispirit the stoutest of his church's enemies, and soon 
 put those in pain that live at ease.  The fright they were in upon the 
 sight of Jerusalem is here compared to the throes of a woman in 
 travail, which are sharp and grievous, which sometimes come suddenly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Th+5:3">1 Thess. v. 3</A>),

 which cannot be avoided, and which are effects of sin and the curse.
 The defeat hereby given to their designs upon Jerusalem is compared to
 the dreadful work made with a fleet of ships by a violent storm, when
 some are split, others shattered, all dispersed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind;</I> effects
 at sea lie thus exposed. The terrors of God are compared to an east 
 wind

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+27:20,21">Job xxvii. 20, 21</A>);

 these shall put them into confusion, and break all their measures.
 <I>Who knows the power of God's anger?</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> of
 hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.
 Selah.
 &nbsp; 9  We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of
 thy temple.
 &nbsp; 10  According to thy name, O God, so <I>is</I> thy praise unto the
 ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.
 &nbsp; 11  Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad,
 because of thy judgments.
 &nbsp; 12  Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers
 thereof.
 &nbsp; 13  Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may
 tell <I>it</I> to the generation following.
 &nbsp; 14  For this God <I>is</I> our God for ever and ever: he will be our
 guide <I>even</I> unto death.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here the good use and improvement which the people of God are 
 taught to make of his late glorious and gracious appearances for them 
 against their enemies, that they might work for their good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let our faith in the word of God be hereby confirmed. If we compare 
 what God has done with what he has spoken, we shall find that, as <I>we 
 have heard,</I> so <I>have we seen</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 and what we have seen obliges us to believe what we have heard.

 1. "As we have heard done in former providences, in the days of old, so 
 have we seen done in our own days." Note, God's latter appearances for 
 his people against his and their enemies are consonant to his former 
 appearances, and should put us in mind of them. 

 2. "As we have heard in the promise and prediction, so have we seen in 
 the performance and accomplishment. We have heard that God is the Lord 
 of hosts, and that Jerusalem is the city of our God, is dear to him, is 
 his particular care; and now we have seen it; we have seen the power of 
 our God; we have seen his goodness; we have seen his care and concern 
 for us, that he is a <I>wall of fire round about Jerusalem and the 
 glory in the midst of her.</I>" Note, In the great things that God has 
 done, and is doing, for his church, it is good to take notice of the 
 fulfilling of the scriptures; and this would help us the better to 
 understand both the providence itself and the scripture that is 
 fulfilled in it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let our hope of the stability and perpetuity of the church be 
 hereby encouraged. "From what we have seen, compared with what we have 
 heard, in the city of our God, we may conclude that God will establish 
 it for ever." This was not fulfilled in Jerusalem (that city was long 
 since destroyed, and all its glory laid in the dust), but has its 
 accomplishment in the gospel church. We are sure that that shall be 
 established for ever; it is built upon a rock, and the gates of hell 
 cannot prevail against it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+16:18">Matt. xvi. 18</A>.

 God himself has undertaken the establishment of it; it is the Lord that
 has founded Zion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:32">Isa. xiv. 32</A>.

 And what we have seen, compared with what we have heard, may encourage 
 us to hope in that promise of God upon which the church is built.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Let our minds be hereby filled with good thoughts of God. "From 
 what we have heard, and seen, and hope for, we may take occasion to 
 think much of God's loving-kindness, whenever we meet <I>in the midst 
 of his temple,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 All the streams of mercy that flow down to us must be traced up to the 
 fountain of God's lovingkindness. It is not owing to any merit of ours, 
 but purely to his mercy, and the peculiar favour he bears to his 
 people. This therefore we must think of with delight, think of 
 frequently and fixedly. What subject can we dwell upon more noble, more 
 pleasant, more profitable? We must have God's lovingkindness always 
 before our eyes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:3">Ps. xxvi. 3</A>),

 especially when we attend upon him in his temple. When we enjoy the
 benefit of public ordinances undisturbed, when we meet in his temple 
 and there is none to make us afraid, we should take occasion thence to 
 think of his lovingkindness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Let us give to God the glory of the great things which he has done 
 for us, and mention them to his honour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>According to thy name, O God! so is thy praise,</I> not only in
 Jerusalem, but to the ends of the earth." By the late signal 
 deliverance of Jerusalem God had made himself a name; that is, he had 
 gloriously discovered his wisdom, power, and goodness, and made all the 
 nations about sensible of it; and <I>so was his praise;</I> that is, 
 some in all parts would be found giving glory to him accordingly. As 
 far as his name goes his praise will go, at least it should go, and, at 
 length, it shall go, when all the ends of the world shall praise him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:27,Re+11:15">Ps. xxii. 27; Rev. xi. 15</A>.

 Some, by his <I>name,</I> understand especially that glorious name of
 his, <I>the Lord of hosts;</I> according to that name, so is his 
 praise; for all the creatures, even to the ends of the earth, are under 
 his command. But his people must, in a special manner, acknowledge his 
 justice in all he does for them.  "<I>Righteousness fills thy right 
 hand;</I>" that is, all the operations of thy power are consonant to 
 the eternal rules of equity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. Let all the members of the church in particular take to themselves 
 the comfort of what God does for his church in general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>Let Mount Zion rejoice,</I> the priests and Levites that attend the
 sanctuary, and then <I>let</I> all <I>the daughters of Judah,</I> the 
 country towns, and the inhabitants of them, be glad: let the women in 
 their songs and dances, as usual on occasion of public joys, celebrate 
 with thankfulness the great salvation which God has wrought for us." 
 Note, When we have given God the praise we may then take the pleasure 
 of the extraordinary deliverances of the church, and <I>be glad because 
 of God's judgments</I> (that is, the operations of his providence), all 
 which we may see wrought in wisdom (therefore called <I>judgments</I>) 
 and working for the good of his church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. Let us diligently observe the instances and evidences of the 
 church's beauty, strength, and safety, and faithfully transmit our 
 observations to those that shall come after us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:12,13"><I>v.</I> 12, 13</A>):

 <I>Walk about Zion.</I> Some think this refers to the ceremony of the
 triumph; let those who are employed in that solemnity walk round the 
 walls (as they did,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+12:31">Neh. xii. 31</A>),

 singing and praising God. In doing this let <I>them tell the towers and 
 mark well the bulwarks,</I>

 1. That they might magnify the late wonderful deliverance God had
 wrought for them.  Let them observe, with wonder, that the towers and 
 bulwarks are all in their full strength and none of them damaged, the 
 palaces in their beauty and none of them blemished; there is not the 
 least damage done to the city by the kings that were assembled against 
 it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Tell this to the generation following,</I> as a wonderful instance
 of God's care of his holy city, that the enemies should not only not 
 ruin or destroy it, but not so much as hurt or deface it.

 2.  That they might fortify themselves against the fear of the like 
 threatening danger another time. And so,

 (1.) We may understand it literally of Jerusalem, and the strong-hold
 of Zion. Let the daughters of Judah see the towers and bulwarks of
 Zion, with a pleasure equal to the terror with which the kings their
 enemies saw them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Jerusalem was generally looked upon as an impregnable place, as
 appears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:12">Lam. iv. 12</A>.

 <I>All the inhabitants of the world would not have believed that an
 enemy should enter the gates of Jerusalem;</I> nor could they have 
 entered if the inhabitants had not sinned away their defence. <I>Set 
 your heart to her bulwarks.</I> This intimates that the principal 
 bulwarks of Zion were not the objects of sense, which they might set 
 their eye upon, but the objects of faith, which they must set their 
 hearts upon. It was well enough fortified indeed both by nature and 
 art; but its bulwarks that were mostly to be relied upon were the 
 special presence of God in it, the beauty of holiness he had put upon 
 it, and the promises he had made concerning it. "Consider Jerusalem's 
 strength, and tell it to the generations to come, that they may do 
 nothing to weaken it, and that, if at any time it be in distress, they 
 may not basely surrender it to the enemy as not tenable." Calvin 
 observes here that when they are directed to transmit to posterity a 
 particular account of the towers, and bulwarks, and palaces of 
 Jerusalem, it is intimated that in process of time they would all be 
 destroyed and remain no longer to be seen; for, otherwise, what need 
 was thee to preserve the description and history of them?  When the 
 disciples were admiring the buildings of the temple their Master told 
 them that in a little time one stone of it should not be <I>left upon 
 another,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:1,2">Matt. xxiv. 1, 2</A>.

 Therefore, 

 (2.) This must certainly be applied to the gospel church, that Mount
 Zion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22">Heb. xii. 22</A>.

 "Consider the towers, and bulwarks, and palaces of that, that you may
 be invited and encouraged to join yourselves to it and embark in it. 
 See it founded on Christ, the rock fortified by the divine power, 
 guarded by him that neither slumbers nor sleeps. See what precious 
 ordinances are its palaces, what precious promises are its bulwarks; 
 tell this to the generation following, that they may with purpose of 
 heart espouse its interests and cleave to it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. Let us triumph in God, and in the assurances we have of his 
 everlasting lovingkindness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+48:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Tell this to the generation following; transmit this truth as a sacred 
 deposit to your posterity, That <I>this God,</I> who has now done such 
 great things for us, <I>is our God for ever and ever;</I> he is 
 constant and unchangeable in his love to us and care for us.

 1. If God be our God, he is ours for ever, not only through all the
 ages of time, but to eternity; for it is the everlasting blessedness of 
 glorified saints that <I>God himself will be with them and will be 
 their God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:3">Rev. xxi. 3</A>.

 2. If he be our God, <I>he will be our guide,</I> our faithful constant 
 guide, to show us our way and to lead us in it; he will be so, <I>even 
 unto death,</I> which will be the period of our way, and will bring us 
 to our rest. He will lead and keep us even to the last. He will be our 
 guide <I>above</I> death (so some); he will so guide us as to set us 
 above the reach of death, so that it shall not be able to do us any 
 real hurt. He will be our guide <I>beyond</I> death (so others); he 
 will conduct us safely to a happiness on the other side death, to a 
 life in which there shall be no more death. If we take the Lord for our 
 God, he will conduct and convey us safely to death, through death, and 
 beyond death--down to death and up again to glory.</P>
