 God proceeds here to show Job what little reason he had to charge him 
 with unkindness who was so compassionate to the inferior creatures and 
 took such a tender care of them, or to boast of himself, and his own 
 good deeds before God, which were nothing to the divine mercies. He 
 shows him also what great reason he had to be humble who knew so little 
 of the nature of the creatures about him and had so little influence 
 upon them, and to submit to that God on whom they all depend. He 
 discourses particularly,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God here shows Job what little acquaintance he had with the untamed 
 creatures that run wild in the deserts and live at large, but are the 
 care of the divine Providence. As,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The <I>wild goats</I> and the <I>hinds.</I> That which is taken
 notice of concerning them is the bringing forth and bringing up of 
 their young ones. For, as every individual is fed, so every species of 
 animals is preserved, by the care of the divine Providence, and, for 
 aught we know, none extinct to this day. Observe here, 

 1. Concerning the production of their young,

 (1.) Man is wholly ignorant of the time when they bring forth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.
 
 Shall we pretend to tell what is in the womb of Providence, or what a
 day will bring forth, who know not the time of the pregnancy of a hind 
 or a wild goat? 

 (2.) Though they bring forth their young with a great deal of 
 difficulty and sorrow, and have no assistance from man, yet, by the 
 good providence of God, their young ones are safely produced, and their 
 sorrows cast out and forgotten, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Some think it is intimated 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+29:9">Ps. xxix. 9</A>)

 that God by thunder helps the hinds in calving. Let it be observed, for
 the comfort of women in labour, that God helps even the hinds to bring 
 forth their young; and shall he not much more succour them, and save 
 them in child-bearing, who are his children in covenant with him?

 2. Concerning the growth of their young, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>They are in good liking;</I> though they are brought forth in 
 sorrow, after their dams have suckled them awhile they shift for 
 themselves in the corn-fields, and are no more burdensome to them, 
 which is an example to children, when they have grown up, not to be 
 always hanging upon their parents and craving from them, but to put 
 forth themselves to get their own livelihood and to requite their 
 parents.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The <I>wild ass,</I> a creature we frequently read of in Scripture, 
 some say untameable. Man is said to be born as the wild ass's colt, so 
 hard to be governed. Two things Providence has allotted to the wild 
 ass:--
 
 1. An unbounded liberty
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Who</I> but God <I>has sent out the wild ass free?</I> He has given 
 a disposition to it, and therefore a dispensation for it. The tame ass 
 is bound to labour; the wild ass has no bonds on him. Note, Freedom 
 from service, and liberty to range at pleasure, are but the privileges 
 of a wild ass. It is a pity that any of the children of men should 
 covet such a liberty, or value themselves on it. It is better to labour 
 and be good for something than ramble and be good for nothing. But if, 
 among men, Providence sets some at liberty and suffers them to live at 
 ease, while others are doomed to servitude, we must not marvel at the 
 matter: it is so among the brute-creatures.

 2. An unenclosed lodging 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Whose house I have made the wilderness,</I> where he has room enough 
 to traverse his ways, and snuff up the wind at his pleasure, as the 
 wild ass is said to do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:24">Jer. ii. 24</A>),

 as if he had to live upon the air, for it is <I>the barren land</I>
 that is <I>his dwelling.</I> Observe, The tame ass, that labours, and 
 is serviceable to man, has his master's crib to go to both for shelter 
 and food, and lives in a fruitful land: but the wild ass, that will 
 have his liberty, must have it in a barren land. He that will not 
 labour, let him not eat. He that will shall eat the labour of his 
 hands, and have also to give to him that needs. Jacob, the shepherd,
 has good red pottage to spare, when Esau, a sportsman, is ready to 
 perish for hunger. A further description of the liberty and livelihood 
 of the wild ass we have,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 (1.) He has no owner, nor will he be in subjection: <I>He scorns the 
 multitude of the city.</I> If they attempt to take him, and in order to 
 that surround him with a multitude, he will soon get clear of them, and 
 <I>the crying of the driver</I> is nothing to him. He laughs at those 
 that live in the tumult and bustle of cities (so bishop Patrick), 
 thinking himself happier in the wilderness; and opinion is the rate of 
 things. 

 (2.) Having no owner, he has no feeder, nor is any provision made for 
 him, but he must shift for himself: <I>The range of the mountains is 
 his pasture,</I> and a bare pasture it is; there he <I>searches after 
 here and there a green thing,</I> as he can find it and pick it up; 
 whereas the labouring asses have green things in plenty, without their 
 searching for them. From the untameableness of this and other creatures 
 we may infer how unfit we are to give law to Providence, who cannot 
 give law even to a wild ass's colt.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The unicorn--<I>rhem,</I> a strong creature 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:22">Num. xxiii. 22</A>),

 a stately proud creature, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+112:10">Ps. cxii. 10</A>.

 He is able to serve, but not willing; and God here challenges Job to
 force him to it. Job expected every thing should be just as he would 
 have it. "Since thou dost pretend" (says God) "to bring every thing
 beneath thy sway, begin with the unicorn, and try thy skill upon him. 
 Now that thy oxen and asses are all gone, try whether he will be 
 willing to serve thee in their stead

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>)

 and whether he will be content with the provision thou usedst to make 
 for them: <I>Will he abide by thy crib?</I> No;"

 1. "Thou canst not tame him, nor <I>bind him with his band,</I> nor set
 him to <I>draw the harrow,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 There are creatures that are willing to serve man, that seem to take a 
 pleasure in serving him, and to have a love for their masters; but 
 there are such as will never be brought to serve him, which is the 
 effect of sin. Man has revolted from his subjection to his Maker, and 
 is therefore justly punished with the revolt of the inferior creatures 
 from their subjection to him; and yet, as an instance of God's 
 good-will to man, there are some that are still serviceable to him. 
 Though the wild bull (which some think is meant here by the unicorn) 
 will not serve him, nor submit to his hand in the furrows, yet there 
 are tame bullocks that will, and other animals that are not <I>fer&aelig; 
 natur&aelig;--of a wild nature,</I> in whom man may have a property, 
 for whom he provides, and to whose service he is entitled. <I>Lord,
 what is man, that thou art thus mindful of him?</I>

 2. "Thou darest not trust him; though <I>his strength is great,</I> yet 
 thou wilt not <I>leave thy labour to him,</I> as thou dost with thy 
 asses or oxen, which a little child may lead or drive, leaving to them 
 all the pains. Thou wilt never depend upon the wild bull, as likely to 
 come to thy harvest-work, much less to go through it, to <I>bring home 
 thy seed and gather it into thy barn,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 And, because he will not serve about the corn, he is not so well fed as 
 the tame ox, whose mouth was not to be muzzled in treading out the 
 corn; but <I>therefore</I> he will not draw the plough, because he that 
 made him never designed him for it. A disposition to labour is as much 
 the gift of God as an ability for it; and it is a great mercy if, where 
 God gives strength for service, he gives a heart; it is what we should 
 pray for, and reason ourselves into, which the brutes cannot do; for, 
 as among beasts, so among men, those may justly be reckoned wild and 
 abandoned to the deserts who have no mind either to take pains or to do 
 good.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  <I>Gavest thou</I> the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings
 and feathers unto the ostrich?
 &nbsp; 14  Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in
 dust,
 &nbsp; 15  And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the
 wild beast may break them.
 &nbsp; 16  She is hardened against her young ones, as though <I>they
 were</I> not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;
 &nbsp; 17  Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he
 imparted to her understanding.
 &nbsp; 18  What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the
 horse and his rider.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The ostrich is a wonderful animal, a very large bird, but it never 
 flies. Some have called it <I>a winged camel.</I> God here gives an 
 account of it, and observes,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Something that it has in common with the peacock, that is, beautiful 
 feathers 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:13">(<I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Gavest thou proud wings unto the peacocks?</I> so some read it. Fine 
 feathers make proud birds. The peacock is an emblem of pride; when he 
 struts, and shows his fine feathers, Solomon in all his glory is not 
 arrayed like him. The ostrich too has goodly feathers, and yet is a 
 foolish bird; for wisdom does not always go along with beauty and 
 gaiety. Other birds do not envy the peacock or the ostrich their gaudy 
 colours, nor complain for want of them; why then should we repine if we 
 see others wear better clothes than we can afford to wear? God gives
 his gifts variously, and those gifts are not always the most valuable 
 that make the finest show. Who would not rather have the voice of the 
 nightingale than the tail of the peacock, the eye of the eagle and her 
 soaring wing, and the natural affection of the stork, than the 
 beautiful wings and feathers of the ostrich, which can never rise above 
 the earth, and is without natural affection?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Something that is peculiar to itself,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Carelessness of her young. It is well that this is peculiar to 
 herself, for it is a very bad character. Observe, 

 (1.) How she exposes her eggs; she does not retire to some private 
 place, and make a nest there, as the sparrows and swallows do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:3">Ps. lxxxiv. 3</A>),

 and there lay eggs and hatch her young. Most birds, as well as other
 animals, are strangely guided by natural instinct in providing for the 
 preservation of their young. But the ostrich is a monster in nature, 
 for she drops her eggs any where upon the ground and takes no care to 
 hatch them. If the sand and the sun will hatch them, well and good; 
 they may for her, for she will not warm them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Nay, she takes no care to preserve them: <I>The foot</I> of the 
 traveller <I>may crush them,</I> and <I>the wild beast break them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 But how then are any young ones brought forth, and whence is it that 
 the species has not perished? We must suppose either that God, by a
 special providence, with the heat of the sun and the sand (so some 
 think), hatches the neglected eggs of the ostrich, as he feeds the 
 neglected young ones of the raven, or that, though the ostrich 
 <I>often</I> leaves her eggs thus, yet not <I>always.</I>

 (2.) The reason why she does thus expose her eggs. It is,

 [1.] For want of natural affection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>She is hardened against her young ones.</I> To be hardened against 
 any is unamiable, even in a brute-creature, much more in a rational 
 creature that boasts of humanity, especially to be hardened against 
 young ones, that cannot help themselves and therefore merit compassion, 
 that give no provocation and therefore merit no hard usage: but it is 
 worst of all for her to be hardened against her own young ones, as 
 though they were not hers, whereas really they are parts of herself. 
 Her labour in laying her eggs is in vain and all lost, because she has 
 not that fear and tender concern for them that she should have. Those 
 are most likely to lose their labour that are least in fear of losing 
 it.

 [2.] For want of wisdom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>God has deprived her of wisdom.</I> This intimates that the art 
 which other animals have to nourish and preserve their young is God's 
 gift, and that, where it exists not, God denies it, that by the folly 
 of the ostrich, as well as by the wisdom of the ant, we may learn to be 
 wise; for, <I>First,</I> As careless as the ostrich is of her eggs so 
 careless many people are of their own souls; they make no provision for 
 them, no proper nest in which they may be safe, leave them exposed to 
 Satan and his temptations, which is a certain evidence that they are 
 deprived of wisdom. <I>Secondly,</I> So careless are many parents of 
 their children; some of their bodies, not providing for their own 
 house, their own bowels, and therefore worse than infidels, and as bad 
 as the ostrich; but many more are thus careless of their children's 
 souls, take no care of their education, send them abroad into the world 
 untaught, unarmed, forgetting what corruption there is in the world 
 through lust, which will certainly crush them. Thus their labour in 
 rearing them comes to be in vain; it were better for their country that 
 they had never been born. <I>Thirdly,</I> So careless are too many
 ministers of their people, with whom they should reside; but they leave 
 them in the earth, and forget how busy Satan is to sow tares while men 
 sleep. They overlook those whom they should oversee, and are really 
 hardened against them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Care of herself. She leaves her eggs in danger, but, if she herself 
 be in danger, no creature shall strive more to get out of the way of it 
 than the ostrich, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Then she lifts up her wings on high (the strength of which then stands 
 her in better stead than their beauty), and, with the help of them, 
 runs so fast that a horseman at full speed cannot overtake her: <I>She 
 scorneth the horse and his rider.</I> Those that are least under the 
 law of natural affection often contend most for the law of 
 self-preservation. Let not the rider be proud of the swiftness of his 
 horse when such an animal as the ostrich shall out-run him.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God, having displayed his own power in those creatures that are strong 
 and despise man, here shows it in one scarcely inferior to any of them 
 in strength, and yet very tame and serviceable to man, and that is the 
 horse, especially <I>the horse that is prepared against the day of 
 battle</I> and is serviceable to man at a time when he has more than 
 ordinary occasion for his service. It seems, there was, in Job's 
 country, a noble generous breed of horses. Job, it is probable, kept 
 many, though they are not mentioned among his possessions, cattle for 
 use in husbandry being there valued more than those for state and war, 
 which alone horses were then reserved for, and they were not then put 
 to such mean services as with us they are commonly put to. Concerning
 the great horse, that stately beast, it is here observed, 

 1. That he has a great deal of strength and spirit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>Hast thou given the horse strength?</I> He uses his strength for 
 man, but has it not from him: God gave it to him, who is the fountain 
 of all the powers of nature, and yet he himself <I>delights not in the 
 strength of the horse</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:10">Ps. cxlvii. 10</A>),

 but has told us that <I>a horse is a vain thing for safety,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+33:17">Ps. xxxiii. 17</A>.

 For running, drawing, and carrying, no creature that is ordinarily in
 the service of man has so much strength as the horse has, nor is of so 
 stout and bold a spirit, not to be made afraid as a grasshopper, but 
 daring and forward to face danger. It is a mercy to man to have such a 
 servant, which, though very strong, submits to the management of a 
 child, and rebels not against his owner. But let not the strength of a 
 horse be trusted to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:3,Ps+20:7,Isa+31:1,3">Hos. xiv. 3; 
 Ps. xx. 7; Isa. xxxi. 1, 3</A>.

 2. That his neck and nostrils look great. His neck is <I>clothed with
 thunder,</I> with a large and flowing mane, which makes him formidable 
 and is an ornament to him. <I>The glory of his nostrils,</I> when he 
 snorts, flings up his head, and throws foam about, <I>is terrible,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Perhaps there might be at that time, and in that country, a more 
 stately breed of horses than any we have now.

 3. That he is very fierce and furious in battle, and charges with an
 undaunted courage, though he pushes on in imminent danger of his life.

 (1.) See how frolicsome he is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>He paws in the valley,</I> scarcely knowing what ground he stands
 upon. He is proud of his strength, and he has much more reason to be so 
 as using his strength in the service of man, and under his direction, 
 than the wild ass that uses it in contempt of man, and in a revolt from 
 him 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 (2.) See how forward he is to engage: <I>He goes on to meet the armed 
 men,</I> animated, not by the goodness of the cause, or the prospect of 
 honour, but only by <I>the sound of the trumpet, the thunder of the 
 captains, and the shouting</I> of the soldiers, which are as bellows to 
 the fire of his innate courage, and make him spring forward with the 
 utmost eagerness, as if he cried, <I>Ha! ha!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 How wonderfully are the brute-creatures fitted for and inclined to the 
 services for which they were designed.

 (3.) See how fearless he is, how he despises death and the most 
 threatening dangers, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>He mocks at fear,</I> and makes a jest of it; slash at him with a 
 sword, rattle the quiver, brandish the spear, to drive him back, he 
 will not retreat, but press forward, and even inspires courage into his 
 rider.

 (4.) See how furious he is. He curvets and prances, and runs on with so 
 much violence and heat against the enemy that one would think he even 
 <I>swallowed the ground with fierceness and rage,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 High mettle is the praise of a horse rather than of a man, whom 
 fierceness and rage ill become. This description of the war-horse will
 help to explain that character which is given of presumptuous sinners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:6">Jer. viii. 6</A>.

 <I>Every one turneth to his course, as the horse rusheth into the
 battle.</I> When a man's heart is fully set in him to do evil, and he 
 is carried on in a wicked way by the violence of inordinate appetites 
 and passions, there is no making him afraid of the wrath of God and the 
 fatal consequences of sin. Let his own conscience set before him the 
 curse of the law, the death that is the wages of sin, and all the 
 terrors of the Almighty in battle-array; he mocks at this fear, and is 
 not affrighted, neither turns he back from the flaming sword of the 
 cherubim. Let ministers lift up their voice like a trumpet, to proclaim 
 the wrath of God against him, <I>he believes not that it is the sound 
 of the trumpet,</I> nor that God and his heralds are in earnest with 
 him; but what will be in the end hereof it is easy to foresee.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The birds of the air are proofs of the wonderful power and providences 
 of God, as well as the beasts of the earth; God here refers 
 particularly to two stately ones:--

 1. The <I>hawk,</I> a noble bird of great strength and sagacity, and
 yet a bird of prey,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 This bird is here taken notice of for her flight, which is swift and 
 strong, and especially for the course she steers <I>towards the 
 south,</I> whither she follows the sun in winter, out of the colder 
 countries in the north, especially when she is to cast her plumes and 
 renew them. This is her wisdom, and it was God that gave her this 
 wisdom, not man. Perhaps the extraordinary wisdom of the hawk's flight
 after her prey was not used then for men's diversion and recreation, as 
 it has been since. It is a pity that the reclaimed hawk, which is
 taught to fly at man's command and to make him sport, should at any 
 time be abused to the dishonour of God, since it is from God that she 
 receives that wisdom which makes her flight entertaining and 
 serviceable.

 2. The <I>eagle,</I> a royal bird, and yet a bird of prey too, the 
 permission of which, nay, the giving of power to which, may help to 
 reconcile us to the prosperity of oppressors among men. The eagle is 
 here taken notice of,

 (1.) For the height of her flight. No bird soars so high, has so strong 
 a wind, nor can so well bear the light of the sun. Now, "<I>Doth she 
 mount at thy command?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 Is it by any strength she has from thee? or dost thou direct her 
 flight? No; it is by the natural power and instinct God has given her 
 that she will soar out of thy sight, much more out of thy call."

 (2.) For the strength of her nest. Her house is her castle and
 strong-hold; she makes it <I>on high</I> and <I>on the rock, the crag 
 of the rock</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>),

 which sets her and her young out of the reach of danger. Secure sinners 
 think themselves as safe in their sins as the eagle in her nest on 
 high, in the <I>clefts of the rock; but I will bring thee down thence, 
 saith the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+49:16">Jer. xlix. 16</A>.

 The higher bad men sit above the resentments of the earth the nearer
 they ought to think themselves to the vengeance of Heaven.

 (3.) For her quicksightedness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 <I>Her eyes behold afar off,</I> not upwards, but downwards, in quest 
 of her prey. In this she is an emblem of a hypocrite, who, while, in 
 the profession of religion, he seems to rise towards heaven, keeps his 
 eye and heart upon the prey on earth, some temporal advantage, some 
 widow's house or other that he hopes to devour, under pretence of 
 devotion.

 (4.) For the way she has of maintaining herself and her young. She 
 preys upon living animals, which she seizes and tears to pieces, and 
 thence carries to her young ones, which are taught to <I>suck up 
 blood;</I> they do it by instinct, and know no better; but for men that 
 have reason and conscience to thirst after blood is what could scarcely 
 be believed if there had not been in every age wretched instances of 
 it. She also preys upon the dead bodies of men: <I>Where the slain are, 
 there is she,</I> These birds of prey (in another sense than the horse, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>)

 <I>smell the battle afar off.</I> Therefore, when a great slaughter is 
 to be made among the enemies of the church, the fowls are invited to 
 <I>the supper of the great God, to eat the flesh of kings and 
 captains,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:17,18">Rev. xix. 17, 18</A>.

 Our Saviour refers to this instinct of the eagle,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:28">Matt. xxiv. 28</A>.

 <I>Wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered
 together.</I> Every creature will make towards that which is its proper 
 food; for he that provides the creatures their food has implanted in 
 them that inclination. These and many such instances of natural power 
 and sagacity in the inferior creatures, which we cannot account for, 
 oblige us to confess our own weakness and ignorance and to give glory 
 to God as the fountain of all being, power, wisdom, and perfection.</P>
