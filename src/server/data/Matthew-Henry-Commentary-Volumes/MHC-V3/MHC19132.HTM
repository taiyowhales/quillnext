 <HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=50>
 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is probable that this psalm was penned by Solomon, to be sung at the 
 dedication of the temple which he built according to the charge his 
 father gave him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+28:2-21">1 Chron. xxviii. 2</A>,

 &c. Having fulfilled his trust, he begs of God to own what he had done.

 I. He had built this house for the honour and service of God; and when
 he brings the ark into it, the token of God's presence, he desires that 
 God himself would come and take possession of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:8-10">ver. 8-10</A>.

 With these words Solomon concluded his prayer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+6:41,42">2 Chron. vi. 41, 42</A>.

 II. He had built it in pursuance of the orders he had received from his
 father, and therefore his pleas to enforce these petitions refer to 
 David. 

 1. He pleads David's piety towards God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:1-7">ver. 1-7</A>.

 2. He pleads God's promise to David, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:11-18">ver. 11-18</A>.

 The former introduces his petition: the latter follows it as an answer 
 to it. In singing this psalm we must have a concern for the gospel 
 church as the temple of God, and a dependence upon Christ as David our 
 King, in whom the mercies of God are sure mercies.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have Solomon's address to God for his favour to him 
 and to his government, and his acceptance of his building a house to 
 God's name.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What he pleads--two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That what he had done was in pursuance of the pious vow which his 
 father David had made to build a house for God. Solomon was a wise man, 
 yet pleads not any merit of his own: "I am not worthy, for whom thou 
 shouldst do this; but, <I>Lord, remember David,</I> with whom thou 
 madest the covenant" (as Moses prayed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:13">Exod. xxxii. 13</A>,

 <I>Remember Abraham,</I> the first trustee of the covenant); "remember 
 <I>all his afflictions,</I> all the troubles of his life, which his 
 being anointed was the occasion of," or his care and concern about the 
 ark, and what an uneasiness it was to him that the ark was in curtains, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+7:2">2 Sam. vii. 2</A>.

 <I>Remember all his humility and meekness</I> (so some read it), all 
 that pious and devout affection with which he had made the following 
 vow. Note, It is not amiss for us to put God in mind of our 
 predecessors in profession, of their afflictions, their services, and 
 their sufferings, of God's covenant with them, the experiences they 
 have had of his goodness, the care they took of, and the many prayers 
 they put up for, those that should come after them. We may apply it to 
 Christ, the Son of David, and to all his afflictions: "Lord, remember 
 the covenant made with him and the satisfaction made by him.  
 <I>Remember all his offerings</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:3">Ps. xx. 3</A>),

 that is, all his sufferings." He especially pleads the solemn vow that 
 David had made as soon as ever he was settled in his government, and 
 before he was well settled in a house of his own, that he would build a 
 house for God.  Observe, 

 (1.) Whom he bound himself to, <I>to the Lord, to the mighty God of 
 Jacob.</I> Vows are to be made to God, who is a party as well as a 
 witness. The Lord is the Mighty One of Jacob, Jacob's God, and a mighty 
 one, whose power is engaged for Jacob's defence and deliverance.  Jacob 
 is weak, but the God of Jacob is a mighty one. 

 (2.) What he bound himself to do, to <I>find out a place for the 
 Lord,</I> that is, for the ark, the token of his presence. He had 
 observed in the law frequent mention of the <I>place that God would 
 choose to put his name there,</I> to which all the tribes should 
 resort. When he came to the crown there was no such place; Shiloh was 
 deserted, and no other place was pitched upon, for want of which the 
 feasts of the Lord were not kept with due solemnity. "Well," says 
 David, "I will find out such a place for the general rendezvous of all 
 the tribes, a place of <I>habitation for the Mighty</I> One <I>of 
 Jacob,</I> a place for the ark, where there shall be room both for the 
 priests and people to attend upon it." 

 (3.) How intent he was upon it; he would not settle in his bed, till he 
 had brought this matter to some head, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 The thing had been long talked of, and nothing done, till at last
 David, when he went out one morning about public business, made a vow 
 that before night he would come to a resolution in this matter, and 
 would determine the place either where the tent should be pitched for 
 the reception of the ark, at the beginning of his reign, or rather 
 where Solomon should build the temple, which was not fixed till the 
 latter end of his reign, just after the pestilence with which he was 
 punished for numbering the people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+22:1">1 Chron. xxii. 1</A>,

 <I>Then David said, This is the house of the Lord</I>); and perhaps it 
 was upon occasion of that judgment that he made this vow, being 
 apprehensive that one of God's controversies with him was for his 
 dilatoriness in this matter.  Note, When needful work is to be done for 
 God it is good for us to task ourselves, and tie ourselves to a time, 
 because we are apt to put off.  It is good in the morning to cut out 
 work for the day, binding ourselves that we will do it before we sleep, 
 only with submission to Providence; for we <I>know not what a day may 
 bring forth.</I> Especially in the great work of conversion to God we 
 must be thus solicitous, thus zealous; we have good reason to resolve 
 that we will not enjoy the comforts of this life till we have laid a 
 foundation for hopes of a better.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That it was in pursuance of the expectations of the people of 
 Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 (1.) They were inquisitive after the ark; for they lamented its 
 obscurity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+7:2">1 Sam. vii. 2</A>.

 They <I>heard of it at Ephratah</I> (that is, at Shiloh, in the tribe 
 of Ephraim); there they were told it had been, but it was gone. They 
 <I>found it,</I> at last, <I>in the fields of the wood,</I> that is, in 
 Kirjath-jearim, which signifies <I>the city of woods.</I> Thence all 
 Israel fetched it, with great solemnity, in the beginning of David's 
 reign 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:6">1 Chron. xiii. 6</A>),

 so that in building his house for the ark Solomon had gratified all 
 Israel. They needed not to go about to seek the ark anymore; they now 
 knew where to find it. 

 (2.) They were resolved to attend it: "Let us but have a convenient 
 place, and <I>we will go into his tabernacle,</I> to pay our homage 
 there; <I>we will worship at his footstool</I> as subjects and 
 suppliants, which we neglected to do, for want of such a place, <I>in 
 the days of Saul,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+13:3">1 Chron.  xiii. 3</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What he prays for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:8-10"><I>v.</I> 8-10</A>.

 1. That God would vouchsafe, not only to take possession of, but to
 take up his residence in, this temple which he had built: <I>Arise, O 
 Lord! into thy rest,</I> and let this be it, <I>thou,</I> even <I>the 
 ark of thy strength,</I> the pledge of thy presence, thy mighty 
 presence. 

 2. That God would give grace to the ministers of the sanctuary to do 
 their duty: <I>Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness;</I> let 
 them appear righteous both in their administrations and in their 
 conversations, and let both be according to the rule. Note, 
 Righteousness is the best ornament of a minister.  Holiness towards 
 God, and goodness towards all men, are habits for ministers of the 
 necessity of which there is no dispute. "They are <I>thy priests,</I> 
 and will therefore discredit their relation to thee if they <I>be not 
 clothed with righteousness.</I>" 

 3. That the people of God might have the comfort of the due 
 administration of holy ordinances among them: <I>Let thy saints shout 
 for joy.</I> They did so when the ark was brought into the city of 
 David

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:15">2 Sam. vi. 15</A>);

 they will do so when the priests are clothed with righteousness. A 
 faithful ministry is the joy of the saints; it is the matter of it; it 
 is a friend and a furtherance to it; we are <I>helpers of your joy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:24">2 Cor. i. 24</A>.

 4. That Solomon's own prayer, upon occasion of the dedicating of the 
 temple, might be accepted of God: "<I>Turn not away the face of thy 
 anointed,</I> that is, deny me not the things I have asked of thee, 
 send me not away ashamed." He pleads, 

 (1.) That he was the anointed of the Lord, and this he pleads as a type 
 of Christ, the great anointed, who, in his intercession, urges his 
 designation to his office. He is God's anointed, and therefore the 
 Father hears him always. 

 (2.) That he was the son of David: "For his sake do not deny me;" and 
 this is the Christian's plea: "For the sake of Christ" (our David), 
 "<I>in whom thou art well pleased,</I> accept me." He is David, whose 
 name signifies <I>beloved;</I> and we are made accepted in the beloved. 
 He is God's servant, whom he <I>upholds,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1">Isa. xlii. 1</A>.

 "We have no merit of our own to plead, but for his sake, in whom there 
 is a fulness of merit, let us find favour." When we pray for the 
 prosperity of the church we may pray with great boldness, for Christ's 
 sake, who purchased the church with his own blood. "Let both ministers 
 and people do their duty."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These are precious promises, <I>confirmed by an oath,</I> that the 
 heirs of them might have <I>strong consolation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:17,18">Heb. vi. 17, 18</A>.

 It is all one whether we take them as pleas urged in the prayer or as 
 answers returned to the prayer; believers know how to make use of the 
 promises both ways, with them to speak to God and in them to hear what 
 God the Lord will speak to us. These promises relate to the 
 establishment both in church and state, both to the throne of the house 
 of David and to the testimony of Israel fixed on Mount Zion. The 
 promises concerning Zion's hill are as applicable to the gospel-church 
 as these concerning David's seed are to Christ, and therefore both 
 pleadable by us and very comfortable to us. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The choice God made of David's house and Zion hill. Both were of 
 divine appointment.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God chose David's family for the royal family and confirmed his 
 choice by an oath, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 David, being a type of Christ, was made king with an oath: <I>The Lord
 hath sworn and will not repent,</I> will not turn from it. Did David 
 swear to the Lord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 that he would find him a house? The Lord swore to David that he would 
 build him a house; for God will be behind with none of his people in 
 affections or assurances. The promise made to David refers,

 (1.) To a long succession of kings that should descend from his loins: 
 <I>Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne,</I> which was 
 fulfilled in Solomon; David himself lived to see it with great 
 satisfaction,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:48">1 Kings i. 48</A>.

 The crown was also entailed conditionally upon his heirs for ever:
 <I>If thy children,</I> in following ages, <I>will keep my covenant and 
 my testimony that I shall teach them.</I> God himself engaged to teach 
 them, and he did his part; they had Moses and the prophets, and all he 
 expects is that they should keep what he taught them, and keep to it, 
 and then <I>their children shall sit upon thy throne for evermore.</I> 
 Kings are before God upon their good behaviour, and their commission 
 from him runs <I>quamdiu se bene gesserint--during good behaviour.</I> 
 The issue of this was that they did not keep God's covenant, and so the 
 entail was at length cut off, and <I>the sceptre departed from 
 Judah</I> by degrees. 

 (2.) To an everlasting successor, a king that should descend from his 
 loins of <I>the increase of whose government and peace there shall be 
 no end.</I> St. Peter applies this to Christ, nay, he tells us that 
 David himself so understood it.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:30">Acts ii. 30</A>,

 <I>He knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of 
 his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on 
 his throne;</I> and in the fulness of time he did so, and <I>gave him 
 the throne of his father David,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:32">Luke i. 32</A>.

 He did fulfill the condition of the promise; he kept God's covenant and 
 his testimony, did his Father's will, and in all things pleased him; 
 and therefore to him, and his spiritual seed, the promise shall be made 
 good. He, and the children God has given him, all believers, shall 
 <I>sit upon the throne for evermore,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:21">Rev.  iii. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God chose Zion hill for the holy hill, and confirmed his choice by 
 the delight he took in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:13,14"><I>v.</I> 13, 14</A>.

 He <I>chose the Mount Zion which he loved</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:68">Ps. lxxviii. 68</A>);

 he chose it for the habitation of his ark, and said of it, <I>This is 
 my rest for ever,</I> and not merely my residence for a time, as Shiloh 
 was. Zion was the city of David; he chose it for the royal city because 
 God chose it for the holy city. God said, <I>Here will I dwell,</I> and 
 therefore David said, <I>Here will I dwell,</I> for here he adhered to 
 his principle, <I>It is good for me to be near to God.</I> Zion must be 
 here looked upon as a type of the gospel-church, which is called 
 <I>Mount Zion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22">Heb. xii. 22</A>),

 and in it what is here said of Zion has its full accomplishment.  Zion 
 was long since ploughed as a field, but the church of Christ <I>is the 
 house of the living God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:15">1 Tim. iii. 15</A>),

 and it is his <I>rest for ever,</I> and shall be blessed with his 
 presence always, even to the end of the world. The delight God takes in 
 his church, and the continuance of his presence with his church, are 
 the comfort and joy of all its members.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The choice blessings God has in store for David's house and Zion 
 hill. Whom God chooses he will bless.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God, having chosen Zion hill, promises to bless that,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) With the blessings of the life that now is; for godliness has the 
 promise of them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The earth shall yield her increase; where religion is set up there
 shall be provision, and in blessing God will bless it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+67:6">Ps. lxvii. 6</A>);

 he will surely and abundantly bless it. And a little provision, with an 
 abundant blessing upon it, will be more serviceable, as well as more 
 comfortable, than a great deal without that blessing. God's people have 
 a special blessing upon common enjoyments, and that blessing puts a 
 peculiar sweetness into them. Nay, the promise goes further: <I>I will 
 satisfy her poor with bread.</I> Zion has her own poor to keep; and it 
 is promised that God will take care even of them. 

 [1.] By his providence they shall be kept from wanting; they shall have 
 provision enough. If there be scarcity, the poor are the first that 
 feel it, so that it is a sure sign of plenty if they have sufficient. 
 Zion's poor shall not want, for God has obliged all the sons of Zion to 
 be charitable to the poor, according to their ability, and the church 
 must take care that they be not <I>neglected,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+6:1">Acts vi. 1</A>.

 [2.] By his grace they shall be kept from complaining; though they have 
 but dry bread, yet they shall be satisfied. Zion's poor have, of all 
 others, reason to be content with a little of this world, because they 
 have better things prepared for them. And this may be understood 
 spiritually of the provision that is made for the soul in the word and 
 ordinances; God will abundantly bless that for the nourishment of the 
 new man, and satisfy the poor in spirit with the bread of life. What 
 God sanctifies to us we shall and may be satisfied with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) With the blessings of the life that is to come, things pertaining 
 to godliness 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 
 which is an answer to the prayer,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 [1.] It was desired that the priests might be <I>clothed with 
 righteousness;</I> it is here promised that God will <I>clothe them 
 with salvation,</I> not only save them, but make them and their 
 administrations instrumental for the salvation of his people; they 
 shall both <I>save themselves and those that hear them,</I> and <I>add 
 those to the church that shall be saved.</I> Note, Whom God clothes 
 with righteousness he will clothe with salvation; we must pray for 
 righteousness and then with it God will give salvation.

 [2.] It was desired that the saints might <I>shout for joy;</I> it is 
 promised that they <I>shall shout aloud for joy.</I> God gives more 
 than we ask, and when he gives salvation he will give an abundant 
 joy.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God, having chosen David's family, here promises to bless that also 
 with suitable blessings. 

 (1.) Growing power: <I>There,</I> in Zion, <I>will I make the horn of 
 David to bud,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+132:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The royal dignity shall increase more and more, and constant additions
 he made to the lustre of it. Christ is the <I>horn of salvation</I> 
 (denoting a plentiful and powerful salvation) which God has raised up, 
 and made to bud, <I>in the house of his servant David.</I> David had 
 promised to use his power for God's glory, to cut off the horns of the 
 wicked, and to exalt the horns of the righteous

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:10">Ps. lxxv. 10</A>);

 in recompence for it God here promises to make his horn to bud, for to 
 those that have power, and use it well, more shall be given. 

 (2.) Lasting honour: <I>I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.</I> 
 Thou wilt <I>light my candle,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+18:28">Ps. xviii. 28</A>.

 That lamp is likely to burn brightly which God ordains. A lamp is a 
 successor, for, when a lamp is almost out, another may be lighted by 
 it; it is a succession, for by this means David shall not want a man to 
 stand before God. Christ is the lamp and the light of the world. 

 (3.) Complete victory: "<I>His enemies,</I> who have formed designs 
 against him, <I>will I clothe with shame,</I> when they shall see their 
 designs baffled." Let the enemies of all good governors expect to be 
 clothed with shame, and especially the enemies of the Lord Jesus and 
 his government, who shall rise, in the great day, <I>to everlasting 
 shame and contempt.</I> 

 (4.) Universal prosperity: <I>Upon himself shall his crown 
 flourish,</I> that is, his government shall be more and more his 
 honour. This was to have its full accomplishment in Jesus Christ, whose 
 crown of honour and power shall never fade, nor the flowers of it 
 wither. The crowns of earthly princes <I>endure not to all 
 generations</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:24">Prov. xxvii. 24</A>),

 but Christ's crown shall endure to all eternity and the crowns reserved 
 for his faithful subjects are such as <I>fade not away.</I></P>
