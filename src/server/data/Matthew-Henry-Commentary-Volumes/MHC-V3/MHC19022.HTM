 <HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=50>
 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Spirit of Christ, which was in the prophets, testifies in this 
 psalm, as clearly and fully as any where in all the Old Testament, "the 
 sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:11">1 Pet. i. 11</A>);

 of him, no doubt, David here speaks, and not of himself, or any other
 man. Much of it is expressly applied to Christ in the New Testament,
 all of it may be applied to him, and some of it must be understood of 
 him only. The providences of God concerning David were so very 
 extraordinary that we may suppose there were some wise and good men who 
 then could not but look upon him as a figure of him that was to come.
 But the composition of his psalms especially, in which he found himself
 wonderfully carried out by the spirit of prophecy far beyond his own
 thought and intention, was (we may suppose) an abundant satisfaction to
 himself that he was not only a father of the Messiah, but a figure of
 him. In this psalm he speaks,

 I. Of the humiliation of Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:1-21">ver. 1-21</A>),

 where David, as a type of Christ, complains of the very calamitous
 condition he was in upon many accounts.

 1. He complains, and mixes comforts with his complaints; he complains

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 but comforts himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:3-5">ver. 3-5</A>),

 complains again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>),

 but comforts himself again,,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 2. He complains, and mixes prayers with his complaints; he complains
 of the power and rage of his enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:12,13,16,18">ver. 12, 13, 16, 18</A>),

 of his own bodily weakness and decay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:14,15,17">ver. 14, 15, 17</A>);

 but prays that God would not be far from him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:11,19">ver. 11, 19</A>),

 that he would save and deliver him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:19-21">ver. 19-21</A>.

 II. Of the exaltation of Christ, that his undertaking should be for the 
 glory of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:22-25">ver. 22-25</A>),

 for the salvation and joy of his people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:26-29">ver. 26-29</A>),

 and for the perpetuating of his own kingdom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:30,31">ver. 30, 31</A>.

 In singing this psalm we must keep our thoughts fixed upon Christ, and 
 be so affected with his sufferings as to experience the fellowship of 
 them, and so affected with his grace as to experience the power and 
 influence of it.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician upon Aijeleth Shahar. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? <I>why art thou
 so</I> far from helping me, <I>and from</I> the words of my roaring?
 &nbsp; 2  O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in
 the night season, and am not silent.
 &nbsp; 3  But thou <I>art</I> holy, <I>O thou</I> that inhabitest the praises of
 Israel.
 &nbsp; 4  Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst
 deliver them.
 &nbsp; 5  They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in
 thee, and were not confounded.
 &nbsp; 6  But I <I>am</I> a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and
 despised of the people.
 &nbsp; 7  All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the
 lip, they shake the head, <I>saying,</I>
 &nbsp; 8  He trusted on the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>that</I> he would deliver him: let him
 deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.
 &nbsp; 9  But thou <I>art</I> he that took me out of the womb: thou didst
 make me hope <I>when I was</I> upon my mother's breasts.
 &nbsp; 10  I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou <I>art</I> my God from
 my mother's belly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some think they find Christ in the title of this psalm, upon 
 <I>Aijeleth Shahar</I>--<I>The hind of the morning.</I> Christ is as the
 swift hind upon the mountains of spices 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+8:14">Cant. viii. 14</A>),

 as the loving hind and the pleasant roe, to all believers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+5:19">Prov. v. 19</A>);

 he giveth goodly words like Naphtali, who is compared to a <I>hind let
 loose,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+49:21">Gen. xlix. 21</A>.

 He is the hind of the morning, marked out by the counsels of God from
 eternity, to be run down by those dogs that compassed him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 But others think it denotes only the tune to which the psalm was set.
 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. A sad complaint of God's withdrawings, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. This may be applied to David, or any other child of God, in the want 
 of the tokens of his favour, pressed with the burden of his 
 displeasure, roaring under it, as one overwhelmed with grief and 
 terror, crying earnestly for relief, and, in this case, apprehending 
 himself forsaken of God, unhelped, unheard, yet calling him, again and 
 again, "<I>My God,</I>" and continuing to cry day and night to him and 
 earnestly desiring his gracious returns. Note, 

 (1.) Spiritual desertions are the saints' sorest afflictions; when
 their evidences are clouded, divine consolations suspended, their 
 communion with God interrupted, and the terrors of God set in array 
 against them, how sad are their spirits, and how sapless all their 
 comforts!

 (2.) Even their complaint of these burdens is a good sign of spiritual
 life and spiritual senses exercised. To cry out, "My God, why am I 
 sick? Why am I poor?" would give cause to suspect discontent and 
 worldliness. But, <I>Why has thou forsaken me?</I> is the language of
 a heart binding up its happiness in God's favour.

 (3.) When we are lamenting God's withdrawings, yet still we must call
 him our God, and continue to call upon him as ours. When we want the 
 faith of assurance we must live by a faith of adherence. "However it 
 be, yet God is good, and he is mine; <I>though he slay me, yet I trust 
 in him;</I> though he do not answer me immediately, I will continue 
 praying and waiting; though he be silent, I will not be silent."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But is must be applied to Christ: for, in the first words of this 
 complaint, he poured out his soul before God when he was upon the cross 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:46">Matt. xxvii. 46</A>);

 probably he proceeded to the following words, and, some think, repeated
 the whole psalm, if not aloud (because they cavilled at the first
 words), yet to himself. Note, 

 (1.) Christ, in his sufferings, cried earnestly to his Father for his
 favour and presence with him. He cried <I>in the day-time,</I> upon the 
 cross, <I>and in the night-season,</I> when he was in agony in the 
 garden. <I>He offered up strong crying and tears to him that was able 
 to save him,</I> and with some fear too,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>.

 (2.) Yet God forsook him, was far from helping him, and did not hear
 him, and it was this that he complained of more than all his 
 sufferings. God delivered him into the hands of his enemies; it was by 
 his determinate counsel that he was crucified and slain, and he did not 
 give in sensible comforts. But, Christ having made himself sin for us, 
 in conformity thereunto the Father laid him under the present 
 impressions of his wrath and displeasure against sin. <I>It pleased
 the Lord to bruise him and put him to grief,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10">Isa. liii. 10</A>.

 But even then he kept fast hold of his relation to his Father as his 
 God, by whom he was now employed, whom he was now serving, and with 
 whom he should shortly be glorified.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Encouragement taken, in reference hereunto, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>.

 Though God did not hear him, did not help him, yet,

 1. He will think well of God: "<I>But thou art holy,</I> not unjust, 
 untrue, nor unkind, in any of thy dispensations. Though thou dost not 
 immediately come in to the relief of thy afflicted people, yet thou
 lovest them, art true to thy covenant with them, and dost not 
 countenance the iniquity of their persecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+1:13">Hab. i. 13</A>.

 And, as thou art infinitely pure and upright thyself, so thou
 delightest in the services of thy upright people: <I>Thou inhabitest 
 the praises of Israel;</I> thou art pleased to manifest thy glory, and 
 grace, and special presence with thy people, in the sanctuary, where 
 they attend thee with their praises. There thou art always ready to 
 receive their homage, and of the tabernacle of meeting thou hast said, 
 <I>This is my rest for ever.</I>" This bespeaks God's wonderful 
 condescension to his faithful worshippers--(that, though he is attended 
 with the praises of angels, yet he is pleased to inhabit the praises of 
 Israel), and it may comfort us in all our complaints--that, though God 
 seem, for a while, to turn a deaf ear to them, yet he is so well 
 pleased with his people's praises that he will, in due time, give them 
 cause to change their note: <I>Hope in God, for I shall yet praise 
 him.</I> Our Lord Jesus, in his sufferings, had an eye to the holiness 
 of God, to preserve and advance the honour of that, and of his grace in 
 inhabiting the praises of Israel notwithstanding the iniquities of 
 their holy things.

 2. He will take comfort from the experiences which the saints in former
 ages had of the benefit of faith and prayer

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>):

 "<I>Our fathers trusted in thee, cried unto thee, and thou didst
 deliver them;</I> therefore thou wilt, in due time, deliver me, for 
 never any that hoped in thee were made ashamed of their hope, never any 
 that sought thee sought thee in vain. And thou art still the same in 
 thyself and the same to thy people that ever thou wast. They were our 
 fathers, and thy people are <I>beloved for the fathers' sake,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:28">Rom. xi. 28</A>.

 The entail of the covenant is designed for the support of the seed of
 the faithful. He that was our fathers' God must be ours, and will 
 therefore be ours. Our Lord Jesus, in his sufferings, supported himself 
 with this--that all the fathers who were types of him in his 
 sufferings, Noah, Joseph, David, Jonah, and others, were in due time 
 delivered and were types of his exaltation too; therefore he knew that 
 <I>he also should not be confounded,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7">Isa. l. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The complaint renewed of another grievance, and that is the 
 contempt and reproach of men. This complaint is by no means so bitter 
 as that before of God's withdrawings; but, as that touches a gracious 
 soul, so this a generous soul, in a very tender part, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>.

 Our fathers were honoured, the patriarchs in their day, first or last,
 appeared great in the eye of the world, Abraham, Moses, David; but 
 Christ is <I>a worm, and no man.</I> It was great condescension that he 
 became man, a step downwards, which is, and will be, the wonder of 
 angels; yet, as if it were too much, too great, to be a man, he becomes 
 a worm, and no man. He was <I>Adam--a mean man,</I> and <I>Enosh--a man 
 of sorrows,</I> but <I>lo Ish--not a considerable man:</I> for he took 
 upon him the form of a servant, and <I>his visage was marred more than 
 any man's,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+52:14">Isa. lii. 14</A>.

 Man, at the best, is a worm; but he became <I>a worm, and no man.</I> 
 If he had not made himself a worm, he could not have been trampled upon 
 as he was. The word signifies such a worm as was used in dyeing scarlet 
 or purple, whence some make it an allusion to his bloody sufferings. 
 See what abuses were put upon him.

 1. He was reproached as a bad man, as a blasphemer, a sabbath-breaker,
 a wine-bibber, a false prophet, an enemy to C&aelig;sar, a confederate 
 with the prince of the devils. 

 2. He was despised of the people as a mean contemptible man, not worth
 taking notice of, his country in no repute, his relations poor 
 mechanics, his followers none of the rulers, or the Pharisees, but the 
 mob. 

 3. He was ridiculed as a foolish man, and one that not only deceived
 others, but himself too. Those that saw him hanging on the cross 
 laughed him to scorn. So far were they from pitying him, or concerning 
 themselves for him, that they added to his afflictions, with all the 
 gestures and expressions of insolence upbraiding him with his fall. 
 They make mouths at him, make merry over him, and make a jest of his 
 sufferings: <I>They shoot out the lip, they shake their head,</I> 
 saying, This was he that said <I>he trusted God would deliver him; now 
 let him deliver him.</I> David was sometimes taunted for his confidence 
 in God; but in the sufferings of Christ this was literally and exactly 
 fulfilled. Those very gestures were used by those that reviled him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:39">Matt. xxvii. 39</A>);

 they wagged their heads, nay, and so far did their malice make them
 forget themselves that they used the very words

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>),

 <I>He trusted in God; let him deliver him.</I> Our Lord Jesus, having
 undertaken to satisfy for the dishonour we had done to God by our sins, 
 did it by submitting to the lowest possible instance of ignominy and 
 disgrace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Encouragement taken as to this also 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>):

 Men despise me, <I>but thou art he that took me out of the womb.</I>
 David and other good men have often, for direction to us, encouraged 
 themselves with this, that God was not only the <I>God of their 
 fathers,</I> as before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 but the God of their infancy, who began by times to take care of them,
 as soon as they had a being, and therefore, they hope, will never cast 
 them off. He that did so well for us in that helpless useless state 
 will not leave us when he has reared us and nursed us up into some 
 capacity of serving him. See the early instances of God's providential 
 care for us, 

 1. In the birth: <I>He took us also out of the womb,</I> else we had
 died there, or been stifled in the birth. Every man's particular time
 begins with this pregnant proof of God's providence, as time, in 
 general, began with the creation, that pregnant proof of his being. 

 2. At the breast: "<I>Then didst thou make me hope;</I>" that is,
 "thou didst that for me, in providing sustenance for me and protecting 
 me from the dangers to which I was exposed, which encourages me to hope 
 in thee all my days." The blessings of the breasts, as they crown the 
 blessings of the womb, so they are earnests of the blessings of our 
 whole lives; surely he that fed us then will never starve us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:12">Job iii. 12</A>.

 3. In our early dedication to him: <I>I was cast upon thee from the 
 womb,</I> which perhaps refers to his circumcision on the eighth day; 
 he was then by his parents committed and given up to God as his God in 
 covenant; for circumcision was a seal of the covenant; and this 
 encouraged him to trust in God. Those have reason to think themselves 
 safe who were so soon, so solemnly, <I>gathered under the wings of the 
 divine majesty.</I> 

 4. In the experience we have had of God's goodness to us all along ever
 since, drawn out in a constant uninterrupted series of preservations 
 and supplies: <I>Thou art my God,</I> providing me and watching over me 
 for good, <I>from my mother's belly,</I> that is, from my coming into 
 the world unto this day. And if, as soon as we became capable of 
 exercising reason, we put our confidence in God and committed ourselves 
 and our way to him, we need not doubt but he will always remember the 
 <I>kindness of our youth and the love of our espousals,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:2">Jer. ii. 2</A>.

 This is applicable to our Lord Jesus, over whose incarnation and birth
 the divine Providence watched with a peculiar care, when he was born in 
 a stable, laid in a manger, and immediately exposed to the malice of 
 Herod, and forced to flee into Egypt. <I>When he was a child God loved 
 him and called him thence</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+11:1">Hos. xi. 1</A>),

 and the remembrance of this comforted him in his sufferings. Men
 reproached him, and discouraged his confidence in God; but God had 
 honoured him and encouraged his confidence in him.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have Christ suffering and Christ praying, by which
 we are directed to look for crosses and to look up to God under 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is Christ suffering. David indeed was often in trouble, and 
 beset with enemies; but many of the particulars here specified are such 
 as were never true of David, and therefore must be appropriated to 
 Christ in the depth of his humiliation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He is here deserted by his friends: <I>Trouble</I> and distress are 
 <I>near,</I> and <I>there is none to help,</I> none to uphold, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 He trod the wine-press alone; for all his disciples forsook him and
 fled. It is God's honour to help when all other helps and succours 
 fail.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He is here insulted and surrounded by his enemies, such as were of a 
 higher rank, who for their strength and fury, are compared to bulls, 
 <I>strong bulls of Bashan</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 fat and fed to the full, haughty and sour; such were the chief priests
 and elders that persecuted Christ; and others of a lower rank, who are 
 compared to dogs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),
 
 filthy and greedy, and unwearied in running him down. There was an
 assembly of the wicked plotting against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>);

 for the chief priests sat in council, to consult of ways and means to
 take Christ. These enemies were numerous and unanimous: "Many, and
 those of different and clashing interests among themselves, as Herod 
 and Pilate, have agreed to compass me. They have carried their plot 
 far, and seem to have gained their point, for they have <I>beset me 
 round,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 They have enclosed me, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 They are formidable and threatening

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>They gaped upon me with their mouths,</I> to show me that they would
 swallow me up; and this with as much strength and fierceness as a 
 roaring ravening lion leaps upon his prey."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He is here crucified. The very manner of his death is described, 
 though never in use among the Jews: <I>They pierced my hands and my 
 feet</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 which were nailed to the accursed tree, and the whole body left so to
 hang, the effect of which must needs be the most exquisite pain and 
 torture. There is no one passage in all the Old Testament which the 
 Jews have so industriously corrupted as this, because it is such an 
 eminent prediction of the death of Christ and was so exactly 
 fulfilled.</P>

 4. He is here dying 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>),

 dying in pain and anguish, because he was to satisfy for sin, which
 brought in pain, and for which we must otherwise have lain in 
 everlasting anguish. Here is,

 (1.) The dissolution of the whole frame of his body: <I>I am poured out
 like water,</I> weak as water, and yielding to the power of death, 
 emptying himself of all the supports of his human nature.

 (2.) The dislocation of his bones. Care was taken that not one of them
 should be broken

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:36">John xix. 36</A>),

 but they were all out of joint by the violent stretching of his body
 upon the cross as upon a rack. Or it may denote the fear that seized 
 him in his agony in the garden, when he began to be sore amazed, the 
 effect of which perhaps was (as sometimes it has been of great fear,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:6">Dan. v. 6</A>),

 that the <I>joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smote one
 against another.</I> His bones were put out of joint that he might put 
 the whole creation into joint again, which sin had put out of joint, 
 and might make our broken bones to rejoice.

 (3.) The colliquation of his spirits: <I>My heart is like wax,</I>
 melted to receive the impressions of God's wrath against the sins he 
 undertook to satisfy for, melting away like the vitals of a dying man; 
 and, as this satisfied for the hardness of our hearts, so the 
 consideration of it should help to soften them. When Job speaks of his 
 inward trouble he says, <I>The Almighty makes my heart soft,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:16">Job xxiii. 16</A>,

 and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:2">Ps. lviii. 2</A>.

 (4.) The failing of his natural force: <I>My strength is dried up;</I>
 so that he became parched and brittle like a potsherd, the radical
 moisture being wasted by the fire of divine wrath preying upon his
 spirits. Who then can stand before God's anger? Or who knows the power
 of it? <I>If this was done in the green tree, what shall be done in the
 dry?</I> 

 (5.) The clamminess of his mouth, a usual symptom of approaching death:
 <I>My tongue cleaveth to my jaws;</I> this was fulfilled both in his 
 thirst upon the cross

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:28">John xix. 28</A>)

 and in his silence under his sufferings; for, <I>as a sheep before the
 shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth,</I> nor objected against 
 any thing done to him. 

 (6.) His giving up the ghost: "<I>Thou hast brought me to the dust of
 death;</I> I am just ready to drop into the grave;" for nothing less 
 would satisfy divine justice. The life of the sinner was forfeited, and 
 therefore the life of the sacrifice must be the ransom for it. The 
 sentence of death passed upon Adam was thus expressed: <I>Unto dust 
 thou shalt return.</I> And therefore Christ, having an eye to that 
 sentence in his obedience to death, here uses a similar expression: 
 <I>Thou hast brought me to the dust of death.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He was stripped. The shame of nakedness was the immediate 
 consequence of sin; and therefore our Lord Jesus was stripped of his 
 clothes, when he was crucified, that he might clothe us with the robe 
 of his righteousness, and that the shame of our nakedness might not 
 appear. Now here we are told, 

 (1.) How his body looked when it was thus stripped: <I>I may tell all
 my bones,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 His blessed body was lean and emaciated with labour, grief, and
 fasting, during the whole course of his ministry, which made him look 
 as if he was nearly 50 years old when he was yet but 33, as we find,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+8:57">John viii. 57</A>.

 His wrinkles now witnessed for him that he was far from being what was
 called, <I>a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber.</I> Or his bones might 
 be numbered, because his body was distended upon the cross, which made 
 it easy to count his ribs. <I>They look and stare upon me,</I> that is, 
 my bones do, being distorted, and having no flesh to cover them, as Job 
 says

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:8"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 8</A>),

 <I>My leanness, rising up in me, beareth witness to my face.</I> Or
 "the standers by, the passers by, are amazed to see my bones start out 
 thus; and, instead of pitying me, are pleased even with such a rueful 
 spectacle." 

 (2.) What they did with his clothes, which they took from him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>They parted my garments among them,</I> to every soldier a part, and
 <I>upon my vesture,</I> the seamless coat, <I>do they cast lots.</I> 
 This very circumstance was exactly fulfilled,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:23,24">John xix. 23, 24</A>.

 And though it was no great instance of Christ's suffering, yet it is a
 great instance of the fulfilling of the scripture in him. <I>Thus it
 was written, and</I> therefore <I>thus it behoved Christ to suffer.</I> 
 Let this therefore confirm our faith in him as the true Messiah, and 
 inflame our love to him as the best of friends, who loved us and 
 suffered all this for us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is Christ praying, and with that supporting himself under the 
 burden of his sufferings. Christ, in his agony, prayed earnestly, 
 prayed that the cup might pass from him. When the prince of this world 
 with his terrors set upon him, <I>gaped upon him as a roaring lion,</I> 
 he fell upon the ground and prayed. And of that David's praying here 
 was a type. He calls God his <I>strength,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 When we cannot rejoice in God as our song, yet let us stay ourselves
 upon him as our strength, and take the comfort of spiritual supports
 when we cannot come at spiritual delights. He prays,

 1. That God would be with him, and not set himself at a distance from
 him: <I>Be not thou far from me</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),
 
 and again, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 "Whoever stands aloof from my sore, Lord, do not thou." The nearness of
 trouble should quicken us to draw near to God and then we may hope that 
 he will draw near to us. 

 2. That he would help him and make haste to help him, help him to bear
 up under his troubles, that he might not fail nor be discouraged, that 
 he might neither shrink from his undertaking nor sink under it. And the
 Father <I>heard him in that he feared</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>)

 and enabled him to go through with his work.

 3. That he would deliver him and save him,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 (1.) Observe what the jewel is which he is in care for, "The safety of
 my soul, my darling; let that be redeemed from the power of the grave,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:15">Ps. xlix. 15</A>.

 Father, into thy hands I commit that, to be conveyed safely to
 paradise." The psalmist here calls his soul his <I>darling,</I> his 
 <I>only one</I> (so the word is): "<I>My soul</I> is <I>my only 
 one.</I> I have but one soul to take care of, and therefore the greater 
 is my shame if I neglect it and the greater will the loss be if I let 
 it perish. Being my only one, it ought to be my darling, for the 
 eternal welfare of which I ought to be deeply concerned. I do not use 
 my soul as my darling, unless I take care to preserve it from every 
 thing that would hurt it and to provide all necessaries for it, and be 
 entirely tender of its welfare." 

 (2.) Observe what the danger is from which he prays to be delivered,
 <I>from the sword,</I> the flaming sword of divine wrath, which turns
 every way. This he dreaded more than any thing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:24">Gen. iii. 24</A>.

 God's anger was the wormwood and the gall in the bitter cup that was
 put into his hands. "O deliver my soul from that. Lord, though I lose
 my life, let me not lose thy love. Save me from <I>the power of the 
 dog,</I> and <I>from the lion's mouth.</I>" This seems to be meant of 
 Satan, that old enemy who bruised the heel of the seed of the woman, 
 the prince of this world, with whom he was to engage in close combat 
 and whom he saw coming,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:30">John xiv. 30</A>.

 "Lord, save me from being overpowered by his terrors." He pleads, "Thou
 hast formerly <I>heard me from the horns of the unicorn,</I>" that is, 
 "saved me from him in answer to my prayer." This may refer to the 
 victory Christ had obtained over Satan and his temptations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:1-11">Matt. iv.</A>),
 
 when the devil left him for a season
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:13">Luke iv. 13</A>),

 but now returned in another manner to attack him with his terrors.
 "Lord, thou gavest me the victory then, give it me now, that I may 
 spoil principalities and powers, and <I>cast out the prince of this 
 world.</I>" Has God delivered us <I>from the horns of the unicorn,</I> 
 that we be not tossed? Let that encourage us to hope that we shall be 
 delivered from the lion's mouth, that we be not torn. He that has 
 delivered doth and will deliver. This prayer of Christ, no doubt, was 
 answered, for the Father heard him always. And, though he did not 
 deliver him from death, yet he suffered him not to see corruption, but, 
 the third day, raised him out of the dust of death, which was a greater 
 instance of God's favour to him than if he had helped him down from the 
 cross; for that would have hindered his undertaking, whereas his 
 resurrection crowned it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this we should meditate on the sufferings and resurrection 
 of Christ till we experience in our own souls the power of his 
 resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The same that began the psalm complaining, who was no other than Christ 
 in his humiliation, ends it here triumphing, and it can be no other 
 than Christ in his exaltation. And, as the first words of the complaint 
 were used by Christ himself upon the cross, so the first words of the 
 triumph are expressly applied to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:12">Heb. ii. 12</A>)

 and are made his own words: <I>I will declare thy name unto my
 brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</I> 
 The certain prospect which Christ had of the joy set before him not 
 only gave him a satisfactory answer to his prayers, but turned his 
 complaints into praises; he saw of the travail of his soul, and was 
 well satisfied, witness that triumphant word wherewith he breathed his 
 last: <I>It is finished.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Five things are here spoken of, the view of which were the satisfaction 
 and triumph of Christ in his sufferings:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That he should have a church in the world, and that those that were 
 given him from eternity should, in the fulness of time, be gathered in 
 to him. This is implied here; that he should <I>see his seed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+53:10">Isa. liii. 10</A>.

 It pleased him to think, 

 1. That by the declaring of God's name, by the preaching of the
 everlasting gospel in its plainness and purity, many should be 
 effectually called to him and to God by him. And for this end ministers 
 should be employed to publish this doctrine to the world, and they 
 should be much his messengers and his voice that their doing it should 
 be accounted his doing it; their word is his, and by them he declares 
 God's name. 

 2. That those who are thus called in should be brought into a very near
 and dear relation to him as his brethren; for he is not only not 
 ashamed, but greatly well pleased, to call them so; not the believing 
 Jews only, his countrymen, but those of the Gentiles also who became 
 fellow-heirs and of the same body,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:11">Heb. ii. 11</A>.

 Christ is our elder brother, who takes care of us, and makes provision
 for us, and expects that our desire should be towards him and that we 
 should be willing he should rule over us. 

 3. That these his brethren should be incorporated into a congregation, a
 great congregation; such is the universal church, the whole family that 
 is named from him, unto which all the <I>children of God that were 
 scattered abroad are collected,</I> and in which they are united

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:52,Eph+1:10">John xi. 52, Eph. i. 10</A>),

 and that they should also be incorporated into smaller societies,
 members of that great body, many religious assemblies for divine 
 worship, on which the face of Christianity should appear and in which 
 the interests of it should be supported and advanced. 

 4. That these should be accounted the seed of Jacob and Israel

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 that on them, though Gentiles, the blessing of Abraham might come

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+3:14">Gal. iii. 14</A>),

 and to them might pertain the adoption, the glory, the covenant, and
 the service of God, as much as ever they did to <I>Israel according to
 the flesh,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+9:4,Heb+8:10">Rom. ix. 4, Heb. viii. 10</A>.

 The gospel church is called <I>the Israel of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:16">Gal. vi. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That God should be greatly honoured and glorified in him by that 
 church. His Father's glory was that which he had in his eye throughout 
 his whole undertaking 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+17:4">John xvii. 4</A>),

 particularly in his sufferings, which he entered upon with this solemn
 request, <I>Father, glorify thy name,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:27,28">John xii. 27, 28</A>.

 He foresees with pleasure, 

 1. That God would be glorified by the church that should be gathered to
 him, and that for this end they should be called and gathered in that 
 they might be unto God <I>for a name and a praise.</I> Christ by his 
 ministers will declare God's name to his brethren, as God's mouth to 
 them, and then by them, as the mouth of the congregation to God, will 
 God's name be praised. All that fear the Lord will praise him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),
 
 even every Israelite indeed. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:2-4,135:19,20">Ps. cxviii. 2-4; cxxxv. 19, 20</A>.

 The business of Christians, particularly in their solemn religious
 assemblies, is to praise and glorify God with a holy awe and reverence 
 of his majesty, and therefore those that are here called upon to praise 
 God are called upon to fear him. 

 2. That God would be glorified in the Redeemer and in his undertaking.
 <I>Therefore</I> Christ is said to <I>praise God in the church,</I> not 
 only because he is the Master of the assemblies in which God is 
 praised, and the Mediator of all the praises that are offered up to 
 God, but because he is the matter of the church's praise. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:21">Eph. iii. 21</A>.

 All our praises must centre in the work of redemption and a great deal
 of reason we have to be thankful,

 (1.) That Jesus Christ was owned by his Father in his undertaking,
 notwithstanding the apprehension he was sometimes under that his Father 
 had forsaken him.
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
 afflicted</I> one (that is, of the suffering Redeemer), but has 
 graciously accepted it as a full satisfaction for sin, and a valuable 
 consideration on which to ground the grant of eternal life to all 
 believers. Though it was offered for us poor sinners, he did not 
 despise nor abhor him that offered it for our sakes; nor did he turn his
 face from him that offered it, as Saul was angry with his own son 
 because he interceded for David, whom he looked upon as his enemy. But 
 when he cried unto him, when his blood cried for peace and pardon for 
 us, he heard him. This, as it is the matter of our rejoicing, ought to 
 be the matter of our thanksgiving. Those who have thought their
 prayers slighted and unheard, if they continue to pray and wait, will 
 find they have not sought in vain.

 (2.) That he himself will go on with his undertaking and complete it. 
 Christ says, <I>I will pay my vows,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>.

 Having engaged to bring many sons to glory, he will perform his
 engagement to the utmost, and will lose none.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That all humble gracious souls should have a full satisfaction and
 happiness in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 It comforted the Lord Jesus in his sufferings that in and through him
 all true believers should have everlasting consolation.

 1. The poor in spirit shall be rich in blessings, spiritual blessings;
 the hungry shall be filled with good things. Christ's sacrifice being
 accepted, the saints shall feast upon the sacrifice, as, under the law, 
 upon the peace-offerings, and so partake of the altar: <I>The meek 
 shall eat and be satisfied,</I> eat of the bread of life, feed with an 
 appetite upon the doctrine of Christ's mediation, which is meat and 
 drink to the soul that knows its own nature and case. Those that hunger 
 and thirst after righteousness in Christ shall have all they can desire 
 to satisfy them and make them easy, and shall not labour, as they have 
 done, for that which satisfies not. 

 2. Those that are much in praying shall be much in thanksgiving:
 <I>Those shall praise the Lord that seek him,</I> because through 
 Christ they are sure of finding him, in the hopes of which they have 
 reason to praise him even while they are seeking him, and the more 
 earnest they are in seeking him the more will their hearts be enlarged 
 in his praises when they have found him.

 3. The souls that are devoted to him shall be for ever happy with him: 
 "<I>Your heart shall live for ever.</I> Yours that are meek, that are 
 satisfied in Christ, that continue to seek God; what ever becomes of 
 your bodies, <I>your hearts shall live for ever;</I> the graces and 
 comforts you have shall be perfected in everlasting life. Christ has 
 said, <I>Because I live, you shall live also,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:19">John xiv. 19</A>);

 and therefore that life shall be as sure and as long as his."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That the church of Christ, and with it the kingdom of God among 
 men, should extend itself to all the corners of the earth and should 
 take in all sorts of people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That it should reach far 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>),

 that, whereas the Jews had long been the only professing people of God,
 now all the ends of the world should come into the church, and, the 
 partition-wall being taken down, the Gentiles should be taken in. It is 
 here prophesied,

 (1.) That they should be converted: They <I>shall remember, and turn to
 the Lord.</I> Note, Serious reflection is the first step, and a good 
 step it is towards true conversion. We must consider and turn. The 
 prodigal came first to himself, and then to his father.

 (2.) That then they should be admitted into communion with God and with 
 the assemblies that serve him; <I>They shall worship before thee,</I> 
 for <I>in every place incense shall be offered to God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:11,Isa+66:23">Mal. i. 11; Isa. lxvi. 23</A>.

 Those that turn to God will make conscience of worshipping before him. 
 And good reason there is why all the kindreds of nations should do 
 homage to God, for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>)

 <I>the kingdom is the Lord's;</I> his, and his only, is the universal
 monarchy. 

 [1.] The kingdom of nature is the Lord Jehovah's, and his providence 
 rules among the nations, and upon that account we are bound to worship 
 him; so that the design of the Christian religion is to revive natural 
 religion and its principles and laws. Christ died to bring us to God, 
 the God that made us, from whom we had revolted, and to reduce us to 
 our native allegiance. 

 [2.] The kingdom of grace is the Lord Christ's, and he, as Mediator, is 
 appointed governor among the nations, head over all things to his 
 church. Let every tongue therefore confess that he is Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That it should include many of different ranks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 High and low, rich and poor, bond and free, meet in Christ.

 (1.) Christ shall have the homage of many of the great ones. <I>Those 
 that are fat upon the earth,</I> that live in pomp and power, <I>shall 
 eat and worship;</I> even those that fare deliciously, when they have 
 eaten and are full, shall bless the Lord their God for their plenty and 
 prosperity.

 (2.) The poor also shall receive his gospel: <I>Those that go down to
 the dust,</I> that sit in the dust

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:7">Ps. cxiii. 7</A>),

 that can scarcely keep life and soul together, <I>shall bow before
 him,</I> before the Lord Jesus, who reckons it his honour to be the 
 poor man's King

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:12">Ps. lxxii. 12</A>)

 and whose protection does, in a special manner, draw their allegiance.
 Or this may be understood in general of dying men, whether poor or 
 rich. See then what is our condition--we are going down to the dust to
 which we are sentenced and where shortly we must make our bed. Nor can 
 we keep alive our own souls; we cannot secure our own natural life 
 long, nor can we be the authors of our own spiritual and eternal life. 
 It is therefore our great interest, as well as duty, to bow before the 
 Lord Jesus, to give up ourselves to him to be his subjects and 
 worshippers; for this is the only way, and it is a sure way, to secure 
 our happiness when we go down to the dust. Seeing we cannot keep alive 
 our own souls, it is our wisdom, by an obedient faith, to commit our 
 souls to Jesus Christ, who is able to save them and keep them alive for 
 ever.</P>

 V. That the church of Christ, and with it the kingdom of God among men, 
 should continue to the end, through all the ages of time. Mankind is 
 kept up in a succession of generations; so that there is always a 
 generation passing away and a generation coming up. Now, as Christ 
 shall have honour from that which is passing away and leaving the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>,

 <I>those that go down to the dust shall bow before him,</I> and it is
 good to die bowing before Christ; <I>blessed are the dead who</I> thus 
 <I>die in the Lord</I>), so he shall have honour from that which is 
 rising up, and setting out, in the world,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.
 
 Observe,

 1. Their application to Christ: <I>A seed shall serve him,</I> shall
 keep up the solemn worship of him and profess and practice obedience to 
 him as their Master and Lord. Note, God will have a church in the world 
 to the end of time; and, in order to that, there shall be a succession 
 of professing Christians and gospel ministers from generation to 
 generation. <I>A seed shall serve him;</I> there shall be a remnant, 
 more or less, to whom shall pertain the service of God and to whom God 
 will give grace to serve him,--perhaps not the seed of the same 
 persons, for grace does not run in a blood (he does not say 
 <I>their</I> seed, but <I>a</I> seed),--perhaps but few, yet enough to 
 preserve the entail.

 2. Christ's acknowledgment of them: <I>They shall be accounted to him
 for a generation;</I> he will be the same to them that he was to those
 who went before them; his kindness to his friends shall not die with
 them, but shall be drawn out to their heirs and successors, and instead
 of the fathers shall be the children, whom all shall acknowledge to be
 a <I>seed that the Lord hath blessed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:9,65:23">Isa. lxi. 9; lxv. 23</A>.

 The generation of the righteous God will graciously own as his
 treasure, his children. 
 
 3. Their agency for him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>they shall come,</I> shall rise up in their day, not only to keep up
 the virtue of the generation that is past, and to do the work of their 
 own generation, but to serve the honour of Christ and the welfare of 
 souls in the generations to come; they shall transmit to them the 
 gospel of Christ (that sacred deposit) pure and entire, even to a 
 people that shall be born hereafter; to them they shall declare two 
 things:--

 (1.) That there is an everlasting righteousness, which Jesus Christ has 
 brought in. This righteousness of his, and not any of our own, they
 shall declare to be the foundation of all our hopes and the fountain of 
 all our joys. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:16,17">
 Rom. i. 16, 17</A>.

 (2.) That the work of our redemption by Christ is the Lord's own doing

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+118:23">Ps. cxviii. 23</A>)

 and no contrivance of ours. We must declare to our children that God
 has done this; it is his wisdom in a mystery; it is his arm 
 revealed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this we must triumph in the name of Christ as above every 
 name, must give him honour ourselves, rejoice in the honours others do
 him, and in the assurance we have that there shall be a people praising 
 him on earth when we are praising him in heaven.</P>
