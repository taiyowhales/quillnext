 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 There are two excellent books which the great God has published for the 
 instruction and edification of the children of men; this psalm treats 
 of them both, and recommends them both to our diligent study. 

 I. The book of the creatures, in which we may easily read the power and
 godhead of the Creator, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. The book of the scriptures, which makes known to us the will of God
 concerning our duty. He shows the excellency and usefulness of that
 book

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:7-11">ver. 7-11</A>)

 and then teaches us how to improve it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The heavens
 declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his
 handywork.
 &nbsp; 2  Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth
 knowledge.
 &nbsp; 3  <I>There is</I> no speech nor language, <I>where</I> their voice is not
 heard.
 &nbsp; 4  Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words
 to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the
 sun,
 &nbsp; 5  Which <I>is</I> as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, <I>and</I>
 rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.
 &nbsp; 6  His going forth <I>is</I> from the end of the heaven, and his
 circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the
 heat thereof.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 From the things that are seen every day by all the world the psalmist, 
 in these verses, leads us to the consideration of the invisible things
 of God, whose being appears incontestably evident and whose glory 
 shines transcendently bright in the visible heavens, the structure and 
 beauty of them, and the order and influence of the heavenly bodies. 
 This instance of the divine power serves not only to show the folly of 
 atheists, who see there is a heaven and yet say, "There is no God," who 
 see the effect and yet say, "There is no cause," but to show the folly 
 of idolaters also, and the vanity of their imagination, who, though the 
 heavens declare the glory of God, yet gave that glory to the lights of 
 heaven which those very lights directed them to give to God only, the 
 Father of lights. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What that is which the creatures notify to us. They are in many ways
 useful and serviceable to us, but in nothing so much as in this, that 
 they declare the glory of God, by showing his handy-works, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They plainly speak themselves to be God's handy-works; for they could
 not exist from eternity; all succession and motion must have had a 
 beginning; they could not make themselves, that is a contradiction; 
 they could not be produced by a casual hit of atoms, that is an 
 absurdity, fit rather to be bantered than reasoned with: therefore they 
 must have a Creator, who can be no other than an eternal mind, 
 infinitely wise, powerful, and good. Thus it appears they are God's 
 works, the <I>works of his fingers</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:3">Ps. viii. 3</A>),

 and therefore they declare his glory. From the excellency of the work 
 we may easily infer the infinite perfection of its great author. From 
 the brightness of the heavens we may collect that the Creator is light; 
 their vastness of extent bespeaks his immensity; their height his
 transcendency and sovereignty, their influence upon this earth his 
 dominion, and providence, and universal beneficence: and all declare 
 his almighty power, by which they were at first made, and continue to 
 this day according to the ordinances that were then settled.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What are some of those things which notify this? 

 1. The heavens and the firmament--the vast expanse of air and ether, 
 and the spheres of the planets and fixed stars. Man has this advantage 
 above the beasts, in the structure of his body, that whereas they are 
 made to look downwards, as their spirits must go, he is made erect, to 
 look upwards, because upwards his spirit must shortly go and his 
 thoughts should now rise. 

 2. The constant and regular succession of day and night 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Day unto day, and night unto night,</I> speak the glory of that God 
 who first divided between the light and the darkness, and has, from the 
 beginning to this day, preserved that established order without 
 variation, according to God's covenant with Noah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+8:22">Gen. viii. 22</A>),

 that, <I>while the earth remains, day and night shall not cease,</I> to
 which covenant of providence the covenant of grace is compared for its 
 stability,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+33:20,Jer+31:35">Jer. xxxiii. 20; xxxi. 35</A>.

 The counterchanging of day and night, in so exact a method, is a great
 instance of the power of God, and calls us to observe that, as in the 
 kingdom of nature, so in that of providence, <I>he forms the light and 
 creates the darkness</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:7">Isa. xlv. 7</A>),

 and sets the one over-against the other. It is likewise an instance of
 his goodness to man; for he <I>makes the out-goings of the morning and 
 evening to rejoice,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+65:8">Ps. lxv. 8</A>.

 He not only glorifies himself, but gratifies us, by this constant 
 revolution; for as the light of the morning befriends the business of 
 the day, so the shadows of the evening befriend the repose of the 
 night; every day and every night speak the goodness of God, and, when 
 they have finished their testimony, leave it to the next day, to the 
 next night, to stay the same. 

 3. The light and influence of the sun do, in a special manner, declare 
 the glory of God; for of all the heavenly bodies that is the most 
 conspicuous in itself and most useful to this lower world, which would 
 be all dungeon, and all desert, without it. It is not an improbable 
 conjecture that David penned this psalm when he had the rising sun in 
 view, and from the brightness of it took occasion to declare the glory 
 of God. Concerning the sun observe here,

 (1.) The place appointed him. In the heavens God has <I>set a 
 tabernacle for the sun.</I> The heavenly bodies are called <I>hosts of 
 heaven,</I> and therefore are fitly said to <I>dwell in tents,</I> as 
 soldiers in their encampments. The sun is said to have a tabernacle set 
 him, not only because he is in continual motion and never has a fixed
 residence, but because the mansion he has will, at the end of time, be 
 taken down like a tent, when the heavens shall be rolled together like 
 a scroll and the sun shall be turned to darkness. 

 (2.) The course assigned him. That glorious creature was not made to be 
 idle, but <I>his going forth</I> (at least as it appears to our eye) 
 <I>is from one point of the heavens, and his circuit</I> thence to the 
 opposite point, and thence (to complete his diurnal revolution) to the 
 same point again; and this with such steadiness and constancy that we 
 can certainly foretel the hour and the minute at which the sun will 
 rise at such a place, any day to come. 

 (3.) The brightness wherein he appears. He is <I>as a bridegroom
 coming out of his chamber,</I> richly dressed and adorned, as fine as 
 hands can make him, looking pleasantly himself and making all about him 
 pleasant; for <I>the friend of the bridegroom rejoices greatly to hear 
 the bridegroom's voice,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:29">John iii. 29</A>.

 (4.) The cheerfulness wherewith he makes this tour. Though it seems a
 vast round which he has to walk, and he has not a moment's rest, yet in 
 obedience to the law of this creation, and for the service of man, he 
 not only does it, but does it with a great deal of pleasure and 
 <I>rejoices as a strong man to run a race.</I> With such satisfaction 
 did Christ, the Sun of righteousness, finish the work that was given 
 him to do. 

 (5.) His universal influence on this earth: <I>There is nothing hidden 
 from the heart thereof,</I> no, not metals in the bowels of the earth, 
 which the sun has an influence upon.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. To whom this declaration is made of the glory of God. It is made 
 to all parts of the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>):

 <I>There is no speech nor language</I> (no nation, for the nations were 
 divided <I>after their tongues,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+10:31,32">Gen. x. 31, 32</A>)

 <I>where their voice is not heard. Their line has gone through all the
 earth</I> (the equinoctial line, suppose) <I>and</I> with it <I>their 
 words to the end of the world,</I> proclaiming the eternal power of God 
 of nature,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The apostle uses this as a reason why the Jews should not be angry with 
 him and others for preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, because God 
 had already made himself known to the Gentile world by the works of 
 creation, and left not himself without witness among them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:18">Rom. x. 18</A>),

 so that they were without excuse if they were idolaters,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:20,21">Rom. i. 20, 21</A>.

 And those were without blame, who, by preaching the gospel to them,
 endeavoured to turn them from their idolatry. If God used these means 
 to prevent their apostasy, and they proved ineffectual, the apostles 
 did well to use other means to recover them from it. <I>They have no 
 speech or language</I> (so some read it) <I>and yet their voice is 
 heard.</I> All people may hear these natural immortal preachers speak 
 to them in their own tongue the wonderful works of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:1-6">these verses</A>

 we must give God the glory of all the comfort and benefit we have by
 the lights of the heaven, still looking above and beyond them to the 
 Sun of righteousness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God's glory, (that is, his goodness to man) appears much in the works 
 of creation, but much more in and by divine revelation. The holy 
 scripture, as it is a rule both of our duty to God and of our 
 expectation from him, is of much greater use and benefit to us than day 
 or night, than the air we breathe in, or the light of the sun. The 
 discoveries made of God by his works might have served if man had 
 retained his integrity; but, to recover him out of his fallen state, 
 another course must be taken; that must be done by the word of God. And 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The psalmist gives an account of the excellent properties and uses
 of the word of God, in six sentences 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>),

 in each of which the name <I>Jehovah</I> is repeated, and no vain 
 repetition, for the law has its authority and all its excellency from 
 the law-maker. Here are six several titles of the word of God, to take 
 in the whole of divine revelation, precepts and promises, and 
 especially the gospel. Here are several good properties of it, which 
 proves its divine original, which recommend it to our affection, and 
 which extol it above all other laws whatsoever. Here are several good 
 effects of the law upon the minds of men, which show what it is 
 designed for, what use we are to make of it, and how wonderful the 
 efficacy of divine grace is, going along with it, and working by it.

 1. <I>The law of the Lord is perfect.</I> It is perfectly free from all 
 corruption, perfectly filled with all good, and perfectly fitted for 
 the end for which it is designed; and it will make the man of God 
 perfect, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:17">2 Tim. iii. 17</A>.

 Nothing is to be added to it nor taken from it. It is of use to
 <I>convert the soul,</I> to bring us back to ourselves, to our God, to 
 our duty; for it shows us our sinfulness and misery in our departures 
 from God and the indispensable necessity of our return to him.

 2. <I>The testimony of the Lord</I> (which witnesses for him to us) 
 <I>is sure,</I> incontestably and inviolably sure, what we may give 
 credit to, may rely upon, and may be confident it will not deceive us.
 It is a sure discovery of the divine truth, a sure direction in the way 
 of duty. It is a sure foundation of living comforts and a sure 
 foundation of lasting hopes. It is of use to make us wise, wise to 
 salvation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+3:15">2 Tim. iii. 15</A>.

 It will give us an insight into things divine and a foresight of things
 to come. It will employ us in the best work and secure to us our true 
 interests. It will make even <I>the simple</I> (poor contrivers as they 
 may be for the present world) wise for their souls and eternity. Those 
 that are humbly simple, sensible of their own folly and willing to be 
 taught, shall be made wise by the word of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:9">Ps. xxv. 9</A>.

 3. <I>The statutes of the Lord</I> (enacted by his authority, and 
 binding on all wherever they come) <I>are right,</I> exactly agreeing 
 with the eternal rules and principles of good and evil, that is, with 
 the right reason of man and the right counsels of God. All God's 
 precepts, concerning all things, are right 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:128">Ps. cxix. 128</A>),

 just as they should be; and they will set us to rights if we receive
 them and submit to them; and, because they are right, they <I>rejoice 
 the heart.</I> The law, as we see it in the hands of Christ, gives 
 cause for joy; and, when it is written in our hearts, it lays a 
 foundation for everlasting joy, by restoring us to our right mind.

 4. <I>The commandment of the Lord is pure;</I> it is clear, without
 darkness; it is clean, without dross and defilement. It is itself 
 purified from all alloy, and is purifying to those that receive and 
 embrace it. It is the ordinary means which the Spirit uses in 
 <I>enlightening the eyes;</I> it brings us to a sight and sense of our 
 sin and misery, and directs us in the way of duty. 

 5. <I>The fear of the Lord</I> (true religion and godliness prescribed 
 in the word, reigning in the heart, and practised in the life) <I>is 
 clean,</I> clean itself, and will make us clean

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+15:3">John xv. 3</A>);

 it will cleanse our way,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:9">Ps. cxix. 9</A>.

 And it <I>endureth for ever;</I> it is of perpetual obligation and can
 never be repealed. The ceremonial law is long since done away, but the 
 law concerning the fear of God is ever the same. Time will not alter
 the nature of moral good and evil.

 6. <I>The judgments of the Lord</I> (all his precepts, which are framed 
 in infinite wisdom) <I>are true;</I> they are grounded upon the most 
 sacred and unquestionable truths; they are <I>righteous,</I> all 
 consonant to natural equity; and they are so <I>altogether:</I> there 
 is no unrighteousness in any of them, but they are all of a piece.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He expresses the great value he had for the word of God, and the 
 great advantage he had, and hoped to have, from it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See how highly he prized the commandments of God. It is the 
 character of all good people that they prefer their religion and the 
 word of God, 

 (1.) Far before all the wealth of the world. It is <I>more desirable 
 than gold,</I> than fine gold, <I>than much fine gold.</I> Gold is of 
 the earth, earthly; but grace is the image of the heavenly. Gold is
 only for the body and the concerns of time; but grace is for the soul 
 and the concerns of eternity. 

 (2.) Far before all pleasures and delights of sense. The word of God,
 received by faith, is sweet to the soul, <I>sweeter than honey and the 
 honey comb.</I> The pleasures of sense are the delight of brutes, and 
 therefore debase the great soul of man; the pleasures of religion are 
 the delight of angels, and exalt the soul. The pleasures of sense are 
 deceitful, will soon surfeit, and yet never satisfy; but those of 
 religion are substantial and satisfying, and there is no danger of 
 exceeding in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See what use he made of the precepts of God's word: <I>By them is 
 thy servant warned.</I> The word of God is a word of warning to the 
 children of men; it warns us of the duty we are to do, the dangers we 
 are to avoid, and the deluge we are to prepare for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:17,33:7">Ezek. iii. 17; xxxiii. 7</A>.

 It warns the wicked not to go on in his wicked way, and warns the
 righteous not to turn from his good way. All that are indeed God's 
 servants take this warning.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. See what advantage he promised himself by his obedience to God's 
 precepts: <I>In keeping them there is great reward.</I> Those who make 
 conscience of their duty will not only be no losers by it, but 
 unspeakable gainers. There is a reward, not only after keeping, but in 
 keeping, God's commandments, a present great reward of obedience. 
 Religion is health and honour; it is peace and pleasure; it will make 
 our comforts sweet and our crosses easy, life truly valuable and death 
 itself truly desirable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He draws some good inferences from this pious meditation upon the 
 excellency of the word of God. Such thoughts as these should excite in 
 us devout affections, and they are to good purpose.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He takes occasion hence to make a penitent reflection upon his sins; 
 for <I>by the law is the knowledge of sin.</I> "Is the commandment thus 
 holy, just, and good? Then <I>who can understand his errors?</I> I 
 cannot, whoever can." From the rectitude of the divine law he learns to 
 call his sins his <I>errors.</I> If the commandment be true and 
 righteous, every transgression of the commandment is an error, as
 grounded upon a mistake; every wicked practice takes rise from some 
 corrupt principle; it is a deviation from the rule we are to work by, 
 the way we are to walk in. From the extent, the strictness, and 
 spiritual nature, of the divine law he learns that his sins are so many 
 that he cannot understand the number of them, and so exceedingly sinful 
 that he cannot understand the heinousness and malignity of them. We are 
 guilty of many sins which, through our carelessness and partiality to 
 ourselves, we are not aware of; many we have been guilty of which we 
 have forgotten; so that, when we have been ever so particular in the 
 confession of sin, we must conclude with an <I>et cetera--and such
 like;</I> for God knows a great deal more evil of us than we do of 
 ourselves. In many things we all offend, and who can tell how often he 
 offends? It is well that we are under grace, and not under the law, 
 else we were undone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He takes occasion hence to pray against sin. All the discoveries of 
 sin made to us by the law should drive us to the throne of grace, there 
 to pray, as David does here, 

 (1.) For mercy to pardon. Finding himself unable to specify all the 
 particulars of his transgressions, he cries out, <I>Lord, cleanse me 
 from my secret faults;</I> not secret to God, so none are, nor only 
 such as were secret to the world, but such as were hidden from his own 
 observation of himself. The best of men have reason to suspect 
 themselves guilty of many secret faults, and to pray to God to cleanse 
 them from that guilt and not to lay it to their charge; for even our 
 sins of infirmity and inadvertency, and our secret sins, would be our 
 ruin if God should deal with us according to the desert of them. Even 
 secret faults are defiling, and render us unfit for communion with God; 
 but, when they are pardoned, we are cleansed from them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+1:7">1 John i. 7</A>.

 (2.) For grace to help in time of need. Having prayed that his sins of
 infirmity might be pardoned, he prays that presumptuous sins might be 
 prevented, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 All that truly repent of their sins, and have them pardoned, are in
 care not to relapse into sin, nor to return again to folly, as appears 
 by their prayers, which concur with David's here, where observe,

 [1.] His petition: "Keep me from ever being guilty of a wilful 
 presumptuous sin." We ought to pray that we may be kept from sins of 
 infirmity, but especially from presumptuous sins, which most offend God 
 and wound conscience, which wither our comforts and shock our hopes. 
 "However, let none such <I>have dominion over me,</I> let me not be at 
 the command of any such sin, nor be enslaved by it." 

 [2.] His plea: "<I>So shall I be upright;</I> I shall appear upright; I
 shall preserve the evidence and comfort of my uprightness; and I 
 <I>shall be innocent from the great transgression;</I>" so he calls a 
 presumptuous sin, because no sacrifice was accepted for it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+15:28-30">Num. xv. 28-30</A>.

 Note, <I>First,</I> Presumptuous sins are very heinous and dangerous.
 those that sin against the habitual convictions and actual admonitions 
 of their consciences, in contempt and defiance of the law and its 
 sanctions, that sin with a high hand, sin presumptuously, and it is a 
 great transgression. <I>Secondly,</I> Even good men ought to be jealous 
 of themselves, and afraid of sinning presumptuously, yea, though 
 through the grace of God they have hitherto been kept from them. Let
 none be high-minded, but fear. <I>Thirdly,</I> Being so much exposed, 
 we have great need to pray to God, when we are pushing forward towards 
 a presumptuous sin, to keep us back from it, either by his providence 
 preventing the temptation or by his grace giving us victory over 
 it.</P>

 3. He takes occasion humbly to beg the divine acceptance of those his 
 pious thoughts and affections, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 Observe the connexion of this with what goes before. He prays to God to 
 keep him from sin, and then begs he would accept his performances; for, 
 if we favour our sins, we cannot expect God should favour us or our 
 services,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:18">Ps. lxvi. 18</A>.
 
 Observe,
 
 (1.) What his services were--the <I>words of his mouth and the
 meditations of his heart,</I> his holy affections offered up to God. 
 The pious meditations of the heart must not be smothered, but expressed 
 in the words of our mouth, for God's glory and the edification of 
 others; and the words of our mouth in prayer and praise must not be 
 formal, but arising from the meditation of the heart, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:1">Ps. xlv. 1</A>.

 (2.) What was his care concerning these services--that they might be 
 acceptable with God; for, if our services be not acceptable to God, 
 what do they avail us? Gracious souls must have all they aim at if they 
 be accepted of God, for that is their bliss. 

 (3.) What encouragement he had to hope for this, because God was his 
 strength and his redeemer. If we seek assistance from God as our 
 strength in our religious duties, we may hope to find acceptance with 
 God in the discharge of our duties; for by his strength we have power 
 with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this we should get our hearts much affected with the 
 excellency of the word of God and delivered into it, we should be much 
 affected with the evil of sin, the danger we are in of it and the
 danger we are in by it, and we should fetch in help from heaven against 
 it.</P>
