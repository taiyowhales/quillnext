 <BR><FONT SIZE=+2>PSALM XCVIII.</FONT>
 <HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=50>
 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is to the same purport with the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:1-13,Ps+97:1-12">two foregoing psalms</A>;

 it is a prophecy of the kingdom of the Messiah, the settling of it up
 in the world, and the bringing of the Gentiles into it. The Chaldee 
 entitles it a prophetic psalm. It sets forth,

 I.  The glory of the Redeemer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+98:1-3">ver.  1-3</A>.

 II. The joy of the redeemed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+98:4-9">ver. 4-9</A>.

 If we in a right manner give to Christ this glory, and upon right
 grounds take to ourselves this joy, in singing this psalm, we sing it 
 with understanding. If those who saw Christ's triumph thus, much more 
 reason have we to do so who see these things accomplished and share in 
 the better things provided for us,

 <P>A psalm.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O sing unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> a new song; for he hath
 done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath
 gotten him the victory.
 &nbsp; 2  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath made known his salvation: his righteousness
 hath he openly showed in the sight of the heathen.
 &nbsp; 3  He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house
 of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of
 our God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here called upon again to <I>sing unto the Lord a new song,</I> 
 as before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:1">Ps. xcvi. 1</A>.

 "Sing a most excellent song, the best song you have." Let the song of
 Christ's love be like Solomon's on that subject, a <I>song of 
 songs.</I> A song of praise for redeeming love is a <I>new song,</I> 
 such a song as had not been sung before; for this is a mystery which 
 was hidden from ages and generations. Converts sing a <I>new song,</I> 
 very different from what they had sung; they change their wonder and 
 change their joy, and therefore change their note. If the grace of God 
 put a new heart into our breasts, it will therewith put a new song into 
 our mouths. In the new Jerusalem there will be new songs sung, that 
 will be new to eternity, and never wax old. Let this new song be sung 
 to the praise of God, in consideration of these four things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The wonders he has wrought: <I>He has done marvellous things,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+98:1"><I>v.</I>  1</A>.

 Note, The work of our salvation by Christ is a work of wonder.  If we 
 take a view of all the steps of it from the contrivance of it, and the 
 counsels of God concerning it before all time, to the consummation of 
 it, and its everlasting consequences when time shall be no more, we 
 shall say, God has in it <I>done marvellous things;</I> it is all his 
 doing and it is <I>marvellous in our eyes.</I> The more it is known the 
 more it will be admired.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The conquests he has won: <I>His right hand and his holy arm have 
 gotten him the victory.</I> Our Redeemer has surmounted all the 
 difficulties that lay in the way of our redemption, has broken through 
 them all, and was not discouraged by the services or sufferings 
 appointed him. He has subdued all the enemies that opposed it, has 
 gotten the victory over Satan, disarmed him, and cast him out of his 
 strong-holds, has <I>spoiled principalities and powers</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+2:15">Col. ii. 15</A>),
 
 has <I>taken the prey from the mighty</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:24">Isa. xlix. 24</A>),

 and given death his death's wound. He has gotten a clear and complete
 victory, not only for himself, but for us also, for we through him are 
 more than conquerors. He got this victory by his own power; there was 
 <I>none to help, none to uphold,</I> none that durst venture into the 
 service; but his <I>right hand and his holy arm,</I> which are always 
 stretched out with good success, because they are never stretched out 
 but in a good cause, these have <I>gotten him the victory,</I> have 
 <I>brought him relief or deliverance.</I> God's power and faithfulness, 
 called here <I>his right hand and his holy arm,</I> brought relief to 
 the Lord Jesus, in raising him from the dead, and exalting him 
 personally to the right hand of God; so Dr.  Hammond.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The discoveries he has made to the world of the work of 
 redemption. What he has wrought for us he has revealed to us, and both 
 by his Son; the gospel-revelation is that on which the gospel-kingdom 
 is founded--<I>the word which God sent,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:36">Acts x. 36</A>.

 The <I>opening of the sealed book</I> is that which is to be celebrated
 with songs of praise

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+5:8">Rev. v. 8</A>),

 because by it was brought to light the mystery which had long been hid 
 in God. Observe, 

 1. The subject of this discovery--his salvation and his righteousness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+98:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.
 
 Righteousness and salvation are often put together; as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:10,Isa+46:13,51:5,6,8">Isa. lxi. 10; 
 xlvi. 13; li. 5, 6, 8</A>.

 Salvation denotes the redemption itself, and righteousness the way in
 which it was wrought, by the righteousness of Christ. Or the salvation 
 includes all our gospel-privileges and the righteousness all our 
 gospel-duties; both are made known, for God has joined them together, 
 and we must not separate them. Or righteousness is here put for the way 
 of our justification by Christ, which is revealed in the gospel to be 
 by faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:17">Rom. i. 17</A>.

 2. The plainness of this discovery. He has openly shown it, not in
 types and figures as under the law, but it is written as with a 
 sunbeam, that he that runs may read it. Ministers are appointed to 
 preach it with all plainness of speech. 

 3. The extent of this discovery. It is made in the sight of the
 heathen, and not of the Jews only: <I>All the ends of the earth have 
 seen the salvation of our God;</I> for to the Gentiles was the word of 
 salvation sent.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The accomplishment of the prophecies and promises of the Old 
 Testament, in this 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+98:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>He has remembered his mercy and his truth towards the house of 
 Israel.</I> God had mercy in store for the seed of Abraham, and had 
 given them many and great assurances of the kindness he designed them 
 in the latter days; and it was in pursuance of all those that he raised 
 up his Son Jesus to be not only a <I>light to lighten the Gentiles,</I> 
 but <I>the glory of his people Israel;</I> for he sent him, in the 
 first place, to bless <I>them.</I> God is said, in sending Christ, to 
 <I>perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember the holy 
 covenant,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:72">Luke i. 72</A>.

 It was in consideration of that, and not of their merit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Make a joyful noise unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, all the earth: make a loud
 noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.
 &nbsp; 5  Sing unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with the harp; with the harp, and the
 voice of a psalm.
 &nbsp; 6  With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, the King.
 &nbsp; 7  Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and
 they that dwell therein.

 righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The setting up of the kingdom of Christ is here represented as a matter 
 of joy and praise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let all the children of men rejoice in it, for they all have, or may 
 have, benefit by it. Again and again we are here called upon by all 
 ways and means possible to express our joy in it and give God praise 
 for it: <I>Make a joyful noise,</I> as before, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:1,2">Ps. xcv. 1, 2</A>.

 <I>Make a loud noise,</I> as those that are affected with those glad
 tidings and are desirous to affect others with them. <I>Rejoice and 
 sing praise,</I> sing <I>Hosannas</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:9">Matt. xxi. 9</A>),
 
 sing <I>Hallelujahs,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+19:6">Rev. xix. 6</A>.

 Let him be welcomed to the throne, as new kings are, with acclamations
 of joy and loud shouts, till the earth ring again, as when Solomon was
 proclaimed, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+1:40">1 Kings i. 40</A>.

 And let the shouts of the crowd be accompanied with the <I>singers and
 players on instruments</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+87:7,Ps+68:25">Ps.  lxxvii. 7; lxvi. 25</A>),
 
 as is usual in such solemnities. 

 1. Let sacred songs attend the new King: "<I>Sing praise, sing with the
 voice of a psalm.</I> Express your joy; thus proclaim it, thus excite 
 it yet more, and thus propagate it among others." 

 2. Let these be assisted with sacred music, not only with the soft and 
 gentle melody of <I>the harp,</I> but since it is a victorious King 
 whose glory is to be celebrated, who goes forth conquering and to 
 conquer, let him be proclaimed with the martial sound of the 
 <I>trumpet</I> and <I>cornet,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+98:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Let all this joy be directed to God, and expressed in a solemn 
 religious manner: <I>Make a joyful noise to the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+98:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 <I>Sing to the Lord,</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+98:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 do it <I>before the Lord, the King,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+98:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Carnal mirth is an enemy to this holy joy. When David danced before the 
 ark he pleaded that <I>it was before the Lord;</I> and the piety and 
 devotion of the intention not only vindicated what he did, but 
 commended it. We must rejoice <I>before the Lord</I> whenever we draw 
 near to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+12:12">Deut. xii. 12</A>),
 
 before <I>the Lord Jesus,</I> and before him, not only as the Saviour,
 but as the King, the King of kings, the church's King, and our 
 King.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let the inferior creatures rejoice in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+98:7-9"><I>v.</I> 7-9</A>.

 This is to the same purport with what we had before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:11-13">Ps. xcvi. 11-13</A>):

 <I>Let the sea roar,</I> and let that be called, not as it used to be,
 a <I>dreadful noise,</I> but a <I>joyful noise;</I> for the coming of 
 Christ, and the salvation wrought out by him, have quite altered the 
 property of the troubles and terrors of this world, so that when the 
 floods <I>lift up their voice, lift up their waves,</I> we must not 
 construe that to be the sea roaring against us, but rather rejoicing 
 with us. Let the <I>floods</I> express their joy, as men do when they 
 <I>clap their hands;</I> and let the hills, that trembled for fear 
 before God when he came down to give the law at Mount Sinai, dance for 
 joy before him when his gospel is preached and that word of the Lord 
 goes forth from Zion in a still small voice: <I>Let the hills be joyful 
 together before the Lord.</I> This intimates that the kingdom of Christ 
 would be a blessing to the whole creation; but that, as the inferior 
 creatures declare the glory of the Creator

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:1">Ps. xix. 1</A>),

 so they declare the glory of the Redeemer, for by him all things not
 only subsist in their being, but consist in their order. It intimates 
 likewise that the children of men would be wanting in paying their due 
 respects to the Redeemer, and therefore that he must look for his 
 honour from the sea and the floods, which would shame the stupidity and 
 ingratitude of mankind. And perhaps respect is here had to the <I>new 
 heavens</I> and the <I>new earth,</I> which we yet, according to his 
 promise, look for

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+3:13">2 Pet. iii. 13</A>),

 and this second mention of his coming (after the like, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:1-13">Ps. xcvi.</A>)

 may principally refer to his second coming, when all these things shall
 be so dissolved as to be refined; then shall he come to <I>judge the 
 world with righteousness.</I> In the prospect of that day all that are 
 sanctified do rejoice, and even the sea, and the floods, and the hills, 
 would rejoice if they could. One would think that Virgil had these 
 psalms in his eye, as well as the oracles of the Cumean Sibyl, in his 
 fourth eclogue, where he either ignorantly or basely applies to Asinius 
 Pollio the ancient prophecies, which at that time were expected to be 
 fulfilled; for he lived in the reign of Augustus C&aelig;sar, a little 
 before our Saviour's birth. He owns they looked for the birth of a 
 child from heaven that should be a great blessing to the world, and 
 restore the golden age:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Many other things he says of this long-looked-for child, which 
 Ludovicus Vives, in his notes on that eclogue, thinks applicable to 
 Christ; and he concludes, as the psalmist here, with a prospect of the 
 rejoicing of the whole creation herein:--</P>
