 In this chapter,

 I. The church gives an account of a sore trial wherewith she was
 exercised through the withdrawing of her beloved from her, the pains
 she was at before she recovered the comfortable sense of his favour
 again, and the resolution she took, when she did recover it, not to
 lose it again, as she had done through her own carelessness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. The daughters of Jerusalem admire the excellencies of the church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:6">ver. 6</A>.

 III. The church admires Jesus Christ under the person of Solomon, his
 bed, and the life-guards about it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>),

 his chariot,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A></A>.

 She calls upon the daughters of Zion, who were admiring her, to admire
 him rather, especially as he appeared on his coronation day and the day
 of his nuptials,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought
 him, but I found him not.
 &nbsp; 2  I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in
 the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him,
 but I found him not.
 &nbsp; 3  The watchmen that go about the city found me: <I>to whom I
 said,</I> Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?
 &nbsp; 4  <I>It was</I> but a little that I passed from them, but I found
 him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go,
 until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the
 chamber of her that conceived me.
 &nbsp; 5  I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and
 by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake <I>my</I>
 love, till he please.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 God is not wont to say to the seed of Jacob, <I>Seek you me in 
 vain;</I> and yet here we have the spouse for a great while seeking her 
 beloved in vain, but finding him at last, to her unspeakable 
 satisfaction. It was hard to the Old-Testament church to find Christ in 
 the ceremonial law, and the types and figures which then were <I>of 
 good things to come.</I> Long was the consolation of Israel looked for 
 before it came. The watchman of that church gave little assistance to 
 those who enquired after him; but at length Simeon had <I>him</I> in 
 his arms <I>whom his soul loved.</I> It is applicable to the case of 
 particular believers, who often walk in darkness a great while, but 
 <I>at even time it shall be light,</I> and those that seek Christ to 
 the end shall find him at length. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How the spouse sought him in vain <I>upon her bed</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>);

 when she was up and looking about her, grace in act and exercise,
 though her beloved was withdrawn, yet she could see him at a distance

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:8"><I>ch.</I> ii. 8</A>),

 but now it was otherwise. She still continued her affection to him,
 still it was <I>he whom her soul loved,</I> that bond of the covenant 
 still continued firm. "<I>Though he slay me, I will trust in him;</I> 
 though he leave me, I will love him. When I have him not in my arms, I 
 have him in my heart." But she wanted the communion she used to have 
 with him, as David when he <I>thirsted for God, for the living God.</I> 
 She sought him, but, 

 1. It was <I>by night on her bed;</I> it was late and lazy seeking. Her
 understanding was clouded; it was by night, in the dark. Her affections 
 were chilled, it was on her bed half asleep. The wise virgins
 slumbered in the absence of the bridegroom. It was a dark time with the 
 believer; she saw not her signs, and yet she sought them. Those whose 
 souls love Jesus Christ will continue to seek him even in silence and 
 solitude: their <I>reins</I> instruct them to do so, even <I>in the 
 night season.</I> 

 2. She failed in her endeavour. Sometimes he is <I>found of those that
 seek him not</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+65:1">Isa. lxv. 1</A>),

 but here he is not found of one that sought him, either for punishment
 of her corruptions, her slothfulness and security (we miss of comfort 
 because we do not seek it aright), or for the exercises of grace, her 
 faith and patience, to try whether she will continue seeking. The woman 
 of Canaan sought Christ, and found him not at first, that she might 
 find him, at length, so much the more to her honour and comfort.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How she had sought him in vain abroad, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 She had made trial of secret worship, and had gone through the duties 
 of the closet, had remembered him on her bed and meditated on him in 
 the <I>night-watches</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+63:6">Ps. lxiii. 6</A>),

 but she did not meet with comfort. <I>My sore ran in the night,</I>
 and then <I>I remembered God and was troubled,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:2,3">Ps. lxxvii. 2, 3</A>.

 And yet she is not driven off by the disappointment from the use of
 further means; she resolves, "<I>I will rise now;</I> I will not lie 
 here if I cannot find my beloved here, nor be content if he be 
 withdrawn. <I>I will rise now</I> without delay, and seek him 
 immediately, lest he withdraw further from me." Those that would seek 
 Christ so as to find him must lose no time. "<I>I will rise</I> out of 
 a warm bed, and go out in a cold dark night, in quest of my beloved." 
 Those that see Christ must not startle at difficulties. "<I>I will
 rise, and go about the city,</I> the holy city, in the streets, and the 
 broad-ways;" for she knew he was not to be found in any blind by-ways. 
 We must seek in the city, in Jerusalem, which was a type of the 
 gospel-church. The likeliest place to find Christ is in the temple 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+2:46">Luke ii. 46</A>),

 in the streets of the gospel-church, in holy ordinances, where the
 children of Zion pass and repass at all hours. She had a good purpose
 when she said, <I>I will arise now,</I> but the good performance was 
 all in all. She arose, and <I>sought him</I> (those that are in pursuit 
 of Christ, the knowledge of him and communion with him, must turn every 
 stone, seek every where), and yet she <I>found him not;</I> she was 
 still unsatisfied, uneasy, as Job, when he looked on all sides, but 
 could not perceive any tokens of the divine favour

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:8,9">Job xxiii. 8, 9</A>),

 and the Psalmist often, when he complained that God hid his face from
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+88:14">Ps. lxxxviii. 14</A>.

 We may be in the way of our duty and yet may miss the comfort, for
 <I>the wind bloweth where it listeth.</I> How heavy is the accent on 
 this repeated complaint: <I>I sought him, but I found him not!</I> like 
 that of Mary Magdalen, <I>They have taken away my Lord, and I know not 
 where they have laid him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:13">John xx. 13</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How she enquired of the watchmen concerning him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 In the night the watchmen <I>go about the city,</I> for the
 preservation of its peace and safety, to guide and assist the honest 
 and quiet, as well as to be a check upon those that are disorderly; 
 these met her in her walks, and she asked them if they could give her 
 any tidings of her beloved. In the streets and broad-ways of Jerusalem 
 she might meet with enough to divert her from her pursuit and to 
 entertain her, though she could not meet her beloved; but she regards 
 none in comparison with him. Gracious souls press through crowds of 
 other delights and contentments in pursuit of Christ, whom they prefer 
 before their chief joy. Mary Magdalen sees angels in the sepulchre, but 
 that will not do unless she see Jesus. <I>Saw you him whom my soul 
 loveth?</I> Note, We must evince the sincerity of our love to Christ by 
 our solicitous enquiries after him. <I>The children of the 
 bride-chamber will mourn when the bridegroom is taken away</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+9:15">Matt. ix. 15</A>),

 especially for the sin which provoked him to withdraw; and, if we do
 so, we shall be in care to recover the sense of his favour and diligent 
 and constant in the use of proper means in order thereunto. We must 
 search the scriptures, be much in prayer, keep close to ordinances, and 
 all with this upon our heart, <I>Saw you him whom my soul loveth?</I> 
 Those only who have seen Christ themselves are likely to direct others 
 to a sight of him. When the Greeks came to worship at the feast they 
 applied to Philip, with such an address as this of the spouse to the 
 watchmen, <I>Sir, we would see Jesus,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:21">John xii. 21</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How she found him at last, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 She <I>passed from</I> the watchmen as soon as she perceived they could 
 give her no tidings of her beloved; she would not stay with them, 
 because he was not among them, but went on seeking, for (as Ainsworth 
 observes) the society neither of brethren, nor of the church, nor of 
 ministers, can comfort the afflicted conscience unless Christ himself 
 be apprehended by faith. But soon after she parted from the watchmen 
 she found him whom she sought, and then called him <I>him whom my soul 
 loveth,</I> with as much delight as before with desire. Note, Those 
 that continue seeking Christ shall find him at last, and when perhaps 
 they were almost ready to despair of finding him. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+42:7,8,77:9,10,Isa+54:7,8">Ps. xlii. 7, 8; lxxvii. 9, 10; Isa. liv. 7, 8</A>.

 Disappointments must not drive us away from gracious pursuits. Hold
 out, faith and patience; <I>the vision is for an appointed time,</I> 
 and, though the watchman can give us no account of it, <I>at the 
 end</I> it shall itself <I>speak and not lie;</I> and the comfort that 
 comes in after long waiting, in the use of means, will be so much the 
 sweeter at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. How close she kept to him when she had found him. She is now as much 
 in fear of losing him as before she was in care to find him: <I>I held 
 him,</I> held him fast, as the women, when they met with Christ after 
 his resurrection, <I>held him by the feet, and worshipped him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+28:9">Matt. xxviii. 9</A>.

 "<I>I would not let him go.</I> Not only, I would never do any thing to
 provoke him to depart, but I would by faith and prayer prevail with him 
 to stay, and by the exercise of grace preserve inward peace." Those 
 that know how hard comfort is come by, and how dearly it is bought, 
 will be afraid of forfeiting it and playing it away, and will think 
 nothing too much to do to keep it safe. <I>Non minor est virtus quam 
 qu&aelig;rere parta tueri</I>--<I>As much is implied in securing our 
 acquisitions as in making them.</I> Those that have laid hold on wisdom 
 must <I>retain her,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:18">Prov. iii. 18</A>.

 Those that hold Christ fast in the arms of faith and love shall <I>not
 let him go;</I> he will abide with them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. How desirous she was to make others acquainted with him: "<I>I 
 brought him to my mother's house,</I> that all my relations, all who 
 are dear to me, might have the benefit of communion with him." When 
 Zaccheus found Christ, or rather was found of him, <I>salvation came to 
 his house,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+19:9">Luke xix. 9</A>.

 Wherever we find Christ we must take him home with us to our houses,
 especially to our hearts. The church is our mother, and we should be 
 concerned for her interests, that she may have Christ present with her 
 and be earnest in prayer for his presence with his people and ministers 
 always. Those that enjoy the tokens of Christ's favour to their own 
 souls should desire that the church, and all religious assemblies in 
 their public capacity, might likewise enjoy the tokens of his 
 favour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. What care she was in that no disturbance might be given him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);
 
 she repeats the charge she had before given
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:7"><I>ch.</I> ii. 7</A>)

 to the <I>daughters of Jerusalem</I> not to <I>stir up or awake her 
 love.</I> When she <I>had brought him into her mother's house,</I> 
 among her sisters, she gives them a strict charge to keep all quiet and 
 in good order, to be very observant of him, careful to please him, and 
 afraid of offending him. The charge given to the church in the 
 wilderness concerning the angel of the covenant, who was among them, 
 explains this. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+23:21">Exod. xxiii. 21</A>,

 <I>Beware of him and obey his voice;</I> <I>provoke him not.</I> See
 that none of you stir out of your places, lest you disturb him, but 
 <I>with quietness work and mind your own business;</I> make no noise; 
 let all <I>clamour and bitterness be put</I> far <I>from you,</I> for 
 that <I>grieves the Holy Spirit of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:30,31">Eph. iv. 30, 31</A>.

 Some make this to be Christ's charge to the <I>daughters of
 Jerusalem</I> not to disturb or disquiet his church, nor trouble the 
 minds of the disciples; for Christ is very tender of the peace of his 
 church, and all the members of it, even the little ones; and those that 
 trouble them <I>shall bear their judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+5:10">Gal. v. 10</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Who <I>is</I> this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars
 of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders
 of the merchant?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These are the words of the <I>daughters of Jerusalem,</I> to whom the 
 charge was given, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 They had looked shily upon the bride because she was black

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:6"><I>ch.</I> i. 6</A>);

 but now they admire her, and speak of her with great respect: <I>Who is 
 this?</I> How beautiful she looks! Who would have expected such a 
 comely and magnificent person to <I>come out of the wilderness?</I> As, 
 when Christ rode in triumph into Jerusalem, they said, <I>Who is 
 this?</I> And of the accession of strangers to the church she herself 
 says, with wonder 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:21">Isa. xlix. 21</A>),
 
 <I>Who has begotten me these?</I>

 1. This is applicable to the Jewish church, when, after forty years'
 wandering in the wilderness, they came out of it, to take a glorious 
 possession of the land of promise; and this may very well be 
 illustrated by what Balaam said of them at that time, when they 
 ascended <I>out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke,</I> and he 
 stood admiring them: <I>From the top of the rocks I see him. How goodly 
 are thy tents, O Jacob!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+23:9,24:5">Num. xxiii. 9; xxiv. 5</A>.

 2. It is applicable to any public deliverance of the church of God, as 
 particularly of Babylon, the Old-Testament and the New-Testament 
 Babylon; then the church is <I>like pillars of smoke,</I> ascending 
 upwards in devout affections, the incense of praise, from which, as 
 from Noah's sacrifice, God <I>smells a sweet savour;</I> then she is 
 amiable in the eyes of her friends, and her enemies too cannot but have 
 a veneration for her, and <I>worship at her feet, knowing that God has 
 loved her,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9">Rev. iii. 9</A>.

 Sometimes the <I>fear of the Jews</I> was upon their neighbours, when
 they saw that <I>God was with them of a truth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+8:17">Esth. viii. 17</A>.

 3. It is applicable to the recovery of a gracious soul out of a state
 of desertion and despondency.

 (1.) She ascends <I>out of the wilderness,</I> the dry and barren land, 
 where there is <I>no way,</I> where there is <I>no water,</I> where 
 travellers are still in want and ever at a loss; here a poor soul may 
 long be left to wander, but shall come up, at last, under the conduct 
 of the Comforter. 

 (2.) She comes up <I>like pillars of smoke,</I> like a cloud of incense 
 ascending from the altar or the smoke of the burnt-offerings. This 
 intimates a fire of pious and devout affections in the soul, whence 
 this smoke arises, and the mounting of the soul heaven-ward in this 
 smoke (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+13:20">Judges xiii. 20</A>),

 the heart lifted up to God in the heavens, <I>as the sparks fly
 upward.</I> Christ's return to the soul gives life to its devotion, and 
 its communion with God is most reviving when it ascends <I>out of a 
 wilderness.</I>

 (3.) She is <I>perfumed with myrrh and frankincense.</I> She is 
 replenished with the graces of God's Spirit, which are as sweet spices, 
 or as the holy incense, which, being now kindled by his gracious 
 returns, sends forth a very fragrant smell. Her devotions being now
 peculiarly lively, she is not only acceptable to God, but amiable in 
 the eyes of others also, who are ready to cry out with admiration, 
 <I>Who is this?</I> What a monument of mercy is this! The graces and
 comforts with which she is <I>perfumed</I> are called the <I>powders of 
 the merchant,</I> for they are far-fetched and dear-bought, by our Lord 
 Jesus, that blessed merchant, who took a long voyage, and was at vast 
 expense, no less than that of his own blood, to purchase them for us. 
 They are not the products of our own soil, nor the growth of our own 
 country; no, they are imported from the heavenly Canaan, the better 
 country.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>The daughters of Jerusalem</I> stood admiring the spouse and 
 commending her, but she overlooks their praises, is not puffed up with 
 them, but transfers all the glory to Christ, and directs them to look 
 off from her to him, recommends him to their esteem, and sets herself 
 to applaud him. Here he is three times called <I>Solomon,</I> and we 
 have that name but three times besides in all this song, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:5,8:11,12"><I>ch.</I> i. 5; viii. 11, 12</A>.

 It is Christ that is here meant, who is greater than Solomon, and of
 whom Solomon was an illustrious type for his wisdom and wealth, and 
 especially his building the temple.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three things she admires him for:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The safety of his bed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>Behold his bed,</I> even <I>Solomon's,</I> very rich and fine; for
 such <I>the curtains of Solomon</I> were. <I>His bed, which is above 
 Solomon's,</I> so some read it. Christ's bed, though he had <I>not 
 where to lay his head,</I> is better than Solomon's best bed. The 
 church is his bed, for he has said of it. <I>This is my rest for 
 ever;</I> <I>here will I dwell.</I> The hearts of believers are his 
 bed, for he lies all night between their breasts, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:17">Eph. iii. 17</A>.

 Heaven is his bed, the rest into which he entered when he had done his
 work. Or it may be meant of the sweet repose and satisfaction which 
 gracious souls enjoy in communion with him; it is called <I>his 
 bed,</I> because, though we are admitted to it, and therefore it is 
 called <I>our bed</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:16"><I>ch.</I> i. 16</A>),

 yet it is his peace that is our rest, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+14:27">John xiv. 27</A>.

 <I>I will give you rest,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+11:28">Matt. xi. 28</A>.

 It <I>is Solomon's bed,</I> whose name signifies <I>peace,</I> because
 in his days Judah and Israel <I>dwelt safely under their vines and 
 fig-trees.</I> That which she admires his bed for is the guard that 
 surrounded it. Those that rest in Christ not only dwell at ease (many 
 do so who yet are in the greatest danger) but they dwell in safety.
 Their holy serenity is under the protection of a holy security. This 
 bed had <I>threescore valiant men about it,</I> as yeomen of the guard, 
 or the band of gentlemen-pensioners; they are <I>of the valiant of 
 Israel,</I> and a great many bold and brave men David's reign had 
 produced. The life-guard men are well armed: <I>They all hold 
 swords,</I> and know how to hold them; they are <I>expert in war,</I> 
 well skilled in all the arts of it. They are posted about the bed at a 
 convenient distance. They are in a posture of defence, <I>every
 man</I> with <I>his sword upon his thigh</I> and his hand upon his 
 sword, ready to draw upon the first alarm, and this <I>because of fear 
 in the night,</I> because of the danger feared; for the lives of 
 princes, even the wisest and best, as they are more precious, so they 
 are more exposed, and require to be more guarded than the lives of 
 common persons. Or, <I>because of the fear</I> of it, and the 
 apprehension which the spouse may have of danger, these guards are set 
 for her satisfaction, that she may be <I>quiet from the fear of 
 evil,</I> which believers themselves are subject to, especially <I>in 
 the night,</I> when they are under a cloud as to their spiritual state, 
 or in any outward trouble more than ordinary. Christ himself was under 
 the special protection of his Father in his whole undertaking. <I>In 
 the shadow of his hand he hid me</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:2">Isa. xlix. 2</A>);

 he had legions of angels at his command. The church is well guarded;
 more are with her than against her. Lest any hurt this vineyard, God 
 himself <I>keeps it night and day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:2,3">Isa. xxvii. 2, 3</A>);

 particular believers, when they repose themselves in Christ and with
 him, though it may be night-time with them, and they may have their 
 <I>fears in the night,</I> and yet safe, as safe as Solomon himself in 
 the midst of his guards; the angels have a charge concerning them, 
 ministers are appointed to <I>watch for their souls,</I> and 
 <I>they</I> ought to be <I>valiant</I> men, <I>expert in</I> the 
 spiritual warfare, holding <I>the sword of the Spirit, which is the 
 word of God,</I> and having that girt <I>upon their thigh,</I> always 
 ready to them for the silencing <I>of the fears</I> of God's people 
 <I>in the night.</I> All the attributes of God are engaged for the 
 safety of believers; they are kept as in a strong-hold by his power

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:5">1 Pet. i. 5</A>),
 
 are safe in <I>his name</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:10">Prov. xviii. 10</A>),
 
 his peace protects those in whom it rules
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:7">Phil. iv. 7</A>),
 
 and the effect of righteousness in them is <I>quietness</I> and
 <I>assurance,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:17">Isa. xxxii. 17</A>.

 Our danger is from <I>the rulers of the darkness of this world,</I> but
 we are safe in the <I>armour of light.</I></P>

 II. The splendour of his chariot, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 As Christ and believers rest in safety under a sufficient guard, so 
 when they appear publicly, as kings in their coaches of state, they 
 appear in great magnificence. This chariot was of Solomon's own
 contriving and making, the materials very rich, <I>silver,</I> and 
 <I>gold,</I> and <I>cedar,</I> and <I>purple.</I> He made it for 
 himself, and yet made it <I>for the daughters of Jerusalem,</I> to 
 oblige them. Some by this <I>chariot,</I> or <I>coach,</I> or 
 <I>chaise</I> (the word is nowhere else used in scripture), understand 
 the human nature of Christ, in which the divine nature rode as in an 
 open chariot. It was a divine workmanship (<I>A body hast thou prepared 
 me</I>); the structure was very fine, but that which was at the bottom 
 of it was love, pure love to the children of men. Others make it to 
 represent the everlasting gospel, in which, as in an open chariot, 
 Christ shows himself, and as in a chariot of war rides forth 
 triumphantly, <I>conquering and to conquer. The pillars,</I> the seven 
 pillars 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+9:1">Prov. ix. 1</A>),

 are of <I>silver,</I> for the words of the Lord are <I>as silver
 tried</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:6">Ps. xii. 6</A>),

 nay, they are better <I>than thousands of gold and silver.</I> It is
 hung with <I>purple,</I> a princely colour; all the adornings of it are 
 dyed in the precious blood of Christ, and that gives them this colour. 
 But that which completes the glory of it is <I>love;</I> <I>it is paved 
 with love,</I> it is lined with love, not love of strangers, as 
 Solomon's was in the days of his defection, but <I>love</I> of <I>the 
 daughters of Jerusalem,</I> a holy <I>love.</I> Silver is better than 
 cedar, gold than silver, but love is better than gold, better than all, 
 and it is put last, for nothing can be better than that. The gospel is
 all <I>love.</I> Mr. Durham applies it to the covenant of redemption,
 the way of our salvation, as it is contrived in the eternal counsel of 
 God, and manifested to us in the scriptures. This is that work of
 Christ himself wherein the glory of his grace and love to sinners most 
 eminently appears, and which makes him amiable and admirable in the 
 eyes of believers. In this covenant love is conveyed to them, and they 
 are carried in it to the perfection of love, and, as it were, ride in 
 triumph. It is admirably framed and contrived, both for the glory of
 Christ and for the comfort of believers. It is <I>well ordered in all 
 things, and sure</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:5">2 Sam. xxiii. 5</A>);

 it has <I>pillars</I> that cannot be shaken, it is <I>made of the wood
 of Lebanon,</I> which can never rot; the basis of it is <I>gold,</I> 
 the most lasting metal; the blood of the covenant, that rich 
 <I>purple,</I> is the cover of this chariot, by which believers are 
 sheltered from the wind and storms of divine wrath, and the troubles of 
 this world; but the midst of it, and that which is all in all in it, is 
 <I>love,</I> that <I>love of Christ which surpasses knowledge</I> and 
 the dimensions of which are immeasurable.</P>

 III. The lustre of his royal person, when he appears in his greatest 
 pomp, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+3:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Here observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The call that is given to the <I>daughters of Zion</I> to acquaint 
 themselves with the glories of <I>king Solomon: Go forth, and 
 behold</I> him. The multitude of the spectators adds to the beauty of a 
 splendid cavalcade. Christ, in his gospel, manifests himself. Let each 
 of us add to the number of those that give honour to him, by giving 
 themselves the satisfaction of looking upon him. Who should pay 
 respects to Zion's king but Zion's daughters? They have reason to 
 rejoice greatly when he comes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:9">Zec. ix. 9</A>.

 (1.) <I>Behold him</I> then. Look with pleasure upon Christ in his
 glory. Look upon him with an eye of faith, with a fixed eye. Here is a 
 sight worth seeing; <I>behold,</I> and admire him, <I>behold,</I> and 
 love him; look upon him, and know him again. 

 (2.) <I>Go forth and behold</I> him; go off from the world, as those 
 that see no beauty and excellency in it in comparison with what is to 
 be seen in the Lord Jesus. Go out of yourselves, and let the light of 
 his transcendent beauty put you out of conceit with yourselves. <I>Go 
 forth</I> to the place where he is to be seen, to the street through 
 which he passes, as Zaccheus.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The direction that is given them to take special notice of that 
 which they would not see every day, and that was his <I>crown,</I> 
 either the crown of gold, adorned with jewels, which he wore on his 
 coronation-day (Solomon's mother, Bathsheba, though she did not procure 
 that for him, yet, by her seasonable interposal, she helped to secure 
 it to him when Adonijah was catching at it), or the garland or crown of 
 flowers and green tied with ribbons which his mother made for him, to 
 adorn the solemnity of his nuptials. Perhaps Solomon's coronation day 
 was his marriage-day, <I>the day of his espousals,</I> when the garland 
 his mother crowned him with was added to the crown his people crowned 
 him with. Applying this to Christ, it speaks, 

 (1.) The many honours put upon him, and the power and dominion he is 
 entrusted with: <I>Go forth,</I> and see king Jesus, <I>with the crown 
 wherewith his</I> Father <I>crowned him,</I> when he declared him his 
 <I>beloved Son, in whom</I> he was <I>well-pleased,</I> when he <I>set 
 him as King upon his holy hill of Zion,</I> when he advanced him to his 
 own right hand, and invested him with a sovereign authority, both <I>in 
 heaven and in earth,</I> and <I>put all things under his feet.</I> 

 (2.) The dishonour put upon him by his persecutors. Some apply it to 
 the <I>crown of thorns</I> with which <I>his mother,</I> the Jewish 
 church, <I>crowned him</I> on the day of his death, which was <I>the 
 day of his espousals</I> to his church, when he <I>loved it, and gave 
 himself for it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+5:25">Eph. v. 25</A>);

 and it is observable that when he was <I>brought forth wearing the
 crown of thorns Pilate said,</I> and said it to the <I>daughters of 
 Zion, Behold the man.</I>

 (3.) It seems especially to mean the honour done him by his church, as 
 his mother, and by all true believers, in whose hearts he is formed, 
 and of whom he has said, <I>These are my mother, my sister, and 
 brother,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:50">Matt. xii. 50</A>.

 They give him the glory of his undertaking; to him is glory <I>in the
 church,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:21">Eph. iii. 21</A>.

 When believers accept of him as theirs, and join themselves to him in
 an everlasting covenant,

 [1.] It is his coronation-day in their souls. Before conversion they 
 were crowning themselves, but then they begin to crown Christ, and 
 continue to do so from that day forward. They appointed him their head; 
 they bring <I>every thought into obedience to</I> him; they set up his 
 throne in their hearts, and cast all their crowns at his feet. 

 [2.] It is <I>the day of his espousals,</I> in which he betroths them 
 to him for ever in lovingkindness and in mercies, joins them to himself 
 in faith and love, and gives himself to them in the promises and all he 
 has, to be theirs. <I>Thou shalt not be for another, so will I also be
 for thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+3:3">Hos. iii. 3</A>.

 And to him they are presented as <I>chaste virgins.</I>

 [3.] It is <I>the day of the gladness of his heart;</I> he is pleased 
 with the honour that his people do him, pleased with the progress of 
 his interest among them. Does <I>Satan fall</I> before them? <I>In that 
 hour Jesus rejoices in spirit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:18,21">Luke x. 18, 21</A>.

 There is joy in heaven over repenting sinners; the family is glad when
 the prodigal son returns. <I>Go forth and behold</I> Christ's grace 
 toward sinners, as his <I>crown,</I> his brightest glory.</P>
