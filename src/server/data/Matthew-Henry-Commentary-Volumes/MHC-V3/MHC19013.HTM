 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is the deserted soul's case and cure. Whether it was penned 
 upon any particular occasion does not appear, but in general, 

 I. David sadly complains that God had long withdrawn from him and 
 delayed to relieve him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+13:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. He earnestly prays to God to consider his case and comfort him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+13:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III. He assures himself of an answer of peace, and therefore concludes 
 the psalm with joy and triumph, because he concludes his deliverance to 
 be as good as wrought, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+13:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  How long wilt
 thou forget me, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy
 face from me?
 &nbsp; 2  How long shall I take counsel in my soul, <I>having</I> sorrow in
 my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
 &nbsp; 3  Consider <I>and</I> hear me, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God: lighten mine eyes,
 lest I sleep the <I>sleep of</I> death;
 &nbsp; 4  Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; <I>and</I>
 those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
 &nbsp; 5  But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in
 thy salvation.
 &nbsp; 6  I will sing unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, because he hath dealt bountifully
 with me.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, in affliction, is here pouring out his soul before God; his 
 address is short, but the method is very observable, and of use for 
 direction and encouragement.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His troubles extort complaints 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+13:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>);

 and the afflicted have liberty to <I>pour out their complaint before
 the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:1">Ps. cii.</A>

 <I>title.</I> It is some ease to a troubled spirit to give vent to its 
 griefs, especially to give vent to them at the throne of grace, where 
 we are sure to find one who is afflicted in the afflictions of his 
 people and is troubled with the feeling of their infirmities; thither 
 we have boldness of access by faith, and there we have 
 <B><I>parresia</I></B>--<I>freedom of speech.</I> Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What David complains of. 

 (1.) God's unkindness; so he construed it, and it was his infirmity. He 
 thought God had forgotten him, had forgotten his promises to him, his 
 covenant with him, his former lovingkindness which he had shown him and 
 which he took to be an earnest of further mercy, had forgotten that 
 there was such a man in the world, who needed and expected relief and 
 succour from him. Thus Zion said, <I>My God has forgotten me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+49:14">Isa. xlix. 14</A>),

 Israel said, <I>My way is hidden from the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+40:27">Isa. xl. 27</A>.

 Not that any good man can doubt the omniscience, goodness, and 
 faithfulness of God; but it is a peevish expression of prevailing fear, 
 which yet, when it arises from a high esteem and earnest desire of 
 God's favour, though it be indecent and culpable, shall be passed by 
 and pardoned, for the second thought will retract it and repent of it.  
 God hid his face from him, so that he wanted that inward comfort in God 
 which he used to have, and herein was a type of Christ upon the cross, 
 crying out, <I>My God, why hast thou forsaken me?</I> God sometimes 
 hides his face from his own children, and leaves them in the dark 
 concerning their interest in him; and this they lay to heart more than 
 any outward trouble whatsoever.

 (2.) His own uneasiness.

 [1.] He was racked with care, which filled his head: <I>I take counsel 
 in my soul;</I> "I am at a loss, and am <I>inops 
 consilii--without a friend to advise with</I> that I can put any 
 confidence in, and therefore am myself continually projecting what to 
 do to help myself; but none of my projects are likely to take effect, 
 so that I am at my wits' end, and in a continual agitation." Anxious 
 cares are heavy burdens with which good people often load themselves 
 more than they need. 

 [2.] He was overwhelmed with sorrow, which filled his heart: <I>I have 
 sorrow in my heart daily.</I> He had a constant disposition to sorrow 
 and it preyed upon his spirits, not only in the night, when he was 
 silent and solitary, but by day too, when lighter griefs are diverted 
 and dissipated by conversation and business; nay, every day brought 
 with it fresh occasions of grief; <I>the clouds returned after the 
 rain.</I> The bread of sorrow is sometimes the saint's daily bread. Our 
 Master himself was a man of sorrows. 

 (3.) His enemies' insolence, which added to his grief. Saul his great 
 enemy, and others under him, were exalted over him, triumphed in his 
 distress, pleased themselves with his grief, and promised themselves a 
 complete victory over him. This he complained of as reflecting 
 dishonour upon God, and his power and promise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he expostulates with God hereupon: "<I>How long</I> shall it be 
 thus?" And, "Shall it be thus <I>for ever?</I>" Long afflictions try 
 our patience and often tire it. It is a common temptation, when trouble 
 lasts long, to think it will last always; despondency then turns into 
 despair, and those that have long been without joy begin, at last, to 
 be without hope. "Lord, tell me how long thou wilt hide thy face, and 
 assure me that it shall not be for ever, but that thou wilt return at 
 length in mercy to me, and then I shall the more easily bear my present 
 troubles."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His complaints stir up his prayers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+13:3,4"><I>v.</I> 3, 4</A>.

 We should never allow ourselves to make any complaints but what are fit 
 to be offered up to God and what drive us to our knees. Observe 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What his petitions are: <I>Consider</I> my case, <I>hear</I> my 
 complaints, and <I>enlighten my eyes,</I> that is, 

 (1.) "Strengthen my faith;" for faith is the eye of the soul, with 
 which it sees above, and sees through, the things of sense.  "Lord, 
 enable me to look beyond my present troubles and to foresee a happy 
 issue of them." 

 (2.) "Guide my way; enable me to look about me, that I may avoid the 
 snares which are laid for me." 

 (3.) "Refresh my soul with the joy of thy salvation." That which 
 revives the drooping spirits is said to <I>enlighten the eyes,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+14:27,Ezr+9:8">1 Sam. xiv. 27; Ezra ix. 8</A>.

 "Lord, scatter the cloud of melancholy which darkens my eyes, and let
 my countenance be made pleasant."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What his pleas are. He mentions his relation to God and interest in 
 him (<I>O Lord my God!</I>) and insists upon the greatness of the 
 peril, which called for speedy relief and succour. If his eyes were not 
 enlightened quickly, 

 (1.) He concludes that he must perish: "I shall <I>sleep the sleep of 
 death;</I> I cannot live under the weight of all this care and grief." 
 Nothing is more killing to a soul then the want of God's favour, 
 nothing more reviving than the return of it. 

 (2.) That then his enemies would triumph: "<I>Lest my enemy say,</I> So 
 would I have it; lest Saul, lest Satan, be gratified in my fall." It 
 would gratify the pride of his enemy: He will say, "<I>I have 
 prevailed,</I> I have gotten the day, and been too hard for him and his 
 God." It would gratify the malice of his enemies: They will <I>rejoice 
 when I am moved.</I> And will it be for God's honour to suffer them 
 thus to trample upon all that is sacred both in heaven and earth?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His prayers are soon turned into praises 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+13:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 But <I>my heart shall rejoice and I will sing to the Lord.</I> What a
 surprising change is here in a few lines! In the beginning of the psalm 
 we have him drooping, trembling, and ready to sink into melancholy and 
 despair; but, in the close of it, rejoicing in God, and elevated and 
 enlarged in his praises. See the power of faith, the power of prayer, 
 and how good it is to draw near to God. If we bring our cares and 
 griefs to the throne of grace, and leave them there, we may go away 
 like Hannah, and our <I>countenance will be no more sad,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:18">1 Sam. i. 18</A>.

 And here observe the method of his comfort. 

 1. God's mercy is the support of his faith. "My case is bad enough, and
 I am ready to think it deplorable, till I consider the infinite 
 goodness of God; but, finding I have that to trust to, I am comforted, 
 though I have no merit of my own. In former distresses <I>I have 
 trusted in the mercy of God,</I> and I never found that it failed me; 
 his mercy has in due time relieved me and my confidence in it has in 
 the mean time supported me.  Even in the depth of this distress, when 
 God hid his face from me, when without were fightings and within were 
 fears, yet <I>I trusted in the mercy of God</I> and that was as an 
 anchor in a storm, by the help of which, though I was tossed, I was not 
 overset." And still <I>I do trust in thy mercy;</I> so some read it. "I 
 refer myself to that, with an assurance that it will do well for me at 
 last." This he pleads with God, knowing what pleasure he takes <I>in 
 those that hope in his mercy,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:11">Ps.  cxlvii. 11</A>.

 2. His faith in God's mercy filled his heart with <I>joy in his 
 salvation;</I> for joy and peace come <I>by believing,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:13">Rom. xv. 13</A>.
 
 <I>Believing, you rejoice,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:8">1 Pet.  i. 8</A>.

 Having put his trust in the mercy of God, he is fully assured of
 salvation, and that his heart, which was now daily grieving, should 
 <I>rejoice in that salvation.</I> Though weeping endure long, joy will 
 return. 

 3. His joy in God's salvation would fill his mouth with songs of praise
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+13:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>I will sing unto the Lord,</I> sing in remembrance of what he has
 done formerly; though I should never recover the peace I have had, I 
 will die blessing God that ever I had it. He has dealt bountifully with 
 me formerly, and he shall have the glory of that, however he is pleased 
 to deal with me now. I will sing in hope of what he will do for me at 
 last, being confident that all will end well, will end everlastingly 
 well." But he speaks of it as a thing past <I>(He has dealt bountifully 
 with me</I>), because by faith he had received the earnest of the 
 salvation and he was as confident of it as if it had been done 
 already.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this psalm and praying it over, if we have not the same 
 complaints to make that David had, we must thank God that we have not,
 dread and deprecate his withdrawings, sympathize with those that are 
 troubled in mind, and encourage ourselves in our most holy faith and 
 joy.</P>
