 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It does not appear upon what occasion this psalm was penned nor whether
 upon any particular occasion. Some say David penned it when Saul
 persecuted him; others, when Absalom rebelled against him. But they are
 mere conjectures, which have not certainty enough to warrant us to
 expound the psalm by them. The apostle, in quoting part of this psalm
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:10">Rom. iii. 10</A>,

 &c.) to prove that Jews and Gentiles are all under sin

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:9">ver. 9</A>)

 and that all the world is guilty before God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+3:19">ver. 19</A>),

 leads us to understand it, in general, as a description of the
 depravity of human nature, the sinfulness of the sin we are conceived
 and born in, and the deplorable corruption of a great part of mankind,
 even of the world that lies in wickedness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:19">1 John v. 19</A>.

 But as in those psalms which are designed to discover our remedy in
 Christ there is commonly an allusion to David himself, yea, and some
 passages that are to be understood primarily of him (as in
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1-12,16:1-11,22:1-31">psalm ii., xvi,, xxii.</A>, 

 and others), so in this psalm, which is designed to discover our wound
 by sin, there is an allusion to David's enemies and persecutors, and 
 other oppressors of good men at that time, to whom some passages have 
 an immediate reference. In all the psalms from the 3rd to this (except 
 the 8th) David had been complaining of those that hated and persecuted
 him, insulted him and abused him; now here he traces all those bitter 
 streams to the fountain, the general corruption of nature, and sees 
 that not his enemies only, but all the children of men, were thus 
 corrupted. Here is, 

 I.  A charge exhibited against a wicked world, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:1">ver.  1</A>.

 II. The proof of the charge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 III. A serious expostulation with sinners, especially with persecutors,
 upon it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:4-6">ver.  4-6</A>.

 IV. A believing prayer for the salvation of Israel and a joyful
 expectation of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:7">ver. 7</A>.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The fool hath
 said in his heart, <I>There is</I> no God. They are corrupt, they have
 done abominable works, <I>there is</I> none that doeth good.
 &nbsp; 2  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to
 see if there were any that did understand, <I>and</I> seek God.
 &nbsp; 3  They are all gone aside, they are <I>all</I> together become
 filthy: <I>there is</I> none that doeth good, no, not one.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 If we apply our hearts as Solomon did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:25">Eccl. vii. 25</A>)

 <I>to search out the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and
 madness,</I> these verses will assist us in the search and will show us 
 that sin is exceedingly sinful. Sin is the disease of mankind, and it 
 appears here to be malignant and epidemic.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. See how malignant it is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>)
 
 in two things:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The contempt it puts upon the honour of God: for there is 
 something of practical atheism at the bottom of all sin. <I>The fool 
 hath said in his heart, There is no God.</I> We are sometimes tempted 
 to think, "Surely there never was so much atheism and profaneness as 
 there is in our days;" but we see the former days were no better; even 
 in David's time there were those who had arrived at such a height of 
 impiety as to deny the very being of a God and the first and 
 self-evident principles of religion. Observe, 

 [1.] The sinner here described. He is one that <I>saith in his heart, 
 There is no God;</I> he is an atheist. "There is no <I>Elohim,</I> no 
 Judge or governor of the world, no providence presiding over the 
 affairs of men." They cannot doubt of the being of God, but will 
 question his dominion. He says this <I>in his heart;</I> it is not his 
 judgment, but his imagination. He cannot satisfy himself that there is 
 none, but he wishes there were none, and pleases himself with the fancy 
 that it is possible there may be none. He cannot be sure there is one, 
 and therefore he is willing to think there is none. He dares not speak 
 it out, lest he be confuted, and so undeceived, but he whispers it 
 secretly <I>in his heart,</I> for the silencing of the clamours of his 
 conscience and the emboldening of himself in his evil ways. 

 [2.] The character of this sinner. He is a fool; he is simple and 
 unwise, and this is an evidence of it; he is wicked and profane, and 
 this is the cause of it. Note, Atheistical thoughts are very foolish 
 wicked thoughts, and they are at the bottom of a great deal of the 
 wickedness that is in this world. The word of God is a <I>discerner of 
 these thoughts,</I> and puts a just brand on him that harbours them. 
 <I>Nabal is his name, and folly is with him;</I> for he thinks against 
 the clearest light, against his own knowledge and convictions, and the 
 common sentiments of all the wise and sober part of mankind. No man 
 will say, <I>There is no God</I> till he is so hardened in sin that it 
 has become his interest that there should be none to call him to an 
 account.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) The disgrace and debasement it puts upon the nature of man. 
 Sinners are corrupt, quite degenerated from what man was in his 
 innocent estate: <I>They have become filthy</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 putrid. All their faculties are so disordered that they have become
 odious to their Maker and utterly incapable of answering the ends of 
 their creation.  <I>They are corrupt</I> indeed; for,

 [1.] They do no good, but are the unprofitable burdens of the earth; 
 they do God no service, bring him no honour, nor do themselves any real 
 kindness. 

 [2.] They do a great deal of hurt. <I>They have done abominable 
 works,</I> for such all sinful works are. Sin is an abomination to God; 
 it is that <I>abominable thing which he hates</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+44:4">Jer. xliv. 4</A>),

 and, sooner or later, it will be so to the sinner; it will be <I>found
 to be hateful</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:2">Ps. xxxvi. 2</A>),

 an <I>abomination of desolation,</I> that is, making desolate,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:15">Matt. xxiv. 15</A>.

 This follows upon their saying, <I>There is no God;</I> for those that 
 <I>profess they know God, but in works deny him, are abominable, and to 
 every good work reprobate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+1:16">Tit.  i. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. See how epidemic this disease is; it has infected the whole race of 
 mankind. To prove this, God himself is here brought in for a witness, 
 and he is an eye-witness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) His enquiry: <I>The Lord looked down from heaven,</I> a place of 
 prospect, which commands this lower world; thence, with an all-seeing 
 eye, he took a view of all <I>the children of men,</I> and the question 
 was, <I>Whether there were any</I> among them <I>that did 
 understand</I> themselves aright, their duty and interests, and did 
 seek God and set him before them. He that made this search was not only 
 one that could find out a good man if he was to be found, though ever 
 so obscure, but one that would be glad to find out one, and would be 
 sure to take notice of him, as of Noah in the old world. 

 (2.) The result of this enquiry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Upon search, upon his search, it appeared, <I>They have all gone
 aside,</I> the apostasy is universal, <I>there is none that doeth good, 
 no, not one,</I> till the free and mighty grace of God has wrought a 
 change. Whatever good is in any of the children of men, or is done by 
 them, it is not of themselves; it is God's work in them. When God had 
 made the world he looked upon his own work, and <I>all was very 
 good</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:31">Gen. i. 31</A>);

 but, some time after, he looked upon man's work, and, behold, all was
 very bad

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:5">Gen. vi. 5</A>),

 every operation of the thought of man's heart was evil, only evil, and
 that continually. They have gone aside from the right of their duty, 
 the way that leads to happiness, and have turned into the paths of the 
 destroyer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this let us lament the corruption of our own nature, and see 
 what need we have of the grace of God; and, since that which is born of 
 the flesh is flesh, let us not marvel that we are told we must be born 
 again.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
 people <I>as</I> they eat bread, and call not upon the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 5  There were they in great fear: for God <I>is</I> in the generation
 of the righteous.
 &nbsp; 6  Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses the psalmist endeavours,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To convince sinners of the evil and danger of the way they are in, 
 how secure soever they are in that way. Three things he shows them, 
 which, it may be, they are not very willing to see--their wickedness,
 their folly, and their danger, while they are apt to believe themselves 
 very wise, and good, and safe. See here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Their wickedness. This is described in four instances:--

 (1.) They are themselves <I>workers of iniquity;</I> they design it, 
 they practise it, and take as much pleasure in it as ever any man did 
 in his business. 

 (2.) They <I>eat up God's people</I> with as much greediness <I>as they
 eat bread,</I> such an innate and inveterate enmity they have to them, 
 and so heartily do they desire their ruin, because they really hate 
 God, whose people they are. It is meat and drink to persecutors to be 
 doing mischief; it is as agreeable to them as their necessary food. 
 They eat up God's people easily, daily, securely, without either check 
 of conscience when they do it or remorse of conscience when they have 
 done it; as Joseph's brethren <I>cast him into a pit</I> and then 
 <I>sat down to eat bread,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+37:24,25">Gen. xxxvii. 24, 25</A>.

 See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+3:2,3">Mic. iii. 2, 3</A>.

 (3.) They <I>call not upon the Lord.</I> Note, Those that care not for 
 God's people, for God's poor, care not for God himself, but live in 
 contempt of him. The reason why people run into all manner of 
 wickedness, even the worst, is because they do not call upon God for 
 his grace. What good can be expected from those that live without 
 prayer? 

 (4.) They <I>shame the counsel of the poor,</I> and upbraid them with 
 making God their refuge, as David's enemies upbraided him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:1">Ps. xi. 1</A>.
 
 Note, Those are very wicked indeed, and have a great deal to answer
 for, who not only shake off religion, and live without it themselves, 
 but say and do what they can to put others out of conceit with it that 
 are well-inclined--with the duties of it, as if they were mean, 
 melancholy, and unprofitable, and with the privileges of it, as if they 
 were insufficient to make a man safe and happy. Those that banter 
 religion and religious people will find, to their cost, it is ill 
 jesting with edged-tools and dangerous persecuting those that make God 
 their refuge.  <I>Be you not mockers, lest your bands be made 
 strong.</I> He shows them,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their folly: <I>They have no knowledge;</I> this is obvious, for if 
 they had any knowledge of God, if they did rightly understand 
 themselves, and would but consider things as men, they would not be so 
 abusive and barbarous as they are to the people of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Their danger 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>There were they in great fear.</I> There, where they ate up God's
 people, their own consciences condemned what they did, and filled them 
 with secret terrors; they sweetly sucked the blood of the saints, but 
 in their bowels it is turned, and become the gall of asps. Many 
 instances there have been of proud and cruel persecutors who have been 
 made like Pashur, <I>Magormissabibs--terrors to themselves</I> and all 
 about them. Those that will not fear God perhaps may be made to fear at 
 the shaking of a leaf.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He endeavours to comfort the people of God, 

 1. With what they have.  They have God's presence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 He <I>is in the generation of the righteous.</I> They have his
 protection

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 <I>The Lord is their refuge.</I> This is as much their security as it
 is the terror of their enemies, who may jeer them for their confidence 
 in God, but cannot jeer them out of it. In the judgment-day it will add 
 to the terror and confusion of sinners to see God own the generation of 
 the righteous, which they have hated and bantered. 

 2. With what they hope for; and that is the <I>salvation of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 When David was driven out by Absalom and his rebellious accomplices, he
 comforted himself with an assurance that god would in due time <I>turn 
 again his captivity,</I> to the joy of all his good subjects. But 
 surely this pleasing prospect looks further. He had, in the beginning 
 of the psalm, lamented the general corruption of mankind; and, in the 
 melancholy view of that, wishes for the salvation which should be 
 wrought out by the Redeemer, who was expected <I>co come to Zion,</I> 
 to <I>turn away ungodliness from Jacob,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+11:26">Rom. xi. 26</A>.

 The world is bad; O that the Messiah would come and change its
 character!  There is a universal corruption; O for the times of 
 reformation! Those will be as joyful times as these are melancholy 
 ones. Then shall God <I>turn again the captivity of his people;</I> for 
 the Redeemer shall <I>ascend on high, and lead captivity captive,</I> 
 and Jacob shall then rejoice. The triumphs of Zion's King will be the 
 joys of Zion's children. The second coming of Christ, finally to 
 extinguish the dominion of sin and Satan, will be the completing of 
 this salvation, which is the hope, and will be the joy, of every 
 Israelite indeed. With the assurance of that we should, in singing 
 this, comfort ourselves and one another, with reference to the present 
 sins of sinners and sufferings of saints.</P>
