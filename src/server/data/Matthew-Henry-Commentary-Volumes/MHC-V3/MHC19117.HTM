 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is short and sweet; I doubt the reason why we sing it so 
 often as we do is for the shortness of it; but, if we rightly 
 understood and considered it, we should sing it oftener for the 
 sweetness of it, especially to us sinners of the Gentiles, on whom it 
 casts a very favourable eye. Here is, 

 I. A solemn call to all nations to praise God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+117:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. Proper matter for that praise suggested, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+117:2">ver. 2</A>.

 We are soon weary indeed of well-doing if, in singing this psalm, we
 keep not up those pious and devout affections with which the spiritual 
 sacrifice of praise ought to be kindled and kept burning.</P>

 There is a great deal of gospel in this psalm. The apostle has 
 furnished us with a key to it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:11">Rom. xv. 11</A>),

 where he quotes it as a proof that the gospel was to be preached to,
 and would be entertained by, the Gentile nations, which yet was so 
 great a stumbling-block to the Jews. Why should that offend them when 
 it is said, and they themselves had often sung it, <I>Praise the Lord, 
 all you Gentiles, and laud him, all you people.</I> Some of the Jewish 
 writers confess that this psalm refers to the kingdom of the Messiah; 
 nay, one of them has a fancy that it consists of two verses to signify 
 that in the days of the Messiah God should be glorified by two sorts of 
 people, by the Jews, according to the law of Moses, and by the 
 Gentiles, according to the seven precepts of the sons of Noah, which 
 yet should make one church, as these two verses make one psalm. We have 
 here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The vast extent of the gospel church, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+117:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 For many ages in Judah only was God known and his name praised. The
 sons of Levi and the seed of Israel praised him, but the rest of the 
 nations <I>praised gods of wood and stone</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+5:4">Dan. v. 4</A>),

 while there was no devotion at all paid, at least none openly, that we 
 know of, to the living and true God. But here <I>all nations</I> are 
 called to praise the Lord, which could not be applied to the 
 Old-Testament times, both because this call was not then given to any 
 of the Gentile nations, much less to all, in a language they 
 understood, and because, unless the people of the land became Jews and 
 were circumcised, they were not admitted to praise God with them. But 
 the gospel of Christ is ordered to be preached to all nations, and by 
 him the partition-wall is taken down, and those that were <I>afar 
 off</I> are <I>made nigh.</I> This was the mystery which was hidden in 
 prophecy for many ages, but was at length revealed in the 
 accomplishment, <I>That the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:3,6">Eph. iii. 3, 6</A>.

 Observe here, 

 1. Who should be admitted into the church--<I>all nations</I> and
 <I>all people.</I> The original words are the same that are used for 
 the <I>heathen that rage</I> and <I>the people that imagine</I> against 
 Christ

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1">Ps. ii. 1</A>);

 those that had been enemies to his kingdom should become his willing 
 subjects. The gospel of the kingdom was to be preached <I>to all the 
 world, for a witness to all nations,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:14,Mk+16:15">Matt. xxiv. 14; Mark xvi. 15</A>.

 All nations shall be called, and to some of all nations the call shall 
 be effectual, and they shall be discipled. 

 2. How their admission into the church is foretold--by a repeated call 
 to <I>praise him.</I> The tidings of the gospel, being sent to all 
 nations, should give them cause to praise God; the institution of 
 gospel-ordinances would give them leave and opportunity to praise God; 
 and the power of gospel-grace would give them hearts to praise him. 
 Those are highly favoured whom God invites by his word and inclines by 
 his Spirit to praise him, and so makes to be to him for a name and a 
 praise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:11">Jer. xiii. 11</A>.

 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9,10">Rev. vii. 9, 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The unsearchable riches of gospel-grace, which are to be the matter 
 or our praise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+117:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 In the gospel, those celebrated attributes of God, his mercy and his
 truth, shine most brightly in themselves and most comfortably to us; 
 and the apostle, where he quotes this psalm, takes notice of these as 
 the two great things for which the Gentiles should glorify God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+15:8,9">Rom. xv. 8, 9</A>),

 for <I>the truth of God</I> and for <I>his mercy.</I> We that enjoy the 
 gospel have reason to praise the Lord, 

 1. For the power of his mercy: <I>His merciful kindness is great
 towards us;</I> it is <I>strong</I> (so the word signifies); it is 
 <I>mighty</I> for the pardon of <I>mighty sins</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+5:12">Amos v. 12</A>)

 and for the working out of a mighty salvation. 

 2. For the perpetuity of his truth: <I>The truth of the Lord endures 
 for ever.</I> It was mercy, mere mercy, to the Gentiles, that the 
 gospel was sent among them. It was merciful kindness prevailing towards 
 them above their deserts; and in it the <I>truth of the Lord,</I> of 
 his promise made unto the fathers, <I>endures for ever;</I> for, though 
 the Jews were hardened and expelled, yet the promise took its effect in 
 the believing Gentiles, the spiritual seed of Abraham. God's mercy is 
 the fountain of all our comforts and his truth the foundation of all 
 our hopes, and therefore for both we must praise the Lord.</P>
