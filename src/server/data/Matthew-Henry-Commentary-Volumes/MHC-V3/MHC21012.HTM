 The wise and penitent preacher is here closing his sermon; and he
 closes it, not only like a good orator, but like a good preacher, with
 that which was likely to make the best impressions and which he wished
 might be powerful and lasting upon his hearers. Here is,

 I. An exhortation to young people to begin betimes to be religious and
 not to put it off to old age

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:1">ver. 1</A>),

 enforced with arguments taken from the calamities of old age

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>)
 
 and the great change that death will make upon us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 II. A repetition of the great truth he had undertaken to prove in this
 discourse, the vanity of the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:8">ver. 8</A>.

 III. A confirmation and recommendation of what he had written in this 
 and his other books, as worthy to be duly weighed and considered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:9">ver. 9</A>.

 IV. The whole matter summed up and concluded, with a charge to all to
 be truly religious, in consideration of the judgment to come, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:13,14">ver. 13, 14</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the
 evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say,
 I have no pleasure in them;
 &nbsp; 2  While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be
 not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:
 &nbsp; 3  In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and
 the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease
 because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be
 darkened,
 &nbsp; 4  And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of
 the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the
 bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;
 &nbsp; 5  Also <I>when</I> they shall be afraid of <I>that which is</I> high, and
 fears <I>shall be</I> in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish,
 and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail:
 because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the
 streets:
 &nbsp; 6  Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be
 broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel
 broken at the cistern.
 &nbsp; 7  Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the
 spirit shall return unto God who gave it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A call to young people to think of God, and mind their duty to him,
 when they are young: <I>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy 
 youth.</I> This is, 

 1. The royal preacher's application of his sermon concerning the vanity
 of the world and every thing in it. "You that are young flatter 
 yourselves with expectations of great things from it, but believe those 
 that have tried it; it yields no solid satisfaction to a soul; 
 therefore, that you may not be deceived by this vanity, nor too much 
 disturbed by it, <I>remember your Creator,</I> and so guard yourselves 
 against the mischiefs that arise from the vanity of the creature." 

 2. It is the royal physician's antidote against the particular
 diseases of youth, the love of mirth, and the indulgence of sensual 
 pleasures, the vanity which childhood and youth are subject to; to 
 prevent and cure this, <I>remember thy Creator.</I> Here is,

 (1.) A great duty pressed upon us, to <I>remember</I> God as our 
 <I>creator,</I> not only to remember that God is our Creator, that he 
 <I>made us and not we ourselves,</I> and is therefore our rightful Lord 
 and owner, but we must engage ourselves to him with the considerations 
 which his being our Creator lay us under, and pay him the honour and 
 duty which we owe him as our Creator. <I>Remember thy Creators;</I> the 
 word is plural, as it is 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+35:10">Job xxxv. 10</A>,

 <I>Where is God my Makers?</I> For God said, <I>Let us make man,</I>
 us, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

 (2.) The proper season for this duty--<I>in the days of thy youth,</I> 
 the <I>days of thy choice</I> (so some), thy choice days, thy choosing 
 days. "Begin in the beginning of thy days to remember him from whom 
 thou hadst thy being, and go on according to that good beginning. Call 
 him to mind when thou art young, and keep him in mind throughout all 
 the days of thy youth, and never forget him. Guard thus against the 
 temptations of youth, and thus improve the advantages of it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A reason to enforce this command: <I>While the evil days come not, 
 and the years of which thou shalt say I have no pleasure in 
 them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Do it quickly, 

 (1.) "Before sickness and death come. Do it while thou livest, for it 
 will be too late to do it when death has removed thee from this state 
 of trial and probation to that of recompence and retribution." The days 
 of sickness and death are <I>the days of evil,</I> terrible to nature, 
 <I>evil days</I> indeed to those that have forgotten their Creator. 
 These <I>evil days</I> will <I>come</I> sooner or later; as yet they 
 <I>come not,</I> for God is <I>long-suffering to us-ward,</I> and gives 
 us <I>space to repent;</I> the continuing of life is but the deferring 
 of death, and, while life is continued and death deferred, it concerns 
 us to prepare, and get the property of death altered, that we may die 
 comfortably. 

 (2.) Before old age comes, which, if death prevent not, will come, and 
 they will be <I>years of which we shall say, We have no pleasure in 
 them,</I>--when we shall not relish the delights of sense, as Barzillai 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:35">2 Sam. xix. 35</A>),

 --when we shall be loaded with bodily infirmities, old and blind, or
 old and lame,--when we shall be taken off from our usefulness, and our 
 <I>strength</I> shall be <I>labour and sorrow,</I>--when we shall 
 either have parted with our relations, and all our old friends, or be 
 afflicted in them and see them weary of us,--when we shall feel 
 ourselves die by inches. These <I>years draw nigh,</I> when <I>all that 
 comes</I> will be <I>vanity,</I> the remaining months all months of 
 vanity, and there will be <I>no pleasure</I> but in the reflection of a 
 good life on earth and the expectation of a better life in heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. These two arguments he enlarges upon in the following verses, only
 inverting the order, and shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How many are the calamities of old age, and that if we should live 
 to be old, our days will be such as we shall <I>have no pleasure 
 in,</I> which is a good reason why we should return to God, and make 
 our peace with him, <I>in the days of our youth,</I> and not put it off 
 till we come to be old; for it will be no thanks to us to leave the 
 pleasures of sin when they have left us, nor to return to God when need 
 forces us. It is the greatest absurdity and ingratitude imaginable to 
 give the cream and flower of our days to the devil, and reserve the 
 bran, and refuse, and dregs of them for God; this is offering <I>the 
 torn, and the lame, and the sick for sacrifice;</I> and, besides, old 
 age being thus clogged with infirmities, it is the greatest folly 
 imaginable to put off that needful work till then, which requires the 
 best of our strength, when our faculties are in their prime, and 
 especially to make the work more difficult by a longer continuance in 
 sin, and, laying up treasures of guilt in the conscience, to add to the 
 burdens of age and make them much heavier. If the calamities of age 
 will be such as are here represented, we shall have need of something 
 to support and comfort us then, and nothing will be more effectual to 
 do that than the testimony of our consciences for us that we begin 
 betimes to remember our Creator and have not since laid aside the 
 remembrance of him. How can we expect God should help us when we are 
 old, if we will not serve him when we are young? See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:17,18">Ps. lxxi. 17, 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [1.] The decays and infirmities of old age are here elegantly described 
 in figurative expressions, which have some difficulty in them to us 
 now, who are not acquainted with the common phrases and metaphors used 
 in Solomon's age and language; but the general scope is plain--to show 
 how uncomfortable, generally, the days of old age are. <I>First,</I> 
 Then <I>the sun</I> and <I>the light</I> of it, <I>the moon</I> and 
 <I>the stars,</I> and the light which they borrow from it, will <I>be 
 darkened.</I> They look dim to old people, in consequence of the decay 
 of their sight; their countenance is clouded, and the beauty and lustre 
 of it are eclipsed; their intellectual powers and faculties, which are 
 as lights in the soul, are weakened; their understanding and memory 
 fail them, and their apprehension is not so quick nor their fancy so 
 lively as it has been; the days of their mirth are over (light is often 
 put for joy and prosperity) and they have not the pleasure either of 
 the converse of the day or the repose of the night, for both <I>the 
 sun</I> and <I>the moon</I> are darkened to them. <I>Secondly,</I> Then 
 <I>the clouds return after the rain;</I> as, when the weather is 
 disposed to wet, no sooner has one cloud blown over than another 
 succeeds it, so it is with old people, when they have got free from one 
 pain or ailment, they are seized with another, so that their distempers 
 are <I>like a continual dropping in a very rainy day.</I> The end of 
 one trouble is, in this world, but the beginning of another, and deep 
 calls unto deep. Old people are often afflicted with defluxions of 
 rheum, like soaking rain, after which still more clouds return, feeding 
 the humour, so that it is continually grievous, and therein the body, 
 as it were, melts away. <I>Thirdly,</I> Then <I>the keepers of the 
 house tremble.</I> The head, which is as the watch-tower, shakes, and 
 the arms and hands, which are ready for the preservation of the body, 
 shake too, and grow feeble, upon every sudden approach and attack of 
 danger. That vigour of the animal spirits which used to be exerted for 
 self-defence fails and cannot do its office; old people are easily 
 dispirited and discouraged. <I>Fourthly,</I> Then <I>the strong men 
 shall bow themselves;</I> the legs and thighs, which used to support 
 the body, and bear its weight, bend, and cannot serve for travelling as 
 they have done, but are soon tired. Old men that have been in their 
 time <I>strong men</I> become weak and stoop for <I>age,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:4">Zech. viii. 4</A>.
 
 <I>God takes no pleasure in the legs of a man</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:10">Ps. cxlvii. 10</A>),

 for their strength will soon fail; but <I>in the Lord Jehovah there is
 everlasting strength;</I> he has everlasting arms. <I>Fifthly,</I> Then 
 the <I>grinders cease because they are few;</I> the teeth, with which 
 we grind our meat and prepare it for concoction, cease to do their 
 part, <I>because they are few.</I> They are rotted and broken, and 
 perhaps have been drawn because they ached. Some old people have lost 
 all their teeth, and others have but few left; and this infirmity is 
 the more considerable because the meat, not being well chewed, for want 
 of teeth, is not well digested, which has as much influence as any 
 thing upon the other decays of age. <I>Sixthly, Those that look out of 
 the windows</I> are <I>darkened;</I> the eyes wax dim, as Isaac's

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:1">Gen. xxvii. 1</A>),

 and Ahijah's, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+14:4">1 Kings xiv. 4</A>.

 Moses was a rare instance of one who, when 120 years old, had good
 eye-sight, but ordinarily the sight decays in old people as soon as any 
 thing, and it is a mercy to them that art helps nature with spectacles. 
 We have need to improve our sight well while we have it, because the 
 light of the eyes may be gone before the light of life. <I>Seventhly, 
 The doors are shut in the streets.</I> Old people keep within doors, 
 and care not for going abroad to entertainments. The lips, the doors of 
 the mouth, are shut in eating, because the teeth are gone and <I>the 
 sound of the grinding</I> with them <I>is low,</I> so that they have 
 not that command of their meat in their mouths which they used to have; 
 they cannot digest their meat, and therefore little grist is brought to 
 the mill. <I>Eightly,</I> Old people <I>rise up at the voice of the 
 bird.</I> They have no sound sleep as young people have, but a little 
 thing disturbs them, even the chirping of a bird; they cannot rest for 
 coughing, and therefore rise up at cock-crowing, as soon as any body is 
 stirring; or they are apt to be jealous, and timorous, and full of 
 care, which breaks their sleep and makes them rise early; or they are 
 apt to be superstitious, and <I>rise up</I> as in a fright, <I>at those 
 voices of birds,</I> as of ravens, or screech-owls, which soothsayers 
 call ominous. <I>Ninthly,</I> With them <I>all the daughters of
 music</I> are <I>brought low.</I> They have neither voice nor ear, can 
 neither sing themselves nor take any pleasure, as Solomon had done in 
 the days of his youth, in <I>singing men, and singing women, and 
 musical instruments,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:8"><I>ch.</I> ii. 8</A>.

 Old people grow hard of hearing, and unapt to distinguish sounds and
 voices. <I>Tenthly,</I> They are <I>afraid of that which is high,</I>
 afraid to go to the top of any high place, either because, for want of 
 breath, they cannot reach it, or, their heads being giddy or their legs 
 failing them, they dare not venture to it, or they frighten themselves 
 with fancying that <I>that which is high</I> will fall upon them. 
 <I>Fear</I> is <I>in the way;</I> they can neither ride nor walk with 
 their former boldness, but are afraid of every thing that lies in their 
 way, lest it throw them down. <I>Eleventhly, The almond-tree
 flourishes.</I> The old man's hair has grown white, so that his head 
 looks like an almond-tree in the blossom. The almond-tree blossoms
 before any other tree, and therefore fitly shows what haste old age 
 makes in seizing upon men; it prevents their expectations and comes 
 faster upon them than they thought of. Gray hairs are here and there 
 upon them, and they perceive it not. <I>Twelfthly, The grasshopper is
 a burden and desire fails.</I> Old men can bear nothing; the lightest 
 thing sits heavily upon them, both on their bodies and on their minds, 
 a little thing sinks and breaks them. Perhaps <I>the grasshopper</I>
 was some food that was looked upon to be very light of digestion (John
 Baptist's meat <I>was locusts</I>), but even that lies heavily upon an
 old man's stomach, and therefore <I>desire fails,</I> he has no
 appetite to his meat, neither shall he <I>regard the desire of
 woman,</I> as that king,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+11:37">Dan. xi. 37</A>.

 Old men become mindless and listless, and the pleasures of sense are to
 them tasteless and sapless.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 [2.] It is probable that Solomon wrote this when he was himself old, 
 and could speak feelingly of the infirmities of age, which perhaps grew 
 the faster upon him for the indulgence he had given himself in sensual 
 pleasures. Some old people bear up better than others under the decays 
 of age, but, more or less, the days of old age are and will be <I>evil 
 days</I> and of little pleasure. Great care therefore should be taken 
 to pay respect and honour to old people, that they may have something 
 to balance these grievances and nothing may be done to add to them. And 
 all this, put together, makes up a good reason why we should 
 <I>remember our Creator in the days of our youth,</I> that he may 
 remember us with favour when these <I>evil days come,</I> and his 
 comforts may delight our souls when the delights of sense are in a 
 manner worn off.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He shows how great a change death will make with us, which will be 
 either the prevention or the period of the miseries of old age. Nothing 
 else will keep them off, nor any thing else cure them. "Therefore 
 <I>remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth,</I> because death is 
 certainly before thee, perhaps it is very near thee, and it is a 
 serious thing to die, and thou shouldst feel concerned with the utmost 
 care and diligence to prepare for it." 

 [1.] Death will fix us in an unchangeable state: <I>Man</I> shall then
 <I>go to his long home,</I> and all these infirmities and decays of age 
 are harbingers of and advances towards that awful remove. At death 
 <I>man goes</I> from this world and all the employments and enjoyments 
 of it. He has gone for good and all, as to his present state. He has 
 gone <I>home,</I> for here he was a stranger and pilgrim; both soul and 
 body go to the place whence they came,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He has gone to his rest, to the place where he is to fix. He has gone 
 <I>to his home, to the house of his world</I> (so some), for this world 
 is not his. He has gone <I>to his long home,</I> for the days of his 
 lying in the grave will be many. He has gone <I>to his house of 
 eternity,</I> not only to his house whence he shall never return to 
 this world, but to the house where he must be for ever. This should 
 make us willing to die, that, at death, we must <I>go home;</I> and why 
 should we not long to go to our Father's house? And this should quicken 
 us to get ready to die, that we must then go to our <I>long home,</I> 
 to an <I>everlasting habitation.</I> 

 [2.] Death will be an occasion of sorrow to our friends that love us. 
 When <I>man goes to his long home the mourners go about the 
 streets</I>--the real mourners, and those, as now with us, 
 distinguished by their habits as they go along the streets,--the 
 mourners for ceremony, that were hired to weep for the dead, both to 
 express and to excite the real mourning. When we die we not only
 remove to a melancholy house before us, but we leave a melancholy house 
 behind us. Tears are a tribute due to the dead, and this, among other 
 circumstances, makes it a serious thing to die. But in vain do we <I>go 
 to the house of mourning,</I> and see <I>the mourners go about the 
 streets,</I> if it do not help to make us serious and pious mourners in 
 the closet. 

 [3.] Death will dissolve the frame of nature and take down the earthly 
 house of this tabernacle, which is elegantly described,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Then shall <I>the silver cord,</I> by which soul and body were 
 wonderfully fastened together, <I>be loosed,</I> that sacred knot 
 untied, and those old friends be forced to part; then shall <I>the 
 golden bowl,</I> which held the waters of life for us, <I>be 
 broken;</I> then shall <I>the pitcher</I> with which we used to fetch 
 up water, for the constant support of life and the repair of its 
 decays, <I>be broken,</I> even <I>at the fountain,</I> so that it can 
 fetch up no more; and <I>the wheel</I> (all those organs that serve for 
 the collecting and distributing of nourishment) shall be <I>broken,</I> 
 and disabled to do their office any more. The body shall become like a 
 watch when the spring is broken, the motion of all the wheels is 
 stopped and they all stand still; the machine is taken to pieces; the 
 heart beats no more, nor does the blood circulate. Some apply this to 
 the ornaments and utensils of life; rich people must, at death, leave 
 behind them their clothing and furniture of <I>silver</I> and 
 <I>gold,</I> and poor people their earthen <I>pitchers,</I> and the 
 drawers of water will have their <I>wheel broken.</I> 

 [4.] Death will resolve us into our first principles,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Man is a strange sort of creature, a ray of heaven united to a clod of 
 earth; at death these are separated, and each goes to the place whence 
 it came. <I>First,</I> The body, that clod of clay, <I>returns to</I>
 its own <I>earth.</I> It is made of <I>the earth;</I> Adam's body was 
 so, and we are of the same mould; it is a house of clay. At death it is 
 laid in <I>the earth,</I> and in a little time will be resolved into 
 earth, not to be distinguished from common earth, according to the 
 sentence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:19">Gen. iii. 19</A>),

 <I>Dust thou art and</I> therefore <I>to dust thou shalt return.</I>
 Let us not therefore indulge the appetites of the body, nor pamper it 
 (it will be worms' meat shortly), nor let <I>sin reign in our mortal 
 bodies,</I> for they are mortal, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:12">Rom. vi. 12</A>.

 <I>Secondly,</I> The soul, that beam of light, <I>returns to</I> that
 <I>God</I> who, when he <I>made man of the dust of the ground, breathed 
 into him the breath of life,</I> to make him <I>a living soul</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+2:7">Gen. ii. 7</A>),

 and forms the spirit of every man within him. When the fire consumes
 the wood the flame ascends, and the ashes <I>return to the earth</I> 
 out of which the wood grew. The soul does not die with the body; it is 
 <I>redeemed from the power of the grave</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:15">Ps. xlix. 15</A>);

 it can subsist without it and will in a state of separation from it, as
 the candle burns, and burns brighter, when it is taken out of the dark 
 lantern. It removes to the world of spirits, to which it is allied. It 
 goes <I>to God</I> as a Judge, to give account of itself, and to be 
 lodged either with <I>the spirits in prison</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+3:19">1 Pet. iii. 19</A>)

 or with <I>the spirits in paradise</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:43">Luke xxiii. 43</A>),

 according to what was done in the body. This makes death terrible to
 the wicked, whose souls go to God as an avenger, and comfortable to the 
 godly, whose souls go to God as a Father, into whose hands they 
 cheerfully commit them, through a Mediator, out of whom sinners may 
 justly dread to think of going <I>to God.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all <I>is</I> vanity.
 &nbsp; 9  And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught
 the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out,
 <I>and</I> set in order many proverbs.
 &nbsp; 10  The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and <I>that
 which was</I> written <I>was</I> upright, <I>even</I> words of truth.
 &nbsp; 11  The words of the wise <I>are</I> as goads, and as nails fastened
 <I>by</I> the masters of assemblies, <I>which</I> are given from one
 shepherd.

 books <I>there is</I> no end; and much study <I>is</I> a weariness of the

 Solomon is here drawing towards a close, and is loth to part till he 
 has gained his point, and prevailed with his hearers, with his readers, 
 to seek for that satisfaction in God only and in their duty to him 
 which they can never find in the creature.</P>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 1. As that which he had fully demonstrated the truth of, and so made 
 good his undertaking in this sermon, wherein he had kept closely to his 
 text, and both his reasons and his application were to the purpose. 

 2. As that which he desired to inculcate both upon others and upon
 himself, to have it ready, and to make use of it upon all occasions. We 
 see it daily proved; let it therefore be daily improved: <I>Vanity of 
 vanities, all is vanity.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He recommends what he had written upon this subject by divine 
 direction and inspiration to our serious consideration. The words of 
 this book are faithful, and well worthy our acceptance, for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They are the words of one that was a convert, a penitent, that could 
 speak by dear-bought experience of the vanity of the world and the 
 folly of expecting great things from it. He was <I>Coheleth,</I> one 
 gathered in from his wanderings and gathered home to that God from whom 
 he had revolted. <I>Vanity of vanities, saith the</I> penitent. All 
 true penitents are convinced of the vanity of the world, for they find 
 it can do nothing to ease them of the burden of sin, which they 
 complain of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They are the words of one that was wise, wiser than any, endued with 
 extraordinary measures of wisdom, famous for it among his neighbours, 
 who all sought unto him <I>to hear his wisdom,</I> and therefore a 
 competent judge of this matter, not only wise as a prince, but wise as 
 a preacher--and preachers have need of wisdom to win souls.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He was one that made it his business to do good, and to use wisdom 
 aright. <I>Because</I> he <I>was</I> himself <I>wise,</I> but knew he 
 had not his wisdom for himself, any more than he had it from himself, 
 <I>he still taught the people</I> that <I>knowledge</I> which he had 
 found useful to himself, and hoped might be so to them too. It is the 
 interest of princes to have their people well taught in religion, and 
 no disparagement to them to teach them themselves <I>the good knowledge 
 of the Lord,</I> but their duty to encourage those whose office it is 
 to teach them and to speak comfortably to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+30:22">2 Chron. xxx. 22</A>.

 Let not the people, the common people, be despised, no, not by the
 wisest and greatest, as either unworthy or incapable of good knowledge: 
 even those that are well taught have need to be <I>still taught,</I> 
 that they may grow in knowledge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He took a great deal of pains and care to do good, designing to 
 <I>teach the people knowledge.</I> He did not put them off with any 
 thing that came next to hand, because they were inferior people, and he 
 a very wise man, but considering the worth of the souls he preached to 
 and the weight of the subject he preached on, he <I>gave good heed</I> 
 to what he read and heard from others, that, having stocked himself 
 well, he might <I>bring out of his treasury things new and old.</I> He 
 <I>gave good heed</I> to what he spoke and wrote himself, and was 
 choice and exact in it; all he did was elaborate. 

 (1.) He chose the most profitable way of preaching, by proverbs or 
 short sentences, which would be more easily apprehended and remembered 
 than long and laboured periods. 

 (2.) He did not content himself with a few parables, or wise sayings, 
 and repeat them again and again, but he furnished himself with <I>many 
 proverbs,</I> a great variety of grave discourses, that he might have 
 something to say on every occasion. 

 (3.) He did not only give them such observations as were obvious and 
 trite, but he <I>sought out</I> such as were surprising and uncommon; 
 he dug into the mines of knowledge, and did not merely pick up what lay 
 on the surface. 

 (4.) He did not deliver his heads and observations at random, as they 
 came to mind, but methodized them, and <I>set them in order</I> that 
 they might appear in more strength and lustre.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He put what he had to say in such a dress as he thought would be 
 most pleasing: <I>He sought to find out acceptable words,</I> words of 
 delight 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 he took care that good matter might not be spoiled by a bad style, and 
 by the ungratefulness and incongruity of the expression. Ministers 
 should study, not for the big words, nor the fine words, but 
 <I>acceptable words,</I> such as are likely to please men for their 
 good, to edification, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:33">1 Cor. x. 33</A>.

 Those that would win souls must contrive how to win upon them with
 <I>words fitly spoken.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. That which he wrote for our instruction is of unquestionable
 certainty, and what we may rely upon: <I>That which was written was 
 upright</I> and sincere, according to the real sentiments of the 
 penman, even <I>words of truth,</I> the exact representation of the 
 thing as it is. Those are sure not to miss their way who are guided by 
 these words. What good will <I>acceptable words</I> do us if they be 
 not <I>upright and words of truth?</I> Most are for smooth things, that 
 flatter them, rather than right things, that direct them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:10">Isa. xxx. 10</A>),
 
 but to those that understand themselves, and their own interest,
 <I>words of truth</I> will always be <I>acceptable words.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 7. That which he and other holy men wrote will be of great use and 
 advantage to us, especially being inculcated upon us by the exposition 
 of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 Here observe, 

 (1.) A double benefit accruing to us from divine truths if duly applied 
 and improved; they are <I>profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for 
 correction, and instruction in righteousness.</I> They are of use, 

 [1.] To excite us to our duty. They are as goads to the ox that draws
 the plough, putting him forward when he is dull and quickening him, to 
 amend his pace. The truths of God <I>prick men to the heart</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+2:37">Acts ii. 37</A>)

 and put them upon bethinking themselves, when they trifle and grow
 remiss, and exerting themselves with more vigour in their work. While
 our good affections are so apt as they are to grow flat and cool, we 
 have need of these <I>goads.</I> 

 [2.] To engage us to persevere in our duty. They are <I>as nails</I> to 
 those that are wavering and inconstant, to fix them to that which is 
 good. They are <I>as goads</I> to such as are dull and draw back, and 
 <I>nails</I> to such as are desultory and draw aside, means to 
 establish the heart and confirm good resolutions, that we may not sit 
 loose to our duty, nor even be taken off from it, but that what good 
 there is in us may be <I>as a nail fastened in a sure place,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ezr+9:8">Ezra ix. 8</A>.

 (2.) A double way of communicating divine truths, in order to those 
 benefits:--

 [1.] By the scriptures, as the standing rule, the <I>words of the
 wise,</I> that is, of the prophets, who are called <I>wise men,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:34">Matt. xxiii. 34</A>.

 These we have in black and white, and may have recourse to them at any
 time, and make use of them <I>as goads and as nails.</I> By them we may 
 teach ourselves; let them but come with pungency and power to the soul, 
 let the impressions of them be deep and durable, and the will <I>make 
 us wise to salvation.</I>

 [2.] By the ministry. To make the <I>words of the wise</I> more 
 profitable to us, it is appointed that they should be impressed and 
 fastened by the <I>masters of assemblies.</I> Solemn assemblies for 
 religious worship are an ancient divine institution, intended for the 
 honour of God and the edification of his church, and are not only 
 serviceable, but necessary, to those ends. There must be masters of 
 these assemblies, who are Christ's ministers, and as such are to 
 preside in them, to be God's mouth to the people and theirs to God. 
 Their business is to fasten the <I>words of the wise,</I> and drive 
 them as <I>nails</I> to the head, in order to which the word of God is 
 likewise as <I>a hammer,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+23:29">Jer. xxiii. 29</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 8. That which is written, and thus recommended to us, is of divine 
 origin. Though it comes to us through various hands (many <I>wise 
 men,</I> and many <I>masters of assemblies</I>), yet it is <I>given by 
 one</I> and the same <I>shepherd,</I> the great <I>shepherd of Israel, 
 that leads Joseph like a flock,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:1">Ps. lxxx. 1</A>.

 God is that one Shepherd, whose good Spirit indited the scriptures, and
 assists the <I>masters of the assemblies</I> in opening and applying 
 the scriptures. <I>These words of the wise</I> are the true sayings of 
 God, on which we may rest our souls. From that one Shepherd all 
 ministers must receive what they deliver, and speak according to the 
 light of the written word.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 9. The sacred inspired writings, if we will but make use of them, are 
 sufficient to guide us in the way of true happiness, and we need not, 
 in the pursuit of that, to fatigue ourselves with the search of other 
 writings 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>And further,</I> nothing now remains but to tell thee that that 
 <I>of making many books there is no end,</I>" that is, 

 (1.) Of <I>writing</I> many books. "If what I have written, serve not 
 to convince thee of the vanity of the world, and the necessity of being 
 religious, neither wouldst thou be convinced if I should write ever so 
 much." If the end be not attained in the use of those books of 
 scripture which God has blessed us with, neither should we obtain the 
 end, if we had twice as many more; nay, if we had so many that the 
 whole world could not contain them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+21:25">John xxi. 25</A>),

 and much study of them would but confound us, and would rather be <I>a
 weariness to the flesh</I> than any advantage to the soul. We have as 
 much as God saw fit to give us, saw fit for us, and saw us fit for. 
 Much less can it be expected that those who will not by these be 
 admonished should be wrought upon by other writings. Let men write ever 
 so many books for the conduct of human life, write till they have tired 
 themselves with much study, they cannot give better instructions than 
 those we have from the word of God. Or,

 (2.) Of <I>buying</I> many books, making ourselves master of them, and 
 masters of what is in them, by much study; still the desire of learning 
 would be unsatisfied. It will give a man indeed the best entertainment 
 and the best accomplishment this world can afford him; but if we be not 
 by these <I>admonished</I> of the vanity of the world, and human 
 learning, among other things, and its insufficiency to make us happy 
 without true piety, alas! there is no end of it, nor real benefit by 
 it; it will weary the body, but never give the soul any true 
 satisfaction. The great Mr. Selden subscribed to this when he owned 
 that in all the books he had read he never found that on which he could 
 rest his soul, but in the holy scripture, especially 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Tit+2:11,12">Tit. ii. 11, 12</A>.

 By these therefore let us be admonished.</P>

 The great enquiry which Solomon prosecutes in this book is, <I>What is 
 that good which the sons of men should do?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+2:3"><I>ch.</I> ii. 3</A>.

 What is the true way to true happiness, the certain means to attain our
 great end? He had in vain sought it among those things which most men
 are eager in pursuit of, but here, at length, he has found it, by the 
 help of that discovery which God anciently made to man

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:28">Job xxviii. 28</A>),

 that serious godliness is the only way to true happiness: <I>Let us
 hear the conclusion of the whole matter,</I> the return entered upon 
 the writ of enquiry, the result of this diligent search; you shall have 
 all I have been driving at in two words. He does not say, <I>Do you 
 hear it,</I> but <I>Let us hear it;</I> for preachers must themselves 
 be hearers of that word which they preach to others, must hear it as 
 from God; those are teachers by the halves who teach others and not 
 themselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:21">Rom. ii. 21</A>.

 Every word of God is pure and precious, but some words are worthy of
 more special remark, as this; the Masorites begin it with a capital 
 letter, as that 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+6:4">Deut. vi. 4</A>.

 Solomon himself puts a <I>nota bene</I> before it, demanding attention
 in these words, <I>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter.</I> 
 Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The summary of religion. Setting aside all matters of doubtful 
 disputation, to be religious is to <I>fear God and keep his 
 commandments.</I> 

 1. The root of religion is fear of God reigning in the heart, and a
 reverence of his majesty, a deference to his authority, and a dread of 
 his wrath. <I>Fear God,</I> that is, worship God, give him the honour 
 due to his name, in all the instances of true devotion, inward and 
 outward. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:7">Rev. xiv. 7</A>.

 2. The rule of religion is the law of God revealed in the scriptures. 
 Our fear towards God must be taught by his commandments 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:13">Isa. xxix. 13</A>),
 
 and those we must keep and carefully observe. Wherever the fear of God
 is uppermost in the heart, there will be <I>a respect to all his 
 commandments</I> and care to keep them. In vain do we pretend to fear
 God if we do not make conscience of our duty to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The vast importance of it: <I>This is the whole of man;</I> it is 
 all his business and all his blessedness; our whole duty is summed up 
 in this and our whole comfort is bound up in this. It is the concern of 
 every man, and ought to be his chief and continual care; it is the 
 common concern of all men, of their whole time. It is nothing to a man 
 whether he be rich or poor, high or low, but it is the main matter, it 
 is all in all to a man, to fear God and do as he bids him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. A powerful inducement to this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 We shall see of what vast consequence it is to us that we be religious 
 if we consider the account we must every one of us shortly give of 
 himself to God; thence he argued against a voluptuous and vicious life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+11:9"><I>ch.</I> xi. 9</A>),

 and here for a religious life: <I>God shall bring every work into
 judgment.</I> Note, 

 1. There is a judgment to come, in which every man's eternal state will
 be finally determined. 

 2. God himself will be the Judge, God-man will, not only because he has 
 a right to judge, but because he is perfectly fit for it, infinitely 
 wise and just. 

 3. <I>Every work</I> will then be <I>brought into judgment,</I> will
 be enquired into and called over again. It will be a day to <I>bring to 
 remembrance every thing done in the body.</I> 

 4. The great thing to be then judged of concerning <I>every work</I> is 
 whether it be good or evil, conformable to the will of God or a 
 violation of it. 

 5. Even <I>secret things,</I> both good and evil, will be brought to
 light, and brought to account, in the judgment of the great day 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:16">Rom. ii. 16</A>);

 there is no good work, no bad work, hid, but shall then be made
 manifest.

 6. In consideration of the judgment to come, and the strictness of
 that judgment, it highly concerns us now to be very strict in our
 walking with God, that we may <I>give up our account with joy.</I></P>
