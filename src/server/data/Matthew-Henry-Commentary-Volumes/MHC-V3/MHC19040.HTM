 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It should seem David penned this psalm upon occasion of his 
 deliverance, by the power and goodness of God, from some great and 
 pressing trouble, by which he was in danger of being overwhelmed; 
 probably it was some trouble of mind arising from a sense of sin and of 
 God's displeasure against him for it; whatever it was, the same Spirit 
 that indited his praises for that deliverance was in him, at the same 
 time, a Spirit of prophecy, testifying of the sufferings of Christ and 
 the glory that should follow; or, ere he was aware, he was led to speak 
 of his undertaking, and the discharge of his undertaking, in words that 
 must be applied to Christ only; and therefore how far the praises that 
 here go before that illustrious prophecy, and the prayers that follow, 
 may safely and profitably be applied to him it will be worth while to 
 consider. In this psalm, 

 I. David records God's favour to him in delivering him out of his deep
 distress, with thankfulness to his praise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40+1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. Thence he takes occasion to speak of the work of our redemption by
 Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40+6-10">ver. 6-10</A>.

 III. That gives him encouragement to pray to God for mercy and grace
 both for himself and for his friends, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40+11-17">ver. 11-17</A>.

 If, in singing this psalm, we mix faith with the prophecy of Christ, 
 and join in sincerity with the praises and prayers here offered up, we 
 make melody with our hearts to the Lord.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1 I waited patiently for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>;
 and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
 &nbsp; 2 He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry
 clay, and set my feet upon a rock, <I>and</I> established my goings.
 &nbsp; 3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, <I>even</I> praise unto
 our God: many shall see <I>it,</I> and fear, and shall trust in the
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 4 Blessed <I>is</I> that man that maketh the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> his trust, and
 respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
 &nbsp; 5 Many, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my God, <I>are</I> thy wonderful works <I>which</I> thou
 hast done, and thy thoughts <I>which are</I> to us-ward: they cannot
 be reckoned up in order unto thee: <I>if</I> I would declare and speak
 <I>of them,</I> they are more than can be numbered.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The great distress and trouble that the psalmist had been in. He had
 been plunged into a horrible pit and into miry clay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 out of which he could not work himself, and in which he found himself
 sinking yet further. He says nothing here either of the sickness of his 
 body or the insults of his enemies, and therefore we have reason to 
 think it was some inward disquiet and perplexity of spirit that was now 
 his greatest grievance. Despondency of spirit under the sense of Gods 
 withdrawings, and prevailing doubts and fears about the eternal state, 
 are indeed a horrible pit and miry clay, and have been so to many a 
 dear child of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His humble attendance upon God and his believing expectations from 
 him in those depths: <I>I waited patiently for the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 <I>Waiting, I waited.</I> He expected relief from no other than from God;
 the same hand that tears must heal, that smites must bind up 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:1">Hos. vi. 1</A>),

 or it will never be done. From God he expected relief, and he was big
 with expectation, not doubting but it would come in due time. There is 
 power enough in God to help the weakest, and grace enough in God to 
 help the unworthiest, of all his people that trust in him. But he 
 waited patiently, which intimates that the relief did not come quickly; 
 yet he doubted not but it would come, and resolved to continue 
 believing, and hoping, and praying, till it did come. Those whose 
 expectation is from God may wait with assurance, but must wait with 
 patience. Now this is very applicable to Christ. His agony, both in the 
 garden and on the cross, was the same continued, and it was a horrible 
 pit and miry clay. Then was his soul troubled and exceedingly 
 sorrowful; but then he prayed, <I>Father, glorify thy name; Father, 
 save me;</I> then he kept hold of his relation to his Father, "My God, 
 my God," and thus waited patiently for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His comfortable experience of God's goodness to him in his 
 distress, which he records for the honour of God and his own and 
 others' encouragement.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God answered his prayers: <I>He inclined unto me and heard my 
 cry.</I> Those that wait patiently for God, though they may wait long, 
 do not wait in vain. Our Lord Jesus was <I>heard in that he feared,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>.
 
 Nay, he was sure that the Father heard him always.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He silenced his fears, and stilled the tumult of his spirits, and 
 gave him a settled peace of conscience 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "He <I>brought me up out of that horrible pit</I> of despondency and
 despair, scattered the clouds, and shone brightly upon my soul, with 
 the assurances of his favour; and not only so, but <I>set my feet upon 
 a rock and established my goings.</I>" Those that have been under the 
 prevalency of a religious melancholy, and by the grace of God have been 
 relieved, may apply this very feelingly to themselves; they are brought 
 up out of a horrible pit.

 (1.) The mercy is completed by the setting of their feet upon a rock, 
 where they find firm footing, are as much elevated with the hopes of 
 heaven as they were before cast down with the fears of hell. Christ is 
 the rock on which a poor soul may stand fast, and on whose meditation 
 alone between us and God we can build any solid hopes or satisfaction. 
 
 (2.) It is continued in the establishment of their goings. Where God
 has given a stedfast hope he expects there should be a steady regular 
 conversation; and, if that be the blessed fruit of it, we have reason 
 to acknowledge, with abundance of thankfulness, the riches and power of 
 his grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He filled him with joy, as well as peace, in believing: "<I>He has 
 put a new song in my mouth;</I> he has given me cause to rejoice and a 
 heart to rejoice." He was brought, as it were, into a new world, and 
 that filled his mouth with a new song, <I>even praise to our God;</I> 
 for to his praise and glory must all our songs be sung. Fresh mercies, 
 especially such as we never before received, call for new songs. This 
 is applicable to our Lord Jesus in his reception to paradise, his 
 resurrection from the grave, and his exaltation to the joy and glory 
 set before him; he was brought out of the horrible pit, set upon a 
 rock, and had a new song put into his mouth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The good improvement that should be made of this instance of God's 
 goodness to David.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. David's experience would be an encouragement to many to hope in God, 
 and, for that end, he leaves it here upon record: <I>Many shall see, 
 and fear, and trust in the Lord.</I> They shall fear the Lord and his 
 justice, which brought David, and the Son of David, into that horrible 
 pit, and shall say, <I>If this be done to the green tree, what shall be 
 done to the dry?</I> They shall fear the Lord and his goodness, in 
 filling the mouth of David, and the Son of David, with new songs of joy 
 and praise. There is a holy reverent fear of God, which is not only
 consistent with, but the foundation of, our hope in him. They shall not 
 fear him and shun him, but fear him and trust in him in their greatest 
 straits, not doubting but to find him as able and ready to help as 
 David did in his distress. God's dealings with our Lord Jesus are our
 great encouragement to trust in God; when it pleased the Lord to bruise 
 him, and put him to grief for our sins, he demanded our debt from him; 
 and when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right 
 hand, he made it to appear that he had accepted the payment he made and 
 was satisfied with it; and what greater encouragement can we have to 
 fear and worship God and to <I>trust in him?.</I> See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+4:25,5:1,2">Rom. iv. 25; v. 1, 2</A>.

 The psalmist invites others to make God their hope, as he did, by
 pronouncing those happy that do so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Blessed is the man that makes the Lord his trust,</I> and him only
 (that has great and good thoughts of him, and is entirely devoted to 
 him), <I>and respects not the proud,</I> does not do as those do that 
 trust in themselves, nor depends upon those who proudly encourage 
 others to trust in them; for both the one and the other turn aside to 
 lies, as indeed all those do that turn aside from God." This is 
 applicable, particularly, to our faith in Christ. Blessed are those 
 that trust in him, and in his righteousness alone, and respect not the 
 proud Pharisees, that set up their own righteousness in competition 
 with that, that will not be governed by their dictates, nor turn aside 
 to lies, with the unbelieving Jews, who <I>submit not to the 
 righteousness of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:3">Rom. x. 3</A>.

 Blessed are those that escape this temptation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The joyful sense he had of this mercy led him to observe, with 
 thankfulness, the many other favours he had received from God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 When God puts new songs into our mouth we must not forget our former 
 songs, but repeat them: "<I>Many, O Lord my God! are thy wonderful
 works which thou hast done,</I> both for me and others; this is but one 
 of many." Many are the benefits with which we are daily loaded both by 
 the providence and by the grace of God. 

 (1.) They are his works, not only the gifts of his bounty, but the 
 operations of his power. He works for us, he works in us, and thus he 
 favours us with matter, not only for thanks, but for praise. 

 (2.) They are his wonderful works, the contrivance of them admirable, 
 his condescension to us in bestowing them upon us admirable; eternity 
 itself will be short enough to be spent in the admiration of them. 

 (3.) All his wonderful works are the product of his thoughts to 
 us-ward. He does all <I>according to the counsel of his own will</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:11">Eph. i. 11</A>),

 the purposes of his grace <I>which he purposed in himself,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:11">Eph. iii. 11</A>.

 They are the projects of infinite wisdom, the designs of everlasting
 love

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:7,Jer+31:3">1 Cor. ii. 7, Jer. xxxi. 3</A>),

 <I>thoughts of good and not of evil,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+29:11">Jer. xxix. 11</A>.

 His gifts and callings will <I>therefore</I> be without repentance,
 because they are not sudden resolves, but the result of his thoughts, 
 his many thoughts, to us-ward. 

 (4.) They are innumerable; they cannot be methodized or <I>reckoned up 
 in order.</I> There is an order in all God's works, but there are so 
 many that present themselves to our view at once that we know not where 
 to begin nor which to name next; the order of them, and their natural 
 references and dependencies, and how the links of the golden chain are 
 joined, are a mystery to us, and what we shall not be able to account 
 for till the veil be rent and the mystery of God finished. Nor can they 
 be counted, not the very heads of them. When we have said the most we 
 can of the wonders of divine love to us we must conclude with an <I>et 
 c&aelig;tera--and such like,</I> and adore the depth, despairing to 
 find the bottom.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast

 required.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist, being struck with amazement at the wonderful works that 
 God had done for his people, is strangely carried out here to foretel 
 that work of wonder which excels all the rest and is the foundation and 
 fountain of all, that of our redemption by our Lord Jesus Christ. God's 
 thoughts, which were to us-ward concerning that work, were the most 
 curious, the most copious, the most gracious, and therefore to be most 
 admired. This paragraph is quoted by the apostle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:5-7">Heb. x. 5</A>,

 &c.) and applied to Christ and his undertaking for us. As in the
 institutions, so in the devotions, of the Old Testament saints were 
 aware of; and, when the apostle would show us the Redeemer's voluntary 
 undertaking of his work, he does not fetch his account out of the book 
 of God's secret counsels, which belong not to us, but from the things 
 revealed. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The utter insufficiency of the legal sacrifices to atone for sin in 
 order to our peace with God and our happiness in him: <I>Sacrifice and 
 offering thou didst not desire;</I> thou wouldst not have the Redeemer 
 to offer them. Something he must have to offer, but not these 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+8:3">Heb. viii. 3</A>);
 
 therefore he must not be of the house of Aaron, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+7:14">Heb. vii. 14</A>.

 Or, In the days of the Messiah burnt-offering and sin-offering will be
 no longer required, but all those ceremonial institutions will be 
 abolished. But that is not all: even while the law concerning them was 
 in full force it might be said, God did not desire them, nor accept 
 them, for their own sake. They could not take away the guilt of sin by 
 satisfying God's justice. The life of a sheep, which is so much 
 inferior in value to that of a man

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+12:12">Matt. xii. 12</A>),

 could not pretend to be an equivalent, much less an expedient to
 preserve the honour of God's government and laws and repair the injury
 done to that honour by the sin of man. They could not take away the
 terror of sin by pacifying the conscience, nor the power of sin by
 sanctifying the nature; it was impossible, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:9,10:1-4">Heb. ix. 9; x. 1-4</A>.

 What there was in them that was valuable resulted from their reference
 to Jesus Christ, of whom they were types--shadows indeed, but shadows 
 of good things to come, and trials of the faith and obedience of God's 
 people, of their obedience of God's people, of their obedience to the 
 law and their faith in the gospel. But the substance must come, which
 is Christ, who must bring that glory to God and that grace to man which 
 it was impossible those sacrifices should ever do.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The designation of our Lord Jesus to the work and office of 
 Mediator: <I>My ears hast thou opened.</I> God the Father disposed him 
 to the undertaking 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:5,6">Isa. l. 5, 6</A>)

 and then obliged him to go through with it. <I>My ear hast thou
 digged.</I> It is supposed to allude to the law and custom of binding 
 servants to serve for ever by boring their ear to the doorpost; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+21:6">Exod. xxi. 6</A>.

 Our Lord Jesus was so in love with his undertaking that he would not go
 out free from it, and therefore engaged to persevere for ever in it; 
 and for this reason <I>he is able to save us to the uttermost,</I> 
 because he has engaged to serve his Father to the uttermost, who 
 upholds him in it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+42:1">Isa. xlii. 1</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His own voluntary consent to this undertaking: "<I>Then said I, 
 Lo, I come;</I> then, when sacrifice and offering would not do, rather 
 than the work should be undone; I said, Lo, I come, to enter the lists 
 with the powers of darkness, and to advance the interests of God's 
 glory and kingdom." This intimates three things:--

 1. That he freely offered himself to this service, to which he was
 under no obligation at all prior to his own voluntary engagement. It 
 was no sooner proposed to him than, with the greatest cheerfulness, he 
 consented to it, and was wonderfully well pleased with the undertaking. 
 Had he not been perfectly voluntary in it, he could not have been a 
 surety, he could not have been a sacrifice; for it is by this will 
 (this <I>animus offerentis--mind of the offerer</I>) that we are 
 sanctified,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+10:10">Heb. x. 10</A>.

 2. That he firmly obliged himself to it: "I come; I promise to come in
 the fulness of time." And therefore the apostle says, "It was when he 
 came into the world that he had an actual regard to this promise, by 
 which he had <I>engaged his heart to approach unto God.</I>" He thus 
 entered into bonds, not only to show the greatness of his love, but 
 because he was to have the honour of his undertaking before he had 
 fully performed it. Though the price was not paid, it was secured to
 be paid, so that he was the Lamb slain from the foundation of the 
 world. 

 3. That he frankly owned himself engaged: He said, <I>Lo, I come,</I>
 said it all along to the Old Testament saints, who therefore knew him 
 by the title of <B><I>ho erchomenos</I></B>--<I>He that should 
 come.</I> This word was the foundation on which they built their faith 
 and hope, and which they looked and longed for the accomplishment 
 of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The reason why he came, in pursuance of his undertaking--because
 <I>in the volume of the book it was written of him,</I> 

 1. In the close rolls of the divine decree and counsel; there it was
 written that his ear was opened, and he said, <I>Lo, I come;</I> there 
 the covenant of redemption was recorded, the counsel of redemption was 
 recorded, the counsel of peace between the Father and the Son; and to 
 that he had an eye in all he did, the commandment he received of his 
 Father. 

 2. In the letters patent of the Old Testament. Moses and all the 
 prophets testified of him; in all the volumes of that book something or 
 other was written of him, which he had an eye to, that all might be 
 accomplished,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+19:28">John xix. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The pleasure he took in his undertaking. Having freely offered 
 himself to it, he did not fail, nor was discouraged, but proceeded with 
 all possible satisfaction to himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>):

 <I>I delight to do thy will, O my God!</I> It was to Christ his meat
 and drink to go on with the work appointed to him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+3:34">John iv. 34</A>);

 and the reason here given is, <I>Thy law is within my heart;</I> it is
 written there, it rules there. It is meant of the law concerning the
 work and office of the Mediator, what he was to do and suffer; this law 
 was dear to him and had an influence upon him in his whole undertaking. 
 Note, When the law of God is written in our hearts our duty will be our 
 delight.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The publication of the gospel to the children of men, even <I>in 
 the great congregation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 The same that as a priest wrought out redemption for us, as a prophet, 
 by his own preaching first, then by his apostles, and still by his word 
 and Spirit, makes it known to us. The <I>great salvation began to be
 spoken by the Lord,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:3">Heb. ii. 3</A>.

 It is the gospel of Christ that is preached to all nations. Observe,

 1. What it is that is preached: It is <I>righteousness</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),
 
 God's righteousness
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 the everlasting righteousness which Christ has brought in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+9:24">Dan. ix. 24</A>);
 
 compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:16,17">Rom. i. 16, 17</A>.

 It is God's <I>faithfulness</I> to his promise, and the salvation which
 had long been looked for. It is God's <I>lovingkindness</I> and his 
 <I>truth,</I> his mercy according to his word. Note, In the work of our 
 redemption we ought to take notice how brightly all the divine 
 attributions shine, and give to God the praise of each of them.

 2. To whom it is preached--<I>to the great congregation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>
 
 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 When Christ was here on earth he preached to multitudes, thousands at a 
 time. The gospel was preached both to Jews and Gentiles, to great 
 congregations of both. Solemn religious assemblies are a divine 
 institution, and in them the glory of God, in the face of Christ, ought 
 to be both praised to the glory of God and preached for the edification 
 of men.

 3. How it is preached--freely and openly: <I>I have not refrained my
 lips; I have not hid it; I have not concealed it.</I> This intimates 
 that whoever undertook to preach the gospel of Christ would be in great 
 temptation to hide it and conceal it, because it must be preached with 
 great contention and in the face of great opposition; but Christ 
 himself, and those whom he called to that work, set their faces <I>as a 
 flint</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:7">Isa. l. 7</A>)

 and were wonderfully carried on in it. It is well for us that they were
 so, for by this means our eyes come to see this joyful light and our 
 ears to hear this joyful sound, which otherwise we might for ever have

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: let
 thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
 &nbsp; 12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine
 iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look
 up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart
 faileth me.
 &nbsp; 13 Be pleased, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, to deliver me: O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, make haste to
 help me.
 &nbsp; 14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after
 my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to
 shame that wish me evil.
 &nbsp; 15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say
 unto me, Aha, aha.
 &nbsp; 16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee:
 let such as love thy salvation say continually, The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> be
 magnified.
 &nbsp; 17 But I <I>am</I> poor and needy; <I>yet</I> the Lord thinketh upon me:
 thou <I>art</I> my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.

 The psalmist, having meditated upon the work of redemption, and spoken 
 of it in the person of the Messiah, now comes to make improvement of 
 the doctrine of his mediation between us and God, and therefore speaks 
 in his own person. Christ having done his Father's will, and finished 
 his work, and given orders for the preaching of the gospel to every 
 creature, we are encouraged to come boldly to the throne of grace, for 
 mercy and grace.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. This may encourage us to pray for the mercy of God, and to put 
 ourselves under the protection of that mercy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 "Lord, thou hast not spared thy Son, nor withheld him; <I>withhold not 
 thou thy tender mercies</I> then, which thou hast laid up for us in 
 him; for wilt thou not <I>with him also freely give us all things?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+8:32">Rom. viii. 32</A>.

 <I>Let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.</I>"
 The best saints are in continual danger, and see themselves undone if 
 they be not continually preserved by the grace of God; and the 
 everlasting lovingkindness and truth of God are what we have to depend 
 upon for our preservation to the heavenly kingdom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+61:7">Ps. lxi. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. This may encourage us in reference to the guilt of sin, that Jesus 
 Christ has done that towards our discharge from it which sacrifice and 
 offering could not do. See here, 
 
 1. The frightful sight he had of sin,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 This was it that made the discovery he was now favoured with of a
 Redeemer very welcome to him. He saw his iniquities to be evils, the 
 worst of evils; he saw that they <I>compassed him about;</I> in all the 
 reviews of his life, and his reflections upon each step of it, still he 
 discovered something amiss. The threatening consequences of his sin 
 surrounded him. Look which way he would, he saw some mischief or other 
 waiting for him, which he was conscious to himself his sins had 
 deserved. He saw them taking hold of him, arresting him, as the bailiff 
 does the poor debtor; he saw them to be innumerable and <I>more than 
 the hairs of his head.</I> Convinced awakened consciences are 
 apprehensive of danger from the numberless number of the sins of 
 infirmity which seem small as hairs, but, being numerous, are very 
 dangerous. <I>Who can understand his errors?</I> God numbers our hairs

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+10:30">Matt. x. 30</A>),

 which yet we cannot number; so he keeps an account of our sins, which
 we keep no account of. The sight of sin so oppressed him that he could 
 not hold up his head--<I>I am not able to look up;</I> much less could 
 he keep up his heart--<I>therefore my heart fails me.</I> Note, The 
 sight of our sins in their own colours would drive us to distraction, 
 if we had not at the same time some sight of a Saviour.

 2. The careful recourse he had to God under the sense of sin
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);
 
 seeing himself brought by his sins to the very brink of ruin, eternal
 ruin, with what a holy passion does he cry out, "<I>Be pleased, O Lord!
 to deliver me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>);

 O save me from the wrath to come, and the present terrors I am in
 through the apprehensions of that wrath! I am undone, I die, I perish, 
 without speedy relief. In a case of this nature, where the bliss of an 
 immortal soul is concerned, delays are dangerous; therefore, <I>O Lord! 
 make haste to help me.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. This may encourage us to hope for victory over our spiritual 
 enemies that seek after our souls to destroy them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 the roaring lion that goes about continually seeking to devour. If
 Christ has triumphed over them, we through him, shall be more than 
 conquerors. In the belief of this we may pray, with humble boldness, 
 <I>Let them be ashamed and confounded together,</I> and <I>driven 
 backward,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 <I>Let them be desolate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Both the conversion of a sinner and the glorification of a saint are 
 great disappointments to Satan, who does his utmost, with all his power 
 and subtlety, to hinder both. Now, our Lord Jesus having undertaken to 
 bring about the salvation of all his chosen, we may in faith pray that, 
 in both these ways, that great adversary may be confounded. When a 
 child of God is brought into that horrible pit, and the miry clay, 
 Satan cries <I>Aha! aha!</I> thinking he has gained his point; but he 
 shall rage when he sees the brand plucked out of the fire, and shall be 
 <I>desolate, for a reward of his shame. The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan!
 The accuser of the brethren is cast out.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. This may encourage all that seek God, and love his salvation, to 
 rejoice in him and to praise him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.
 
 See here,

 1. The character of good people. Conformably to the laws of natural
 religion, they seek God, desire his favour, and in all their exigencies 
 apply to him, as a people should seek unto their God; and conformably 
 to the laws of revealed religion they <I>love his salvation,</I> that 
 great salvation of which the prophets enquired and searched diligently, 
 which the Redeemer undertook to work out when he said, <I>Lo, I 
 come.</I> All that shall be saved love the salvation not only as a 
 salvation from hell, but a salvation from sin. 

 2. The happiness secured to good people by this prophetic prayer. Those 
 that seek God shall <I>rejoice and be glad in him,</I> and with good 
 reason, for he will not only be found of them but will be their 
 bountiful rewarder. Those that love his salvation shall be filled with 
 the joy of his salvation, and shall <I>say continually, The Lord be 
 magnified;</I> and thus they shall have a heaven upon earth. Blessed 
 are those that are thus still praising God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. This may encourage the saints, in distress and affliction, to trust 
 in God and comfort themselves in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 David himself was one of these: <I>I am poor and needy</I> (a king,
 perhaps now on the throne, and yet, being troubled in spirit, he calls
 himself <I>poor and needy,</I> in want and distress, lost and undone
 without a Saviour), <I>yet the Lord thinketh upon me</I> in and through
 the Mediator, by whom we are made accepted. Men forget the poor and
 needy, and seldom think of them; but God's thoughts, towards them
 (which he had spoken of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 are their support and comfort. They may assure themselves that God is 
 their help under their troubles, and will be, in due time, their 
 deliverer out of their troubles, and will make no long tarrying; for 
 <I>the vision is for an appointed time,</I> and therefore, <I>though it 
 tarry,</I> we may <I>wait for it,</I> for it shall come; <I>it will 
 come, it will not tarry.</I></P>
