 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Eliphaz concluded his discourse with an air of assurance; very 
 confident he was that what he had said was so plain and so pertinent 
 that nothing could be objected in answer to it. But, though he that is 
 first in his own cause seems just, yet his neighbour comes and searches 
 him. Job is not convinced by all he had said, but still justifies 
 himself in his complaints and condemns him for the weakness of his 
 arguing. 

 I. He shows that he had just cause to complain as he did of his
 troubles, and so it would appear to any impartial judge, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:2-7">ver. 2-7</A>.


 II. He continues his passionate wish that he might speedily be cut off
 by the stroke of death, and so be eased of all his miseries,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:8-13">ver. 8-13</A>.

 III. He reproves his friends for their uncharitable censures of him and
 their unkind treatment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:14-30">ver. 14-30</A>.

 It must be owned that Job, in all this, spoke much that was reasonable,
 but with a mixture of passion and human infirmity. And in this contest, 
 as indeed in most contests, there was fault on both sides.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  But Job answered and said,
 &nbsp; 2  Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid
 in the balances together!
 &nbsp; 3  For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:
 therefore my words are swallowed up.
 &nbsp; 4  For the arrows of the Almighty <I>are</I> within me, the poison
 whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set
 themselves in array against me.
 &nbsp; 5  Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox
 over his fodder?
 &nbsp; 6  Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is
 there <I>any</I> taste in the white of an egg?
 &nbsp; 7  The things <I>that</I> my soul refused to touch <I>are</I> as my
 sorrowful meat.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Eliphaz, in the beginning of his discourse, had been very sharp upon 
 Job, and yet it does not appear that Job gave him any interruption, but 
 heard him patiently till he had said all he had to say. Those that 
 would make an impartial judgment of a discourse must hear it out, and 
 take it entire. But, when he had concluded, he makes his reply, in 
 which he speaks very feelingly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He represents his calamity, in general, as much heavier than either 
 he had expressed it or they had apprehended it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 He could not fully describe it; they would not fully apprehend it, or
 at least would not own that they did; and therefore he would gladly 
 appeal to a third person, who had just weights and just balances with 
 which to weigh his grief and calamity, and would do it with an 
 impartial hand. He wished that they would set his grief and all the 
 expressions of it in one scale, his calamity and all the particulars of 
 it in the other, and (though he would not altogether justify himself in 
 his grief) they would find (as he says,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:2"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 2</A>)

 that <I>his stroke was heavier than his groaning;</I> for, whatever his
 grief was, his calamity was <I>heavier than the sand of the sea:</I> it 
 was complicated, it was aggravated, every grievance weighty, and all 
 together numerous as the sand. "Therefore (says he) <I>my words are 
 swallowed up;</I>" that is, "Therefore you must excuse both the 
 brokenness and the bitterness of my expressions. Do not think it 
 strange if my speech be not so fine and polite as that of an eloquent 
 orator, or so grave and regular as that of a morose philosopher: no, in 
 these circumstances I can pretend neither to the one nor to the other; 
 my words are, as I am, quite swallowed up." Now, 

 1. He hereby complains of it as his unhappiness that his friends
 undertook to administer spiritual physic to him before they thoroughly 
 understood his case and knew the worst of it. It is seldom that those 
 who are at ease themselves rightly weigh the afflictions of the 
 afflicted. Every one feels most from his own burden; few feel from 
 other people's. 

 2. He excuses the passionate expressions he had used when he cursed his 
 day.  Though he could not himself justify all he had said, yet he 
 thought his friends should not thus violently condemn it, for really 
 the case was extraordinary, and that might be connived at in such a man 
 of sorrows as he now was which in any common grief would by no means be 
 allowed.  

 3. He bespeaks the charitable and compassionate sympathy of his friends
 with him, and hopes, by representing the greatness of his calamity, to 
 bring them to a better temper towards him. To those that are pained it 
 is some ease to be pitied.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He complains of the trouble and terror of mind he was in as the 
 sorest part of his calamity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Herein he was a type of Christ, who, in his sufferings, complained most
 of the sufferings of his soul.  <I>Now is my soul troubled,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:27">John xii. 27</A>.

 <I>My soul is exceedingly sorrowful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:38">Matt. xxvi. 38</A>.

 <I>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+27:46">Matt. xxvii. 46</A>.

 Poor Job sadly complains here, 

 1. Of what he felt <I>The arrows of the Almighty are within me.</I> It
 was not so much the troubles themselves he was under that put him into 
 this confusion, his poverty, disgrace, and bodily pain; but that which 
 cut him to the heart and put him into this agitation, was to think that 
 the God he loved and served had brought all this upon him and laid him 
 under these marks of his displeasure. Note, Trouble of mind is the 
 sorest trouble. <I>A wounded spirit who can bear!</I> Whatever burden 
 of affliction, in body or estate, God is pleased to lay upon us, we may 
 well afford to submit to it as long as he continues to the use of our 
 reason and the peace of our consciences; but, if in either of these we 
 be disturbed, our case is sad indeed and very pitiable. The way to 
 prevent God's fiery darts of trouble is with the shield of faith to 
 quench Satan's fiery darts of temptation. Observe, He calls them the 
 <I>arrows of the Almighty;</I> for it is an instance of the power of 
 God above that of any man that he can with his arrows reach the soul. 
 He that made the soul can make his sword to approach to it. The poison 
 or heat of these arrows is said to drink up his spirit, because it 
 disturbed his reason, shook his resolution, exhausted his vigour, and 
 threatened his life; and therefore his passionate expressions, though 
 they could not be justified, might be excused. 

 2.  Of what he feared.  He saw himself charged by <I>the terrors of
 God,</I> as by an army set in battle-array, and surrounded by them. 
 God, by his terrors, fought against him. As he had no comfort when he 
 retired inward into his own bosom, so he had none when he looked upward 
 towards Heaven. He that used to be encouraged with the consolations of 
 God not only wanted those, but was amazed with the terrors of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He reflects upon his friends for their severe censures of his 
 complaints and their unskilful management of his case. 

 1. Their reproofs were causeless. He complained, it is true, now that
 he was in this affliction, but he never used to complain, as those do 
 who are of a fretful unquiet spirit, when he was in prosperity: he did 
 not <I>bray when he had grass,</I> nor <I>low over his fodder,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 But, now that he was utterly deprived of all his comforts, he must be a
 stock or a stone, and not have the sense of an ox or a wild ass, if he 
 did not give some vent to his grief. He was forced to eat unsavoury 
 meats, and was so poor that he had not a grain of salt wherewith to 
 season them, nor to give a little taste to the white of an egg, which 
 was now the choicest dish he had at his table, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Even that food which once he would have scorned to touch he was now
 glad of, and it was his <I>sorrowful meat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Note, It is wisdom not to use ourselves or our children to be nice and
 dainty about meat and drink, because we know not how we or they may be 
 reduced, nor how that which we now disdain may be made acceptable by 
 necessity.

 2. Their comforts were sapless and insipid; so some understand 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.
 
 He complains he had nothing now offered to him for his relief that was
 proper for him, no cordial, nothing to revive and cheer his spirits; 
 what they had afforded was in itself as tasteless as the white of an 
 egg, and, when applied to him, as loathsome and burdensome as the most 
 sorrowful meat.  I am sorry he should say thus of what Eliphaz had 
 excellently well said,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:8-13"><I>ch.</I> v. 8</A>,

 &c. But peevish spirits are too apt thus to abuse their comforters.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant
 <I>me</I> the thing that I long for!
 &nbsp; 9  Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would
 let loose his hand, and cut me off!
 &nbsp; 10  Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself
 in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words
 of the Holy One.
 &nbsp; 11  What <I>is</I> my strength, that I should hope? and what <I>is</I>
 mine end, that I should prolong my life?
 &nbsp; 12  <I>Is</I> my strength the strength of stones? or <I>is</I> my flesh of
 brass?
 &nbsp; 13  <I>Is</I> not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Ungoverned passion often grows more violent when it meets with some 
 rebuke and check. The troubled sea rages most when it dashes against a 
 rock. Job had been courting death, as that which would be the happy 
 period of his miseries, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:1-26">
 <I>ch.</I> iii</A>.

 For this Eliphaz had gravely reproved him, but he, instead of unsaying
 what he had said, says it here again with more vehemence than before; 
 and it is as ill said as almost any thing we meet with in all his 
 discourses, and is recorded for our admonition, not our imitation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He is still most passionately desirous to die, as if it were not 
 possible that he should ever see good days again in this world, or 
 that, by the exercise of grace and devotion, he might make even these 
 days of affliction good days. He could see no end of his trouble but 
 death, and had not patience to wait the time appointed for that. He has 
 a request to make; there is a thing he longs for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>);

 and what is that? One would think it should be, "That it would please
 God to deliver me, and restore me to my prosperity again;" no, <I>That 
 it would please God to destroy me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 "As once he let loose his hand to make me poor, and then to make me
 sick, let him loose it once more to put an end to my life. Let him give 
 the fatal stroke; it shall be to me the <I>coup de grace--the stroke of 
 favour,</I>" as, in France, they call the last blow which dispatches 
 those that are broken on the wheel. There was a time when 
 <I>destruction from the Almighty was a terror</I> to Job

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:23"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 23</A>),

 yet now he courts the destruction of the flesh, but in hopes that the
 spirit should be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. Observe, Though 
 Job was extremely desirous of death, and very angry at its delays, yet 
 he did not offer to destroy himself, nor to take away his own life, 
 only he begged <I>that it would please God to destroy him.</I> Seneca's 
 morals, which recommend self-murder as the lawful redress of 
 insupportable grievances, were not then known, nor will ever be 
 entertained by any that have the least regard to the law of God and 
 nature. How uneasy soever the soul's confinement in the body may be, it 
 must by no means break prison, but wait for a fair discharge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He puts this desire into a prayer, that God would grant him this 
 request, that it would please God to do this for him. It was his sin so 
 passionately to desire the hastening of his own death, and offering up 
 that desire to God made it no better; nay, what looked ill in his wish 
 looked worse in his prayer, for we ought not to ask any thing of God 
 but what we can ask in faith, and we cannot ask any thing in faith but 
 what is agreeable to the will of God. Passionate prayers are the worst 
 of passionate expressions, for we should <I>lift up pure hands without 
 wrath.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He promises himself effectual relief, and the redress of all his 
 grievances, by the stroke of death 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "<I>Then should I yet have comfort,</I> which now I have not, nor ever
 expect till then." See, 

 1.  The vanity of human life; so uncertain a good is it that it often
 proves men's greatest burden and nothing is so desirable as to get 
 clear of it. Let grace make us willing to part with it whenever God 
 calls; for it may so happen that even sense may make us desirous to 
 part with it before he calls. 

 2. The hope which the righteous have in their death. If Job had not had
 a good conscience, he could not have spoken with this assurance of 
 comfort on the other side death, which turns the tables between the 
 rich man and Lazarus. <I>Now he is comforted, and thou art 
 tormented.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He challenges death to do its worst. If he could not die without 
 the dreadful prefaces of bitter pains and agonies, and strong 
 convulsions, if he must be racked before he be executed, yet, in 
 prospect of dying at last, he would make nothing of dying pangs: "<I>I 
 would harden myself in sorrow,</I> would open my breast to receive 
 death's darts, and not shrink from them. <I>Let him not spare;</I> I 
 desire no mitigation of that pain which will put a happy period to all 
 my pains. Rather than not die, let me die so as to feel myself die." 
 These are passionate words, which might better have been spared. We 
 should soften ourselves in sorrow, that we may receive the good 
 impressions of it, and by the sadness of the countenance our hearts, 
 being made tender, may be made better; but, if we harden ourselves, we 
 provoke God to proceed in his controversy; <I>for when he judgeth he 
 will overcome.</I> It is great presumption to dare the Almighty, and to 
 say, <I>Let him not spare;</I> for <I>are we stronger than he?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:22">1 Cor. x. 22</A>.

 We are much indebted to sparing mercy; it is bad indeed with us when we
 are weary of that. Let us rather say with David, <I>O spare me a 
 little.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He grounds his comfort upon the testimony of his conscience for him 
 that he had been faithful and firm to his profession of religion, and 
 in some degree useful and serviceable to the glory of God in his 
 generation: <I>I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</I> 
 Observe, 

 1. Job had the words of the Holy One committed to him. The people of
 God were at that time blessed with divine revelation. 

 2. It was his comfort that he had not concealed them, had not received
 the grace of God therein in vain.

 (1.) He had not kept them from himself, but had given them full scope 
 to operate upon him, and in every thing to guide and govern him. He had 
 not stifled his convictions, <I>imprisoned the truth in 
 unrighteousness,</I> nor done any thing to hinder the digestion of this 
 spiritual food and the operation of this spiritual physic. Let us never 
 conceal God's word from ourselves, but always receive it in the light 
 of it. 

 (2.) He had not kept them to himself, but had been ready, on all 
 occasions, to communicate his knowledge for the good of others, was 
 never ashamed nor afraid to own the word of God to be his rule, nor 
 remiss in his endeavours to bring others into an acquaintance with it.  
 Note Those, and those only, may promise themselves comfort in death who 
 are good, and do good, while they live.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He justifies himself, in this extreme desire of death, from the 
 deplorable condition he was now in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.

 Eliphaz, in the close of his discourse, had put him in hopes that he
 should yet see a good issue of his troubles; but poor Job puts these 
 cordials away from him, refuses to be comforted, abandons himself to 
 despair, and very ingeniously, yet perversely, argues against the 
 encouragements that were given him. Disconsolate spirits will reason 
 strangely against themselves. In answer to the pleasing prospects 
 Eliphaz had flattered him with, he here intimates,

 1. That he had no reason to expect any such thing: "<I>What is my
 strength, that I should hope?</I> You see how I am weakened and brought 
 low, how unable I am to grapple with my distempers, and therefore what 
 reason have I to hope that I should out-live them, and see better days? 
 <I>Is my strength the strength of stones?</I> Are my muscles brass and 
 my sinews steel? No, they are not, and therefore I cannot hold out 
 always in this pain and misery, but must needs sink under the load. Had 
 I strength to grapple with my distemper, I might hope to look through 
 it; but, alas! I have not. The <I>weakening of my strength in the 
 way</I> will certainly be the <I>shortening of my days,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+102:23">Ps. cii. 23</A>.

 Note, All things considered, we have no reason to reckon upon the long
 continuance of life in this world. <I>What is our strength?</I> It is 
 depending strength. We have no more strength than God gives us; for in 
 him we live and move. It is decaying strength; we are daily spending 
 the stock, and by degrees it will be exhausted. It is disproportionable 
 to the encounters we may meet with; what is our strength to be depended 
 upon, when two or three days' sickness will make us weak as water?  
 Instead of expecting a long life, we have reason to wonder that we have 
 lived hitherto and to feel that we are hastening off apace.

 2. That he had no reason to desire any such thing: "<I>What is my end,
 that I should desire to prolong my life?</I> What comfort can I promise 
 myself in life, comparable to the comfort I promise myself in death?" 
 Note, Those who, through grace, are ready for another world, cannot see 
 much to invite their stay in this world, or to make them fond of it. 
 That, if it be God's will, we may do him more service and may get to be 
 fitter and riper for heaven, is an end for which we may wish the 
 prolonging of life, in subservience to our chief end; but, otherwise, 
 what can we propose to ourselves in desiring to tarry here? The longer 
 life is the more grievous will its burdens be

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:1">Eccl. xii. 1</A>),

 and the longer life is the less pleasant will be its delights,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:34,35">2 Sam. xix. 34, 35</A>.

 We have already seen the best of this world, but we are not sure that
 we have seen the worst of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. He obviates the suspicion of his being delirious 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Is not my help in me?</I> that is, "Have I not the use of my reason,
 with which, I thank God, I can help myself, though you do not help me? 
 Do you think wisdom is driven quite from me, and that I am gone 
 distracted? No, I am not mad, most noble Eliphaz, but <I>speak the 
 words of truth and soberness.</I>" Note, Those who have grace in them, 
 who have the evidence of it and have it in exercise, have wisdom in 
 them, which will be their help in the worst of times. <I>Sat lucis 
 intus--They have light within.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Eliphaz had been very severe in his censures of Job; and his 
 companions, though as yet they had said little, yet had intimated their 
 concurrence with him. Their unkindness therein poor Job here complains 
 of, as an aggravation of his calamity and a further excuse of his 
 desire to die; for what satisfaction could he ever expect in this world 
 when those that should have been his comforters thus proved his 
 tormentors?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He shows what reason he had to expect kindness from them. His 
 expectation was grounded upon the common principles of humanity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>To him that is afflicted,</I> and that is wasting and melting under
 his affliction, <I>pity should be shown from his friend;</I> and he 
 that does not show that pity <I>forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</I>" 
 Note, 

 1. Compassion is a debt owing to those that are in affliction.  The
 least which those that are at ease can do for those that are pained and 
 in anguish is to pity them,--to manifest the sincerity of a tender 
 concern for them, and to sympathize with them,--to take cognizance of 
 their case, enquire into their grievances, hear their complaints, and 
 mingle their tears with theirs,--to comfort them, and to do all they 
 can to help and relieve them: this well becomes the members of the same 
 body, who should feel for the grievances of their fellow-members, not 
 knowing how soon the same may be their own. 

 2.  Inhumanity is impiety and irreligion. <I>He that withholds
 compassion from his friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</I> So 
 the Chaldee.  <I>How dwells the love of God in that man?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+3:17">1 John iii. 17</A>.

 Surely those have no fear of the rod of God upon themselves who have no
 compassion for those that feel the smart of it. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:27">Jam. i. 27</A>.

 3.  Troubles are the trials of friendship. When a man is afflicted he
 will see who are his friends indeed and who are but pretenders; for 
 <I>a brother is born for adversity,</I>

 II. He shows how wretchedly he was disappointed in his expectations 
 from them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 "<I>My brethren,</I> who should have helped me, <I>have dealt
 deceitfully as a brook.</I>" They came by appointment, with a great 
 deal of ceremony, to mourn with him and to comfort him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:11"><I>ch.</I> ii. 11</A>);

 and some extraordinary things were expected from such wise, learned,
 knowing men, and Job's particular friends. None questioned but that the 
 drift of their discourses would be to comfort Job with the remembrance 
 of his former piety, the assurance of God's favour to him, and the 
 prospect of a glorious issue; but, instead of this, they most 
 barbarously fall upon him with their reproaches and censures, condemn 
 him as a hypocrite, insult over his calamities, and pour vinegar, 
 instead of oil, into his wounds, and thus they deal deceitfully with 
 him. Note, It is fraud and deceit not only to violate our engagements 
 to our friends, but to frustrate their just expectations from us, 
 especially the expectations we have raised. Note, further, It is our 
 wisdom to cease from man. We cannot expect too little from the creature 
 nor too much from the Creator. It is no new thing even for brethren to 
 <I>deal deceitfully</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+9:4,5,Mic+7:5">Jer. ix. 4, 5; Mic. vii. 5</A>);

 let us therefore put our confidence in the rock of ages, not in broken
 reeds-in the fountain of life, not in broken cisterns. God will out-do 
 our hopes as much as men come short of them. This disappointment which 
 Job met with he here illustrates by the failing of brooks in 
 summer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The similitude is very elegant, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:15-20"><I>v.</I> 15-20</A>.

 (1.) Their pretensions are fitly compared to the great show which the 
 brooks make when they are swollen with the waters of a land flood, by 
 the melting of the ice and snow, which make them blackish or muddy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 (2.) His expectations from them, which their coming so solemnly to 
 comfort him had raised, he compares to the expectation which the weary 
 thirsty travellers have of finding water in the summer where they have 
 often seen it in great abundance in the winter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 <I>The troops of Tema and Sheba,</I> the caravans of the merchants of
 those countries, whose road lay through the deserts of Arabia, looked 
 and waited for supply of water from those brooks. "Hard by here," says 
 one, "A little further," says another, "when I last travelled this way, 
 there was water enough; we shall have that to refresh us." Where we 
 have met with relief or comfort we are apt to expect it again; and yet 
 it does not follow; for,

 (3.) The disappointment of his expectation is here compared to the 
 confusion which seizes the poor travellers when they find heaps of sand 
 where they expected floods of water. In the winter, when they were not 
 thirsty, there was water enough. Every one will applaud and admire 
 those that are full and in prosperity. But in the heat of summer, when 
 they needed water, then it failed them; it was consumed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>);

 it was turned aside, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 When those who are rich and high are sunk and impoverished, and stand
 in need of comfort, then those who before gathered about them stand 
 aloof from them, those who before commended them are forward to run 
 them down. Thus those who raise their expectations high from the 
 creature will find it fail them when it should help them; whereas those 
 who make God their confidence have help <I>in the time of need,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:16">Heb. iv. 16</A>.

 Those who make gold their hope will sooner or later be ashamed of it,
 and of their confidence in it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+7:19">Ezek. vii. 19</A>);

 and the greater their confidence was the greater their shame will be:
 <I>They were confounded because they had hoped,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:20"><I>v.</I>  20</A>.

 We prepare confusion for ourselves by our vain hopes: the reeds break
 under us because we lean upon them. If we build a house upon the sand, 
 we shall certainly be confounded, for it will fall in the storm, and we 
 must thank ourselves for being such fools as to expect it would stand. 
 We are not deceived unless we deceive ourselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The application is very close 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>For now you are nothing.</I> They seemed to be somewhat, but in
 conference they added nothing to him. Allude to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+2:6">Gal. ii. 6</A>.

 He was never the wiser, never the better, for the visit they made him.
 Note, Whatever complacency we may take, or whatever confidence we may 
 put, in creatures, how great soever they may seem and how dear soever 
 they may be to us, one time or other we shall say of them, <I>Now you 
 are nothing.</I> When Job was in prosperity his friends were something 
 to him, he took complacency in them and their society; but "<I>Now you 
 are nothing,</I> now I can find no comfort but in God." It were well 
 for us if we had always such convictions of the vanity of the creature, 
 and its insufficiency to make us happy, as we have sometimes had, or 
 shall have on a sick-bed, a death-bed, or in trouble of conscience: 
 "<I>Now you are nothing.</I> You are not what you have been, what you 
 should be, what you pretend to be, what I thought you would have been; 
 <I>for you see my casting down and are afraid.</I> When you saw me in 
 my elevation you caressed me; but now that you see me in my dejection 
 you are shy of me, are afraid of showing yourselves kind, lest I should 
 thereby be emboldened to beg something of you, or to borrow" (compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>);

 "you are afraid lest, if you own me, you should be obliged to keep me."
 Perhaps they were afraid of catching his distemper or of coming within 
 smell of the noisomeness of it. It is not good, either out of pride or 
 niceness, for love of our purses or of our bodies, to be shy of those 
 who are in distress and afraid of coming near them. Their case may soon 
 be our own.</P>

 Poor Job goes on here to upbraid his friends with their unkindness and 
 the hard usage they gave him. He here appeals to themselves concerning 
 several things which tended both to justify him and to condemn them. If 
 they would but think impartially, and speak as they thought, they could 
 not but own,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That, though he was necessitous, yet he was not craving, nor 
 burdensome to his friends. Those that are so, whose troubles serve them 
 to beg by, are commonly less pitied than the silent poor. Job would be 
 glad to see his friends, but he did not say, <I>Bring unto me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>),

 or, <I>Deliver me,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 He did not desire to put them to any expense, did not urge his friends
 either,

 1. To make a collection for him, to set him up again in the world.
 Though he could plead that his losses came upon him by the hand of God 
 and not by any fault or folly of his own,--that he was utterly ruined 
 and impoverished,--that he had lived in good condition, and that when 
 he had wherewithal he was charitable and ready to help those that were 
 in distress,--that his friends were rich, and able to help him, yet he 
 did not say, <I>Give me of your substance.</I> Note, A good man, when 
 troubled himself, is afraid of being troublesome to his friends. Or, 

 2.  To raise the country for him, to help him to recover his cattle out
 of the hands of the Sabeans and Chaldeans, or to make reprisals upon 
 them: "Did I send for you to <I>deliver me out of the hand of the 
 mighty?</I> No, I never expected you should either expose yourselves to 
 any danger or put yourselves to any charge upon my account. I will 
 rather sit down content under my affliction, and make the best of it, 
 than sponge upon my friends." St. Paul worked with his hands, that he 
 might not be burdensome to any. Job's not asking their help did not 
 excuse them from offering it when he needed it and it was in the power 
 of their hands to give it; but it much aggravated their unkindness when 
 he desired no more from them than a good look, and a good word, and yet 
 could not obtain them. It often happens that from man, even when we 
 expect little, we have less, but from God, even when we expect much, we 
 have more, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+3:20">Eph. iii. 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That, though he differed in opinion from them, yet he was not 
 obstinate, but ready to yield to conviction, and to strike sail to 
 truth as soon as ever it was made to appear to him that he was in an 
 error 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>):

 "If, instead of invidious reflections and uncharitable insinuations,
 you will give me plain instructions and solid arguments, which shall 
 carry their own evidence along with them, I am ready to acknowledge my 
 error and own myself in a fault: <I>Teach me, and I will hold my 
 tongue;</I> for I have often found, with pleasure and wonder, <I>how 
 forcible right words are.</I> But the method you take will never make 
 proselytes: <I>What doth your arguing reprove?</I> Your hypothesis is 
 false, your surmises are groundless, your management is weak, and your 
 application peevish and uncharitable." Note, 

 1. Fair reasoning has a commanding power, and it is a wonder if men are
 not conquered by it; but railing and foul language are impotent and 
 foolish, and it is no wonder if men are exasperated and hardened by 
 them. 

 2. It is the undoubted character of every honest man that he is truly
 desirous to have his mistakes rectified, and to be made to understand 
 wherein he has erred; and he will acknowledge that right words, when 
 they appear to him to be so, though contrary to his former sentiments, 
 are both forcible and acceptable.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That, though he had been indeed in a fault, yet they ought not to 
 have given him such hard usage 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>):

 "<I>Do you imagine,</I> or contrive with a great deal of art" (for so
 the word signifies), "<I>to reprove words,</I> some passionate 
 expressions of mine in this desperate condition, as if they were 
 certain indications of reigning impiety and atheism? A little candour 
 and charity would have served to excuse them, and to put a better 
 construction upon them. Shall a man's spiritual state be judged of by 
 some rash and hasty words, which a surprising trouble extorts from him? 
 Is it fair, is it kind, is it just, to criticize in such a case? Would 
 you yourselves be served thus?" Two things aggravated their unkind 
 treatment of him:--

 1. That they took advantage of his weakness and the helpless condition
 he was in: <I>You overwhelm the fatherless,</I> a proverbial 
 expression, denoting that which is most barbarous and inhuman. "The 
 fatherless cannot secure themselves from insults, which emboldens men 
 of base and sordid spirits to insult them and trample upon them; and 
 you do so by me." Job, being a childless father, thought himself as 
 much exposed to injury as a fatherless child

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:5">Ps. cxxvii. 5</A>)

 and had reason to be offended with those who therefore triumphed over
 him. Let those who overwhelm and overpower such as upon any account may 
 be looked upon as fatherless know that therein they not only put off 
 the compassions of man, but fight against the compassions of God, who 
 is, and will be, a Father of the fatherless and a helper of the 
 helpless. 

 2. That they made a pretence of kindness: "<I>You dig a pit for your
 friend;</I> not only you are unkind to me, who am your friend, but, 
 under colour of friendship, you ensnare me." When they came to see and 
 sit with him he thought he might speak his mind freely to them, and 
 that the more bitter his complaints to them were the more they would 
 endeavour to comfort him. This made him take a greater liberty than 
 otherwise he would have done. David, though he smothered his 
 resentments when the wicked were before him, would probably have given 
 vent to them if none had been by but friends,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:1">Ps. xxxix. 1</A>.

 But this freedom of speech, which their professions of concern for him
 made him use, had exposed him to their censures, and so they might be 
 said to dig a pit for him. Thus, when our hearts are hot within us, 
 what is ill done we are apt to misrepresent as if done designedly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That, though he had let fall some passionate expressions, yet in 
 the main he was in the right, and that his afflictions, though very 
 extraordinary, did not prove him to be a hypocrite or a wicked man. His 
 righteousness he holds fast, and will not let it go. For the evincing 
 of it he here appeals, 
 
 1. To what they saw in him
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 "<I>Be content,</I> and <I>look upon me;</I> what do you see in me that
 bespeaks me either a madman or a wicked man? Nay, look in my face, and 
 you may discern there the indications of a patient and submissive 
 spirit, for all this. Let the show of my countenance witness for me 
 that, though I have cursed my day, I do not curse my God." Or rather, 
 "Look upon my ulcers and sore boils, and by them it will be evident to 
 you that I do not lie," that is, "that I do not complain without cause.  
 Let your own eyes convince you that my condition is very sad, and that 
 I do not quarrel with God by making it worse than it is." 

 2. To what they heard from him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 "You hear what I have to say: <I>Is there iniquity in my tongue?</I>
 that iniquity that you charge me with? Have I blasphemed God or 
 renounced him? Are not my present arguings right?  Do not you perceive, 
 by what I say, that I can discern perverse things?  I can discover your 
 fallacies and mistakes, and, if I were myself in an error, I could 
 perceive it. Whatever you think of me, I know what I say."

 3. To their own second and sober thoughts

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>):

 "<I>Return, I pray you,</I> consider the thing over again without
 prejudice and partiality, and let not the result be iniquity, let it 
 not be an unrighteous sentence; and you will find <I>my righteousness 
 is in it,</I>" that is, "I am in the right in this matter; and, though 
 I cannot keep my temper as I should, I keep my integrity, and have not 
 said, nor done, nor suffered, any thing which will prove me other than 
 an honest man." A just cause desires nothing more than a just hearing, 
 and if need be a re-hearing.</P>
