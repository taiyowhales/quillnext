 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is the will of God that prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings, 
 should be made, in special manner, for kings and all in authority. This 
 psalm is a prayer, and the next a thanksgiving, for the king. David was 
 a martial prince, much in war. Either this psalm was penned upon 
 occasion of some particular expedition of his, or, in general, as a 
 form to be used in the daily service of the church for him. In this 
 psalm we may observe, 

 I. What it is they beg of God for the king, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. With what assurance they beg it. The people triumph

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:5">ver. 5</A>),

 the prince
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:6">ver. 6</A>),

 both together

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>),

 and so he concludes with a prayer to God for audience, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:9">ver. 9</A>.

 In this, David may well be looked upon as a type of Christ, to whose
 kingdom and its interests among men the church was, in every age, a 
 hearty well-wisher.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hear
 thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend
 thee;
 &nbsp; 2  Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of
 Zion;
 &nbsp; 3  Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
 Selah.
 &nbsp; 4  Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy
 counsel.
 &nbsp; 5  We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God
 we will set up <I>our</I> banners: the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> fulfil all thy petitions.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This prayer for David is entitled <I>a psalm of David;</I> nor was it 
 any absurdity at all for him who was divinely inspired to draw up a 
 directory, or form of prayer, to be used in the congregation for 
 himself and those in authority under him; nay it is very proper for 
 those who desire the prayers of their friends to tell them particularly 
 what they would have to be asked of God for them. Note, Even great and 
 good men, and those that know ever so well how to pray for themselves, 
 must not despise, but earnestly desire, the prayers of others for them, 
 even those that are their inferiors in all respects. Paul often begged 
 of his friends to pray for him. Magistrates and those in power ought to 
 esteem and encourage praying people, to reckon them their strength 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+12:5,10">Zech. xii. 5, 10</A>),

 and to do what they can for them, that they may have an interest in
 their prayers and may do nothing to forfeit it. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What it is that they are taught to ask of God for the king.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That God would answer his prayers: <I>The Lord hear thee in the day 
 of trouble</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 and <I>the Lord fulfil all thy petitions,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 Note,

 (1.) Even the greatest of men may be much in trouble. It was often a 
 day of trouble with David himself, of disappointment and distress, of 
 treading down and of perplexity. Neither the crown on his head nor the 
 grace in his heart would exempt him from the trouble. 

 (2.) Even the greatest of men must be much in prayer. David, though a 
 man of business, a man of war, was constant to his devotions; though he 
 had prophets, and priests, and many good people among his subjects, to 
 pray for him, he did not think that excused him from praying for 
 himself. Let none expect benefit by the prayers of the church, or of
 their ministers or friends for them, who are capable of praying for 
 themselves, and yet neglect it. The prayers of others for us must be 
 desired, not to supersede, but to second, our own for ourselves. Happy 
 the people that have praying princes, to whose prayers they may thus 
 say, <I>Amen.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That God would protect his person, and preserve his life, in the 
 perils of war: "<I>The name of the God of Jacob defend thee,</I> and 
 set thee out of the reach of thy enemies." 

 (1.) "Let God by his providence keep thee safe, even the God who 
 preserved Jacob in the days of his trouble." David had mighty men for 
 his guards, but he commits himself, and his people commit him, to the 
 care of the almighty God.

 (2.) "Let God by his grace keep thee easy from the fear of evil.--
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:10">Prov. xviii. 10</A>,

 <I>The name of the Lord is a strong tower, into which the righteous
 run</I> by faith, <I>and are safe;</I> let David be enabled to shelter 
 himself in that strong tower, as he has done many a time."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That God would enable him to go on in his undertakings for the 
 public good--that, in the day of battle, he would <I>send him help out
 of the sanctuary, and strength out of Zion,</I> not from common 
 providence, but from the ark of the covenant and the peculiar favour 
 God bears to his chosen people Israel. That he would help him, in 
 performance of the promises and in answer to the prayers made in the 
 sanctuary. Mercies out of the sanctuary are the sweetest mercies, such 
 as are the tokens of God's peculiar love, the blessing of God, even our 
 own God. Strength out of Zion is spiritual strength, strength in the 
 soul, in the inward man, and that is what we should most desire both 
 for ourselves and others in services and sufferings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That God would testify his gracious acceptance of the sacrifices he 
 offered with his prayers, according to the law of that time, before he 
 went out on a dangerous expedition: <I>The Lord remember all thy 
 offerings and accept thy burnt-sacrifices</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 or <I>turn them to ashes;</I> that is, "The Lord give thee the victory 
 and success which thou didst by prayer with sacrifices ask of him, and 
 thereby give as full proof of his acceptance of the sacrifice as ever 
 he did by kindling it with fire from heaven." By this we may now know 
 that God accepts our spiritual sacrifices, if by his Spirit he kindles 
 in our souls a holy fire of pious and divine affection and with that 
 makes our hearts burn within us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. That God would crown all his enterprises and noble designs for the 
 public welfare with the desired success 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The Lord grant thee according to thy own heart.</I> This they might 
 in faith pray for, because they knew David was a man after God's own 
 heart, and would design nothing but what was pleasing to him. Those who 
 make it their business to glorify God may expect that God will, in one 
 way or other, gratify them: and those who walk in his counsel may 
 promise themselves that he will fulfil theirs. <I>Thou shalt devise a 
 thing and it shall be established unto thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What confidence they had of an answer of peace to these petitions 
 for themselves and their good king 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>We will rejoice in thy salvation.</I> We that are subjects will 
 rejoice in the preservation and prosperity of our prince;" or, rather, 
 "In thy salvation, O God! in thy power and promise to save, will we 
 rejoice; that is it which we depend upon now, and which, in the issue, 
 we shall have occasion greatly to rejoice in." Those that have their 
 eye still upon the salvation of the Lord shall have their hearts filled 
 with the joy of that salvation: <I>In the name of our God will we set 
 up our banners.</I>

 1. "We will wage war in his name; we will see that our cause be good 
 and make his glory our end in every expedition; we will ask counsel at 
 his mouth, and take him along with us; we will follow his direction, 
 implore his aid and depend upon it, and refer the issue to him." David 
 went against Goliath in the name of the Lord of hosts,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+17:45">1 Sam. xvii. 45</A>.

 (2.) "We will celebrate our victories in his name. When we lift up our
 banners in triumph, and set up our trophies, it shall be in the name of 
 our God; he shall have all the glory of our success, and no instrument 
 shall have any part of the honour that is due to him."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this we ought to offer up to God our hearty good wishes to 
 the good government we are under and to the prosperity of it. But we 
 may look further; these prayers for David are prophecies concerning 
 Christ the Son of David, and in him they were abundantly answered; he 
 undertook the work of our redemption, and made war upon the powers of 
 darkness. In the day of trouble, when his soul was exceedingly 
 sorrowful, the Lord heard him, heard him in that he feared 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+5:7">Heb. v. 7</A>),

 <I>sent him help out of the sanctuary,</I> sent an angel from heaven to
 strengthen him, took cognizance of his offering when he made his soul 
 an offering for sin, and accepted his burnt-sacrifice, turned it to 
 ashes, the fire that should have fastened upon the sinner fastening 
 upon the sacrifice, with which God was well pleased. And he granted him 
 according to his own heart, made him to see of the travail of his soul, 
 to his satisfaction, prospered his good pleasure in his hand, fulfilled 
 all his petitions for himself and us; for him the Father heareth always 
 and his intercession is ever prevailing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; 9  Save, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: let the king hear us when we call.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. Holy David himself triumphing in the interest he had in the prayers 
 of good people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Now know I</I> (I that pen the psalm know it) <I>that the Lord 
 saveth his anointed,</I> because he hath stirred up the hearts of the 
 seed of Jacob to pray for him." Note, It bodes well to any prince and 
 people, and may justly be taken as a happy presage, when God pours upon 
 them a spirit of prayer. If he see us seeking him, he will be found of 
 us; if he cause us to hope in his word, he will establish his word to 
 us. Now that so many who have an interest in heaven are praying for him 
 he doubts not but that God will hear him, and grant him an answer of 
 peace, which will,

 1. Take its rise from above: <I>He will hear him from his holy 
 heaven,</I> of which the sanctuary was a type 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:23">Heb. ix. 23</A>),

 from the throne he hath prepared in heaven, of which the mercy-seat was
 a type.

 2. It shall take its effect here below: He will hear him <I>with the 
 saving strength of his right hand;</I> he will give a real answer to 
 his prayers, and the prayers of his friends for him, not by letter, nor 
 by word of mouth, but, which is much better, by his right hand, by the 
 saving strength of his right hand. He will make it to appear that he 
 hears him by what he does for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His people triumphing in God and their relation to him, and his 
 revelation of himself to them, by which they distinguish themselves 
 from those that live without God in the world. 

 1. See the difference between worldly people and godly people, in their 
 confidences, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 The children of this world trust in second causes, and think all is
 well if those do but smile upon them; they trust <I>in chariots and in 
 horses,</I> and the more of them they can bring into the field the more 
 sure they are of success in their wars; probably David has here an eye 
 to the Syrians, whose forces consisted much of chariots and horsemen, 
 as we find in the history of David's victories over them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:4,10:18">2 Sam. viii. 4; x. 18</A>.

 "But," say the Israelites, "we neither have chariots and horses to
 trust to nor do we want them, nor, if we had them, would we build our 
 hopes of success upon that; <I>but we will remember,</I> and rely upon, 
 <I>the name of the Lord our God,</I> upon the relation we stand in to 
 him as the Lord our God and the knowledge we have of him by his name," 
 that is, all that whereby he makes himself known; this we will remember 
 and upon every remembrance of it will be encouraged. Note, those who 
 make God and his name their praise may make God and his name their 
 trust. 

 2. See the difference in the issue of their confidences and by that we
 are to judge of the wisdom of the choice; things are as they prove; see 
 who will be ashamed of their confidence and who not, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 "Those that trusted in their chariots and horses are brought down and
 fallen, and their chariots and horses were so far from saving them that 
 they helped to sink them, and made them the easier and the richer prey 
 to the conqueror,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:4">2 Sam. viii. 4</A>.

 But we that trust in the name of the Lord our God not only stand
 upright, and keep our ground, but have risen, and have got ground 
 against the enemy, and have triumphed over them." Note, A believing 
 obedient trust in God and his name is the surest way both to preferment 
 and to establishment, to rise and to stand upright, and this will stand 
 us in stead when creature-confidences fail those that depend upon 
 them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They conclude their prayer for the king with a <I>Hosanna, "Save, 
 now, we beseech thee,</I> O Lord!" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 As we read this verse, it may be taken as a prayer that God would not
 only bless the king, "Save, Lord, give him success," but that he would 
 make him a blessing to them, "<I>Let the king hear us</I> when we call 
 to him for justice and mercy." Those that would have good of their 
 magistrates must thus pray for them, for they, as all other creatures, 
 are that to us (and no more) which God makes them to be. Or it may 
 refer to the Messiah, that King, that King of kings; let him hear us 
 when we call; let him come to us according to the promise, in the time 
 appointed; let him, as the great Master of requests, receive all our 
 petitions and present them to the Father. But many interpreters give 
 another reading of this verse, by altering the pause, <I>Lord, save the 
 king, and hear us when we call;</I> and so it is a summary of the whole 
 psalm and is taken into our English Liturgy; <I>O Lord! save the king, 
 and mercifully hear us when we call upon thee.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+20:6-9">these verses</A>

 we should encourage ourselves to trust in God, and stir up ourselves to
 pray earnestly, as we are in duty bound, for those in authority over 
 us, that under them we may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all 
 godliness and honesty.</P>
