 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is with good reason that many sing this psalm very frequently in 
 their religious assemblies, for it is very proper both to express and 
 to excite pious and devout affections towards God in our approach to 
 him in holy ordinances; and, if our hearts go along with the words, we 
 shall make melody in it to the Lord. The Jews say it was penned to be 
 sung with their thank-offerings; perhaps it was; but we say that as 
 there is nothing in it peculiar to their economy so its beginning with 
 a call to all lands to praise God plainly extends it to the 
 gospel-church. Here, 

 I. We are called upon to praise God and rejoice in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+100:1,2,4">ver. 1, 2, 4</A>.

 II. We are furnished with matter for praise; we must praise him,
 considering his being and relation to us

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+100:3">ver. 3</A>)

 and his mercy and truth, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+100:5">ver. 5</A>.

 These are plain and common things, and therefore the more fit to be the 
 matter of devotion.</P>

 <P>A psalm of praise.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Make a joyful noise unto the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, all
 ye lands.
 &nbsp; 2  Serve the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> with gladness: come before his presence with
 singing.
 &nbsp; 3  Know ye that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> he <I>is</I> God: <I>it is</I> he <I>that</I> hath
 made us, and not we ourselves; <I>we are</I> his people, and the sheep
 of his pasture.
 &nbsp; 4  Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, <I>and</I> into his courts
 with praise: be thankful unto him, <I>and</I> bless his name.
 &nbsp; 5  For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> good; his mercy <I>is</I> everlasting; and his
 truth <I>endureth</I> to all generations.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The exhortations to praise are very importunate. The psalm does 
 indeed answer to the title, <I>A psalm of praise;</I> it begins with 
 that call which of late we have several times met with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+100:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all you lands,</I> or <I>all the 
 earth,</I> all the inhabitants of the earth. When all nations shall be 
 discipled, and the gospel preached to every creature, then this summons 
 will be fully answered to. But, if we take the foregoing psalm to be 
 (as we have opened it) a call to the Jewish church to rejoice in the 
 administration of God's kingdom, which they were under (as the four 
 psalms before it were calculated for the days of the Messiah), this 
 psalm, perhaps, was intended for proselytes, that came over out of all 
 lands to the Jews' religion. However, we have here, 

 1. A strong invitation to worship God; not that God needs us, or any
 thing we have or can do, but it is his will that we should <I>serve the 
 Lord,</I> should devote ourselves to his service and employ ourselves 
 in it; and that we should not only serve him in all instances of 
 obedience to his law, but that we should <I>come before his 
 presence</I> in the ordinances which he has appointed and in which he 
 has promised to manifest himself

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+100:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 that we should <I>enter into his gates and into his courts</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+100:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),
 
 that we should attend upon him among his servants, and keep there where 
 he keeps court. In all acts of religious worship, whether in secret or 
 in our families, we come into God's presence, and serve him; but it is 
 in public worship especially that we <I>enter into his gates and into 
 his courts.</I> The people were not permitted to enter into the holy 
 place; there the priests only went in to minister. But let the people 
 be thankful for their place in the courts of God's house, to which they 
 were admitted and where they gave their attendance. 

 2. Great encouragement given us, in worshipping God, to do it 
 cheerfully

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+100:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 <I>Serve the Lord with gladness.</I> This intimates a prediction that 
 in gospel-times there should be special occasion for joy; and it 
 prescribes this as a rule of worship: Let God be <I>served with 
 gladness.</I> By holy joy we do really serve God; it is an honour to 
 him to rejoice in him; and we ought to serve him with holy joy. 
 Gospel-worshippers should be joyful worshippers; if we serve God in 
 uprightness, let us serve him with gladness. We must be willing and 
 forward to it, glad when we are called to <I>go up to the house of the 
 Lord</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:1">Ps. cxxii. 1</A>),

 looking upon it as the comfort of our lives to have communion with God;
 and we must be pleasant and cheerful in it, must say, <I>It is good to 
 be here,</I> approaching to God, in every duty, as <I>to God our 
 exceeding Joy,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+43:4">Ps. xliii. 4</A>.

 We must <I>come before his presence with singing,</I> not only songs of
 joy, but songs of praise. <I>Enter into his gates with
 thanksgiving,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+100:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 We must not only comfort ourselves, but glorify God, with our joy, and
 let him have the praise of that which we have the pleasure of. <I>Be 
 thankful to him and bless his name;</I> that is, 

 (1.) We must take it as a favour to be admitted into his service, and 
 give him thanks that we have liberty of access to him, that we have 
 ordinances instituted and opportunity continued of waiting upon God in 
 those ordinances. 

 (2.) We must intermix praise and thanksgiving with all our services. 
 This golden thread must run through every duty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+13:15">Heb. xiii. 15</A>),

 for it is the work of angels. <I>In every thing give thanks,</I> in
 every ordinance, as well as in every providence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The matter of praise, and motives to it, are very important, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+100:3,5"><I>v.</I> 3, 5</A>.

 Know you what God is in himself and what he is to you. Note, Knowledge
 is the mother of devotion and of all obedience: blind sacrifices will
 never please a seeing God. "Know it; consider and apply it, and then
 you will be more close and constant, more inward and serious, in the
 worship of him." Let us know then these seven things concerning the
 Lord Jehovah, with whom we have to do in all the acts of religious
 worship:--

 1.  <I>That the Lord he is God,</I> the only living and true God--that
 he is a Being infinitely perfect, self-existent, and self-sufficient, 
 and the fountain of all being; he is God, and not a man as we are. He 
 is an eternal Spirit, incomprehensible and independent, the first cause 
 and last end. The heathen worshipped the creature of their own fancy; 
 the workmen made it, therefore it is not God. We worship him that made 
 us and all the world; he is God, and all other pretended deities are 
 vanity and a lie, and such as he has triumphed over. 

 2. That he is our Creator: <I>It is he that has made us, and not we 
 ourselves.</I> I find that I am, but cannot say, <I>I am that I am,</I> 
 and therefore must ask, Whence am I? Who made me?  <I>Where is God my 
 Maker?</I> And it is the Lord Jehovah. He gave us being, he gave us 
 this being; he is both the former of our bodies and the Father of our 
 spirits. We did not, we could not, make ourselves. It is God's 
 prerogative to be his own cause; our being is derived and depending. 

 3.  That therefore he is our rightful owner. The Masorites, by altering
 one letter in the Hebrew, read it, <I>He made us, and his we are,</I> 
 or <I>to him we belong.</I> Put both the readings together, and we 
 learn that because God <I>made us, and not we ourselves,</I> therefore 
 we are not our own, but his. He has an incontestable right to, and 
 property in, us and all things. His we are, to be actuated by his 
 power, disposed of by his will, and devoted to his honour and glory. 

 4.  That he is our sovereign ruler: <I>We are his people</I> or 
 subjects, and he is our prince, our rector or governor, that gives law 
 to us as moral agents, and will call us to an account for what we do.  
 <I>The Lord is our judge; the Lord is our lawgiver.</I> We are not at 
 liberty to do what we will, but must always make conscience of doing as 
 we are bidden. 

 5. That he is our bountiful benefactor. We are not only his sheep, whom
 he is entitled to, but <I>the sheep of his pasture,</I> whom he takes 
 care of; the <I>flock of his feeding</I> (so it may be read); therefore 
 the <I>sheep of his hand;</I> at his disposal because <I>the sheep of 
 his pasture,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:7">Ps. xcv. 7</A>.

 He that made us maintains us, and gives us all good things richly to
 enjoy. 

 6. That he is a God of infinite mercy and goodness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+100:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):
 
 <I>The Lord is good,</I> and therefore does good; <I>his mercy is 
 everlasting;</I> it is a fountain that can never be drawn dry. The 
 saints, who are now the sanctified vessels of mercy, will be, to 
 eternity, the glorified monuments of mercy. 

 7.  That he is a God of inviolable truth and faithfulness: <I>His truth
 endures to all generations,</I> and no word of his shall fall to the 
 ground as antiquated or revoked. The promise is sure to all the seed, 
 from age to age.</P>
