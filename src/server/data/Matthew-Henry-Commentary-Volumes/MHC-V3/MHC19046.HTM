 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm encourages us to hope and trust in God, and his power, and 
 providence, and gracious presence with his church in the worst of 
 times, and directs us to give him the glory of what he has done for us 
 and what he will do: probably it was penned upon occasion of David's 
 victories over the neighbouring nations 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:1-18">2 Sam. viii.</A>),

 and the rest which God gave him from all his enemies round about. We
 are here taught, 

 I.  To take comfort in God when things look very black and threatening, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:1-5">ver.  1-5</A>.

 II. To mention, to his praise, the great things he had wrought for his
 church against its enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>.

 III.  To assure ourselves that God who has glorified his own name will
 glorify it yet again, and to comfort ourselves with that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.
 
 We may, in singing it, apply it either to our spiritual enemies, and be 
 more than conquerors over them, or to the public enemies of Christ's 
 kingdom in the world and their threatening insults, endeavouring to 
 preserve a holy security and serenity of mind when they seem most 
 formidable. It is said of Luther that, when he heard any discouraging 
 news, he would say, Come let us sing the forty-sixth psalm.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  God <I>is</I> our refuge and strength, a very present help
 in trouble.
 &nbsp; 2  Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
 though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

 the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

 shall help her, <I>and that</I> right early.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist here teaches us by his own example.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To triumph in God, and his relation to us and presence with us, 
 especially when we have had some fresh experiences of his appearing in 
 our behalf 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>God is our refuge and strength;</I> we have found him so, he has
 engaged to be so, and he ever will be so. Are we pursued? God is our 
 refuge to whom we may flee, and in whom we may be safe and think 
 ourselves so; secure upon good grounds, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:10">Prov. xviii. 10</A>.

 Are we oppressed by troubles? Have we work to do and enemies to grapple
 with? God is our strength, to bear us up under our burdens, to fit us 
 for all our services and sufferings; he will by his grace put strength 
 into us, and on him we may stay ourselves. Are we in distress? He is a 
 help, to do all that for us which we need, <I>a present help, a help 
 found</I> (so the word is), one whom we have found to be so, a help on 
 which we may write <I>Probatum est--It is tried,</I> as Christ is 
 called a <I>tried stone,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:16">Isa. xxviii. 16</A>.

 Or, <I>a help at hand,</I> one that never is to seek for, but that is
 always near. Or, a <I>help sufficient,</I> a help accommodated to every 
 case and exigence; whatever it is, he is a very present help; we cannot 
 desire a better help, nor shall ever find the like in any creature.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To triumph over the greatest dangers: <I>God is our strength and 
 our help,</I> a God all-sufficient to us; <I>therefore will not we 
 fear.</I> Those that with a holy reverence fear God need not with any 
 amazement to be afraid of the power of hell or earth. <I>If God be for 
 us, who can be against us;</I> to do us any harm? It is our duty, it is 
 our privilege, to be thus fearless; it is an evidence of a clear 
 conscience, of an honest heart, and of a lively faith in God and his 
 providence and promise: "<I>We will not fear, though the earth be 
 removed,</I> though all our creature-confidences fail us and sink us; 
 nay, though that which should support us threaten to swallow us up, as 
 the earth did Korah," for whose sons this psalm was penned, and, some 
 think, by them; yet while we keep close to God, and have him for us, we 
 will not fear, for we have no cause to fear;</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe here, 

 1. How threatening the danger is. We will suppose the earth to be
 removed, and thrown into the sea, even the mountains, the strongest and 
 firmest parts of the earth, to lie buried in the unfathomed ocean; we 
 will suppose the sea to roar and rage, and make a dreadful noise, and 
 its foaming billows to insult the shore with so much violence as even 
 to <I>shake the mountains,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Though kingdoms and states be in confusion, embroiled in wars, tossed
 with tumults, and their governments incontinual revolution--though 
 their powers combine against the church and people of God, aim at no 
 less than their ruin, and go very near to gain their point--yet will 
 not we fear, knowing that all these troubles will end well for the 
 church. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:4">Ps. xciii. 4</A>.

 If the earth be removed, those have reason to fear who have laid up 
 their treasures on earth, and set their hearts upon it; but not those 
 who have laid up for themselves treasures in heaven, and who expect to 
 be most happy when <I>the earth and all the works that are therein 
 shall be burnt up.</I> Let those be troubled at the troubling of the 
 waters who build their confidence on such a floating foundation, but 
 not those who are led to <I>the rock that is higher than they,</I> and 
 find firm footing upon that rock. 

 2. How well-grounded the defiance of this danger is, considering how 
 well guarded the church is, and that interest which we are concerned 
 for. It is not any private particular concern of our own that we are in 
 pain about; no, it is the city of God, <I>the holy place of the 
 tabernacles of the Most High;</I> it is the ark of God for which our 
 hearts tremble. But, when we consider what God has provided for the 
 comfort and safety of his church, we shall see reason to have our 
 hearts fixed, and set above the fear of evil tidings. Here is,

 (1.) Joy to the church, even in the most melancholy and sorrowful times
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>There is a river the streams whereof shall make</I> it <I>glad,</I>
 even then when the waters of the sea roar and threaten it.  It alludes 
 to the waters of Siloam, which <I>went softly by Jerusalem</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:6,7">Isa. viii. 6, 7</A>):

 though of no great depth or breadth, yet the waters of it were made
 serviceable to the defence of Jerusalem in Hezekiah's time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:10,11">Isa. xxii. 10, 11</A>.

 But this must be understood spiritually; the covenant of grace is the
 river, the promises of which are the streams; or the Spirit of grace is 
 the river

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+7:38,39">John vii. 38, 39</A>),

 the comforts of which are <I>the streams, that make glad the city of
 our God.</I> God's word and ordinances are rivers and streams with 
 which God makes his saints glad in cloudy and dark days.  God himself 
 is to his church a place of <I>broad rivers and streams,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:21">Isa. xxxiii. 21</A>.

 The streams that make glad the city of God are not rapid, but gentle,
 like those of Siloam.  Note, The spiritual comforts which are conveyed 
 to the saints by soft and silent whispers, and which come not with 
 observation, are sufficient to counterbalance the most loud and noisy 
 threatenings of an angry and malicious world.  

 (2.) Establishment to the church. Though heaven and earth are shaken, 
 yet <I>God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 God has assured his church of his special presence with her and concern
 for her; his honour is embarked in her, he has set up his tabernacle in 
 her and has undertaken the protection of it, and therefore she shall 
 not be moved, that is,

 [1.] Not destroyed, not removed, as the earth may be 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The church shall survive the world, and be in bliss when that is in 
 ruins.  It is <I>built upon a rock,</I> and the <I>gates of hell shall 
 not prevail against it.</I>

 [2.] Not disturbed, not much moved, with fears of the issue. If God be 
 for us, if God be with us, we need not be moved at the most violent 
 attempts made against us. 

 (3.) Deliverance to the church, though her dangers be very great: 
 <I>God shall help her;</I> and who then can hurt her? He shall help her 
 under her troubles, that she shall not sink; nay, that the more she is 
 afflicted the more she shall multiply. God shall help her out of her 
 troubles, <I>and that right early</I>--when the morning appears; that 
 is, very speedily, for he is <I>a present help</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 and very seasonably, when things are brought to the last extremity and
 when the relief will be most welcome.  This may be applied by 
 particular believers to themselves; if God be in our hearts, in the 
 midst of us, by his word dwelling richly in us, we shall be 
 established, we shall be helped; let us therefore trust and not be 
 afraid; all is well, and will end well.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 These verses give glory to God both as King of nations and as King of 
 saints.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. As King of nations, ruling the world by his power and providence, 
 and overruling all the affairs of the children of men to his own glory; 
 he does according to his will among the inhabitants of the earth, and 
 none may say, <I>What doest thou?</I> 

 1.  He checks the rage and breaks the power of the nations that oppose
 him and his interests in the world 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>The heathen raged</I> at David's coming to the throne, and at the
 setting up of the kingdom of the Son of David; compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1,2">Ps. ii. 1, 2</A>.

 <I>The kingdoms were moved</I> with indignation, and rose in a
 tumultuous furious manner to oppose it; but God <I>uttered his voice, 
 spoke to them in his wrath,</I> and they were moved in another sense, 
 they were struck into confusion and consternation, put into disorder, 
 and all their measures broken; the earth itself melted under them, so 
 that they found no firm footing; their earthly hearts failed them for 
 fear, and dissolved like snow before the sun. Such a melting of the 
 spirits of the enemies is described, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:4,5">Judg. v. 4, 5</A>;

 and see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:25,26">Luke xxi. 25, 26</A>.

 2. When he pleases to draw his sword, and give it commission, he can
 make great havoc among the nations and lay all waste 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Come, behold the works of the Lord;</I> they are to be observed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:5">Ps.  lxvi. 5</A>),
 
 and to be sought out, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+111:2">Ps. cxi. 2</A>.

 All the operations of Providence must be considered as the works of the 
 Lord, and his attributes and purposes must be taken notice of in them. 
 Particularly take notice of the <I>desolations he has made in the 
 earth,</I> among the enemies of his church, who thought to lay the land 
 of Israel desolate. The destruction they designed to bring upon the 
 church has been turned upon themselves.  War is a tragedy which 
 commonly destroys the stage it is acted on; David carried the war into 
 the enemies' country; and O what desolations did it make there! Cities 
 were burnt, countries laid waste, and armies of men cut off and laid in 
 heaps upon heaps. Come and see the effects of desolating judgments, and 
 stand in awe of God; say, <I>How terrible art thou in thy works!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+66:3">Ps. lxvi. 3</A>.

 Let all that oppose him see this with terror, and expect the same cup 
 of trembling to be put into their hands; let all that fear him and 
 trust in him see it with pleasure, and not be afraid of the most 
 formidable powers armed against the church.  Let them gird themselves, 
 but <I>they shall be broken to pieces.</I> 

 3.  When he pleases to sheathe his sword, he puts an end to the wars of
 the nations and crowns them with peace, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 War and peace depend on his word and will, as much as storms and calms 
 at sea do,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+107:25,29">Ps. cvii. 25, 29</A>.

 <I>He makes wars to cease unto the end of the earth,</I> sometimes in 
 pity to the nations, that they may have a breathing-time, when, by long 
 wars with each other, they have run themselves out of breadth. Both 
 sides perhaps are weary of the war, and willing to let it fall; 
 expedients are found out for accommodation; martial princes are 
 removed, and peace-makers set in their room; and then the bow is broken 
 by consent, the spear cut asunder and turned into a pruning-hook, the 
 sword beaten into a ploughshare, and the chariots of war are burned, 
 there being no more occasion for them; or, rather, it may be meant of 
 what he does, at other times, in favour of his own people. He makes 
 those wars to cease that were waged against them and designed for their 
 ruin. He breaks the enemies' bow that was drawn against them. <I>No 
 weapon formed against Zion shall prosper,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:17">Isa. liv. 17</A>.

 The total destruction of Gog and Magog is prophetically described by
 the burning of their weapons of war

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+39:9,10">Ezek. xxxix. 9, 10</A>),

 which intimates likewise the church's perfect security and assurance of
 lasting peace, which made it needless to lay up those weapons of war 
 for their own service. The bringing of a long war to a good issue is a 
 work of the Lord, which we ought to behold with wonder and 
 thankfulness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. As King of saints, and as such we must own that <I>great and 
 marvellous are his works,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+15:3">Rev. xv. 3</A>.

 He does and will do great things,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. For his own glory 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):
 
 <I>Be still, and know that I am God.</I>
 
 (1.) Let his enemies be still, and threaten no more, but know it, to 
 their terror, that he is God, one infinitely above them, and that will 
 certainly be too hard for them; let them rage no more, for it is all in 
 vain: <I>he that sits in heaven, laughs at them;</I> and, in spite of 
 all their impotent malice against his name and honour, he will be 
 exalted among the heathen and not merely among his own people, he will 
 be exalted in the earth and not merely in the church. Men will set up 
 themselves, will have their own way and do their own will; but let them 
 know that God will be exalted, he will have his way will do his own 
 will, will glorify his own name, and <I>wherein they deal proudly he 
 will be above them,</I> and make them know that he is so. 

 (2.) Let his own people be still; let them be calm and sedate, and 
 tremble no more, but know, to their comfort, that the Lord is God, he 
 is God alone, and will be exalted above the heathen; let him alone to 
 maintain his honour, to fulfil his own counsels and to support his own 
 interest in the world. Though we be depressed, yet let us not be 
 dejected, for we are sure that God will be exalted, and that may 
 satisfy us; he will work for his great name, and then no matter what 
 becomes of our little names. When we pray, <I>Father, glorify thy 
 name,</I> we ought to exercise faith upon the answer given to that 
 prayer when Christ himself prayed it, <I>I have both glorified it and I 
 will glorify it yet again.</I> Amen, Lord, so be it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. For his people's safety and protection. He triumphs in the former: 
 <I>I will be exalted;</I> they triumph in this, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>

 and again 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.
 
 It is the burden of the song, "<I>The Lord of hosts is with us;</I> he 
 is on our side, he takes our part, is present with us and president 
 over us; <I>the God of Jacob is our refuge,</I> to whom we may flee, 
 and in whom we may confide and be sure of safety." Let all believers 
 triumph in this. 

 (1.) They have the presence of a God of power, of all power: <I>The 
 Lord of hosts is with us.</I> God is the Lord of hosts, for he has all 
 the creatures which are called <I>the hosts of heaven and earth</I> at 
 his beck and command, and he makes what use he pleases of them, as the 
 instruments either of his justice or of his mercy. This sovereign Lord 
 is with us, sides with us, acts with us, and has promised he will never 
 leave us. Hosts may be against us, but we need not fear them if the 
 Lord of hosts be with us. 

 (2.) They are under the protection of a God in covenant, who not only 
 is able to help them, but is engaged in honour and faithfulness to help 
 them. He is the God of Jacob, not only Jacob the person, but Jacob the 
 people; nay, and of all praying people, the spiritual seed of wrestling 
 Jacob; and he is our refuge, by whom we are sheltered and in whom we 
 are satisfied, who by his providence secures our welfare when without 
 are fightings, and who by his grace quiets our minds, and establishes 
 them, when within are fears. The Lord of hosts, the God of Jacob, has 
 been, is, and will be with us--has been, is and will be our refuge: the 
 original includes all; and well may <I>Selah</I> be added to it. Mark 
 this, and take the comfort of it, and say, <I>If God be for us, who can 
 be against us?</I></P>
