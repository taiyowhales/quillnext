 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As the foregoing psalm, in the type of David in preferment, showed us 
 the royal dignity of the Redeemer, so this, by the example of David in 
 distress, shows us the peace and holy security of the redeemed, how 
 safe they really are, and think themselves to be, under the divine 
 protection. David, being now driven out from his palace, from the royal 
 city, from the holy city, by his rebellious son Absalom, 

 I. Complains to God of his enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. Confides in God, and encourages himself in him as his God,
 notwithstanding, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:3">ver. 3</A>.

 III.  Recollects the satisfaction he had in the gracious answers God
 gave to his prayers, and his experience of his goodness to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 IV.  Triumphs over his fears 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:6">ver. 6</A>)

 and over his enemies, whom he prays against,,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:7">ver. 7</A>.

 V. Gives God the glory and takes to himself the comfort of the divine 
 blessing and salvation which are sure to all the people of God, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:8">ver. 8</A>.

 Those speak best of the truths of God who speak experimentally; so
 David here speaks of the power and goodness of God, and of the safety
 and tranquility of the godly.</P>

 The title of this psalm and many others is as a key hung ready at the 
 door, to open it, and let us into the entertainments of it; when we
 know upon what occasion a psalm was penned we know the better how to
 expound it. This was composed, or at least the substance of it was
 meditated and digested in David's thought, and offered up to God, when
 he fled from Absalom his son, who formed a conspiracy against him, to
 take away, not his crown only, but his life; we have the story,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:1-16:14">2 Sam. xv.</A>,

 &c.

 1. David was now in great grief; when, in his flight, he went up the
 Mount of Olives, he wept greatly, with his head covered, and marching 
 bare-foot; yet <I>then</I> he composed this comfortable psalm.  He wept 
 and prayed, wept and sung, wept and believed; this was sowing in tears. 
 Is any afflicted? Let him pray; nay, let him sing psalms, let him sing 
 this psalm. Is any afflicted with undutiful disobedient children? David 
 was; and yet that did not hinder his joy in God, nor put him out of 
 tune for holy songs. 

 2. He was now in great danger; the plot against him was laid deep, the 
 party that sought his ruin was very formidable, and his own son at the 
 head of them, so that his affairs seemed to be at the last extremity; 
 yet <I>then</I> he kept hold of his interest in God and improved that. 
 Perils and frights should drive us to God, not drive us from him. 

 3. He had now a great deal of provocation given him by those from whom
 he had reason to expect better things, from his son, whom he had been 
 indulgent of, from his subjects, whom he had been so great a blessing 
 to; this he could not but resent, and it was enough to break in upon 
 any man's temper; yet he was so far from any indecent expressions of 
 passion and indignation that he had calmness enough for those acts of 
 devotion which require the greatest fixedness and freedom of thought.  
 The sedateness of his mind was evinced by the Spirit's coming upon him; 
 for the Spirit chooses to move upon the still waters.  Let no 
 unkindness, no, not of a child or a friend, ever be laid so much to 
 heart as to disfit us for communion with God. 

 4. He was now suffering for his sin in the matter of Uriah; this was
 the evil which, for that sin, God threatened to <I>raise up against him 
 out of his own house</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+12:11">2 Sam. xii. 11</A>),

 which, no doubt, he observed, and took occasion thence to renew his
 repentance for it. Yet he did not <I>therefore</I> cast away his 
 confidence in the divine power and goodness, nor despair of succour. 
 Even our sorrow for sin must not hinder either our joy in God or our 
 hope in God. 

 5. He seemed cowardly in fleeing from Absalom, and quitting his royal
 city, before he had had one struggle for it; and yet, by this psalm, it 
 appears he was full of true courage arising from his faith in God. True 
 Christian fortitude consists more in a gracious security and serenity 
 of mind, in patiently bearing and patiently waiting, than in daring 
 enterprises with sword in hand.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:1-3">three verses</A>

 he applies to God. Whither else should we go but to him when any thing
 grieves us or frightens us? David was now at a distance from his own 
 closet, and from the courts of God's house, where he used to pray; and 
 yet he could find away open heaven-ward. Wherever we are we may have 
 access to God, and may draw nigh to him whithersoever we are driven. 
 David, in his flight, attends his God,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. With a representation of his distress, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 He looks round, and as it were takes a view of his enemies' camp, or 
 receives information of their designs against him, which he brings to 
 God, not to his own council-board. Two things he complains of, 
 concerning his enemies:--

 1.  That they were very many: <I>Lord, how are they increased!</I>
 beyond what they were at first, and beyond whatever he thought they 
 would have been. Absalom's faction, like a snow-ball, strangely 
 gathered in its motion. He speaks of it as one amazed, and well he 
 might, that a people he had so many ways obliged should almost 
 generally revolt from him, rebel against him, and choose for their head 
 such a foolish and giddy young man as Absalom was. How slippery and 
 deceitful are the many! And how little fidelity and constancy are to be 
 found among men! David had had the hearts of his subjects as much as 
 ever any king had, and yet now, of a sudden, he had lost them. As 
 people must not trust too much to princes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+146:3">Ps. cxlvi. 3</A>),

 so princes must not build too much upon their interest in the people.
 Christ, the Son of David, had many enemies.  When a great multitude 
 came to seize him, when the crowd cried, <I>Crucify him, Crucify 
 him,</I> how were those then increased that troubled him! Even good 
 people must not think it strange if the stream be against them and the 
 powers that threaten them grow more and more formidable. 

 2. That they were very malicious. They rose up against him; they aimed 
 to trouble him; but that was not all: they said of his soul, <I>There 
 is no help for him in God.</I> That is,

 (1.) They put a spiteful and invidious construction upon his troubles, 
 as Job's friends did upon him, concluding that, because his servants 
 and subjects forsook him thus and did not help him, God had deserted 
 him and abandoned his cause, and he was therefore to be looked 
 <I>on,</I> or rather to be looked <I>off,</I> as a hypocrite and a 
 wicked man. 

 (2.) They blasphemously reflected upon God as unable to relieve him: 
 "His danger is so great that God himself cannot help him." It is 
 strange that so great unbelief should be found in any, especially in 
 many, in Israel, as to think any party of men too strong for 
 Omnipotence to deal with. 

 (3.) They endeavoured to shake his confidence in God and drive him to 
 despair of relief from him: "They have said it <I>to</I> my soul;" so 
 it may be read; compare

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:1,42:10">Ps. xi. 1; xlii. 10</A>.

 This grieved him worst of all, that they had so bad an opinion of him
 as to think it possible to take him off from that foundation. The mere 
 temptation was a buffeting to him, <I>a thorn in his flesh,</I> nay, a 
 <I>sword in his bones.</I> Note, A child of God startles at the very 
 thought of despairing of help in God; you cannot vex him with any thing 
 so much as if you offer to persuade him that <I>there is no help for 
 him in God.</I> David comes to God, and tells him what his enemies said 
 of him, as Hezekiah spread Rabshakeh's blasphemous letter before the 
 Lord.  "They say, <I>There is no help for me in thee;</I> but, Lord, if 
 it be so, I am undone. They say to my soul, <I>There is no 
 salvation</I>" (for so the word is) "<I>for him in God;</I> but, Lord, 
 do thou say unto my soul, <I>I am thy salvation</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:3">Ps. xxxv. 3</A>)

 and that shall satisfy me, and in due time silence them." To this
 complaint he adds <I>Selah,</I> which occurs about seventy times in the 
 book of Psalms.  Some refer it to the music with which, in David's 
 time, the psalms were sung; others to the sense, and that it is a note 
 commanding a solemn pause. <I>Selah--Mark that,</I> or, "<I>Stop 
 there,</I> and consider a little." As here, they say, <I>There is no 
 help for him in God, Selah.</I> "Take time for such a thought as this.  
 <I>Get thee behind me, Satan. The Lord rebuke thee!</I> Away with such 
 a vile suggestion!"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. With a profession of his dependence upon God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 An active believer, the more he is beaten off from God, either by the 
 rebukes of Providence or the reproaches of enemies, the faster hold he 
 will take of him and the closer will he cleave to him; so David here, 
 when his enemies said, <I>There is no help for him in God,</I> cries 
 out with so much the more assurance, "<I>But thou, O Lord! art a shield 
 for me;</I> let them say what they will, I am sure thou wilt never 
 desert me, and I am resolved I will never distrust thee." See what God 
 is to his people, what he will be, what they have found him, what David 
 found in him. 

 1.  Safety: "<I>Thou art a shield for me,</I> a shield <I>about</I> me"
 (so some), "to secure me on all sides, since my enemies surrounded me." 
 Not only <I>my shield</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+15:1">Gen. xv. 1</A>),

 which denotes an interest in the divine protection, but a shield
 <I>for</I> me, which denotes the present benefit and advantage of that
 protection.

 2. Honour: <I>Thou art my glory.</I> Those whom God owns for his are
 not safe and easy, but really look great, and have true honour put upon
 them, far above that which the great ones of the earth are proud of.
 David was now in disgrace; the crown had fallen from his head; but he
 will not think the worse of himself while he has God for his glory,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:19">Isa. lx. 19</A>.

 "<I>Thou art my glory;</I> thy glory I reckon mine" (so some); "this is
 what I aim at, and am ambitious of, whatever my lot is, and whatever 
 becomes of my honour--that I may be to my God for a name and a praise."

 3. Joy and deliverance: "<I>Thou art the lifter up of my head;</I> thou
 wilt lift up my head <I>out of</I> my troubles, and restore me to my 
 dignity against, in due time; or, at least, thou wilt lift up my head
 <I>under</I> my troubles, so that I shall not droop nor be discouraged, 
 nor shall my spirits fail." If, in the worst of times, God's people can 
 lift up their heads with joy, knowing that all shall work for good to 
 them, they will own it is God that is the lifter up of their head, that 
 gives them both cause to rejoice and hearts to rejoice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this, and praying it over, we should possess ourselves with 
 an apprehension of the danger we are in from the multitude and malice 
 of our spiritual enemies, who seek the ruin of our souls by driving us 
 from our God, and we should concern ourselves in the distresses and 
 dangers of the church of God, which is every where spoken again, every 
 where fought against; but, in reference to both, we should encourage 
 ourselves in our God, who owns and protects and will in due time crown 
 his own interest both in the world and in the hearts of his people.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David, having stirred up himself by the irritations of his enemies to 
 take hold on God as his God, and so gained comfort in looking upward 
 when, if he looked round about him, nothing appeared but what was 
 discouraging, here looks back with pleasing reflections upon the 
 benefit he had derived from trusting in God and looks forward with 
 pleasing expectations of a very bright and happy issue to which the 
 dark dispensation he was now under would shortly be brought.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See with what comfort he looks back upon the communion he had had 
 with God, and the communications of his favour to him, either in some 
 former trouble he had been in, and through God's goodness got through, 
 or in this hitherto. David had been exercised with many difficulties, 
 often oppressed and brought very low; but still he had found God 
 all-sufficient. He now remembered with pleasure,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. That his troubles had always brought him to his knees, and that, in 
 all his difficulties and dangers, he had been enabled to acknowledge 
 God and to lift up his heart to him, and his voice too (this will be 
 comfortable reflection when we are in trouble): <I>I cried unto God 
 with my voice.</I> Care and grief do us good and no hurt when they set 
 us a praying, and engage us, not only to speak to God, but to cry to 
 him, as those that are in earnest. And though God understands the 
 language of the heart, when the <I>voice is not heard</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+1:13">1 Sam. i. 13</A>),
 
 and values not the hypocritical prayers of those who <I>cause their
 voice to be heard on high</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:4">Isa. lviii. 4</A>),

 <I>vox et pr&aelig;terea nihil</I>--<I>mere sound,</I> yet, when the
 earnestness of the voice comes from the fervency of the heart, it shall 
 be taken notice of, in the account, that we cried unto God with our 
 <I>voice.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. That he had always found God ready to answer his prayers: <I>He heard me out of his holy hill,</I> from heaven, the high and holy place, from the ark on Mount Sion, whence he used to give answers to those that sought to him. David had ordered Zadok

 to <I>carry back the ark into the city</I> when he was flying from 
 Absalom 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:25">2 Sam. xv. 25</A>),

 knowing that God was not tied, no, not to the ark of his presence, and
 that, notwithstanding the distance of place, he could by faith receive 
 answers of peace from the holy hill. No such things can fix a gulf 
 between the communications of God's grace towards us and the operations 
 of his grace in us, between his favour and our faith. The ark of the 
 covenant was in Mount Zion, and all the answers to our prayers come 
 from the promises of that covenant. Christ was <I>set King upon the 
 holy hill of Zion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:6">Ps. ii. 6</A>),

 and it is through him, whom the Father hears always, that our prayers
 are heard.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. That he had always been very safe and very easy under the divine 
 protection 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>I laid myself down and slept,</I> composed and quiet; <I>and 
 awaked</I> refreshed, <I>for the Lord sustained me.</I>" 

 (1.) This is applicable to the common mercies of every night, which we 
 ought to give thanks for alone, and with our families, every morning.  
 Many have not where to lay their head (but wander in deserts), or, if 
 they have, dare not lie down for fear of the enemy; but we have laid 
 ourselves down in peace. Many lie down and cannot sleep, but are full 
 of tossings to and fro till the dawning of the day, through pain of 
 body, or anguish of mind, or the continual alarms of fear in the night; 
 but we lie down and sleep in safety, though incapable of doing any 
 thing then for our own preservation. Many lie down and sleep, and never 
 awake again, they sleep the sleep of death, as the first-born of the 
 Egyptians; but we lie down and sleep, and awake again to the light and 
 comfort of another day; and whence is it, but because the Lord has 
 sustained us with sleep as with food? We have been safe under his 
 protection and easy in the arms of his good providence. 

 (2.) It seems here to be meant of the wonderful quietness and calmness 
 of David's spirit, in the midst of his dangers. Having by prayer 
 committed himself and his cause to God, and being sure of his 
 protection, his heart was fixed, and he was easy. The undutifulness of 
 his son, the disloyalty of his subjects, the treachery of many of his 
 friends, the hazard of his person, the fatigues of his march, and the 
 uncertainty of the event, never deprived him of an hour's sleep, nor 
 gave any disturbance to his repose; for the Lord, by his grace and the 
 consolations of his Spirit, powerfully sustained him and made him easy. 
 It is a great mercy when we are in trouble to have our minds stayed 
 upon God, so as never either to eat or sleep with trembling and 
 astonishment. 

 (3.) Some of the ancients apply it to the resurrection of Christ. In 
 his sufferings he offered up strong cries, and was heard; and 
 therefore, though he laid down and slept the sleep of death, yet he 
 awaked the third day, for the Lord sustained him, that he should not 
 see corruption.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That God had often broken the power and restrained the malice of his 
 enemies, had <I>smitten them upon the cheek-bone</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>),

 had silenced them and spoiled their speaking, blemished them and put 
 them to shame, smitten them on the cheek reproachfully, had disabled 
 them to do the mischief they intended; for he had broken their teeth. 
 Saul and the Philistines, who were sometimes ready to swallow him up, 
 could not effect what they designed. The teeth that are gnashed or 
 sharpened against God's people shall be broken. When, at any time, the 
 power of the church's enemies seems threatening, it is good to remember 
 how often God has broken it; and we are sure that his arm is not 
 shortened.  He can stop their mouths and tie their hands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See with what confidence he looks forward to the dangers he had yet 
 in prospect. Having put himself under God's protection and often found 
 the benefit of it, 
 
 1. His <I>fears were all stilled and silenced,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 With what a holy bravery does he bid defiance to the impotent menaces
 and attempts of his enemies! "<I>I will not be afraid of ten thousands 
 of people,</I> that either in a foreign invasion or an intestine 
 rebellion <I>set themselves,</I> or encamp, <I>against me round 
 about.</I>" No man seemed less safe (his enemies are numerous, <I>ten 
 thousands;</I> they are spiteful and resolute, "They have set 
 themselves against me; nay, they have prevailed far, and seem to have 
 gained their point; for they are against me round about on every side, 
 thousands against one"), and yet no man was more secure: "I will not be 
 afraid, for all this; they cannot hurt me, and therefore they shall not 
 frighten me; whatever prudent methods I take for my own preservation, I 
 will not disquiet myself, distrust my God, nor doubt of a good issue at 
 last." When David, in his flight from Absalom, bade Zadok carry back 
 the ark, he spoke doubtfully of the issue of his present troubles, and 
 concluded, like a humble penitent, <I>Here I am; let him do to me what 
 seemeth to him good,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+15:26">2 Sam. xv. 26</A>.

 But now, like a strong believer, he speaks confidently, and has no fear
 concerning the event. Note, A cheerful resignation to God is the way to 
 obtain a cheerful satisfaction and confidence in God. 

 2. His prayers were quickened and encouraged,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 He believed God was his Saviour, and yet prays; nay, he 
 <I>therefore</I> prays, <I>Arise, O Lord! save me, O my God!</I> 
 Promises of salvation do not supersede, but engage, our petitions for 
 it. He will for this be enquired of.  

 3. His faith became triumphant.  He began the psalm with complaints of
 the strength and malice of his enemies, but concludes it with 
 exultation in the power and grace of his God, and now sees more with 
 him than against him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 Two great truths he here builds his confidence upon and fetches comfort 
 from.  

 (1.) That <I>salvation belongeth unto the Lord;</I> he has power to 
 save, be the danger ever so great; it is his prerogative to save, when 
 all other helps and succours fail; it is his pleasure, it is his 
 property, it is his promise to those that are his, whose salvation is 
 not of themselves, but of the Lord. Therefore all that have the Lord 
 for their God, according to the tenour of the new covenant, are sure of 
 salvation; for he that is their God is the God of salvation. 

 (2.) That his blessing is upon his people; he not only has power to 
 save them, but he has assured them of his kind and gracious intentions 
 towards them. He has, in his word, pronounced a blessing upon his 
 people; and we are bound to believe that that blessing does accordingly 
 rest upon them, though there be not the visible effects of it. Hence we 
 may conclude that God's people, though they may lie under the 
 reproaches and censures of men, are surely blessed of him, who blesses 
 indeed, and therefore can command a blessing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this, and praying it over, we must own the satisfaction we 
 have had in depending upon God and committing ourselves to him, and
 encourage ourselves, and one another to continue still hoping and 
 quietly waiting for the salvation of the Lord.</P>
