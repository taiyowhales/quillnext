 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David penned this psalm in his old age, as appears by several passages 
 in it, which makes many think that it was penned at the time of 
 Absalom's rebellion; for that was the great trouble of his later days. 
 It might be occasioned by Sheba's insurrection, or some trouble that 
 happened to him in that part of his life of which it was foretold that 
 the sword should not depart from his house. But he is not 
 over-particular in representing his case, because he intended it for 
 the general use of God's people in their afflictions, especially those 
 they meet with in their declining years; for this psalm, above any 
 other, is fitted for the use of the old disciples of Jesus Christ. 

 I. He begins the psalm with believing prayers, with prayers that God
 would deliver him and save him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:2,4">ver. 2, 4</A>),
 
 and not cast him off 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:9">ver. 9</A>)

 or be far from him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:12">ver. 12</A>),

 and that his enemies might be put to shame, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:13">ver. 13</A>.

 He pleads his confidence in God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:1,3,5,7">ver. 1, 3, 5, 7</A>),

 the experience he had had of help from God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:6">ver. 6</A>),

 and the malice of his enemies against him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:10,11">ver. 10, 11</A>.

 II. He concludes the psalm with believing praises

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:14">ver. 14</A>,

 &c.). Never was his hope more established, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:16,18,20,21">ver. 16, 18, 20, 21</A>.
 
 Never were his joys and thanksgivings more enlarged, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:15,19,22-24">ver. 15, 19, 22-24</A>.
 
 He is in an ecstasy of joyful praise; and, in the singing of it, we too 
 should have our faith in God encouraged and our hearts raised in 
 blessing his holy name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, do I put my trust: let me never be put to
 confusion.
 &nbsp; 2  Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape:
 incline thine ear unto me, and save me.
 &nbsp; 3  Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually
 resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou <I>art</I> my
 rock and my fortress.
 &nbsp; 4  Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of
 the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
 &nbsp; 5  For thou <I>art</I> my hope, O Lord G<FONT SIZE=-1><B>OD</B></FONT>: <I>thou art</I> my trust from
 my youth.
 &nbsp; 6  By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that
 took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise <I>shall be</I>
 continually of thee.
 &nbsp; 7  I am as a wonder unto many; but thou <I>art</I> my strong refuge.
 &nbsp; 8  Let my mouth be filled <I>with</I> thy praise <I>and with</I> thy
 honour all the day.
 &nbsp; 9  Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when
 my strength faileth.
 &nbsp; 10  For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait
 for my soul take counsel together,
 &nbsp; 11  Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for
 <I>there is</I> none to deliver <I>him.</I>
 &nbsp; 12  O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.
 &nbsp; 13  Let them be confounded <I>and</I> consumed that are adversaries
 to my soul; let them be covered <I>with</I> reproach and dishonour
 that seek my hurt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Two things in general David here prays for--that he might not be
 confounded and that his enemies and persecutors might be 
 confounded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He prays that he might never be made ashamed of his dependence upon 
 God nor disappointed in his believing expectations from him. With this 
 petition every true believer may come boldly to the throne of grace; 
 for God will never disappoint the hope that is of his own raising. Now 
 observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How David professes his confidence in God, and with what pleasure 
 and grateful variety of expression he repeats his profession of that 
 confidence, still presenting the profession of it to God and pleading 
 it with him. We praise God, and so please him, by telling him (if it be 
 indeed true) what an entire confidence we have in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>In thee, O Lord!</I> and in thee only, <I>do I put my trust.</I>
 Whatever others do, I choose the God of Jacob for my help." Those that 
 are entirely satisfied with God's all-sufficiency and the truth of his 
 promise, and in dependence upon that, as sufficient to make them 
 amends, are freely willing to do and suffer, to lose and venture, for 
 him, may truly say, <I>In thee, O Lord! do I put my trust.</I> Those 
 that will deal with God must deal upon trust; if we are shy of dealing 
 with him, it is a sign we do not trust him. <I>Thou art my rock and my 
 fortress</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 and again, "<I>Thou art my refuge, my strong refuge</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 that is, "I fly to thee, and am sure to be safe in thee, and under thy
 protection. If thou secure me, none can hurt me. <I>Thou art my hope
 and my trust</I>"

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 that is, "thou hast proposed thyself to me in thy word as the proper
 object of my hope and trust; I have hoped in thee, and never found it 
 in vain to do so."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How his confidence in God is supported and encouraged by his 
 experiences 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast been my trust from my youth;</I> ever since I was capable
 of discerning between my right hand and my left, I stayed myself upon 
 thee, and saw a great deal of reason to do so; for <I>by thee have I 
 been holden up from the womb.</I>" Ever since he had the use of his 
 reason he had been a dependent upon God's goodness, because ever since 
 he had had a being he had been a monument of it. Note, The 
 consideration of the gracious care which the divine Providence took of 
 us in our birth and infancy should engage us to an early piety and 
 constant devotedness to his honour. He that was our help from our birth 
 ought to be our hope from our youth. If we received so much mercy from 
 God before we were capable of doing him any service, we should lose no 
 time when we are capable. This comes in here as a support to the 
 psalmist in his present distress; not only that God had given him his 
 life and being, bringing him out of his mother's bowels into the world, 
 and providing that he should not die from the womb, nor give up the 
 ghost when he came out of the belly, but that he had betimes made him 
 one of his family: "Thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels 
 into the arms of thy grace, under the shadow of thy wings, into the 
 bond of thy covenant; thou tookest me into thy church, as a son of thy 
 handmaid, and born in thy house,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+116:16">Ps. cxvi. 16</A>.

 And therefore," 

 (1.) "I have reason to hope that thou wilt protect me; thou that hast
 held me up hitherto wilt not let me fall now; thou that madest me wilt 
 not forsake the work of thy own hands; thou that helpedst me when I 
 could not help myself wilt not abandon me now that I am as helpless as 
 I was then."

 (2.) "Therefore I have reason to resolve that I will devote myself unto
 thee: <I>My praise shall therefore be continually of thee;</I>" that 
 is, "I will make it my business every day to praise thee and will take 
 all occasions to do it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What his requests to God are, in this confidence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That he might <I>never be put to confusion</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 that he might not be disappointed of the mercy he expected and so made
 ashamed of his expectation. Thus we may all pray in faith that our 
 confidence in God may not be our confusion. Hope of the glory of God is 
 hope that makes not ashamed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That he might be delivered out of the hand of his enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 "<I>Deliver me in thy righteousness.</I> As thou art the righteous
 Judge of the world, pleading the cause of the injured and punishing the 
 injurious, cause me in some way or other to escape" (God will, with the 
 temptation, make a way to escape, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:13">1 Cor. x. 13</A>):

 "<I>Incline thy ear unto my prayers,</I> and, in answer to them, save
 me out of my troubles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 Deliver me, O my God! out of the hands of those that are ready to pull
 me in pieces." Three things he pleads for deliverance:--

 [1.] The encouragement God had given him to expect it: <I>Thou hast 
 given commandment to save me</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 that is, thou hast promised to do it, and such efficacy is there in
 God's promises that they are often spoken of as commands, like that, 
 <I>Let there be light, and there was light.</I> He speaks, and it is 
 done. 

 [2.] The character of his enemies; they are <I>wicked, unrighteous, 
 cruel men,</I> and it will be for the honour of God to appear against 
 them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 for he is a holy, just, and good God. 

 [3.] The many eyes that were upon him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>I am as a wonder unto many;</I> every one waits to see what will be
 the issue of such extraordinary troubles as I have fallen into and such 
 extraordinary confidence as I profess to have in God." Or, "I am looked 
 upon as a monster, am one whom every body shuns, and therefore am 
 undone if the Lord be not my refuge. Men abandon me, but God will 
 not."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That he might always find rest and safety in God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Be thou my strong habitation;</I> by thou to me <I>a rock of repose,
 whereto I may continually resort.</I> Those that are at home in God, 
 that live a life of communion with him and confidence in him, that 
 continually resort unto him by faith and prayer, having their eyes ever 
 towards him, may promise themselves a strong habitation in him, such as 
 will never fall of itself nor can ever be broken through by any 
 invading power; and they shall be welcome to resort to him continually 
 upon all occasions, and not be upbraided as coming too often.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) That he might have continual matter for thanksgiving to God, and 
 might be continually employed in that pleasant work 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Let my mouth be filled with thy praise,</I> as now it is with my
 complaints, and then I shall not be ashamed of my hope, but my enemies 
 will be ashamed of their insolence." Those that love God love to be 
 praising him, and desire to be doing it all the day, not only in their 
 morning and evening devotions, not only <I>seven times a day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:164">Ps. cxix. 164</A>),

 but <I>all the day,</I> to intermix with all they say something or 
 other that may redound to the honour and praise of God. They resolve to 
 do it while they live; they hope to be doing it eternally in a better 
 world.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (5.) That he might not be neglected now in his declining years 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 <I>Cast me not off</I> now <I>in the time of</I> my <I>old gage;
 forsake me not when my strength fails.</I> Observe here, 

 [1.] The natural sense he had of the infirmities of age: <I>My strength 
 fails.</I> Where there was strength of body and vigour of mind, strong 
 sight, a strong voice, strong limbs, alas! in old age they fail; the 
 life is continued, but the strength is gone, or that which is his 
 <I>labour and sorrow,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:10">Ps. xc. 10</A>.

 [2.] The gracious desire he had of the continuance of God's presence
 with him under these infirmities: <I>Lord, cast me not off;</I> do 
 <I>not then forsake me.</I> This intimates that he should look upon 
 himself as undone if God should abandon him. To be cast off and 
 forsaken of God is a thing to be dreaded at any time, especially in the 
 time of old age and when our strength fails us; for it is God that is 
 the strength of our heart. But it intimates that he had reason to hope 
 God would not desert him; the faithful servants of God may be 
 comfortably assured that he will not cast them off in old age, nor 
 forsake them when their strength fails them. He is a Master that is not 
 wont to cast off old servants. In this confidence David here prays 
 again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>O God! be not far from me;</I> let me not be under the apprehension
 of thy withdrawings, for then I am miserable. <I>I my God!</I> a God in 
 covenant with me, <I>make haste for my help,</I> lest I perish before 
 help come."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He prays that his enemies might be made ashamed of their designs 
 against him. Observe, 

 1. What it was which they unjustly said against him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 Their plot was deep and desperate; it was against his life: <I>They lay
 wait for my soul</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 and are adversaries to that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 Their powers and policies were combined: <I>They take counsel
 together.</I> And very insolent they were in their deportment: They 
 say, <I>God has forsaken him; persecute and take him.</I> Here their 
 premises are utterly false, that because a good man was in great 
 trouble and had continued long in it, and was not so soon delivered as 
 perhaps he expected, therefore God had forsaken him and would have no 
 more to do with him. All are not forsaken of God who think themselves 
 so or whom others think to be so. And, as their premises were false, so 
 their inference was barbarous. If God has forsaken him, then persecute 
 and take him, and doubt not but to make a prey of him. This is 
 <I>talking to the grief of one whom God has smitten,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:26">Ps. lxix. 26</A>.

 But thus they endeavour to discourage David, as Sennacherib endeavoured
 to intimidate Hezekiah by suggesting that God was his enemy and fought
 against him. <I>Have I now come up without the Lord against this city,
 to destroy it?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+36:10">Isa. xxxvi. 10</A>.

 It is true, if God has forsaken a man, there is none to deliver him;
 but <I>therefore</I> to insult over him ill becomes those who are 
 conscious to themselves that they deserve to be for ever forsaken of 
 God. But <I>rejoice not against me, O my enemy! though I fall, I shall
 rise.</I> He that seems to forsake for a small moment will gather with 
 everlasting kindness. 

 2. What it was which he justly prayed for, from a spirit of prophecy, 
 not a spirit of passion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my
 soul.</I> If they will not be confounded by repentance, and so saved, 
 let them be confounded with everlasting dishonour, and so ruined." God 
 will turn into shame the glory of those who turn into shame the glory 
 of God and his people.</P>

 soul, which thou hast redeemed.

 long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame,
 that seek my hurt.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David is here in a holy transport of joy and praise, arising from his 
 faith and hope in God; we have both together 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>,

 where there is a sudden and remarkable change of his voice; his fears
 are all silenced, his hopes raised, and his prayers turned into 
 thanksgivings. "Let my enemies say what they will, to drive me to 
 despair, <I>I will hope continually,</I> hope in all conditions, in the 
 most cloudy and dark day; I will live upon hope and will hope to the 
 end." Since we hope in one that will never fail us, let not our hope in 
 him fail us, and then we shall praise him yet more and more. "The more 
 they reproach me the more closely will I cleave to thee; I <I>will 
 praise thee more</I> and better than ever I have done yet." The longer 
 we live the more expert we should grow in praising God and the more we 
 should abound in it. <I>I will add over and above all thy praise,</I>
 all the praise I have hitherto offered, for it is all too little. When 
 we have said all we can, to the glory of God's grace, there is still 
 more to be said; it is a subject that can never be exhausted, and 
 therefore we should never grow weary of it. Now observe, in these 
 verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How his heart is established in faith and hope; and it is a good 
 thing that the heart be so established. Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. What he hopes in, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 (1.) In the power of God: "<I>I will go in the strength of the Lord
 God,</I> not sit down in despair, but stir up myself to and exert 
 myself in my work and warfare, will go forth and go on, not in any 
 strength of my own, but in God's strength--disclaiming my own 
 sufficiency and depending on him only as all-sufficient--in the 
 strength of his providence and in the strength of his grace." We must 
 always go about God's work in his strength, having our eyes up unto him 
 to work in us both to will and to do.

 (2.) In the promise of God: "<I>I will make mention of thy
 righteousness,</I> that is, thy faithfulness to every word which thou 
 hast spoken, the equity of thy disposals, and thy kindness to thy 
 people that trust in thee. This I will make mention of as my plea in 
 prayer for thy mercy." We may very fitly apply it to the righteousness 
 of Christ, which is called the <I>righteousness of God by faith,</I> 
 and which is <I>witnessed by the law and the prophets;</I> we must 
 depend upon God's strength for assistance and upon Christ's 
 righteousness for acceptance. <I>In the Lord have I righteousness and 
 strength,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:24">Isa. xlv. 24</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What he hopes for.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He hopes that God will not leave him in his old age, but will be 
 the same to him to the end that he had been all along, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.
 
 Observe here,

 [1.] What God had done for him when he was young: <I>Thou hast taught 
 me from my youth.</I> The good education and good instructions which 
 his parents gave him when he was young he owns himself obliged to give 
 God thanks for as a great favour. It is a blessed thing to be taught of 
 God from our youth, from our childhood to know the holy scriptures, and 
 it is what we have reason to bless God for. 

 [2.] What he had done for God when he was middle-aged: He had 
 <I>declared all God's wondrous works.</I> Those that have not good when 
 they are young must be doing good when they are grown up, and must 
 continue to communicate what they have received. We must own that all 
 the works of God's goodness to us are wondrous works, admiring he 
 should do so much for us who are so undeserving, and we must make it 
 our business to declare them, to the glory of God and the good of 
 others. 

 [3.] What he desired of God now that he was old: <I>Now that I am old 
 and gray-headed,</I> dying to this world and hastening to another, <I>O 
 God! forsake me not.</I> This is what he earnestly desires and 
 confidently hopes for. Those that have been taught of God from their 
 youth, and have made it the business of their lives to honour him, may 
 be sure that he will not leave them when they are old and gray-headed, 
 will not leave them helpless and comfortless, but will make the evil 
 days of old age their best days, and such as they shall have occasion 
 to say they have pleasure in. 

 [4.] What he designed to do for God in his old age: "I will not only 
 <I>show thy strength,</I> by my own experience of it, <I>to this 
 generation,</I> but I will leave my observations upon record for the 
 benefit of posterity, and so show it <I>to every one that is to
 come.</I>" As long as we live we should be endeavouring to glorify God 
 and edify one another; and those that have had the largest and longest 
 experience of the goodness of God to them should improve their 
 experiences for the good of their friends. It is a debt which the old 
 disciples of Christ owe to the succeeding generations to leave behind 
 them a solemn testimony to the power, pleasure, and advantage of 
 religion, and the truth of God's promises.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He hopes that God would revive him and raise him up out of his 
 present low and disconsolate condition 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Thou who hast made me to see and feel great and sore troubles,</I>
 above most men, <I>shalt quicken me again.</I> Note, 

 [1.] The best of God's saints and servants are sometimes exercised with 
 great and sore troubles in this world. 

 [2.] God's hand is to be eyed in all the troubles of the saints, and 
 that will help to extenuate them and make them seem light. He does not 
 say, "Thou hast burdened me with those troubles," but "shown them to 
 me," as the tender father shows the child the rod to keep him in awe. 
 
 [3.] Though God's people be brought ever so low he can revive them and
 raise them up. Are they dead? he can quicken them again. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:9">2 Cor. i. 9</A>.

 Are they buried, as dead men out of mind? he can bring <I>them up again
 from the depths of the earth,</I> can cheer the most drooping spirit 
 and raise the most sinking interest. 

 [4.] If we have a due regard to the hand of God in our troubles, we may 
 promise ourselves, in due time, a deliverance out of them. Our present 
 troubles, though great and sore, shall be no hindrance to our joyful 
 resurrection from the depths of the earth, witness our great Master, to 
 whom this may have some reference; his Father showed him great and sore 
 troubles, but quickened him and brought him up from the grave.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) He hopes that God would not only deliver him out of his troubles, 
 but would advance his honour and joy more than ever 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 "Thou shalt not only restore me to <I>my greatness</I> again, but shalt
 <I>increase</I> it, and give me a better interest, after this shock, 
 than before; thou shalt not only comfort me, but <I>comfort me on every 
 side,</I> so that I shall see nothing black or threatening on any 
 side." Note, Sometimes God makes his people's troubles contribute to 
 the increase of their greatness, and their sun shines the brighter for 
 having been under a cloud. If he make them contribute to the increase 
 of their goodness, that will prove in the end the increase of their 
 greatness, their glory; and if he comfort them on every side, according 
 to the time and degree wherein he has afflicted them on every side, 
 they will have no reason to complain. When our Lord Jesus was quickened 
 again, and brought back from the depths of the earth, his greatness was 
 increased, and he entered on the joy set before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) He hopes that all his enemies would be put to confusion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 He speaks of it with the greatest assurance as a thing done, and
 triumphs in it accordingly: <I>They are confounded, they are brought to 
 shame, that seek my hurt.</I> His honour would be their disgrace and 
 his comfort their vexation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let us now see how his heart is enlarged in joy and praises, how he 
 rejoices in hope, and sings in hope for we are saved by hope.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He will speak of God's righteousness and his salvation, as great 
 things, things which he was well acquainted with, and much affected 
 with, which he desired God might have the glory of and others might 
 have the comfortable knowledge of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>My mouth shall show forth thy righteousness and thy salvation;</I>
 and again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>),

 <I>My tongue shall talk of thy righteousness,</I> and this <I>all the
 day.</I> God's righteousness, which David seems here to be in a 
 particular manner affected with, includes a great deal: the rectitude 
 of his nature, the equity of his providential disposals, the righteous 
 laws he has given us to be ruled by, the righteous promises he has 
 given us to depend upon, and the everlasting righteousness which his 
 Son has brought in for our justification. God's righteousness and his 
 salvation are here joined together; let no man think to put them 
 asunder, nor expect salvation without righteousness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+50:23">Ps. l. 23</A>.

 If these two are made the objects of our desire, let them be made the
 subjects of our discourse all the day, for they are subjects that can 
 never be exhausted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He will speak of them with wonder and admiration, as one astonished 
 at the dimensions of divine love and grace, the height and depth, the 
 length and breadth, of it: "<I>I know not the numbers thereof,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 Though I cannot give a particular account of thy favours to me, they
 are so many, so great (if <I>I would count them, they are more in 
 number than the sand,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:5">Ps. xl. 5</A>),

 yet, knowing them to be numberless, I will be still speaking of them,
 for in them I shall find new matter," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 The righteousness that is in God is very high; that which is done by
 him for his people is very great: put both together, and we shall say, 
 <I>O God! who is like unto thee?</I> This is praising God, 
 acknowledging his perfections and performances to be,

 (1.) Above our conception; they are very high and great, so high that
 we cannot apprehend them, so great that we cannot comprehend them.

 (2.) Without any parallel; no being like him, no works like his: <I>O
 God! who is like unto thee?</I> None in heaven, none on earth, no 
 angel, no king. God is a non-such; we do not rightly praise him if we
 do not own him to be so.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He will speak of them with all the expressions of joy and 
 exultation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+71:22,23"><I>v.</I> 22, 23</A>.
 
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) How he would eye God in praising him. 

 [1.] As a faithful God: <I>I will praise thee, even thy truth.</I> God 
 is made known by his word; if we praise that, and the truth of that, we 
 praise him. By faith we set to our seal that God is true; and so we 
 praise his truth. 

 [2.] As a God in covenant with him: "<I>O my God!</I> whom I have 
 consented to and avouched for mine." As in our prayers, so in our 
 praises, we must look up to God as our God, and give him the glory of 
 our interest in him and relation to him. 

 [3.] As the <I>Holy One of Israel,</I> Israel's God in a peculiar 
 manner, glorious in his holiness among that people and faithful to his 
 covenant with them. It is God's honour that he is a Holy One; it is his 
 people's honour that he is the Holy One of Israel.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) How he will express his joy and exultation. 

 [1.] With his hand, in sacred music--<I>with the psaltery, with the 
 harp;</I> at these David excelled, and the best of his skill shall be 
 employed in setting forth God's praises to such advantage as might 
 affect others. 

 [2.] With his lips, in sacred songs: "<I>Unto thee will I sing,</I> to 
 thy honour, and with a desire to be accepted of thee. <I>My lips shall
 greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee,</I> knowing they cannot be 
 better employed." 

 [3.] In both with his heart: "<I>My soul</I> shall rejoice <I>which 
 thou hast redeemed.</I>" Note, <I>First,</I> Holy joy is the very heart 
 and life of thankful praise. <I>Secondly,</I> We do not make melody to
 the Lord, in singing his praises, if we do not do it with our hearts. 
 My lips shall rejoice, but that is nothing; lip-labour, though ever so 
 well laboured, if that be all, is but lost labour in serving God; the 
 soul must be at work, and with all that is within us we must bless his 
 holy name, else all about us is worth little. <I>Thirdly,</I> Redeemed 
 souls ought to be joyful thankful souls. The work of redemption ought, 
 above all God's works, to be celebrated by us in our praises. The Lamb 
 that was slain, and has redeemed us to God, must therefore be counted 
 worthy of all blessing and praise.</P>
