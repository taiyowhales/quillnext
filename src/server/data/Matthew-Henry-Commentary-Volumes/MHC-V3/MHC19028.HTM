 <HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=50>
 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The former part of this psalm is the prayer of a saint militan and now
 in distress

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>),

 to which is added the doom of God's implacable enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 The latter part of the psalm is the thanksgiving of a saint triumphant,
 and delivered out of his distresses

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:6-8">ver. 6-8</A>),

 to which is added a prophetical prayer for all God's faithful loyal
 subjects, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:9">ver. 9</A>.

 So that it is hard to say which of these two conditions David was in
 when he penned it. Some think he was now in trouble seeking God, but at
 the same time preparing to praise him for his deliverance, and by faith
 giving him thanks for it, before it was wrought. Others think he was 
 now in triumph, but remembered, and recorded for his own and others' 
 benefit, the prayers he made when he was in affliction, that the mercy 
 might relish the better, when it appeared to be an answer to them.</P>

 <P>A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Unto thee will I cry,
 O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> my rock;
 be not silent to me: lest, <I>if</I> thou be silent to me, I become
 like them that go down into the pit.
 &nbsp; 2  Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee,
 when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
 &nbsp; 3  Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of
 iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief
 <I>is</I> in their hearts.
 &nbsp; 4  Give them according to their deeds, and according to the
 wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their
 hands; render to them their desert.
 &nbsp; 5  Because they regard not the works of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, nor the
 operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them
 up.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses David is very earnest in prayer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He prays that God would graciously hear and answer him, now that, in 
 his distress, he called upon him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>.

 Observe his faith in prayer: <I>O Lord, my rock,</I> denoting his 
 belief of God's power (he is a rock) and his dependence upon that 
 power--"He is <I>my rock,</I> on whom I build my hope." Observe his 
 fervency in prayer: "<I>To thee will I cry,</I> as one in earnest, 
 being ready to sink, unless thou come in with seasonable succour." And 
 observe how solicitous he is to obtain an answer: <I>"Be not silent to 
 me,</I> as one angry at my prayers,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:4">Ps. lxxx. 4</A>.

 Lord, speak to me, answer me <I>with good words and comfortable
 words</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:13">Zech. i. 13</A>);

 though the thing I pray for has not been given me, yet let God speak to
 me joy and gladness, and make me to hear them.  Lord, speak for me, in 
 answer to my prayers, plead my cause, command deliverances for me, and 
 thus hear and answer the voice of my supplications." Two things he 
 pleads:--

 1. The sad despair he should be in if God slighted him: "<I>If thou be 
 silent to me,</I> and I have not the tokens of thy favour, I am <I>like 
 those that go down into the pit</I> (that is, I am a dead man, lost and 
 undone); if God be not my friend, appear not to me and appear not for 
 me, my hope and my help will have perished." Nothing can be so cutting, 
 so killing, to a gracious soul, as the want of God's favour and the 
 sense of his displeasure. <I>I shall be like those that go down to 
 hell</I> (so some understand it); for what is the misery of the damned 
 but this, that God is ever silent to them and deaf to their cry?  Those 
 are in some measure qualified for God's favour, and may expect it, who 
 are thus possessed with a dread of his wrath, and to whom his frowns 
 are worse than death.

 2. The good hopes he had that God would favour him: <I>I lift up my 
 hands towards thy holy oracle,</I> which denotes, not only an earnest 
 desire, but an earnest expectation, thence to receive an answer of 
 peace. The most holy place within the veil is here, as elsewhere, 
 called the <I>oracle;</I> there the ark and the mercy-seat were, there 
 God was said to <I>dwell between the cherubim,</I> and thence he spoke 
 to his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+7:89">Num. vii. 89</A>.

 That was a type of Christ, and it is to him that we must lift up our
 eyes and hands, for through him all good comes from God to us. It was 
 also a figure of heaven

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:24">Heb. ix. 24</A>);

 and from God as our Father in heaven we are taught to expect an answer
 to our prayers. The scriptures are called <I>the oracles of God,</I> 
 and to them we must have an eye in our prayers and expectations. There 
 is the word on which God hath caused and encouraged us to hope.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He deprecates the doom of wicked people, as before 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+26:9">Ps. xxvi. 9</A>,

 "<I>Gather not my soul with sinners</I>): Lord, I attend thy holy 
 oracle, <I>draw me not away</I> from that <I>with the wicked, and with 
 the workers of iniquity,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 1. "Save me from being entangled in the snares they have laid for me.
 They flatter and cajole me, and speak peace to me; but they have a 
 design upon me, for <I>mischief is in their heart;</I> they aim to 
 disturb me, nay, to destroy me. Lord, suffer me not to be drawn away 
 and ruined by their cursed plots; for they have, can have, no power, no 
 success, against me, except it be given them from above." 

 2. "Save me from being infected with their sins and from doing as they 
 do. Let me not be drawn away by their fallacious arguments, or their 
 allurements, from the holy oracle (where I desire to dwell all the days 
 of my life), to practise any wicked works;" see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:4">Ps. cxli. 4</A>.

 "Lord, never leave me to myself, to use such arts of deceit and
 treachery for my safety as they use to my ruin. Let no event of 
 Providence be an invincible temptation to me, to draw me either into 
 the imitation or into the interest of wicked people." Good men dread 
 the way of sinners; the best are sensible of the danger they are in of 
 being drawn aside into it; and therefore we should all pray earnestly 
 to God for his grace to keep us in our integrity. 

 3. "Save me from being involved in their doom; let me not be led forth
 with the workers of iniquity, for I am not one of those that speak 
 peace while war is in their hearts." Note, Those that are careful not 
 to partake with sinners in their sins have reason to hope that they 
 shall not partake with them in their plagues, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+18:4">
 Rev. xviii. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He imprecates the just judgments of God upon the workers of 
 iniquity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Give them according to their deeds.</I> This is not the language of
 passion or revenge, nor is it inconsistent with the duty of praying for 
 our enemies. But,

 1. Thus he would show how far he was from complying with the workers of
 iniquity, and with what good reason he had begged not to be drawn away 
 with them, because he was convinced that they could not be made more 
 miserable then to be dealt with according to their deeds. 

 2. Thus he would express his zeal for the honour of God's justice in 
 the governing world. "Lord, they think all well that they do, and 
 justify themselves in their wicked practices. Lord, <I>give them after 
 the work of their hands,</I> and so undeceive those about them, who 
 think there is no harm in what they do because it goes unpunished,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:1,2">Ps. xciv. 1, 2</A>.

 3. This prayer is a prophecy that God will, sooner or later, render to
 all impenitent sinners according to their deserts. If what has been 
 done amiss be not undone by repentance, there will certainly come a 
 reckoning day, when God will render to every man who persists in his 
 evil deeds according to them.  It is a prophecy particularly of the 
 destruction of destroyers: "<I>They speak peace to their neighbours, 
 but mischief is in their hearts;</I> Lord, <I>give them according to 
 their deeds,</I> let the spoilers be spoiled, and let those be 
 treacherously dealt with who have thus dealt treacherously;" see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:1,Re+18:6,Re+13:10">Isa.  xxxiii. 1;
 Rev. xviii. 6; xiii. 10</A>.

 Observe, He foretels that God will reward them, not only according to
 their deed, but <I>according to the wickedness of their endeavours;</I> 
 for sinners shall be reckoned with, not only for the mischief they have 
 done, but for the mischief they would have done, which they designed, 
 and did what they could to effect. And, if God go by this rule in 
 dealing with the wicked, surely he will do so in dealing with the 
 righteous, and will reward them, not only for the good they have done, 
 but for the good they have endeavoured to do, though they could not 
 accomplish it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He foretels their destruction for their contempt of God and his 
 hand 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>Because they regard not the works of the Lord and the operations of
 his hands,</I> by which he manifests himself and speaks to the children 
 of men, <I>he will destroy them</I> in this world and in the other, 
 <I>and not build them up.</I>" Note, A stupid regardlessness of the 
 works of God is the cause of their ruin. Why do men question the being 
 or attributes of God, but because they do not duly regard his 
 handiworks, which declare his glory, and in which the invisible things 
 of him are clearly seen? Why do men forget God, and live without him, 
 nay, affront God, and live in rebellion against him, but because they 
 consider not the instances of that wrath of his which is revealed 
 <I>from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men?</I> 
 Why do the enemies of God's people hate and persecute them, and devise 
 mischief against them, but because they regard not the works God has 
 wrought for his church, by which he has made it appear how dear it is 
 to him? See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:12">Isa.  v. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this we must arm ourselves against all temptations to join 
 with the workers of iniquity, and animate ourselves against all the 
 troubles we may be threatened with by the workers of iniquity.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David gives God thanks for the audience of his prayers as 
 affectionately as a few verses before he had begged it: <I>Blessed be 
 the Lord,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 How soon are the saints' sorrows turned into songs and their prayers 
 into praises! It was in faith that David prayed

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:2"><I>v.</I>  2</A>),

 <I>Hear the voice of my supplications;</I> and by the same faith he
 gives thanks

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>)

 that <I>God has heard the voice of his supplications.</I> Note,

 1. Those that pray in faith may rejoice in hope. "He hath heard me
 (graciously accepted me) and I am as sure of a real answer as if I had 
 it already." 

 2. What we win by prayer we must wear by praise. Has God heard our 
 supplications? Let us then bless his name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He encourages himself to hope in God for the perfecting of every 
 thing that concerned him. Having given to God the glory of his grace 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 he is humbly bold to take the comfort of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 This is the method of attaining peace: let us begin with praise that is 
 attainable.  Let us first bless God and then bless ourselves. Observe,

 1. His dependence upon God: "<I>The Lord is my strength,</I> to support
 me, and carry me on, through all my services and sufferings. He is 
 <I>my shield,</I> to protect me from all the malicious designs of my 
 enemies against me. I have chosen him to be so, I have always found him 
 so, and I expect he will still be so." 

 2. His experience of the benefits of that dependence: "<I>My heart 
 trusted in him,</I> and in his power and promise; and it has not been 
 in vain to do so, for <I>I am helped,</I> I have been often helped; not 
 only God has given to me, in his due time, the help I trusted to him 
 for, but my very trusting in him has helped me, in the mean time, and 
 kept me from fainting."

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+27:13">Ps. xxvii. 13</A>.

 The very actings of faith are present aids to a dropping spirit, and
 often help it at a dead lift. 
 
 3. His improvement of this experience.
 
 (1.) He had the pleasure of it: <I>Therefore my heart greatly 
 rejoices.</I> The joy of a believer is seated in the heart, while, in 
 the laughter of the fool, the heart is sorrowful. It is great joy, 
 <I>joy unspeakable and full of glory.</I> The heart that truly believes 
 shall in due time greatly rejoice; it is <I>joy and peace in 
 believing</I> that we are to expect. 

 (2.) God shall have the praise of it: when <I>my heart greatly 
 rejoices, with my song will I praise him.</I> Thus must we express our
 gratitude; it is the least we can do; and others will hereby be invited 
 and encouraged to trust in him too.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He pleases himself with the interest which all good people, 
 through Christ, have in God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>The Lord is their strength;</I> not mine only, but the strength of
 every believer." Note, The saints rejoice in their friends' comforts as 
 well as their own; for, as we have not the less benefit from the light 
 of the sun, so neither from the light of Gods' countenance, for others' 
 sharing therein; for we are sure there is enough for all and enough for 
 each. This is our communion with all saints, that God is their strength 
 and ours, Christ their Lord and ours,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:2">1 Cor. i. 2</A>.

 He is their strength, the strength of all Israel, because he is <I>the
 saving strength of his anointed,</I> that is, 

 1.  Of David in the type.  God, in strengthening him that was their
 king and fought their battles, strengthened the whole kingdom. He calls 
 himself God's <I>anointed</I> because it was the unction he had 
 received that exposed him to the envy of his enemies, and therefore 
 entitled him to the divine protection. 

 2.  Of Christ, his anointed, his Messiah, in the anti-type. God was his 
 saving strength, qualified him for his undertaking and carried him 
 through it; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:21,Isa+49:5,50:7,9">Ps. lxxxix. 21; Isa. xlix. 5; l. 7, 9</A>.

 And so he becomes their strength, the strength of all the saints; he
 strengthened him that is the church's head, and from him diffuses 
 strength to all the members, has commanded his strength, and so 
 <I>strengthens what he has wrought for us;</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:28,80,17,18">Ps. lxviii. 28; lxxx. 17, 18</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He concludes with a short but comprehensive prayer for the church 
 of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He prays for Israel, not as his people ("save my people, and bless my 
 inheritance"), though they were so, but, "<I>thine.</I>" God's
 interest in them lay nearer his heart than his own. <I>We are thy 
 people</I> is a good plea,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:9,Isa+63:19">Isa. lxiv. 9; lxiii. 19</A>.

 <I>I am thine, save me.</I> God's people are his inheritance, dear to
 him, and precious in his eyes; what little glory he has from this world 
 he has from them.  <I>The Lord's portion is his people.</I> That which 
 he begs of God for them is, 

 1. That he would save them from their enemies and the dangers they were
 exposed to. 

 2. That he would bless them with all good, flowing from his favour, in 
 performance of his promise, and amounting to a happiness for them. 

 3.  That he would <I>feed them,</I> bless them with plenty, and
 especially the plenty of his ordinances, which are food to the soul.  
 <I>Rule them;</I> so the margin. "Direct their counsels and actions 
 aright, and overrule their affairs for good. Feed them, and rule them; 
 set pastors, set rulers, over them, that shall do their office with
 wisdom and understanding." 

 4. That he would <I>lift them up for ever,</I> lift them up out of 
 their troubles and distresses, and do this, not only for those of that 
 age, but for his people in every age to come, even to the end. "Lift 
 them up into thy glorious kingdom, lift them up as high as heaven." 
 There, and there only, will the saints be lifted up for ever, never 
 more to sink or be depressed. Observe, Those, and those only, whom God 
 feeds and rules, who are willing to be taught, and guided, and 
 governed, by him, shall be saved, and blessed, and lifted up for 
 ever.</P>
