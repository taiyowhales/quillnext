 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have now before us one of the choicest and most excellent parts of
 all the Old Testament; nay, so much is there in it of Christ and his 
 gospel, as well as of God and his law, that it had been called <I>the 
 abstract,</I> or <I>summary, of both Testaments.</I> The History of 
 Israel, which we were long upon, let us to camps and council-boards, 
 and there entertained and instructed us in the knowledge of God. The 
 book of Job brought us into the schools, and treated us with profitable 
 disputations concerning God and his providence. But this book brings us 
 into the sanctuary, draws us off from converse with men, with the 
 politicians, philosophers, or disputers of this world, and directs us 
 into communion with God, by solacing and reposing our souls in him, 
 lifting up and letting out our hearts towards him. Thus may we be in 
 the mount with God; and we understand not our interests if we say not, 
 <I>It is good to be here.</I> Let us consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The title of this book. It is called, 

 1. The <I>Psalms;</I> under that title it is referred to,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:44">Luke xxiv. 44</A>.

 The Hebrew calls it <I>Tehillim,</I> which properly signifies <I>Psalms
 of praise,</I> because many of them are such; but <I>Psalms</I> is a 
 more general word, meaning all metrical compositions fitted to be sung,
 which may as well be historical, doctrinal, or supplicatory, as 
 laudatory. Though singing be properly the voice of joy, yet the 
 intention of songs is of a much greater latitude, to assist the memory, 
 and both to express and to excite all the other affections as well as 
 this of joy. The priests had a mournful muse as well as joyful ones; 
 and the divine institution of singing psalms is thus largely intended; 
 for we are directed not only to praise God, but to teach and admonish 
 ourselves and one another <I>in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual
 songs,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Col+3:16">Col. iii. 16</A>.

 2. It is called the <I>Book of Psalms;</I> so it is quoted by St.
 Peter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+1:20">Acts i. 20</A>.

 It is a collection of psalms, of all the psalms that were divinely 
 inspired, which, though composed at several times and upon several 
 occasions, are here put together without any reference to or dependence 
 upon one another; thus they were preserved from being scattered and 
 lost, and were in so much greater readiness for the service of the 
 church. See what a good master we serve, and what pleasantness there is 
 in wisdom's ways, when we are not only commanded to sing at our work, 
 and have cause enough given us to do so, but have words also put in our 
 mouths and songs prepared to our hands.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The author of this book. It is, no doubt, derived originally from
 the blessed Spirit. They are spiritual songs, words which the Holy
 Ghost taught. The penman of most of them was David the son of Jesse,
 who is therefore called the <I>sweet psalmist of Israel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+23:1">2 Sam. xxiii. 1</A>.

 Some that have not his name in their titles yet are expressly ascribed
 to him elsewhere, as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1-12">Ps. ii</A>.

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+4:25">Acts iv. 25</A>)
 
 and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+96:1-13">Ps. xcvi.</A>

 and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:1-45">cv.</A>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ch+16:1-43">1 Chron. xvi.</A>)

 One psalm is expressly said to be <I>the prayer of Moses</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:1-17">Ps. xc.</A>);

 and that some of the psalms were penned by Asaph is intimated,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+29:30">2 Chron. xxix. 30</A>,

 where they are said to <I>praise the Lord in the words of David and
 Asaph</I>, who is there called a <I>seer</I> or <I>prophet.</I> Some of
 the psalms seem to have been penned long after, as

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+137:1-9">Ps. cxxxvii.</A>,

 at the time of the captivity in Babylon; but the far greater part of
 them were certainly penned by David himself, whose genius lay towards 
 poetry and music, and who was raised up, qualified, and animated, for 
 the establishing of the ordinance of singing psalms in the church of 
 God, as Moses and Aaron were, in their day, for the settling of the 
 ordinances of sacrifice; theirs is superseded, but his remains, and 
 will to the end of time, when it shall be swallowed up in the songs of 
 eternity. Herein David was a type of Christ, who descended from him, 
 not from Moses, because he came to take away sacrifice (the family of 
 Moses was soon lost and extinct), but to establish and perpetuate joy 
 and praise; for of the family of David in Christ there shall be no 
 end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The scope of it. It is manifestly intended, 

 1. To assist the exercises of natural religion, and to kindle in the 
 souls of men those devout affections which we owe to God as our 
 Creator, owner, ruler, and benefactor. The book of Job helps to prove 
 our first principles of the divine perfections and providence; but this 
 helps to improve them in prayers and praises, and professions of desire 
 towards him, dependence on him, and an entire devotedness and 
 resignation to him. Other parts of scripture show that God is 
 infinitely above man, and his sovereign Lord; but this shows us that he 
 may, notwithstanding, be conversed with by us sinful worms of the 
 earth; and there are ways in which, if it be not our own fault, we may 
 keep up communion with him in all the various conditions of human life. 

 2. To advance the excellencies of revealed religion, and in the most 
 pleasing powerful manner to recommend it to the world. There is indeed 
 little or nothing of the ceremonial law in all the book of 
 <I>Psalms.</I> Though sacrifice and offering were yet to continue many 
 ages, yet they are here represented as things which God did not desire 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:6,51:16">Ps. xl. 6, li. 16</A>),

 as things comparatively little, and which in time were to vanish away.
 But the word and law of God, those parts of it which are moral and of 
 perpetual obligation are here all along magnified and made honourable, 
 nowhere more. And Christ, the crown and centre of revealed religion, 
 the foundation, corner, and top-stone, of that blessed building, is 
 here clearly spoken of in type and prophecy, his sufferings and the 
 glory that should follow, and the kingdom that he should set up in the 
 world, in which God's covenant with David, concerning his kingdom, was 
 to have its accomplishment.  What a high value does this book put upon 
 the word of God, his statutes and judgments, his covenant and the great 
 and precious promises of it; and how does it recommend them to us as 
 our guide and stay, and our heritage for ever!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The use of it. All scripture, being given by inspiration of God, is 
 profitable to convey divine light into our understandings; but this 
 book is of singular use with that to convey divine life and power, and 
 a holy warmth, into our affections. There is no one book of scripture
 that is more helpful to the devotions of the saints than this, and it 
 has been so in all ages of the church, ever since it was written and 
 the several parts of it were delivered to the chief musician for the 
 service of the church. 

 1. It is of use to be sung. Further than David's psalms we <I>may</I> 
 go, but we <I>need</I> not, for hymns and spiritual songs. What the 
 rules of the Hebrew metre were even the learned are not certain. But 
 these psalms ought to be rendered according to the metre of every 
 language, at least so as that they may be sung for the edification of 
 the church. And methinks it is a great comfort to us, when we are 
 singing David's psalms, that we are offering the very same praises to 
 God that were offered to him in the days of David and the other godly 
 kings of Judah. So rich, so well made, are these divine poems, that 
 they can never be exhausted, can never be worn thread-bare. 

 2. It is of use to be read and opened by the ministers of Christ, as 
 containing great and excellent truths, and rules concerning good and 
 evil. Our Lord Jesus expounded the psalms to his disciples, the gospel 
 psalms, and opened their understandings (for he had the key of David) 
 to understand them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+24:44">Luke xxiv. 44</A>.

 3. It is of use to be read and meditated upon by all good people. It is
 a full fountain, out of which we may all be drawing water with joy. 
 
 (1.) The Psalmist's experiences are of great use for our direction,
 caution, and encouragement. In telling us, as he often does, what 
 passed between God and his soul, he lets us know what we may expect 
 from God, and what he will expect, and require, and graciously accept, 
 from us. David was a man after God's own heart, and therefore those who 
 find themselves in some measure according to his heart have reason to 
 hope that they are renewed by the grace of God, after the image of God, 
 and many have much comfort in the testimony of their consciences for 
 them that they can heartily say <I>Amen</I> to David's prayers and 
 praises. 

 (2.) Even the Psalmist's expressions too are of great use; and by them 
 the Spirit helps our praying infirmities, because we know not what to 
 pray for as we ought.  In all our approaches to God, as well as in our 
 first returns to God, we are directed to <I>take with us words</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:2">Hos. xiv. 2</A>),

 these words, words which the Holy Ghost teaches.  If we make David's
 psalms familiar to us, as we ought to do, whatever errand we have at 
 the throne of grace, by way of confession, petition, or thanksgiving, 
 we may thence be assisted in the delivery of it; whatever devout 
 affection is working in us, holy desire or hope, sorrow or joy, we may 
 there find apt words wherewith to clothe it, sound speech which cannot 
 be condemned. It will be good to collect the most proper and lively 
 expressions of devotion which we find here, and to methodize them, and 
 reduce them to the several heads of prayer, that they may be the more 
 ready to us. Or we may take sometimes one choice psalm and sometimes 
 another, and pray it over, that is, enlarge upon each verse in our own 
 thoughts, and offer up our meditations to God as they arise from the 
 expressions we find there. The learned Dr. Hammond, in his preface to 
 his paraphrase on the Psalms (sect. 29), says, "That going over a few 
 psalms with these interpunctions of mental devotion, suggested, 
 animated, and maintained, by the native life and vigour which is in the 
 psalms, is much to be preferred before the saying over the whole 
 Psalter, since nothing is more fit to be averted in religious offices 
 than their degenerating into heartless dispirited recitations." If, as 
 St. Austin advises, we form our spirit by the affection of the psalm, 
 we may then be sure of acceptance with God in using the language of it. 
 Nor is it only our devotion, and the affections of our mind, that the 
 book of Psalms assists, teaching us how to offer praise so as to 
 glorify God, but, it is also a directory to the actions of our lives, 
 and teaches us how to <I>order our conversation aright, so as that,</I> 
 in the end, <I>we may see the salvation of God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:23">Ps. i. 23</A>.

 The Psalms were thus serviceable to the Old-Testament church, but to us
 Christians they may be of more use than they could be to those who 
 lived before the coming of Christ; for, as Moses's sacrifices, so 
 David's songs, are expounded and made more intelligible by the gospel 
 of Christ, which lets us within the veil; so that if to David's prayers 
 and praises we add St.  Paul's prayers in his epistles, and the new
 songs in the Revelation, we shall be thoroughly furnished for this good

 As to the division of this book, we need not be solicitous; there is no 
 connexion (or very seldom) between one psalm and another, nor any 
 reason discernible for the placing of them in the order wherein we here 
 find them; but it seems to be ancient, for that which is now the second
 psalm was so in the apostles' time, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+13:33">Acts xiii. 33</A>.

 The vulgar Latin joins the 9th and 10th together; all popish authors
 quote by that, so that, thenceforward, throughout the book, their 
 number is one short of ours; our xi. is their x., our cxix. is their 
 cxviii. But they divide the 147th into two, and so make up the number 
 of 150. Some have endeavoured to reduce the psalms to proper heads,
 according to the matter of them, but there is often such a variety of 
 matter in one and the same psalm that this cannot be done with any 
 certainty. But the seven penitential Psalms have been in a particular 
 manner singled out by the devotions of many. They are reckoned to be

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:1-6,32:1-11,38:1-22,51:1-19,102:1-28,130:1-8,143:1-12">Ps. 
 vi., xxxii., xxxviii., li., cii., cxxx., cxliii.</A>

 The Psalms were divided into five books, each concluding with <I>Amen,
 Amen,</I> or <I>Hallelujah;</I> the first ending with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:1-13">Ps. xli.</A>,

 the second with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:1-20">Ps. lxxii.</A>, 

 the third with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:1-52">Ps. lxxxix.</A>,

 the fourth with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:1-48">Ps. cvi.</A>,

 the fifth with

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+150:1-6">Ps. cl.</A>

 Others divide them into three fifties; others into sixty parts, two for
 every day of the month, one for the morning, the other for the evening. 
 Let good Christians divide them for themselves, so as may best increase 
 their acquaintance with them, that they may have them at hand upon all 
 occasions and may sing them in the spirit and with the 
 understanding.</P>
