 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh
 it down with her hands.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. A good wife is a great blessing to a family. By a fruitful wife a 
 family is multiplied and replenished with children, and so built up. 
 But by a prudent wife, one that is pious, industrious, and considerate, 
 the affairs of the family are made to prosper, debts are paid, portions 
 raised, provision made, the children well educated and maintained, and 
 the family has comfort within doors and credit without; thus is the 
 house built. She looks upon it as her own to take care of, though she 
 knows it is her husband's to bear rule in,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+1:22">Esth. i. 22</A>.

 2. Many a family is brought to ruin by ill housewifery, as well as by
 ill husbandry. A <I>foolish</I> woman, that has no fear of God nor 
 regard to her business, that is wilful, and wasteful, and humoursome, 
 that indulges her ease and appetite, and is all for jaunting and 
 feasting, cards and the play-house, though she come to a plentiful 
 estate, and to a family beforehand, she will impoverish and waste it, 
 and will as certainly be the ruin of her house as if she <I>plucked it 
 down with her hands;</I> and the husband himself, with all his care, 
 can scarcely prevent it.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr14_2"> </A>
 
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>2  He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: but <I>he
 that is</I> perverse in his ways despiseth him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are, 

 1. Grace and sin in their true colours. Grace reigning is a reverence 
 of God, and gives honour to him who is infinitely great and high, and 
 to whom all honour is due, than which what is more becoming or should 
 be more pleasing to the rational creature? Sin reigning is no less than 
 a contempt of God. In <I>this,</I> more than in any thing, sin appears 
 exceedingly sinful, that it despises God, whom angels adore. Those that 
 despise God's precepts, and will not be ruled by them, his promises, 
 and will not accept of them, despise God himself and all his 
 attributes. 

 2. Grace and sin in their true light. By this we may know a man that 
 has grace, and the fear of God, reigning in him, <I>he walks in his 
 uprightness,</I> he makes conscience of his actions, is faithful both 
 to God and man, and every stop he makes, as well as every step he 
 takes, is by rule; here is one that honours God. But, on the contrary, 
 <I>he that is perverse in his ways,</I> that wilfully follows his own 
 appetites and passions, that is unjust and dishonest and contradicts 
 his profession in his conversation, however he may pretend to devotion, 
 he is a wicked man, and will be reckoned with as a despiser of God 
 himself.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr14_3"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  In the mouth of the foolish <I>is</I> a rod of pride: but the lips
 of the wise shall preserve them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. A proud fool exposing himself. Where there is pride in the heart, 
 and no wisdom in the head to suppress it, it commonly shows itself in 
 the words: <I>In the mouth there is pride,</I> proud boasting, proud 
 censuring, proud scorning, proud commanding and giving law; this is the 
 <I>rod,</I> or branch, <I>of pride;</I> the word is used only here and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:1">Isa. xi. 1</A>.

 It grows from that root of bitterness which is in the heart; it is a 
 rod from that stem. The root must be plucked up, or we cannot conquer 
 this branch, or it is meant of a smiting beating rod, a <I>rod of 
 pride</I> which strikes others. The proud man with his tongue lays 
 about him and deals blows at pleasure, but it will in the end be a rod 
 to himself; the proud man shall come under an ignominious correction by 
 the words of his own mouth, not cut as a soldier, but caned as a 
 servant; and herein he will be beaten with his own rod, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:8">Ps. lxiv. 8</A>.

 2. A humble wise man saving himself and consulting his own good: <I>The
 lips of the wise shall preserve them</I> from doing that mischief to 
 others which proud men do with their tongues, and from bringing that 
 mischief on themselves which haughty scorners are often involved 
 in.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Where no oxen <I>are,</I> the crib <I>is</I> clean: but much increase
 <I>is</I> by the strength of the ox.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. The neglect of husbandry is the way to poverty: <I>Where no oxen 
 are,</I> to till the ground and tread out the corn, <I>the crib</I> is 
 empty, <I>is clean;</I> there is no straw for the cattle, and 
 consequently no bread for the service of man. Scarcity is represented
 by <I>cleanness of teeth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+4:6">Amos iv. 6</A>.

 <I>Where no oxen are</I> there is nothing to be done at the ground, and 
 then nothing to be had out of it; <I>the crib</I> indeed <I>is 
 clean</I> from dung, which pleases the neat and nice, that cannot 
 endure husbandry because there is so much dirty work in it, and 
 therefore will sell their oxen to keep the crib clean; but then not 
 only the labour, but even the dung of the ox is wanted. This shows the 
 folly of those who addict themselves to the pleasures of the country, 
 but do not mind the business of it, who (as we say) keep more horses 
 than kine, more dogs than swine; their families must needs suffer by 
 it. 

 2. Those who take pains about their ground are likely to reap the 
 profit of it. Those who keep that about them which is for use and
 service, not for state and show, more husbandmen than footmen, are 
 likely to thrive. <I>Much increase is by the strength of the ox;</I> 
 that is made for our service, and is profitable alive and dead.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will
 utter lies.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the administration of justice much depends upon the witnesses, and 
 therefore it is necessary to the common good that witnesses be 
 principled as they ought to be; for, 

 1. A witness that is conscientious will not dare to give in a testimony 
 that is in the least untrue, nor, for good-will or ill-will, represent 
 a thing otherwise than according to the best of his knowledge, whoever 
 is pleased or displeased, and then judgment runs down like a river. 

 2. But a witness that will be bribed, and biassed, and browbeaten,
 <I>will utter lies</I> (and not stick nor startle at it), with as much 
 readiness and assurance as if what he said were all true.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr14_6"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  A scorner seeketh wisdom, and <I>findeth it</I> not: but knowledge
 <I>is</I> easy unto him that understandeth.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. The reason why some people seek wisdom, and do not find it, is 
 because they do not seek it from a right principle and in a right 
 manner. They are scorners, and it is in scorn that they ask 
 instruction, that they may ridicule what is told them and may cavil at 
 it. Many put questions to Christ, tempting him, and that they might 
 have whereof to accuse him, but they were never the wiser. No marvel if 
 those who seek wisdom, as Simon Magus sought the gifts of the Holy 
 Ghost, to serve their pride and covetousness, do not find it, for they 
 seek amiss. Herod desired to see a miracle, but he was a scorner, and 
 therefore it was denied him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:8">Luke xxiii. 8</A>.
 
 Scorners speed not in prayer. 

 2. To those who understand aright, who <I>depart from evil</I> (for
 <I>that is understanding</I>), the <I>knowledge</I> of God and of his 
 will <I>is easy.</I> The parables which harden scorners in their 
 scorning, and make divine things more difficult to them, enlighten 
 those who are willing to learn, and make the same things more plain, 
 and intelligible, and familiar to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:11,15,16">Matt. xiii. 11, 15, 16</A>.

 The same word which to the scornful <I>is a savour of death unto 
 death</I> to the humble and serious <I>is a savour of life unto 
 life.</I> He <I>that understands,</I> so as to <I>depart from evil</I> 
 (for <I>that is understanding</I>), to quit his prejudices, to lay 
 aside all corrupt dispositions and affections, will easily apprehend 
 instruction and receive the impressions of it.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest
 not <I>in him</I> the lips of knowledge.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. How we may discern a fool and discover him, a wicked man, for he is 
 <I>a foolish man.</I> If we <I>perceive not in him the lips of 
 knowledge,</I> if we find there is no relish or savour of piety in his 
 discourse, that his communication is all corrupt and corrupting, and 
 nothing in it <I>good and to the use of edifying,</I> we may conclude 
 the treasure is bad. 

 2. How we must decline such a one and depart from him: <I>Go from his 
 presence,</I> for <I>thou perceivest</I> there is no good to be gotten 
 by his company, but danger of getting hurt by it. Sometimes the only
 way we have of reproving wicked discourse and witnessing against it is 
 by leaving the company and going out of the hearing of it.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr14_8"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>8  The wisdom of the prudent <I>is</I> to understand his way: but the
 folly of fools <I>is</I> deceit.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. The good conduct of a wise and good man; he manages himself well. It
 is not the wisdom of the learned, which consists only in speculation, 
 that is here recommended, but <I>the wisdom of the prudent,</I> which 
 is practical, and is of use to direct our counsels and actions. 
 Christian prudence consists in a right <I>understanding of our way;</I> 
 for we are travellers, whose concern it is, not to spy wonders, but to 
 get forward towards their journey's end. It <I>is to understand our own 
 way,</I> not to be critics and busybodies in other men's matters, but 
 to look well to ourselves and <I>ponder the path of our feet,</I> to 
 understand the directions of our way, that we may observe them, the 
 dangers of our way, that we may avoid them, the difficulties of our 
 way, that we may break through them, and the advantages of our way, 
 that we may improve them--to understand the rules we are to walk by and 
 the ends we are to walk towards, and walk accordingly. 

 2. The bad conduct of a bad man; he puts a cheat upon himself. He does 
 not rightly understand his way; he thinks he does, and so misses his 
 way, and goes on in his mistake: <I>The folly of fools is deceit;</I> 
 it cheats them into their own ruin. The folly of him that built on the 
 sand was deceit.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr14_9"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous <I>there is</I>
 favour.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. How wicked people are hardened in their wickedness: they <I>make a 
 mock at sin.</I> They make a laughing matter of the sins of others, 
 making themselves and their companions merry with that for which they 
 should mourn, and they make a light matter of their own sins, both when 
 they are tempted to sin and when they have committed it; they <I>call 
 evil good and good evil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:20">Isa. v. 20</A>),

 turn it off with a jest, rush into sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+8:6">Jer. viii. 6</A>)

 and say they shall have peace though they go on. They care not what 
 mischief they do by their sins, and laugh at those that tell them of 
 it. They are advocates for sin, and are ingenious at framing excuses 
 for it. <I>Fools make a mock at the sin-offering</I> (so some); those 
 that make light of sin make light of Christ. Those are fools that make 
 light of sin, for they make light of that which God complains of 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+2:13">Amos ii. 13</A>),

 which lay heavily upon Christ, and which they themselves will have 
 other thoughts of shortly.

 2. How good people are encouraged in their goodness: <I>Among the 
 righteous there is favour;</I> if they in any thing offend, they 
 presently repent and obtain the favour of God. They have a goodwill
 one to another; and among them, in their societies, there is mutual 
 charity and compassion in cases of offences, and no mocking.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr14_10"> </A>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth
 not intermeddle with his joy.

 This agrees with 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+2:11">1 Cor. ii. 11</A>,

 <I>What man knows the things of a man,</I> and the changes of his 
 temper, <I>save the spirit of a man?</I> 

 1. Every man feels most from his own burden, especially that which is
 a burden upon the spirits, for that is commonly concealed and the 
 sufferer keeps it to himself. We must not censure the griefs of others, 
 for we know not what they feel; their stroke perhaps is heavier than 
 their groaning. 

 2. Many enjoy a secret pleasure, especially in divine consolations, 
 which others are not aware of, much less are sharers in; and, as the 
 sorrows of a penitent, so the joys of a believer are such as a 
 <I>stranger does not intermeddle with</I> and therefore is no competent 
 judge of.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the
 tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Sin is the ruin of great families: <I>The house of the wicked,</I> 
 though built ever so strong and high, <I>shall be overthrown,</I> shall 
 be brought to poverty and disgrace, and at length be extinct. His hope 
 for heaven, the house on which he leans, shall not stand, but fail in 
 the storm; the deluge that comes will sweep it away.

 2. Righteousness is the rise and stability even of mean families: Even 
 <I>the tabernacle of the upright,</I> though movable and despicable as 
 a tent, <I>shall flourish,</I> in outward prosperity if Infinite Wisdom 
 see good, at all events in graces and comfort, which are true riches 
 and honours.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr14_12"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end
 thereof <I>are</I> the ways of death.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the way and end of a great many self-deluded 
 souls. 

 1. Their way is seemingly fair: It <I>seems right</I> to themselves; 
 they please themselves with a fancy that they are as they should be, 
 that their opinions and practices are good, and such as will bear them 
 out. The way of ignorance and carelessness, the way of worldliness and 
 earthly-mindedness, the way of sensuality and flesh-pleasing, seem 
 right to those that walk in them, much more the way of hypocrisy in 
 religion, external performances, partial reformations, and blind zeal; 
 this they imagine will bring them to heaven; they flatter themselves in 
 their own eyes that all will be well at last. 

 2. Their end is really fearful, and the more so for their mistake: It 
 is <I>the ways of death,</I> eternal death; their iniquity will 
 certainly be their ruin, and they will perish with a lie in their right 
 hand. Self-deceivers will prove in the end self-destroyers.</P>

 <A NAME="Pr14_13"> </A>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that
 mirth <I>is</I> heaviness.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This shows the vanity of carnal mirth, and proves what Solomon said of 
 laughter, that <I>it is mad;</I> for, 

 1. There is sadness under it. Sometimes when sinners are under
 convictions, or some great trouble, they dissemble their grief by a 
 forced mirth, and put a good face on it, because they will not seem to 
 yield: they cry not when he binds them. Nay, when men really are merry, 
 yet at the same time there is some alloy or other to their mirth, 
 something that casts a damp upon it, which all their gaiety cannot keep 
 from their heart. Their consciences tell them they have no reason to be 
 merry

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+9:1">Hos. ix. 1</A>);

 they cannot but see the vanity of it. Spiritual joy is seated in the 
 soul; the joy of the hypocrite is but from the teeth outward. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:22,2Co+6:10">John xvi. 22; 2 Cor. vi. 10</A>.

 2. There is worse after it: <I>The end of that mirth is heaviness.</I>
 It is soon over, like the crackling of thorns under a pot; and, if the 
 conscience be awake, all sinful and profane mirth will be reflected 
 upon with bitterness; if not, the heaviness will be so much the greater 
 when <I>for all these things God shall bring the</I> sinner <I>into 
 judgment.</I> The sorrows of the saints will end in everlasting joys 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:5">Ps. cxxvi. 5</A>),

 but the laughter of fools will end in endless weeping and wailing.</P>

 and a good man <I>shall be satisfied</I> from himself.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. The misery of sinners will be an eternal surfeit upon their sins: 
 The <I>backslider in heart,</I> who for fear of suffering, or in hope 
 of profit or pleasure, forsakes God and his duty, shall be <I>filled 
 with his own ways;</I> God will give him enough of them. They would not 
 leave their brutish lusts and passions, and therefore they shall stick 
 by them, to their everlasting terror and torment. <I>He that is filthy 
 shall be filthy still. "Son, remember,</I>" shall <I>fill them with 
 their own ways,</I> and set their sins in order before them. 
 Backsliding begins in the heart; it is the evil heart of unbelief that 
 departs from God; and of all sinners backsliders will have most terror 
 when they reflect on <I>their own ways,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+11:26">Luke xi. 26</A>.
 
 2. The happiness of the saints will be an eternal satisfaction in their 
 graces, as tokens of and qualifications for God's peculiar favour: <I>A 
 good man shall be</I> abundantly <I>satisfied from himself,</I> from 
 what God has wrought in him. He has <I>rejoicing in himself alone,</I>

 to heaven.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  The simple believeth every word: but the prudent <I>man</I>
 looketh well to his going.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. It is folly to be credulous, to heed every flying report, to give 
 ear to every man's story, though ever so improbable, to take things 
 upon trust from common fame, to depend upon every man's profession of 
 friendship and give credit to every one that will promise payment; 
 those are <I>simple</I> who thus <I>believe every word,</I> forgetting 
 that all men, in some sense, are liars in comparison with God, all 
 whose words we are to believe with an implicit faith, for he cannot 
 lie. 

 2. It is wisdom to be cautious: <I>The prudent man</I> will try before 
 he trusts, will weigh both the credibility of the witness and the 
 probability of the testimony, and then give judgment as the thing 
 appears or suspend his judgment till it appears. <I>Prove all 
 things,</I> and <I>believe not every spirit.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  A wise <I>man</I> feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool
 rageth, and is confident.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Holy fear is an excellent guard upon every holy thing, and against 
 every thing that is unholy. It is wisdom to depart <I>from evil,</I> 
 from the evil of sin, and thereby from all other evil; and therefore it 
 is wisdom to fear, that is, to be jealous over ourselves with a godly 
 jealousy, to keep up a dread of God's wrath, to be afraid of coming 
 near the borders of sin or dallying with the beginnings of it. A wise 
 man, for fear of harm, keeps out of harm's way, and starts back in a 
 fright when he finds himself entering into temptation. 

 2. Presumption is folly. He who, when he is warned of his danger,
 <I>rages and is confident,</I> furiously pushes on, cannot bear to be 
 checked, bids defiance to the wrath and curse of God, and, fearless of 
 danger, persists in his rebellion, makes bold with the occasions of 
 sin, and plays upon the precipice, he is a fool, for he acts against 
 his reason and his interest, and his ruin will quickly be the proof of 
 his folly.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>17  <I>He that is</I> soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of
 wicked devices is hated.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Passionate men are justly laughed at. Men who are peevish and 
 touchy, and are <I>soon angry</I> upon every the least provocation, 
 <I>deal foolishly;</I> they say and do that which is ridiculous, and so 
 expose themselves to contempt; they themselves cannot but be ashamed of 
 it when the heat is over. The consideration of this should engage those 
 especially who are in reputation for wisdom and honour with the utmost 
 care to bridle their passion. 

 2. Malicious men are justly dreaded and detested, for they are much 
 more dangerous and mischievous to all societies: <I>A man of wicked 
 devices,</I> who stifles his resentments till he has an opportunity of 
 being revenged, and is secretly plotting how to wrong his neighbour and 
 to do him an ill turn, as Cain to kill Abel, such a man as this is 
 hated by all mankind. The character of an angry man is pitiable; 
 through the surprise of a temptation he disturbs and disgraces himself, 
 but it is soon over, and he is sorry for it. But that of a spiteful 
 revengeful man is odious; there is no fence against him nor cure for 
 him.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with
 knowledge.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Sin is the shame of sinners: <I>The simple,</I> who love simplicity, 
 get nothing by it; they <I>inherit folly.</I> They have it <I>by 
 inheritance,</I> so some. This corruption of nature is derived from our 
 first parents, and all the calamities that attend it we have by kind; 
 it was the inheritance they transmitted to their degenerate race, an 
 hereditary disease. They are as fond of it as a man of his inheritance, 
 hold it as fast, and are as loth to part with it. What they value 
 themselves upon is really foolish; and what will be the issue of their 
 simplicity but folly? They will for ever rue their own foolish choice. 

 2. Wisdom is the honour of the wise: <I>The prudent crown</I> 
 themselves <I>with knowledge,</I> they look upon it as their brightest 
 ornament, and there is nothing they are so ambitious of; they bind it 
 to their heads as a crown, which they will by no means part with; they 
 press towards the top and perfection of knowledge, which will crown

 <FONT SIZE=+1>19  The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of
 the righteous.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 That is, 

 1. The wicked are oftentimes impoverished and brought low, so that they 
 are forced to beg, their wickedness having reduced them to straits; 
 while good men, by the blessing of God, are enriched, and enabled to 
 give, and do give, even to the evil; for where God grants life we must 
 not deny a livelihood. 

 2. Sometimes God extorts, even from bad men, an acknowledgement of the 
 excellency of God's people. The evil ought always to <I>bow before the 
 good,</I> and sometimes they are made to do it and <I>to know that God 
 has loved them,</I>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This shows, not what should be, but what is the common way of the 
 world--to be shy of the poor and fond of the rich. 

 1. Few will give countenance to those whom the world frowns upon, 
 though otherwise worthy of respect: <I>The poor,</I> who should be 
 pitied, and encouraged, and relieved, <I>is hated,</I> looked strange 
 upon, and kept at a distance, even <I>by his own neighbour,</I> who, 
 before he fell into disgrace, was intimate with him and pretended to 
 have a kindness for him. Most are swallow-friends, that are gone in 
 winter. It is good having God our friend, for he will not desert us 
 when we are poor. 

 2. Every one will make court to those whom the world smiles upon, 
 though otherwise unworthy: <I>The rich have many friends,</I> friends 
 to their riches, in hope to get something out of them. There is little 
 friendship in the world but what is governed by self-interest, which is 
 no true friendship at all, nor what a wise man will either value 
 himself on or put any confidence in. Those that make the world their 
 God idolize those that have most of its good things, and seek their 
 favour as if indeed they were Heaven's favourites.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here how men's character and condition are measured and judged of 
 by their conduct towards their poor neighbours. 

 1. Those that look upon them with contempt have here assigned them a 
 bad character, and their condition will be accordingly: <I>He that 
 despises his neighbour</I> because he is low in the world, because he 
 is of a mean extraction, rustic education, and makes but a mean figure, 
 that thinks it below him to take notice of him, converse with him, or 
 concern himself about him, and sets him with the dogs of his flock, 
 <I>is a sinner,</I> is guilty of a sin, is in the way to worse, and 
 shall be dealt with as a sinner; unhappy is he. 

 2. Those that look upon them with compassion are here said to be in a 
 good condition, according to their character: <I>He that has mercy on 
 the poor,</I> is ready to do all the good offices he can to him, and 
 thereby puts an honour upon him, <I>happy is he;</I> he does that which 
 is pleasing to God, which he himself will afterwards reflect upon with 
 great satisfaction, for which the loins of the poor will bless him, and 
 which will be abundantly recompensed in the resurrection of the 
 just.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>22  Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth <I>shall
 be</I> to them that devise good.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 See here, 

 1. How miserably mistaken those are that not only do evil, but devise 
 it: <I>Do they not err?</I> Yes, certainly they do; every one knows it. 
 They think that by sinning with craft and contrivance, and carrying on 
 their intrigues with more plot and artifice than others, they shall 
 make a better hand of their sins than others do, and come off better. 
 But they are mistaken. God's justice cannot be out-witted. Those that 
 devise evil against their neighbours greatly err, for it will certainly 
 turn upon themselves and end in their own ruin, a fatal error! 

 2. How wisely those consult their own interest that not only do good 
 but devise it: <I>Mercy and truth</I> shall be to them, not a reward of 
 debt (they will own that they merit nothing), but a reward of mercy, 
 mere mercy, mercy according to the promise, mercy and truth, to which 
 God is pleased to make himself a debtor. Those that are so liberal as 
 to devise liberal things, that seek opportunities of doing good, and 
 contrive how to make their charity most extensive and most acceptable 
 to those that need it, <I>by liberal things they shall stand,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>23  In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips
 <I>tendeth</I> only to penury.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Working, without talking, will make men rich: <I>In all labour</I> 
 of the head, or of the hand, <I>there is profit;</I> it will turn to 
 some good account or other. Industrious people are generally thriving 
 people, and where there is something done there is something to be had. 
 <I>The stirring hand gets a penny.</I> It is good therefore to keep in 
 business, and to keep in action, and what our hand finds to do to do it 
 with all our might. 

 2. Talking, without working, will make men poor. Those that love to
 boast of their business and make a noise about it, and that waste their 
 time in tittle-tattle, in telling and hearing new things, like the 
 Athenians, and, under pretence of improving themselves by conversation, 
 neglect the work of their place and day, they waste what they have, and 
 the course they take <I>tends to penury,</I> and will end in it. It is 
 true in the affairs of our souls; those that take pains in the service 
 of God, that strive earnestly in prayer, will find profit in it. But if 
 men's religion runs all out in talk and noise, and their praying is 
 only the labour of the lips, they will be spiritually poor, and come to 
 nothing.</P>

 foolishness of fools <I>is</I> folly.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. If men be wise and good, riches make them so much the more 
 honourable and useful: <I>The crown of the wise is their riches;</I> 
 their riches make them to be so much the more respected, and give them 
 the more authority and influence upon others. Those that have wealth, 
 and wisdom to use it, will have a great opportunity of honouring God 
 and doing good in the world. <I>Wisdom is good</I> without <I>an 
 inheritance,</I> but better <I>with</I> it. 

 2. If men be wicked and corrupt, their wealth will but the more expose 
 them: <I>The foolishness of fools,</I> put them in what condition you 
 will, <I>is folly,</I> and will show itself and shame them; if they 
 have riches, they do mischief with them and are the more hardened in 
 their foolish practices.</P>

 See here,

 1. How much praise is due to a faithful witness: He <I>delivers the
 souls</I> of the innocent, who are falsely accused, and their good
 names, which are as dear to them as their lives. A man of integrity
 will venture the displeasure of the greatest, to bring truth to light
 and rescue those who are injured by falsehood. A faithful minister, who
 truly witnesses for God against sin, is thereby instrumental to deliver
 souls from eternal death.

 2. How little regard is to be had to a false witness. He forges
 <I>lies,</I> and yet pours them out with the greatest assurance 
 imaginable for the destruction of the innocent. It is therefore the 
 interest of a nation by all means possible to detect and punish
 false-witness-bearing, yea, and lying in common conversation; for truth
 is the cement of society.</P>

 In these two verses we are invited and encouraged to live in the fear
 of God by the advantages which attend a religious life. The <I>fear of
 the Lord</I> is here put for all gracious principles, producing 
 gracious practices. 

 1. Where this reigns it produces a holy security and serenity of mind. 
 There is in it a <I>strong confidence;</I> it enables a man still to 
 hold fast both his purity and his peace, whatever happens, and gives 
 him boldness before God and the world. <I>I know that I shall be 
 justified--None of these things move me;</I> such is the language of 
 this confidence. 

 2. It entails a blessing upon posterity. The children of those that by 
 faith make God their confidence shall be encouraged by the promise that 
 God will be a God to believers and to their seed to flee to him as 
 their refuge, and they shall find shelter in him. The children of 
 religious parents often do the better for their parents' instructions 
 and example and fare the better for their faith and prayers. "<I>Our 
 fathers trusted in thee,</I> therefore we will." 

 3. It is an over-flowing ever-flowing spring of comfort and joy; it is
 <I>a fountain of life,</I> yielding constant pleasure and satisfaction 
 to the soul, joys that are pure and fresh, are life to the soul, and 
 quench its thirst, and can never be drawn dry; it is a <I>well of 
 living water,</I> that is springing up to, and is the earnest of, 
 eternal life. 

 4. It is a sovereign antidote against sin and temptation. Those that
 have a true relish of the pleasures of serious godliness will not be 
 allured by the baits of sin to swallow its hook; they know where to 
 obtain better things than any it can pretend to offer, and therefore it 
 is easy to them <I>to depart from the snares of death</I> and to keep 
 their foot from being taken in them.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>28  In the multitude of people <I>is</I> the king's honour: but in

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here are two maxims in politics, which carry their own evidence with 
 them:-- 

 1. That it is much for the honour of a king to have a populous kingdom; 
 it is a sign that he rules well, since strangers are hereby invited to 
 come and settle under his protection and his own subjects live 
 comfortably; it is a sign that he and his kingdom are under the 
 blessing of God, the effect of which is being fruitful and multiplying.
 It is his strength, and makes him considerable and formidable; happy is 
 the king, the father of his country, who has his <I>quiver full of 
 arrows;</I> he <I>shall not be ashamed, but shall speak with his enemy 
 in the gate,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:4,5">Ps. cxxvii. 4, 5</A>.

 It is therefore the wisdom of princes, by a mild and gentle government, 
 by encouraging trade and husbandry, and by making all easy under them, 
 to promote the increase of their people. And let all that wish well to 
 the kingdom of Christ, and to his honour, do what they can in their 
 places that many may be added to his church. 

 2. That when the people are lessened the prince is weakened: <I>In the 
 want of people is the leanness of the prince</I> (so some read it); 
 trade lies dead, the ground lies untilled, the army wants to be 
 recruited, the navy to be manned, and all because there are not hands 
 sufficient. See how much the honour and safety of kings depend upon
 their people, which is a reason why they should rule by love, and not 
 with rigour. Princes are corrected by those judgments which abate the 
 number of the people, as we find,

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Meekness is wisdom. <I>He</I> rightly understands himself, and his
 duty and interest, the infirmities of human nature, and the 
 constitution of human society, who <I>is slow to anger,</I> and knows 
 how to excuse the faults of others as well as his own, how to adjourn 
 his resentments, and moderate them, so as by no provocation to be put 
 out of the possession of his own soul. A mild patient man is really to 
 be accounted an intelligent man, one that learns of Christ, who is 
 Wisdom itself. 

 2. Unbridled passion is folly proclaimed: <I>He that is hasty of
 spirit,</I> whose heart is tinder to every spark of provocation, that 
 is all fire and tow, as we say, he thinks hereby to magnify himself and 
 make those about stand in awe of him, whereas really he <I>exalts his 
 own folly;</I> he makes it known, as that which is lifted up is visible 
 to all, and he submits himself to it as to the government of one that 
 is exalted.</P>

 The foregoing verse showed how much our reputation, this how much our
 health, depends on the good government of our passions and the 
 preserving of the temper of the mind. 

 1. A healing spirit, made up of love and meekness, a hearty, friendly, 
 cheerful disposition, is <I>the life of the flesh;</I> it contributes 
 to a good constitution of body; people grow fat with good humour. 

 2. A fretful, envious, discontented spirit, is its own punishment; it 
 consumes the flesh, preys upon the animal spirits, makes the 
 countenance pale, and is the <I>rottenness of the bones.</I> Those that 
 see the prosperity of others and are grieved, let them <I>gnash with

 God is here pleased to interest himself more than one would imagine in 
 the treatment given to the poor. 

 1. He reckons himself affronted in the injuries that are done them. 
 Whosoever he be that wrongs a poor man, taking advantage against him 
 because he is poor and cannot help himself, let him know that he puts 
 an affront upon his Maker. God made him, and gave him his being, the 
 same that is the author of our being; we have all one Father, one 
 Maker; see how Job considered this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:15">Job xxxi. 15</A>.

 God made him poor, and appointed him his lot, so that, if we deal 
 hardly with any because they are poor, we reflect upon God as dealing 
 hardly with them in laying them low, that they might be trampled upon. 

 2. He reckons himself honoured in the kindnesses that are done them; he 
 takes them as done to himself, and will show himself accordingly 
 pleased with them. <I>I was hungry, and you gave me meat.</I> Those 
 therefore that have any true honour for God will show it by compassion 
 to the poor, whom he has undertaken in a special manner to protect and 
 patronise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The desperate condition of a wicked man when he goes out of the 
 world: He <I>is driven away in his wickedness.</I> He cleaves so 
 closely to the world that he cannot find in his heart to leave it, but 
 is driven away out of it; his soul is required, is forced from him, And 
 sin cleaves so closely to him that it is inseparable; it goes with him 
 into another world; he <I>is driven away in his wickedness,</I> dies in 
 his sins, under the guilt and power of them, unjustified, unsanctified.
 His wickedness is the storm in which he is hurried away, as chaff 
 before the wind, chased out of the world. 

 2. The comfortable condition of a godly man when he finishes his 
 course: He <I>has hope in his death</I> of a happiness on the other 
 side death, of better things in another world than ever he had in this. 
 <I>The righteous</I> then have the grace of hope in them; though they 
 have pain, and some dread of death, yet they have hope. They have 
 before them the good hoped for, even the blessed hope which God, who 
 cannot lie, has promised.</P>

 but <I>that which is</I> in the midst of fools is made known.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Observe, 

 1. Modesty is the badge of wisdom. He that is truly wise hides his 
 treasure, so as not to boast of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:44">Matt. xiii. 44</A>),

 though he does not hide his talent, so as not to trade with it. His 
 <I>wisdom rests in his heart;</I> he digests what he knows, and has it 
 ready to him, but does not unseasonably talk of it and make a noise 
 with it. The heart is the seat of the affections, and there wisdom must 
 rest in the practical love of it, and not swim in the head. 

 2. Openness and ostentation are a mark of folly. If fools have a little 
 smattering of knowledge, they take all occasions, though very foreign, 
 to produce it, and bring it in by head and shoulders. Or the folly that 
 <I>is in the midst of fools is made known</I> by their forwardness to 
 talk. Many a foolish man takes more pains to show his folly than a wise 
 man thinks it worth his while to take to show his wisdom.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. Justice, reigning in a nation, puts an honour upon it. A righteous 
 administration of the government, impartial equity between man and man, 
 public countenance given to religion, the general practice and 
 profession of virtue, the protecting and preserving of virtuous men, 
 charity and compassion to strangers (<I>alms</I> are sometimes called 
 <I>righteousness</I>), these <I>exalt a nation;</I> they uphold the 
 throne, elevate the people's minds, and qualify a nation for the favour 
 of God, which will make them high, as a <I>holy nation,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+26:19">Deut. xxvi. 19</A>.

 2. Vice, reigning in a nation, puts disgrace upon it: <I>Sin is a
 reproach to any</I> city or kingdom, and renders them despicable among 
 their neighbours. The people of Israel were often instances of both 
 parts of this observation; they were great when they were good, but 
 when they forsook God all about them insulted them and trampled on 
 them. It is therefore the interest and duty of princes to use their 
 power for the suppression of vice and support of virtue.</P>

 This shows that in a well-ordered court and government smiles and 
 favours are dispensed among those that are employed in public trusts 
 according to their merits; Solomon lets them know he will go by that 
 rule, 

 1. That those who behave themselves wisely shall be respected and 
 preferred, whatever enemies they may have that seek to undermine them.
 No man's services shall be neglected to please a party or a favourite.

 2. That those who are selfish and false, who betray their country, 
 oppress the poor, and sow discord, and thus <I>cause shame,</I> shall 
 be displaced and banished the court, whatever friends they may make to 
 speak for them.</P>
