 The history of Job begins here with an account, 

 I. Of his great piety in general 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:1">ver. 1</A>),

 and in a particular instance,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:5">ver. 5</A>.

 II. Of his great prosperity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:2-4">ver. 2-4</A>.

 III. Of the malice of Satan against him, and the permission he obtained
 to try his constancy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:6-12">ver. 6-12</A>.

 IV. Of the surprising troubles that befel him, the ruin of his estate
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:13-17">ver. 13-17</A>),

 and the death of his children,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:18,19">ver. 18, 19</A>.

 V. Of his exemplary patience and piety under these troubles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:20-22">ver. 20-22</A>.
 
 In all this he is set forth for an example of suffering affliction, 
 from which no prosperity can secure us, but through which integrity and 
 uprightness will preserve us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <I>was</I> Job; and
 that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and
 eschewed evil.
 &nbsp; 2  And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
 &nbsp; 3  His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three
 thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred
 she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the
 greatest of all the men of the east.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Concerning Job we are here told,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That he was a man; therefore subject to like passions as we are. He 
 was <I>Ish,</I> a worthy man, a man of note and eminency, a magistrate, 
 a man in authority. The country he lived in was the land of Uz, in the 
 eastern part of Arabia, which lay towards Chaldea, near Euphrates, 
 probably not far from Ur of the Chaldees, whence Abraham was called. 
 When God called one good man out of that country, yet he <I>left not 
 himself without witness,</I> but raised up another in it to be a 
 <I>preacher of righteousness.</I> God has his remnant in all places, 
 sealed ones out of every nation, as well as out of every tribe of 
 Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+7:9">Rev. vii. 9</A>.

 It was the privilege of the land of Uz to have so good a man as Job in
 it; now it was <I>Arabia the Happy</I> indeed: and it was the praise of 
 Job that he was eminently good in so bad a place; the worse others were 
 round about him the better he was. His name <I>Job,</I> or <I>Jjob,</I> 
 some say, signifies <I>one hated</I> and counted as an enemy. Others 
 make it to signify one that grieves or groans; thus the sorrow he 
 carried in his name might be a check to his joy in his prosperity. Dr. 
 Cave derives it from <I>Jaab--to love,</I> or <I>desire,</I> intimating 
 how welcome his birth was to his parents, and how much he was <I>the 
 desire of their eyes;</I> and yet there was a time when he cursed the 
 day of his birth. Who can tell what the day may prove which yet begins 
 with a bright morning?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That he was a very good man, eminently pious, and better than his 
 neighbours: <I>He was perfect and upright.</I> This is intended to show 
 us, not only what reputation he had among men (that he was generally 
 taken for an honest man), but what was really his character; for it is 
 the judgment of God concerning him, and we are sure that is according 
 to truth. 

 1. Job was a religious man, <I>one that feared God,</I> that is, 
 worshipped him according to his will, and governed himself by the rules 
 of the divine law in every thing. 

 2. He was sincere in his religion: He was <I>perfect;</I> not sinless,
 as he himself owns

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:20"><I>ch.</I> ix. 20</A>):

 <I>If I say I am perfect, I shall be proved perverse.</I> But, having a
 respect to all God's commandments, aiming at perfection, he was really 
 as good as he seemed to be, and did not dissemble in his profession of 
 piety; his heart was sound and his eye single. Sincerity is gospel 
 perfection. I know no religion without it. 

 3. He was upright in his dealings both with God and man, was faithful 
 to his promises, steady in his counsels, true to every trust reposed in 
 him, and made conscience of all he said and did. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:15">Isa. xxxiii. 15</A>.

 Though he was not <I>of</I> Israel, he was indeed an <I>Israelite
 without guile.</I>

 4. The fear of God reigning in his heart was the principle that
 governed his whole conversation. This made him perfect and upright, 
 inward and entire for God, universal and uniform in religion; this kept 
 him close and constant to his duty. He <I>feared God,</I> had a 
 reverence for his majesty, a regard to his authority, and a dread of 
 his wrath. 

 5. He dreaded the thought of doing what was wrong; with the utmost
 abhorrence and detestation, and with a constant care and watchfulness, 
 he <I>eschewed evil,</I> avoided all appearances of sin and approaches 
 to it, and this <I>because of the fear of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+5:15">Neh. v. 15</A>.

 <I>The fear of the Lord is to hate evil</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:13">Prov. viii. 13</A>)

 and then <I>by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+16:6">Prov. xvi. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That he was a man who prospered greatly in this world, and made a 
 considerable figure in his country. He was prosperous and yet pious. 
 Though it is hard and rare, it is not impossible, for <I>a rich man to 
 enter into the kingdom of heaven.</I> With God even this is possible, 
 and by his grace the temptations of worldly wealth are not insuperable. 
 He was pious, and his piety was a friend to his prosperity; for 
 godliness has the promise of the life that now is. He was prosperous, 
 and his prosperity put a lustre upon his piety, and gave him who was so 
 good so much greater opportunity of doing good. The acts of his piety 
 were grateful returns to God for the instances of his prosperity; and, 
 in the abundance of the good things God gave him, he served God the 
 more cheerfully. 

 1. He had a numerous family. He was eminent for religion, and yet not a 
 hermit, not a recluse, but the father and master of a family. It was an 
 instance of his prosperity that his house was filled with children, 
 which are a <I>heritage of the Lord,</I> and his <I>reward,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+127:3">Ps. cxxvii. 3</A>.
 
 He had <I>seven sons and three daughters,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Some of each sex, and more of the more noble sex, in which the family
 is built up. Children must be looked upon as blessings, for so they
 are, especially to good people, that will give them good instructions, 
 and set them good examples, and put up good prayers for them. Job had 
 many children, and yet he was neither oppressive nor uncharitable, but 
 very liberal to the poor,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:17-21"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 17</A>,

 &c. Those that have great families to provide for ought to consider
 that what is prudently given in alms is set out to the best interest
 and put into the best fund for their children's benefit.

 2. He had a good estate for the support of his family; his
 <I>substance</I> was considerable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 Riches are called <I>substance,</I> in conformity to the common form of
 speaking; otherwise, to the soul and another world, they are but
 shadows, <I>things that are not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:5">Prov. xxiii. 5</A>.

 It is only in heavenly wisdom that we <I>inherit substance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:21">Prov. viii. 21</A>.

 In those days, when the earth was not fully peopled, it was as now in
 some of the plantations, men might have land enough upon easy terms if 
 they had but wherewithal to stock it; and therefore Job's substance is 
 described, not by the acres of land he was lord of, but,

 (1.) By his cattle--<I>sheep and camels, oxen and asses.</I> The numbers
 of each are here set down, probably not the exact number, but 
 thereabout, a very few under or over. The sheep are put first, because 
 of most use in the family, as Solomon observes 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:23,26,27">Prov. xxvii. 23, 26, 27</A>):

 <I>Lambs for thy clothing, and milk for the food of thy household.</I> 
 Job, it is likely, had silver and gold as well as Abraham 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+13:2">Gen. xiii. 2</A>);

 but then men valued their own and their neighbours' estates by that
 which was for service and present use more than by that which was for 
 show and state, and fit only to be hoarded. As soon as God had made 
 man, and provided for his maintenance by the herbs and fruits, he made 
 him rich and great by giving him <I>dominion over the creatures,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+1:28">Gen. i. 28</A>.

 That therefore being still continued to man, notwithstanding his
 defection

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:2">Gen. ix. 2</A>),

 is still to be reckoned one of the most considerable instances of men's
 wealth, honour, and power, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+8:6">Ps. viii. 6</A>.

 (2.) By his servants. He had a very good household or husbandry, many
 that were employed for him and maintained by him; and thus he both had 
 honour and did good; yet thus he was involved in a great deal of care 
 and put to a great deal of charge. See the vanity of this world; as 
 goods are increased those must be increased that tend them and occupy 
 them, and <I>those will be increased that eat them; and what good has 
 the owner thereof save the beholding of them with his eyes?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+5:11">Eccles. v. 11</A>.

 In a word, <I>Job was the greatest of all the men of the east;</I> and
 they were the richest in the world: those were rich indeed who were 
 <I>replenished more than the east,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+2:6">Isa. ii. 6</A>.

 Margin. Job's wealth, with his wisdom, entitled him to the honour and
 power he had in his country, which he describes

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:1-25"><I>ch.</I> xxix.</A>),

 and made him sit chief. Job was upright and honest, and yet grew rich,
 nay, <I>therefore</I> grew rich; for honesty is the best policy, and 
 piety and charity are ordinarily the surest ways of thriving. He had a 
 great household and much business, and yet kept up the fear and worship 
 of God; and he and his house served the Lord. The account of Job's 
 piety and prosperity comes before the history of his great afflictions, 
 to show that neither will secure us from the common, no, nor from the 
 uncommon calamities of human life. Piety will not secure us, as Job's 
 mistaken friends thought, for <I>all things come alike to all;</I> 
 prosperity will not, as a careless world thinks, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+47:8">Isa. xlvii. 8</A>.

 I sit <I>as a queen</I> and therefore shall <I>see no sorrow.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  And his sons went and feasted <I>in their</I> houses, every one
 his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and
 to drink with them.
 &nbsp; 5  And it was so, when the days of <I>their</I> feasting were gone
 about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in
 the morning, and offered burnt offerings <I>according</I> to the
 number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have
 sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a further account of Job's prosperity and his piety.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His great comfort in his children is taken notice of as an instance 
 of his prosperity; for our temporal comforts are borrowed, depend upon 
 others, and are as those about us are. Job himself mentions it as one 
 of the greatest joys of his prosperous estate that his <I>children were 
 about him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:5"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 5</A>.

 They kept a circular feast at some certain times 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 they <I>went and feasted in their houses.</I> It was a comfort to this
 good man,

 1. To see his children grown up and settled in the world. All his
 sons were in houses of their own, probably married, and to each of them
 he had given a competent portion to set up with. Those that had been
 olive-plants round his table were removed to tables of their own. 

 2. To see them thrive in their affairs, and able to feast one another,
 as well as to feed themselves. Good parents desire, promote, and 
 rejoice in, their children's wealth and prosperity as their own.

 3. To see them in health, no sickness in their houses, for that would
 have spoiled their feasting and turned it into mourning.

 4. Especially to see them live in love, and unity, and mutual good
 affection, no jars or quarrels among them, no strangeness, no shyness 
 one of another, no strait-handedness, but, though every one knew his 
 own, they lived with as much freedom as if they had had all in common.
 It is comfortable to the hearts of parents, and comely in the eyes of 
 all, to see brethren thus knit together. <I>Behold, how good and how 
 pleasant it is!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+133:1">Ps. cxxxiii. 1</A>.

 5. It added to his comfort to see the brothers so kind to their
 sisters, that they sent for them to feast with them; for they were so 
 modest that they would not have gone if they had not been sent for.
 Those brothers that slight their sisters, care not for their company, 
 and have no concern for their comfort, are ill-bred, ill-natured, and 
 very unlike Job's sons. It seems their feast was so sober and decent 
 that their sisters were good company for them at it. 

 6. They feasted in their own houses, not in public houses, where they
 would be more exposed to temptations, and which were not so creditable. 
 We do not find that Job himself feasted with them. Doubtless they
 invited him, and he would have been the most welcome guest at any of 
 their tables; nor was it from any sourness or moroseness of temper, or 
 for want of natural affection, that he kept away, but he was old and 
 dead to these things, like Barzillai

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+19:35">2 Sam. xix. 35</A>),

 and considered that the young people would be more free and pleasant if
 there were none but themselves. Yet he would not restrain his children 
 from that diversion which he denied himself. Young people may be 
 allowed a youthful liberty, provided they flee youthful lusts.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His great care about his children is taken notice of as an instance 
 of his piety: for that we are really which we are relatively. Those 
 that are good will be good to their children, and especially do what 
 they can for the good of their souls. Observe
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 Job's pious concern for the spiritual welfare of his children,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He was jealous over them with a godly jealousy; and so we ought to 
 be over ourselves and those that are dearest to us, as far as is 
 necessary to our care and endeavour for their good. Job had given his 
 children a good education, had comfort in them and good hope concerning 
 them; and yet he said, "<I>It may be, my sons have sinned</I> in the 
 days of their feasting more than at other times, have been too merry, 
 have taken too great a liberty in eating and drinking, and have 
 <I>cursed God in their hearts,</I>" that is, "have entertained 
 atheistical or profane thoughts in their minds, unworthy notions of God 
 and his providence, and the exercises of religion." When they were 
 <I>full</I> they were ready to <I>deny God, and to say, Who is the 
 Lord?</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:9">Prov. xxx. 9</A>),

 ready to <I>forget</I> God and to say, The <I>power of our hand</I> has
 <I>gotten us this wealth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:12-17">Deut. viii. 12</A>,

 &c. Nothing alienates the mind more from God than the indulgence of the 
 flesh.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As soon as the days of their feasting were over he called them to 
 the solemn exercises of religion. Not while their feasting lasted (let 
 them take their time for that; there is a time for all things), but 
 when it was over, their good father reminded them that they must know 
 when to desist, and not think to fare sumptuously every day; though 
 they had their days of feasting the <I>week</I> round, they must not 
 think to have them the <I>year</I> round; they had something else to 
 do. Note, Those that are merry must find a time to be serious.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He sent to them to prepare for solemn ordinances, <I>sent and 
 sanctified them,</I> ordered them to examine their own consciences and 
 repent of what they had done amiss in their feasting, to lay aside 
 their vanity and compose themselves for religious exercises. Thus he 
 kept his authority over them for their good, and they submitted to it, 
 though they had got into houses of their own. Still he was the priest 
 of the family, and at his altar they all attended, valuing their share 
 in his prayers more than their share in his estate. Parents cannot give 
 grace to their children (it is God that sanctifies), but they ought by 
 seasonable admonitions and counsels to further their sanctification. In 
 their baptism they were sanctified to God; let it be our desire and 
 endeavour that they may be sanctified for him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. He offered sacrifice for them, both to atone for the sins he feared 
 they had been guilty of in the days of their feasting and to implore 
 for them mercy to pardon and grace to prevent the debauching of their 
 minds and corrupting of their manners by the liberty they had taken, 
 and to preserve their piety and purity.</P>

 </TD></TR>
 </TABLE>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job, like Abraham, had an altar for his family, on which, it is likely, 
 he offered sacrifice daily; but, on this extraordinary occasion, he 
 offered more sacrifices than usual, and with more solemnity, 
 <I>according to the number of them all,</I> one for each child. Parents 
 should be particular in their addresses to God for the several branches 
 of their family. "For this child I prayed, according to its particular 
 temper, genius, and condition," to which the prayers, as well as the 
 endeavours, must be accommodated. When these sacrifices were to be 
 offered, 

 (1.) He rose early, as one in care that his children might not lie long 
 under guilt and as one whose heart was upon his work and his desire 
 towards it. 

 (2.) He required his children to attend the sacrifice, that they might 
 join with him in the prayers he offered with the sacrifice, that the 
 sight of the killing of the sacrifice might humble them much for their 
 sins, for which they deserved to die, and the sight of the offering of 
 it up might lead them to a Mediator. This serious work would help to 
 make them serious again after the days of their gaiety.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Thus he did <I>continually,</I> and not merely whenever an occasion 
 of this kind recurred; for <I>he that is washed needs to wash his 
 feet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+13:10">John xiii. 10</A>.

 The acts of repentance and faith must be often renewed, because we
 often repeat our transgressions. All days, every day, he offered up his 
 sacrifices, was constant to his devotions, and did not omit them any 
 day. The occasional exercises of religion will not excuse us from those 
 that are stated. He that serves God uprightly will serve him 
 continually.</P>

 nought?

 Job was not only so rich and great, but withal so wise and good, and 
 had such an interest both in heaven and earth, that one would think the 
 mountain of his prosperity stood so strong that it could not be moved; 
 but here we have a thick cloud gathering over his head, pregnant with a 
 horrible tempest. We must never think ourselves secure from storms 
 while we are in this lower region. Before we are told how his troubles 
 surprised and seized him here in this visible world, we are here told 
 how they were concerted in the world of spirits, that the devil, having
 a great enmity to Job for his eminent piety, begged and obtained leave
 to torment him. It does not at all derogate from the credibility of
 Job's story in general to allow that this discourse between God and
 Satan, in these verses, is parabolical, like that of Micaiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+22:19-29">1 Kings xxii. 19</A>,

 &c.), and an allegory designed to represent the malice of the
 devil against good men and the divine check and restraint which that 
 malice is under; only thus much further is intimated, that the affairs 
 of this earth are very much the subject of the counsels of the unseen 
 world. That world is dark to us, but we lie very open to it. Now here 
 we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Satan among the sons of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 an <I>adversary</I> (so <I>Satan</I> signifies) to God, to men, to all
 good: he thrust himself into an assembly of the <I>sons of God</I> that 
 came to <I>present themselves before the Lord.</I> This means either,

 1. A meeting of the saints on earth. Professors of religion, in the 
 patriarchal age, were called <I>sons of God</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+6:2">Gen. vi. 2</A>);

 they had then religious assemblies and stated times for them. The King
 came in to see his guests; the eye of God was on all present. But there 
 was a serpent in paradise, a Satan among the sons of God; when they 
 come together he is among them, to distract and disturb them, stands at 
 their right hand to resist them. <I>The Lord rebuke thee, Satan!</I> 
 Or, 

 2. A meeting of the angels in heaven. They are <I>the sons of God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:7"><I>ch.</I> xxxviii. 7</A>.

 They came to give an account of their negotiations on earth and to
 receive new instructions. Satan was one of them originally; but <I>how 
 hast thou fallen, O Lucifer!</I> He shall no more stand in that 
 congregation, yet he is here represented, as coming among them, either 
 summoned to appear as a criminal or connived at, for the present, 
 though an intruder.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His examination, how he came thither 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>The Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou?</I> He knew very well
 whence he came, and with what design he came thither, that as the good 
 angels came to do good he came for a permission to do hurt; but he 
 would, by calling him to an account, show him that he was under check 
 and control. <I>Whence comest thou?</I> He asks this,

 1. As wondering what brought him thither. <I>Is Saul among the 
 prophets?</I> Satan among the sons of God? Yes, for he <I>transforms 
 himself into an angel of light</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:13,14">2 Cor. xi. 13, 14</A>),

 and would seem one of them. Note, It is possible that a man may be a
 child of the devil and yet be found in the assemblies of the sons of 
 God in this world, and <I>there</I> may pass undiscovered by men, and 
 yet be challenged by the all-seeing God. <I>Friend, how camest thou in 
 hither?</I> Or, 

 2. As enquiring what he had been doing before he came thither. The same
 question was perhaps put to the rest of those that presented themselves 
 before the Lord, "Whence came you?" We are accountable to God for all 
 our haunts and all the ways we traverse.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The account he gives of himself and of the tour he had made. I 
 come (says he) <I>from going to and fro on the earth.</I> 

 1. He could not pretend he had been doing any good, could give no such 
 account of himself as the sons of God could, who <I>presented 
 themselves before the Lord,</I> who came from executing his orders, 
 serving the interest of his kingdom, and ministering to the heirs of 
 salvation. 

 2. He would not own he had been doing any hurt, that he had been
 drawing men from the allegiance to God, deceiving and destroying souls; 
 no. <I>I have done no wickedness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:20">Prov. xxx. 20</A>.

 <I>Thy servant went nowhere.</I> In saying that he had <I>walked to and
 fro through the earth,</I> he intimates that he had kept himself within 
 the bounds allotted him, and had not transgressed his bounds; for 
 <I>the dragon is cast out into the earth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:9">Rev. xii. 9</A>)

 and not yet confined to his place of torment. While we are on this
 earth we are within his reach, and with so much subtlety, swiftness, 
 and industry, does he penetrate into all the corners of it, that we 
 cannot be in any place secure from his temptations.

 3. He yet seems to give some representation of his own character.

 (1.) Perhaps it is spoken proudly, and with an air of haughtiness, as 
 if he were indeed the <I>prince of this world,</I> as if <I>the 
 kingdoms of the world and the glory of them</I> were his

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:6">Luke iv. 6</A>),

 and he had now been walking in circuit through his own territories.

 (2.) Perhaps it is spoken fretfully, and with discontent. He had been
 walking to and fro, and could find no rest, but was as much a fugitive 
 and a vagabond as Cain in the land of Nod. 

 (3.) Perhaps it is spoken carefully: "I have been hard at work, going 
 to and fro," or (as some read it) "searching about in the earth," 
 really in quest of an opportunity to do mischief. He walks about seeking
 whom he may devour. It concerns us therefore to be sober and
 vigilant.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The question God puts to him concerning Job 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Hast thou considered my servant Job?</I> As when we meet with one
 that has been in a distant place, where we have a friend we dearly 
 love, we are ready to ask, "You have been in such a place; pray did you 
 see my friend there?" Observe,

 1. How honourably God speaks of Job: He is <I>my servant.</I> Good men 
 are God's servants, and he is pleased to reckon himself honoured in 
 their services, and they are to him for <I>a name and a praise</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:11">Jer. xiii. 11</A>)

 <I>and a crown of glory,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+62:3">Isa. lxii. 3</A>.

 "Yonder is <I>my servant Job;</I> there is <I>none like him,</I> none I
 value like him, of all the princes and potentates of the earth; one 
 such saint as he is worth them all: <I>none like him</I> for 
 uprightness and serious piety; many do well, but <I>he excelleth them 
 all;</I> there is not to be found <I>such great faith, no, not in 
 Israel.</I>" Thus Christ, long after, commended the centurion and the 
 woman of Canaan, who were both of them, like Job, strangers to that 
 commonwealth. The saints glory in God--<I>Who is like thee among the 
 gods?</I> and he is pleased to glory in them--<I>Who is like Israel 
 among the people?</I> So here, <I>none like Job,</I> none in earth, 
 that state of imperfection. Those in heaven do indeed far outshine him; 
 those who are least in that kingdom are greater than he; but <I>on 
 earth there is not his like.</I> There is none like him in that land; 
 so some good men are the glory of their country.

 2. How closely he gives to Satan this good character of Job: <I>Hast
 thou set thy heart to my servant Job?</I> designing hereby,

 (1.) To aggravate the apostasy and misery of that wicked spirit: "How 
 unlike him are thou!" Note, The holiness and happiness of the saints 
 are the shame and torment of the devil and the devil's children. 

 (2.) To answer the devil's seeming boast of the interest he had in this 
 earth. "I have been walking to and fro in it," says he, "and it is all 
 my own; all flesh have corrupted their way; they all sit still, and are 
 at rest in their sins,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+1:10,11">Zech. i. 10, 11</A>.

 "Nay, hold," saith God, "Job is my faithful servant." Satan may boast,
 but he shall not triumph. 

 (3.) To anticipate his accusations, as if he had said, "Satan, I know 
 thy errand; thou hast come to inform against Job; but <I>hast thou
 considered him?</I> Does not his unquestionable character give thee the 
 lie?" Note, God knows all the malice of the devil and his instruments 
 against his servants; and we have an advocate ready to appear for us, 
 even before we are accused.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. The devil's base insinuation against Job, in answer to God's 
 encomium of him. He could not deny but that Job feared God, but 
 suggested that he was a mercenary in his religion, and therefore a 
 hypocrite 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):
 
 <I>Doth Job fear God for nought?</I> Observe,

 1. How impatient the devil was of hearing Job praised, though it was 
 God himself that praised him. Those are like the devil who cannot 
 endure that any body should be praised but themselves, but grudge the 
 just share of reputation others have, as Saul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:5-16">1 Sam. xviii. 5</A>,

 &c.) and the Pharisees, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+21:15">Matt. xxi. 15</A>.

 2. How much at a loss he was for something to object against him; he
 could not accuse him of any thing that was bad, and therefore charged 
 him with by-ends in doing good. Had the one half of that been true 
 which his angry friends, in the heat of dispute, charged him with

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:4,22:5"><I>ch.</I> xv. 4, xxii. 5</A>),

 Satan would no doubt have brought against him now; but no such thing
 could be alleged, and therefore, 

 3. See how slyly he censured him as a hypocrite, not asserting that he
 was so, but only asking, "Is he not so?" This is the common way of 
 slanderers, whisperers, backbiters, to suggest that by way of query 
 which yet they have no reason to think is true. Note, It is not strange 
 if those that are approved and accepted of God be unjustly censured by 
 the devil and his instruments; if they are otherwise unexceptionable, 
 it is easy to charge them with hypocrisy, as Satan charged Job, and 
 they have no way to clear themselves, but patiently to wait for the 
 judgment of God. As there is nothing we should dread more than being 
 hypocrites, so there is nothing we need dread less that being called 
 and counted so without cause. 

 4. How unjustly he accused him as mercenary, to prove him a hypocrite.
 It was a great truth that Job did not fear God for nought; he got much 
 by it, for godliness is great gain: but it was a falsehood that he 
 would not have feared God if he had not got this by it, as the event 
 proved. Job's friends charged him with hypocrisy because he was
 greatly afflicted, Satan because he greatly prospered. It is no hard 
 matter for those to calumniate that seek an occasion. It is not 
 mercenary to look at the eternal recompence in our obedience; but to 
 aim at temporal advantages in our religion, and to make it subservient 
 to them, is spiritual idolatry, worshipping the creature more than the 
 Creator, and is likely to end in a fatal apostasy. Men cannot long 
 <I>serve God and mammon.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. The complaint Satan made of Job's prosperity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Observe,

 1. What God had done for Job. He had protected him, made a hedge about
 him, for the defence of his person, his family, and all his 
 possessions. Note, God's peculiar people are taken under his special 
 protection, they and all that belong to them; divine grace makes a 
 hedge about their spiritual life, and divine providence about their 
 natural life, so they are safe and easy. He had prospered him, not in 
 idleness or injustice (the devil could not accuse him of them), but in 
 the way of honest diligence: <I>Thou hast blessed the work of his 
 hands.</I> Without that blessing, be the hands ever so strong, ever so 
 skilful, the work will not prosper; but, with that, <I>his substance 
 has wonderfully increased in the land.</I> The blessing of the Lord 
 makes rich: Satan himself owns it. 

 2. What notice the devil took of it, and how he improved it against
 him. The devil speaks of it with vexation. "I see thou hast <I>made a 
 hedge about him, round about;</I>" as if he had walked it round, to see 
 if he could spy a single gap in it, for him to enter in at, to do him a 
 mischief; but he was disappointed: it was a complete hedge. <I>The 
 wicked</I> one <I>saw it and was grieved,</I> and argued against Job 
 that the only reason why he served God was because God prospered him. 
 "No thanks to him to be true to the government that prefers him, and to 
 serve a Master that pays him so well."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VII. The proof Satan undertakes to give of the hypocrisy and 
 mercenariness of Job's religion, if he might but have leave to strip 
 him of his wealth. "Let it be put to this issue," says he 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>);
 
 "make him poor, frown upon him, turn thy hand against him, and then see
 where his religion will be; touch what he has and it will appear what 
 he is. <I>If he curse thee not to thy face,</I> let me never be 
 believed, but posted for a liar and false accuser. Let me perish if he 
 curse thee not;" so some supply the imprecation, which the devil 
 himself modestly concealed, but the profane swearers of our age 
 impudently and daringly speak out. Observe, 

 1. How slightly he speaks of the affliction he desired that Job might 
 be tried with: "Do but touch all that he has, do but begin with him, do 
 but threaten to make him poor; a little cross will change his tone." 

 2. How spitefully he speaks of the impression it would make upon Job:
 "He will not only let fall his devotion, but turn it into an open 
 defiance--not only think hardly of thee, but <I>even curse thee to thy 
 face.</I>" The word translated curse is <I>barac,</I> the same that 
 ordinarily, and originally, signifies to <I>bless;</I> but cursing God 
 is so impious a thing that the holy language would not admit the name: 
 but that where the sense requires it it must be so understood is plain 
 from

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+21:10-13">1 Kings xxi. 10-13</A>,

 where the word is used concerning the crime charged on Naboth, that he
 did blaspheme God and the king. Now, 

 (1.) It is likely that Satan did think that Job, if impoverished, would 
 renounce his religion and so disprove his profession, and if so (as a 
 learned gentleman has observed in his <I>Mount of Spirits</I>) Satan 
 would have made out his own universal empire among the children of men. 
 God declared Job the best man then living: now, if Satan can prove him 
 a hypocrite, it will follow that God had not one faithful servant among 
 men and that there was no such thing as true and sincere piety in the 
 world, but religion was all a sham, and Satan was king <I>de facto--in 
 fact,</I> over all mankind. But it appeared that <I>the Lord knows 
 those that are his</I> and is not deceived in any. 

 (2.) However, if Job should retain his religion, Satan would have the 
 satisfaction to see him sorely afflicted. He hates good men, and 
 delights in their griefs, as God has <I>pleasure in their 
 prosperity.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VIII. The permission God gave to Satan to afflict Job for the trial of 
 his sincerity. Satan desired God to do it: <I>Put forth thy hand 
 now.</I> God allowed him to do it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>All that he has is in thy hand;</I> make the trial as sharp as thou
 canst; do thy worst at him." Now,

 1. It is a matter of wonder that God should give Satan such a 
 permission as this, should <I>deliver the soul of his turtle-dove</I> 
 into the hand of the adversary, such a lamb to such a lion; but he did 
 it for his own glory, the honour of Job, the explanation of Providence, 
 and the encouragement of his afflicted people in all ages, to make a 
 case which, being adjudged, might be a useful precedent. He suffered 
 Job to be tried, as he suffered Peter to be sifted, but took care that 
 <I>his faith should not fail</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+22:32">Luke xxii. 32</A>)

 and then the trial of it was <I>found unto praise, and honour, and
 glory,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:7">1 Pet. i. 7</A>.

 But,

 2. It is a matter of comfort that God has the devil <I>in a chain,</I>
 in a great chain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+20:1">Rev. xx. 1</A>.

 He could not afflict Job without leave from God first asked and
 obtained, and then no further than he had leave: "<I>Only upon himself 
 put not forth thy hand;</I> meddle not with his body, but only with his 
 estate." It is a limited power that the devil has; he has no power to 
 debauch men but what they give him themselves, nor power to afflict men 
 but what is <I>given him from above.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IX. Satan's departure from this meeting of the sons of God. Before they 
 broke up, Satan went forth (as Cain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+4:16">Gen. iv. 16</A>)

 <I>from the presence of the Lord;</I> no longer detained before him (as
 Doeg was,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+21:7">1 Sam. xxi. 7</A>)

 than till he had accomplished his malicious purpose. He went forth, 

 1. Glad that he had gained his point, proud of the permission he had
 to do mischief to a good man; and, 

 2. Resolved to lose no time, but speedily to put his project in
 execution. He went forth now, not to go to and fro, rambling through 
 the earth, but with a direct course, to fall upon poor Job, who is 
 carefully going on in the way of his duty, and knows nothing of the 
 matter. What passes between good and bad spirits concerning us we are 
 not aware of.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  And there was a day when his sons and his daughters <I>were</I>
 eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
 &nbsp; 14  And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were
 plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:

 they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I
 only am escaped alone to tell thee.

 said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up
 the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am
 escaped alone to tell thee.
 &nbsp; 17  While he <I>was</I> yet speaking, there came also another, and
 said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the
 camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants

 thee.

 said, Thy sons and thy daughters <I>were</I> eating and drinking wine
 in their eldest brother's house:

 and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the
 young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell
 thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a particular account of Job's troubles.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Satan brought them upon him on the very day that his children began 
 their course of feasting, at their <I>eldest brother's house</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 where, he having (we may suppose) the double portion, the entertainment
 was the richest and most plentiful. The whole family, no doubt, was in
 perfect repose, and all were easy and under no apprehension of the 
 trouble, now when they revived this custom; and this time Satan chose, 
 that the trouble, coming now, might be the more grievous. <I>The night 
 of my pleasure has he turned into fear,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+21:4">Isa. xxi. 4</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They all come upon him at once; while one messenger of evil tidings 
 was speaking another came, and, before he had told his story, a third, 
 and a fourth, followed immediately. Thus Satan, by the divine 
 permission, ordered it, 

 1. That there might appear a more than ordinary displeasure of God 
 against him in his troubles, and by that he might be exasperated 
 against divine Providence, as if it were resolved, right or wrong, to 
 ruin him, and not give him time to speak for himself. 

 2. That he might not have leisure to consider and recollect himself,
 and reason himself into a gracious submission, but might be overwhelmed 
 and overpowered by a complication of calamities. If he have not room to 
 pause a little, he will be apt to speak in haste, and then, if ever, he 
 will curse his God. Note, The children of God are often in heaviness 
 through manifold temptations; deep calls to deep; waves and billows 
 come one upon the neck of another. Let one affliction therefore quicken 
 and help us to prepare for another; for, how deep soever we have drunk 
 of the bitter cup, as long as we are in this world we cannot be sure 
 that we have drunk our share and that it will finally pass from us.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They took from him all that he had, and made a full end of his 
 enjoyments. The detail of his losses answers to the foregoing inventory 
 of his possessions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He had 500 <I>yoke of oxen,</I> and 500 <I>she-asses,</I> and a 
 competent number of servants to attend them; and all these he lost at 
 once, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:14,15"><I>v.</I> 14, 15</A>.
 
 The account he has of this lets him know,

 (1.) That it was not through any carelessness of his servants; for then 
 his resentment might have spent itself upon them: <I>The oxen were 
 ploughing,</I> not playing, and the asses not suffered to stray and so 
 taken up as waifs, but <I>feeding beside them,</I> under the servant's 
 eye, each in their place; and those that passed by, we may suppose, 
 blessed them, and said, <I>God speed the plough.</I> Note, All our 
 prudence, care, and diligence, cannot secure us from affliction, no, 
 not from those afflictions which are commonly owing to imprudence and 
 negligence. <I>Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman,</I> though
 ever so wakeful, <I>wakes but in vain.</I> Yet it is some comfort under 
 a trouble if it found us in the way of our duty, and not in any 
 by-path. 

 (2.) That is was through the wickedness of his neighbours the Sabeans, 
 probably a sort of robbers that lived by spoil and plunder. They
 carried off the oxen and asses, and slew the servants that faithfully 
 and bravely did their best to defend them, and <I>one only escaped,</I> 
 not in kindness to him or his master, but that Job might have the 
 certain intelligence of it by an eye-witness before he heard it by a 
 flying report, which would have brought it upon him gradually. We have
 no reason to suspect that either Job or his servants had given any 
 provocation to the Sabeans to make this inroad, but Satan put it into 
 their hearts to do it, to do it now, and so gained a double point, for 
 he made both Job to suffer and them to sin. Note, When Satan has God's 
 permission to do mischief he will not want mischievous men to be his 
 instruments in doing it, for he is a <I>spirit that works in the 
 children of disobedience.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He had 7000 <I>sheep,</I> and shepherds that kept them; and all 
 those he lost at the same time by lightning, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 Job was perhaps, in his own mind, ready to reproach the Sabeans, and
 fly out against them for their injustice and cruelty, when the next 
 news immediately directs him to look upwards: <I>The fire of God has 
 fallen from heaven.</I> As thunder is his voice, so lightning is his 
 fire: but this was such an extraordinary lightning, and levelled so 
 directly against Job, that all his sheep and shepherds were not only 
 killed, but consumed by it at once, and one shepherd only was left 
 alive to carry the news to poor Job. The devil, aiming to make him 
 curse God and renounce his religion, managed this part of the trial 
 very artfully, in order thereto.

 (1.) His sheep, with which especially he used to honour God in 
 sacrifice, were all taken from him, as if God were angry at his 
 offerings and would punish him in those very things which he had 
 employed in his service. Having misrepresented Job to God as a false 
 servant, in pursuance of his old design to set Heaven and earth at 
 variance, he here misrepresented God to Jacob as a hard Master, who 
 would not protect those flocks out of which he had so many 
 burnt-offerings. This would tempt Job to say, <I>It is in vain to serve 
 God.</I> 

 (2.) The messenger called the lightning the <I>fire of God</I> (and 
 innocently enough), but perhaps Satan thereby designed to strike into 
 his mind this thought, that God had <I>turned to be his enemy and 
 fought against him,</I> which was much more grievous to him than all 
 the insults of the Sabeans. He owned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:23"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 23</A>)

 that <I>destruction from God was a terror to him.</I> How terrible then
 were the tidings of this destruction, which came immediately from the 
 hand of God! Had the fire from heaven consumed the sheep upon the
 altar, he might have construed it into a token of God's favour; but, 
 the fire consuming them in the pasture, he could not but look upon it 
 as a token of God's displeasure. There have not been the like since
 Sodom was burned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He had 3000 <I>camels,</I> and servants tending them; and he lost 
 them all at the same time by the Chaldeans, who came in three bands, 
 and drove them away, and slew the servants, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 If the fire of God, which fell upon Job's honest servants, who were in
 the way of their duty, had fallen upon the Sabean and Chaldean robbers 
 who were doing mischief, God's judgments therein would have been like 
 the great mountains, evident and conspicuous; but when the way of the 
 wicked prospers, and they carry off their booty, while just and good 
 men are suddenly cut off, God's righteousness is like the great deep, 
 the bottom of which we cannot find,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+36:6">Ps. xxxvi. 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. His dearest and most valuable possessions were his ten children; 
 and, to conclude the tragedy, news if brought him, at the same time, 
 that they were killed and buried in the ruins of the house in which 
 they were feasting, and all the servants that waited on them, except 
 one that came express with the tidings of it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:18,19"><I>v.</I> 18, 19</A>.

 This was the greatest of Job's losses, and which could not but go
 nearest him; and therefore the devil reserved it for the last, that, if 
 the other provocations failed, this might make him curse God. Our 
 children are pieces of ourselves; it is very hard to part with them, 
 and touches a good man in as tender a part as any. But to part with 
 them all at once, and for them to be all cut off in a moment, who had 
 been so many years his cares and hopes, went to the quick indeed.

 (1.) They all died together, and not one of them was left alive. David, 
 though a wise and good man, was very much discomposed by the death of 
 one son. How hard then did it bear upon poor Job who lost them all, 
 and, in one moment, was written childless! 

 (2.) They died suddenly. Had they been taken away by some lingering 
 disease, he would have had notice to expect their death, and prepare 
 for the breach; but this came upon him without giving him any warning.
 
 (3.) They died when they were feasting and making merry. Had they died
 suddenly when they were praying, he might the better have borne it. He 
 would have hoped that death had found them in a good frame if their 
 blood had been mingled with their feast, where he himself used to be 
 jealous of them that they had <I>sinned, and cursed God in their 
 hearts</I>--to have that day come upon them unawares, like a thief in 
 the night, when perhaps their heads were overcharged with surfeiting 
 and drunkenness--this could not but add much to his grief, considering 
 what a tender concern he always had for his children's souls, and that 
 they were now out of the reach of the sacrifices he used to offer 
 <I>according to the number of them all.</I> See how all things come 
 alike to all. Job's children were constantly prayed for by their 
 father, and lived in love one with another, and yet came to this 
 untimely end. 

 (4.) They died by a wind of the devil's raising, who is <I>the prince 
 of the power of the air</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+2:2">Eph. ii. 2</A>),

 but it was looked upon to be an immediate hand of God, and a token of
 his wrath. So Bildad construed it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:4"><I>ch.</I> viii. 4</A>):

 <I>Thy children have sinned against him, and he has cast them away in
 their transgression.</I> 

 (5.) They were taken away when he had most need of them to comfort him 
 under all his other losses. Such miserable comforters are all 
 creatures. In God only we have a present help at all times.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>20  Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head,

 &nbsp; 21  And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The devil had done all he desired leave to do against Job, to provoke 
 him to curse God. He had touched all he had, touched it with a witness; 
 he whom the rising sun saw the richest of all the men in the east was 
 before night poor to a proverb. If his riches had been, as Satan 
 insinuated, the only principle of his religion now that he had lost his 
 riches he would certainly have lost his religion; but the account we 
 have, in these verses, of his pious deportment under his affliction,
 sufficiently proved the devil a liar and Job an honest man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He conducted himself like a man under his afflictions, not stupid 
 and senseless, like a stock or stone, not unnatural and unaffected at 
 the death of his children and servants; no 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>),

 he <I>arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head,</I> which were
 the usual expressions of great sorrow, to show that he was sensible of 
 the hand of the Lord that had gone out against him; yet he did not 
 break out into any indecencies, nor discover any extravagant passion. 
 He did not faint away, but arose, as a champion to the combat; he did 
 not, in a heat, throw off his clothes, but very gravely, in conformity 
 to the custom of the country, rent his mantle, his cloak, or outer 
 garment; he did not passionately tear his hair, but deliberately shaved 
 his head. By all this it appeared that he kept his temper, and bravely
 maintained the possession and repose of his own soul, in the midst of 
 all these provocations. The time when he began to show his feelings is 
 observable; it was not till he heard of the death of his children, and 
 then he arose, then he rent his mantle. A worldly unbelieving heart 
 would have said, "Now that the meat is gone it is well that the mouths 
 are gone too; now that there are no portions it is well that there are 
 no children:" but Job knew better, and would have been thankful if 
 Providence had spared his children, though he had little of nothing for 
 them, for <I>Jehovah-jireh--the Lord will provide.</I> Some expositors, 
 remembering that it was usual with the Jews to rend their clothes when 
 they heard blasphemy, conjecture that Job rent his clothes in a holy 
 indignation at the blasphemous thoughts which Satan now cast into his 
 mind, tempting him to curse God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He conducted himself like a wise and good man under his affliction, 
 like a <I>perfect and upright man,</I> and <I>one that feared God</I> 
 and <I>eschewed</I> the <I>evil</I> of sin more than that of outward 
 trouble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He humbled himself under the hand of God, and accommodated himself 
 to the providences he was under, as one that knew how to want as well 
 as how to abound. When God called to weeping and mourning he wept and 
 mourned, <I>rent his mantle and shaved his head;</I> and, as one that 
 abased himself even to the dust before God, he <I>fell down upon the 
 ground,</I> in a penitent sense of sin and a patient submission to the 
 will of God, <I>accepting the punishment of his iniquity.</I> Hereby he 
 showed his sincerity; for <I>hypocrites cry not when God binds 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:13"><I>ch.</I> xxxvi. 13</A>.

 Hereby he prepared himself to get good by the affliction; for how can
 we improve the grief which we will not feel?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He composed himself with quieting considerations, that he might not 
 be disturbed and put out of the possession of his own soul by these 
 events. He reasons from the common state of human life, which he 
 describes with application to himself: <I>Naked came I</I> (as others 
 do) <I>out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither,</I> 
 into the lap of our common mother--the earth, as the child, when it is
 sick or weary, lays its head in its mother's bosom. <I>Dust we were</I> 
 in our original, and <I>to dust we return</I> in our exit 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:19">Gen. iii. 19</A>),

 <I>to the earth as we were</I>
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+12:7">Eccl. xii. 7</A>),

 <I>naked shall we return thither,</I> whence we were taken, namely, to
 the clay,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:6"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 6</A>.

 St. Paul refers to this of Job,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:7">1 Tim. vi. 7</A>.

 <I>We brought nothing</I> of this world's goods <I>into the world,</I>
 but have them from others; and <I>it is certain that we can carry 
 nothing out,</I> but must leave them to others. We come into the world 
 naked, not only unarmed, but unclothed, helpless, shiftless, not so 
 well covered and fenced as other creatures. The sin we are born in 
 makes us naked, to our shame, in the eyes of the holy God. We go out of 
 the world naked; the body does, though the sanctified soul goes 
 clothed,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:3">2 Cor. v. 3</A>.

 Death strips us of all our enjoyments; clothing can neither warm nor
 adorn a dead body. This consideration silenced Job under all his
 losses. 

 (1.) He is but where he was at first. He looks upon himself only as 
 naked, not maimed, not wounded; he was himself still his own man, when 
 nothing else was his own, and therefore but reduced to his first 
 condition. <I>Nemo tam pauper potest esse quam natus est--no one can be 
 so poor as he was when born.--Min. Felix.</I> If we are impoverished, 
 we are not wronged, nor much hurt, for we are but as we were born. 

 (2.) He is but where he must have been at last, and is only unclothed, 
 or unloaded rather, a little sooner than he expected. If we put off our 
 clothes before we go to bed, it is some inconvenience, but it may be 
 the better borne when it is near bed-time.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He gave glory to God, and expressed himself upon this occasion with 
 a great veneration for the divine Providence, and a meek submission to 
 its disposals. We may well rejoice to find Job in this good frame, 
 because this was the very thing upon which the trial of his integrity 
 was put, though he did not know it. The devil said that he would, under 
 his affliction, curse God; but he blessed him, and so proved himself an 
 honest man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He acknowledged the hand of God both in the mercies he had 
 formerly enjoyed and in the afflictions he was now exercised with: 
 <I>The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away.</I> We must own the 
 divine Providence, 

 [1.] In all our comforts. God gave us our being, <I>made us, and not we 
 ourselves,</I> gave us our wealth; it was not our own ingenuity or 
 industry that enriched us, but God's blessing on our cares and 
 endeavours. He gave us power to get wealth, not only made the creatures 
 for us, but best owed upon us our share.

 [2.] In all our crosses. The same that gave hath taken away; and may he 
 not do what he will with his own? See how Job looks above instruments, 
 and keeps his eye upon the first Cause. He does not say, "The Lord 
 gave, and the Sabeans and Chaldeans have taken away; God made me rich, 
 and the devil has made me poor;" but, "He that gave has taken;" and for 
 that reason he is dumb, and has nothing to say, because God did it. He 
 that gave all may take what, and when, and how much he pleases. Seneca 
 could argue thus, <I>Abstulit, sed et dedit--he took away, but he also 
 gave;</I> and Epictetus excellently (cap. 15), "When thou art deprived
 of any comfort, suppose a child taken away by death, or a part of thy 
 estate lost, say not <B><I>apolesa auto</I></B>--<I>I have lost it;</I> 
 but <B><I>apedoka</I></B>--<I>I have restored it to the right 
 owner;</I> but thou wilt object (says he), <B><I>kakos ho 
 aphelomenos</I></B>--<I>he is a bad man that has robbed me;</I> to 
 which he answers, <B><I>ti de soi melei</I></B>--<I>What is it to thee 
 by what hand he that gives remands what he gave?</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He adored God in both. When all was gone he fell down and 
 worshipped. Note, Afflictions must not divert us from, but quicken us 
 to, the exercises of religion. Weeping must not hinder sowing, nor 
 hinder worshipping. He eyed not only the hand of God, but the name of 
 God, in his afflictions, and gave glory to that: <I>Blessed be the name 
 of the Lord.</I> He has still the same great and good thoughts of God 
 that ever he had, and is as forward as ever to speak them forth to his 
 praise; he can find in his heart to bless God even when he takes away 
 as well as when he gives. Thus must we <I>sing both of mercy and 
 judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:1">Ps. ci. 1</A>.

 [1.] He blesses God for what was given, though now it was taken away. 
 When our comforts are removed from us we must thank God that ever we 
 had them and had them so much longer than we deserved. Nay,

 [2.] He adores God even in taking away, and gives him honour by a 
 willing submission; nay, he gives him thanks for good designed him by 
 his afflictions, for gracious supports under his afflictions, and the 
 believing hopes he had of a happy issue at last.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> Here is the honourable testimony which the Holy Ghost 
 gives to Job's constancy and good conduct under his afflictions. He 
 passed his trials with applause, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.

 In all this Job did not act amiss, for he did not attribute folly to
 God, nor in the least reflect upon his wisdom in what he had done. 
 Discontent and impatience do in effect charge God with folly. Against 
 the workings of these therefore Job carefully watched; and so must we, 
 acknowledging that as God has done right, but we have done wickedly, so 
 God has done wisely, but we have done foolishly, very foolishly. Those 
 who not only keep their temper under crosses and provocations, but keep 
 up good thoughts of God and sweet communion with him, whether their 
 praise be of men or no, it will be of God, as Job's here was.</P>
