 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is one of the Hallelujah-psalms; that is the title of it, and that 
 is the Amen of it, both its Alpha and its Omega. 

 I. It begins with a call to praise God, particularly a call to the
 "servants of the Lord" to praise him, as in the foregoing psalm, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. It goes on to furnish us with matter for praise. God is to be
 praised, 

 1. As the God of Jacob, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:4">ver. 4</A>.
 
 2. As the God of gods, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:5">ver. 5</A>.

 3. As the God of the whole world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>.

 4. As a terrible God to the enemies of Israel, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 5. As a gracious God to Israel, both in what he had done for them and 
 what he would do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:12-14">ver. 12-14</A>.

 6. As the only living God, all other gods being vanity and a lie, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:15-18">ver. 15-18</A>.

 III. It concludes with another exhortation to all persons concerned to
 praise God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:19-21">ver. 19-21</A>.

 In singing this psalm our hearts must be filled, as well as our mouths, 
 with the high praises of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Praise ye the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>. Praise ye the name of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; praise
 <I>him,</I> O ye servants of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 2  Ye that stand in the house of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, in the courts of the
 house of our God,
 &nbsp; 3  Praise the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> good: sing praises unto
 his name; for <I>it is</I> pleasant.
 &nbsp; 4  For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> hath chosen Jacob unto himself, <I>and</I> Israel for
 his peculiar treasure.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. The duty we are called to--to <I>praise the Lord,</I> to <I>praise
 his name; praise him,</I> and again <I>praise him.</I> We must not only 
 thank him for what he has done for us, but praise him for what he is in 
 himself and has done for others; take all occasions to speak well of 
 God and to give his truths and ways a good word. 

 2. The persons that are called upon to do this--the <I>servants of the 
 Lord,</I> the priests and Levites <I>that stand in his house,</I> and 
 all the devout and pious Israelites that stand <I>in the courts of his 
 house</I> to worship there, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Those that have most reason to praise God who are admitted to the
 privileges of his house, and those see most reason who there behold his 
 beauty and taste his bounty; from them it is expected, for to that end 
 they enjoy their places. Who should praise him if they do not? 

 3. The reasons why we should praise God.

 (1.) Because he whom we are to praise <I>is good,</I> and goodness is
 that which every body will speak well of. He is good to all, and we 
 must give him the praise of that. His goodness is his glory, and we 
 must make mention of it to his glory.

 (2.) Because the work is its own wages: <I>Sing praises to his name,
 for it is pleasant.</I> It is best done with a cheerful spirit, and we 
 shall have the pleasure of having done our duty. It is a heaven upon 
 earth to be praising God; and the pleasure of that should quite put our 
 mouths out of taste for the pleasures of sin.

 (3.) Because of the peculiar privileges of God's people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>The Lord hath chosen Jacob to himself,</I> and therefore Jacob is 
 bound to praise him; for <I>therefore</I> God chose a people to himself 
 that they might be unto him <I>for a name and a praise</I> 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+13:11">Jer. xiii. 11</A>),

 and <I>therefore</I> Jacob has abundant matter for praise, being thus
 dignified and distinguished. <I>Israel</I> is God's <I>peculiar 
 treasure</I> above all people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:5">Exod. xix. 5</A>);

 they are his <I>Segullah,</I> a people appropriated to him, and that he
 has a delight in, <I>precious in his sight and honourable.</I> For this 
 distinguishing surprising favour, if the seed of Jacob do not praise 
 him, they are the most unworthy ungrateful people under the sun.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>5  For I know that the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> great, and <I>that</I> our Lord <I>is</I>
 above all gods.
 &nbsp; 6  Whatsoever the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> pleased, <I>that</I> did he in heaven, and in
 earth, in the seas, and all deep places.
 &nbsp; 7  He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth;
 he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of
 his treasuries.
 &nbsp; 8  Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.
 &nbsp; 9  <I>Who</I> sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O
 Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
 &nbsp; 10  Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
 &nbsp; 11  Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all
 the kingdoms of Canaan:
 &nbsp; 12  And gave their land <I>for</I> a heritage, a heritage unto
 Israel his people.
 &nbsp; 13  Thy name, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, <I>endureth</I> for ever; <I>and</I> thy memorial, O
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, throughout all generations.
 &nbsp; 14  For the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> will judge his people, and he will repent
 himself concerning his servants.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist had suggested to us the goodness of God, as the proper 
 matter of our cheerful praises; here he suggests to us the greatness of 
 God as the proper matter of our awful praises; and on this he is most 
 copious, because this we are less forward to consider.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He asserts the doctrine of God's greatness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>The Lord is great,</I> great indeed, who knows no limits of time or
 place. He asserts it with assurance, "I know that he is so; know it not 
 only by observation of the proofs of it, but by belief of the 
 revelation of it. I know it; I am sure of it; I know it by my own
 experience of the divine greatness working on my soul." He asserts it 
 with a holy defiance of all pretenders, though they should join in 
 confederacy against him. He is not only above any god, but above all 
 gods, infinitely above them, between him and them there is no 
 comparison.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He proves him to be a great God by the greatness of his power, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 1. He has an absolute power, and may do what he will: <I>Whatsoever the
 Lord pleased, that did he,</I> and none could control him, or say unto 
 him, <I>What doest thou?</I> He does what he pleases, because he 
 pleases, and gives not an account of any of his matters. 

 2. He has an almighty power and can do what he will; if he will work,
 none shall hinder. 

 3. This absolute almighty power is of universal extent; he does what he
 will <I>in heaven, in earth, in the seas,</I> and in <I>all the deep 
 places</I> that are in the bottom of the sea or the bowels of the 
 earth. The gods of the heathen can do nothing; but our God can do any 
 thing and does do every thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He gives instances of his great power,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In the kingdom of nature, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 All the powers of nature prove the greatness of the God of nature, from
 whom they are derived and on whom they depend. The chain of natural 
 causes was not only framed by him at first, but is still preserved by 
 him.

 (1.) It is by his power that exhalations are drawn up from the
 terraqueous globe. The heat of the sun raises them, but it has that 
 power from God, and therefore it is given as an instance of the glory 
 of God that <I>nothing is hidden from the heat</I> of the sun,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:6">Ps. xix. 6</A>.

 <I>He causes the vapours to ascend</I> (not only unhelped, but unseen,
 by us) from the earth, <I>from the ends of the earth,</I> that is, from 
 the seas, by which the earth is surrounded. 

 (2.) It is he who, out of those vapours so raised, forms the rain, so
 that the earth is no loser by the vapours it sends up, for they are 
 returned with advantage in fruitful showers.

 (3.) Out of the same vapours (such is his wonderful power) he <I>makes
 lightnings or the rain;</I> by them he opens the bottles of heaven, and 
 shakes the clouds, that they may water the earth. Here are fire and 
 water thoroughly reconciled by divine omnipotence. They come together, 
 and yet the water does not quench the fire, nor the fire lick up the 
 water, as fire from heaven did when God pleased,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+18:38">1 Kings xviii. 38</A>.

 (4.) The same exhalations, to serve another purpose, are converted into 
 winds, which blow where they list, from what point of the compass they 
 will, and we are so far from directing them that we cannot tell whence 
 they come nor whither they go, but God <I>brings them out of his 
 treasuries</I> with as much exactness and design as a prudent prince 
 orders money to issue out of his exchequer.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In the kingdoms of men; and here he mentions the great things God 
 had formerly done for his people Israel, which were proofs of God's 
 greatness as well as of his goodness, and confirmations of the truth of 
 the scriptures of the Old Testament, which began to be written by 
 Moses, the person employed in working those miracles. Observe God's 
 sovereign dominion and irresistible power, 

 (1.) In bringing Israel out of Egypt, humbling Pharaoh by many plagues,
 and so forcing him to let them go. These plagues are called 
 <I>tokens</I> and <I>wonders,</I> because they came not in the common 
 course of providence, but there was something miraculous in each of 
 them. They were <I>sent upon Pharaoh and all his servants,</I> his 
 subjects; but the Israelites, whom God claimed for his servants, his 
 son, his first-born, his free-born, were exempted from them, and no 
 plague came nigh their dwelling. The death of the first-born both of 
 men and cattle was the heaviest of all the plagues, and that which 
 gained the point.

 (2.) In destroying the kingdoms of Canaan before them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 Those that were in possession of the land designed for Israel had all
 possible advantages for keeping possession. The people were numerous, 
 and warlike, and confederate against Israel. They were great nations.
 Yet, if a great nation has a meek and mean-spirited prince, it lies 
 exposed; but these great nations had <I>mighty kings,</I> and yet they 
 were all smitten and slain--<I>Sihon</I> and <I>Og,</I> and <I>all the 
 kingdoms of Canaan,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.

 No power of hell or earth can prevent the accomplishment of the promise
 of God when the time, the set time, for it has come.

 (3.) In settling them in the land of promise. He that gives kingdoms to
 whomsoever he pleases gave Canaan to be a heritage to Israel his 
 people. It came to them by inheritance, for their ancestors had the 
 promise of it, though not the possession; and it descended as an 
 inheritance to their seed. This was done long before, yet God is now 
 praised for it; and with good reason, for the children were now 
 enjoying the benefit of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He triumphs in the perpetuity of God's glory and grace. 

 1. Of his glory

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>Thy name, O God! endures for ever.</I> God's manifestations of 
 himself to his people have everlasting fruits and consequences. <I>What 
 God doeth it shall be for ever,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+3:14">Eccl. iii. 14</A>.

 His name endures for ever in the constant and everlasting praises of 
 his people; his memorial endures, has endured hitherto, and shall still 
 endure throughout all generations of the church. This seems to refer to 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:15">Exod. iii. 15</A>,

 where, when God had called himself <I>the God of Abraham, Isaac, and 
 Jacob,</I> he adds, <I>This is my name for ever and this is my memorial 
 unto all generations.</I> God is, and will be, always the same to his 
 church, a gracious, faithful, wonder-working God; and his church is, 
 and will be, the same to him, a thankful praising people; and thus his 
 name <I>endures for ever.</I> 

 2. Of his grace. He will be kind to his people.

 (1.) He will plead their cause against others that contend with them.
 <I>He will judge his people,</I> that is, he will judge for them, and 
 will not suffer them to be run down.

 (2.) He will not himself contend for ever with them, but will <I>repent
 himself concerning his servants,</I> and not proceed in his controversy 
 with them; he will be entreated for them, or he will be comforted 
 concerning them; he will return in ways of mercy to them and will 
 delight to do them good.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The design of these verses is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To arm the people of God against idolatry and all false worship, by 
 showing what sort of gods they were that the heathen worshipped, as we 
 had it before, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:4-8">Ps. cxv. 4</A>,

 &c.

 1. They were gods of their own making; being so, they could have no
 power but what their makers gave them, and then what power could their 
 makers receive from them? The images were the <I>work of men's 
 hands,</I> and the deities that were supposed to inform them were as 
 much the creatures of men's fancy and imagination.

 2. They had the shape of animals, but could not perform the least act,
 no, not of the <I>animal</I> life. They could neither <I>see,</I> nor 
 <I>hear,</I> nor <I>speak,</I> nor so much as <I>breathe;</I> and 
 therefore to make them with <I>eyes,</I> and <I>ears,</I> and 
 <I>mouths,</I> and <I>nostrils,</I> was such a jest that one would 
 wonder how reasonable creatures could suffer themselves to be so 
 imposed upon as to expect any good from such mock-deities. 

 3. Their worshippers were therefore as stupid and senseless as they
 were, both those that made them to be worshipped and those that trusted 
 in them when they were made, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 The worshipping of such gods as were the objects of sense, and
 senseless, made the worshippers sensual and senseless. Let our 
 worshipping a God that is a Spirit make us spiritual and wise.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To stir up the people of God to true devotion in the worship of the 
 true God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+135:19-21"><I>v.</I> 19-21</A>.

 The more deplorable the condition of the Gentile nations that worship
 idols is the more are we bound to thank God that we know better. 
 Therefore,

 1. Let us set ourselves about the acts of devotion, and employ
 ourselves in them: <I>Bless the Lord,</I> and again and again, <I>bless 
 the Lord.</I> In the parallel place

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:9-11">Ps. cxv. 9-11</A>),

 by way of inference from the impotency of idols, the duty thus pressed
 upon us is to <I>trust in the Lord;</I> here to <I>bless him;</I> by 
 putting our trust in God we give glory to him, and those that depend 
 upon God shall not want matter of thanksgiving to him. All persons that 
 knew God are here called to praise him--the <I>house of Israel</I> (the 
 nation in general), the <I>house of Aaron</I> and the <I>house of 
 Levi</I> (the Lord's ministers that attended in his sanctuary), and all 
 others <I>that feared the Lord,</I> though they were not of the house 
 of Israel. 

 2. Let God have the glory of all: <I>Blessed be the Lord.</I> The
 tribute of praise arises <I>out of Zion.</I> All God's works do praise 
 him, but his saints bless him; and they need not go far to pay their 
 tribute, for he <I>dwells in Jerusalem,</I> in his church, which they 
 are members of, so that he is always nigh unto them to receive their 
 homage. The condescensions of his grace, in dwelling with men upon the 
 earth, call for our grateful and thankful returns, and our repeated 
 Hallelujahs.</P>
