 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this and the following chapter we have Job's answer to Bildad's 
 discourse, wherein he speaks honourably of God, humbly of himself, and 
 feelingly of his troubles; but not one word by way of reflection upon 
 his friends, or their unkindness to him, nor in direct reply to what 
 Bildad had said. He wisely keeps to the merits of the cause, and makes 
 no remarks upon the person that managed it, nor seeks occasion against 
 him. In this chapter we have, 

 I. The doctrine of God's justice laid down, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:2">ver. 2</A>.

 II.  The proof of it, from his wisdom, and power, and sovereign
 dominion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:3-13">ver. 3-13</A>.

 III.  The application of it, in which, 

 1.  He condemns himself, as not able to contend with God either in law
 or battle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:14-21">ver. 14-21</A>.

 2. He maintains his point, that we cannot judge of men's character by 
 their outward condition, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:22-24">ver. 22-24</A>.

 3. He complains of the greatness of his troubles, the confusion he was 
 in, and the loss he was at what to say or do, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:25-35">ver. 25-35</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then Job answered and said,
 &nbsp; 2  I know <I>it is</I> so of a truth: but how should man be just with
 God?
 &nbsp; 3  If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a
 thousand.
 &nbsp; 4  <I>He is</I> wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath
 hardened <I>himself</I> against him, and hath prospered?
 &nbsp; 5  Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which
 overturneth them in his anger.
 &nbsp; 6  Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars
 thereof tremble.
 &nbsp; 7  Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up
 the stars.
 &nbsp; 8  Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the
 waves of the sea.
 &nbsp; 9  Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers
 of the south.
 &nbsp; 10  Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders
 without number.
 &nbsp; 11  Lo, he goeth by me, and I see <I>him</I> not: he passeth on also,
 but I perceive him not.
 &nbsp; 12  Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say
 unto him, What doest thou?
 &nbsp; 13  <I>If</I> God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do
 stoop under him.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Bildad began with a rebuke to Job for talking so much, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:2"><I>ch.</I> viii. 2</A>.

 Job makes no answer to that, though it would have been easy enough to
 retort it upon himself; but in what he next lays down as his principle, 
 that God never perverts judgment, Job agrees with him: <I>I know it is 
 so of a truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Note, We should be ready to own how far we agree with those with whom 
 we dispute, and should not slight, much less resist, a truth, though 
 produced by an adversary and urged against us, but receive it in the 
 light and love of it, though it may have been misapplied. "<I>It is so 
 of a truth,</I> that wickedness brings men to ruin and the godly are 
 taken under God's special protection. These are truths which I 
 subscribe to; but how can any man make good his part with God?" <I>In 
 his sight shall no flesh living be justified,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+143:2">Ps.  cxliii. 2</A>.

 <I>How should man be just with God?</I> Some understand this as a
 passionate complaint of God's strictness and severity, that he is a God 
 whom there is no dealing with; and it cannot be denied that there are, 
 in this chapter, some peevish expressions, which seem to speak such 
 language as this. But I take this rather as a pious confession of man's 
 sinfulness, and his own in particular, that, if God should deal with 
 any of us according to the desert of our iniquities, we should 
 certainly be undone.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He lays this down for a truth, that man is an unequal match for his 
 Maker, either in dispute or combat.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In dispute 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>If he will contend with him,</I> either at law or at an argument, 
 <I>he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</I>

 (1.) God can ask a thousand puzzling questions which those that quarrel 
 with him, and arraign his proceedings, cannot give an answer to. When 
 God spoke to Job out of the whirlwind he asked him a great many 
 questions (<I>Dost thou know</I> this? <I>Canst thou do</I> that?) to 
 none of which Job could give an answer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:1-39:30"><I>ch.</I> xxxviii., xxxix.</A>

 God can easily manifest the folly of the greatest pretenders to wisdom.
 
 (2.) God can lay to our charge a thousand offences, can draw up against
 us a thousand articles of impeachment, and we cannot answer him so as 
 to acquit ourselves from the imputation of any of them, but must, by 
 silence, give consent that they are all true. We cannot set aside one 
 as foreign, another as frivolous, and another as false. We cannot, as 
 to one, deny the fact, and plead not guilty, and, as to another, deny 
 the fault, confess and justify. No, we are not able to answer him, but 
 must <I>lay our hand upon our mouth,</I> as Job did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:4,5"><I>ch.</I> xl. 4, 5</A>),

 and cry, <I>Guilty, guilty.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. In combat 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Who hath hardened himself against him and hath prospered?</I>" The 
 answer is very easy. You cannot produce any instance, from the 
 beginning of the world to this day, of any daring sinner who has 
 <I>hardened himself against God,</I> has obstinately persisted in 
 rebellion against him, who did not find God too hard for him and pay 
 dearly for his folly. Such transgressors have not prospered or had 
 peace; they have had no comfort in their way nor any success.  What did 
 ever man get by trials of skill, or trials of titles, with his Maker? 
 All the opposition given to God is but setting briers and thorns before 
 a consuming fire; so foolish, so fruitless, so destructive, is the 
 attempt,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+27:4,Eze+28:24,1Co+10:22">Isa. xxvii. 4; 
 Ezek. xxviii. 24; 1 Cor. x. 22</A>.

 Apostate angels hardened themselves against God, but did not prosper,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+2:4">2 Pet. ii. 4</A>.

 The dragon fights, but is cast out, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:9">Rev. xii. 9</A>.

 Wicked men harden themselves against God, dispute his wisdom, disobey
 his laws, are impenitent for their sins and incorrigible under their 
 afflictions; they reject the offers of his grace, and resist the 
 strivings of his Spirit; they make nothing of his threatenings, and 
 make head against his interest in the world. But have they prospered? 
 Can they prosper?  No; they are but <I>treasuring up for themselves 
 wrath against the day of wrath.</I> Those that roll this will find it 
 return upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He proves it by showing what a God he is with whom we have to do: 
 <I>He is wise in heart,</I> and therefore we cannot answer him at law; 
 he is <I>mighty in strength,</I> and therefore we cannot fight it out 
 with him. It is the greatest madness that can be to think to contend 
 with a God of infinite wisdom and power, who knows every thing and can 
 do every thing, who can be neither outwitted nor overpowered. The devil 
 promised himself that Job, in the day of his affliction, would curse 
 God and speak ill of him, but, instead of that, he sets himself to 
 honour God and to speak highly of him. As much pained as he is, and as 
 much taken up with his own miseries, when he has occasion to mention 
 the wisdom and power of God he forgets his complaints, dwells with 
 delight, and expatiates with a flood of eloquence, upon that noble 
 useful subject. Evidences of the wisdom and power of God he 
 fetches,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. From the kingdom of nature, in which the God of nature acts with an 
 uncontrollable power and does what he pleases; for all the orders and 
 all the powers of nature are derived from him and depend upon him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) When he pleases he alters the course of nature, and turns back its 
 streams, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>.

 By the common law of nature the mountains are settled and are therefore 
 called <I>everlasting mountains,</I> the earth is established and 
 cannot be removed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:1">Ps. xciii. 1</A>)

 and the pillars there of are immovably fixed, the sun rises in its
 season, and the stars shed their influences on this lower world; but 
 when God pleases he can not only drive out of the common track, but 
 invert the order and change the law of nature.

 [1.] Nothing more firm than the mountains. When we speak of removing 
 mountains we mean that which is impossible; yet the divine power can 
 make them change their seat: <I>He removes them and they know not,</I> 
 removes them whether they will or no; he can make them lower their 
 heads; he can level them, and overturn them in his anger; he can spread 
 the mountains as easily as the husbandman spreads the molehills, be 
 they ever so high, and large, and rocky. Men have much ado to pass over
 them, but God, when he pleases, can make them pass away. He made Sinai
 shake, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:8">Ps. lxviii. 8</A>.
 
 <I>The hills skipped,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+114:4">Ps. cxiv. 4</A>.

 <I>The everlasting mountains were scattered,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+3:6">Hab. iii. 6</A>.

 [2.] Nothing more fixed than the earth on its axletree; yet God can, 
 when he pleases, <I>shake the earth out of its place,</I> heave it off 
 its centre, and make even <I>its pillars to tremble;</I> what seemed to 
 support it will itself need support when God gives it a shock. See how 
 much we are indebted to God's patience. God has power enough to shake 
 the earth from under that guilty race of mankind which makes it groan 
 under the burden of sin, and so to <I>shake the wicked out of it</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:13">Job xxxviii. 13</A>);

 yet he continues the earth, and man upon it, and does not make it, as
 once, to swallow up the rebels.

 [3.] Nothing more constant than the rising sun, it never misses its 
 appointed time; yet God, when he pleases, can suspend it. He that at 
 first commanded it to rise can countermand it. Once the sun was told to 
 stand, and another time to retreat, to show that it is still under the 
 check of its great Creator.  Thus great is God's power; and how great 
 then is his goodness, which causes his sun to shine even upon the evil 
 and unthankful, though he could withhold it! He that made the stars 
 also, can, if he pleases, seal them up, and hide them from our eyes. By 
 earthquakes and subterraneous fires mountains have sometimes been 
 removed and the earth shaken: in very dark and cloudy days and nights 
 it seems to us as if the sun were forbidden to rise and the stars were 
 sealed up, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+27:20">Acts xxvii. 20</A>.

 It is sufficient to say that Job here speaks of what God can do; but,
 if we must understand it of what he has done in fact, all these verses 
 may perhaps be applied to Noah's flood, when the mountains of the earth 
 were shaken, and the sun and stars were darkened; and the world that 
 now is we believe to be reserved for that fire which will consume the 
 mountains, and melt the earth, with its fervent heat, and which will 
 turn the sun into darkness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) As long as he pleases he preserves the settled course and order of 
 nature; and this is a continued creation. He himself alone, by his own 
 power, and without the assistance of any other, 

 [1.] <I>Spreads out the heaven</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 not only did spread them out at first, but still spreads them out (that 
 is, keeps them spread out), for otherwise they would of themselves roll 
 together like a scroll of parchment.

 [2.] <I>He treads upon the waves of the sea;</I> that is, he suppresses 
 them and keeps them under, that they return not to deluge the earth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:9">Ps. civ. 9</A>),

 which is given as a reason why we should all fear God and stand in awe
 of him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+5:22">Jer. v. 22</A>.
 
 He is mightier than the proud waves 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+93:4,Ps+65:7">Ps. xciii. 4; lxv. 7</A>.

 [3.] He makes the constellations; three are named for all the rest 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 <I>Arcturus, Orion,</I> and <I>Pleiades,</I> and in general <I>the 
 chambers of the south.</I> The stars of which these are composed he 
 made at first, and put into that order, and he still makes them, 
 preserves them in being, and guides their motions; he makes them to be 
 what they are to man, and inclines the hearts of man to observe them, 
 which the beasts are not capable of doing. Not only those stars which 
 we see and give names to, but those also in the other hemisphere, about 
 the antarctic pole, which never come in our sight, called here <I>the 
 chambers of the south,</I> are under the divine direction and dominion.  
 How wise is he then, and how mighty!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. From the kingdom of Providence, that special Providence which is 
 conversant about the affairs of the children of men. Consider what God 
 does in the government of the world, and you will say, He is <I>wise in 
 heart</I> and <I>mighty in strength.</I> 

 (1.) He does many things and great, many and great to admiration, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Job here says the same that Eliphaz had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:9"><I>ch.</I> v. 9</A>),

 and in the original in the very same words, not declining to speak
 after him, though now his antagonist. God is a great God, and <I>doeth 
 great things,</I> a wonder-working God; his works of wonder are so many 
 that we cannot number them and so mysterious that we cannot find them 
 out. O the depth of his counsels!  

 (2.) He acts invisibly and undiscerned, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 "<I>He goes by me</I> in his operations, <I>and I see him not, I 
 perceive him not.</I> His <I>way is in the sea,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+77:19">Ps. lxxvii. 19</A>.

 The operations of second causes are commonly obvious to sense, but God
 does all about us and yet <I>we see him not,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+17:23">Acts xvii. 23</A>.

 Our finite understandings cannot fathom his counsels, apprehend his
 motions, or comprehend the measures he takes; we are therefore 
 incompetent judges of God's proceedings, because we know not what he 
 does or what he designs. The <I>arcana imperii--secrets of 
 government,</I> are things above us, which therefore we must not 
 pretend to expound or comment upon.

 (3.) He acts with an incontestable sovereignty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 He takes away our creature-comforts and confidences when and as he 
 pleases, takes away health, estate, relations, friends, takes away life 
 itself; whatever goes, it is he that takes it; by what hand so ever it 
 is removed, his hand must be acknowledged in its removal. The Lord 
 <I>takes away,</I> and <I>who can hinder him? Who can turn him 
 away?</I> (Margin, <I>Who shall make him restore?</I>) Who can dissuade 
 him or alter his counsels? Who can resist him or oppose his operations?  
 Who can control him or call him to an account? What action can be 
 brought against him?  Or <I>who will say unto him, What doest thou?</I> 
 Or, Why doest thou so? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:35">Dan. iv. 35</A>.

 God is not obliged to give us a reason of what he does.  The meanings
 of his proceedings we know not now; it will be time enough to know
 hereafter, when it will appear that what seemed now to be done by 
 prerogative was done in infinite wisdom and for the best.

 (4.) He acts with an irresistible power, which no creature can resist, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 <I>If God will not withdraw his anger</I> (which he can do when he 
 pleases, for he is <I>Lord of his anger,</I> lets it out or calls it in 
 according to his will), <I>the proud helpers do stoop under him;</I> 
 that is, He certainly breaks and crushes those that proudly help one 
 another against him. Proud men set themselves against God and his 
 proceedings.  In this opposition they join hand in hand. <I>The kings 
 of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together,</I> 
 to throw off his yoke, to run down his truths, and to persecute his 
 people. <I>Men of Israel, help,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+21:28,Ps+83:8">Acts xxi. 28; Ps. lxxxiii. 8</A>.

 If one enemy of God's kingdom fall under his judgment, the rest come
 proudly to help that, and think to deliver that out of his hand: but in 
 vain; unless he pleases to withdraw his anger (which he often does, for 
 it is the day of his patience) the proud helpers stoop under him, and 
 fall with those whom they designed to help. <I>Who knows the power of 
 God's anger?</I> Those who think they have strength enough to help 
 others will not be able to help themselves against it.</P>

 bitterness.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What Job had said of man's utter inability to contend with God he here 
 applies to himself, and in effect despairs of gaining his favour, which 
 (some think) arises from the hard thoughts he had of God, as one who, 
 having set himself against him, right or wrong, would be too hard for 
 him. I rather think it arises from the sense he had of the imperfection 
 of his own righteousness, and the dark and cloudy apprehensions which 
 at present he had of God's displeasure against him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He durst not dispute with God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 "<I>If the proud helpers do stoop under him, how much less shall I</I> 
 (a poor weak creature, so far from being a helper that I am very 
 helpless) <I>answer him?</I> What can I say against that which God 
 does?  If I go about to reason with him, he will certainly be too hard 
 for me." If the potter make the clay into a vessel of dishonour, or 
 break in pieces the vessel he has made, shall the clay or the broken 
 vessel reason with him? So absurd is the man who replies against God, 
 or thinks to talk the matter out with him. No, let all flesh be silent 
 before him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He durst not insist upon his own justification before God. Though 
 he vindicated his own integrity to his friends, and would not yield 
 that he was a hypocrite and a wicked man, as they suggested, yet he 
 would never plead it as his righteousness before God. "I will never 
 venture upon the covenant of innocency, nor think to come off by virtue 
 of that." Job knew so much of God, and knew so much of himself, that he 
 durst not insist upon his own justification before God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He knew so much of God that he durst not stand a trial with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:15-19"><I>v.</I> 15-19</A>.

 He knew how to make his part good with his friends, and thought himself 
 able to deal with them; but, though his cause had been better than it 
 was, he knew it was to no purpose to debate it with God.

 (1.) God knew him better than he knew himself and therefore 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 "<I>Though I were righteous</I> in my own apprehension, and my own 
 heart did not condemn me, <I>yet God is greater than my heart,</I> and 
 knows those secret faults and errors of mine which I do not and cannot 
 understand, and is able to charge me with them, and therefore <I>I 
 would not answer.</I>" St. Paul speaks to the same purport: <I>I know 
 nothing by myself,</I> am not conscious to myself of any reigning 
 wickedness, and <I>yet I am not hereby justified,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+4:4">1 Cor. iv. 4</A>.

 "I dare not put myself upon that issue, lest God should charge that
 upon me which I did not discover in myself." Job will therefore wave 
 that plea, and <I>make supplication to his Judge,</I> that is, will 
 cast himself upon God's mercy, and not think come off by his own merit. 
 
 (2.) He had no reason to think that there was anything in his prayers 
 to recommend them to the divine acceptance, or to fetch in an answer of 
 peace, no worth or worthiness at all to which to ascribe their success, 
 but it must be attributed purely to the grace and compassion of God, 
 who answers before we call and not because we call, and gives gracious 
 answers to our prayers, but not for our prayers 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>If I had called, and he had answered,</I> had given the thing I 
 called to him for, yet, so weak and defective are my best prayers, that 
 <I>I would not believe he had</I> therein <I>hearkened to my voice;</I> 
 I could not say that he had <I>saved with his right hand and answered 
 me</I>" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:5">Ps. lx. 5</A>),

 "but that he did it purely for his own name's sake." Bishop Patrick
 expounds it thus: "If I had made supplication, and he had granted my 
 desire, I would not think my prayer had done the business." <I>Not for 
 your sakes, be it known to you.</I>

 (3.) His present miseries, which God had brought him into 
 notwithstanding his integrity, gave him too sensible a conviction that, 
 in the ordering and disposing of men's outward condition in this world, 
 God acts by sovereignty, and, though he never does wrong to any, yet he 
 does not ever give full right to all (that is, the best do not always 
 fare best, nor the worst fare worst) in this life, because he reserves 
 the full and exact distribution of rewards and punishments for the 
 future state. Job was not conscious to himself of any extraordinary 
 guilt, and yet fell under extraordinary afflictions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>.

 Every man must expect the wind to blow upon him and ruffle him, but Job 
 was <I>broken with a tempest.</I> Every man, in the midst of these 
 thorns and briers, must expect to be scratched; but Job was wounded, 
 and his wounds were multiplied. Every man must expect a cross daily, 
 and to taste sometimes of the bitter cup; but poor Job's troubles came 
 so thickly upon him that he had no breathing time, and he was filled 
 with bitterness. And he presumes to say that all this was <I>without 
 cause,</I> without any great provocation given. We have made the best 
 of what Job said hitherto, though contrary to the judgment of many good 
 interpreters; but here, no doubt, <I>he spoke unadvisedly with his 
 lips;</I> he reflected on God's goodness in saying that he was not 
 suffered <I>to take his breath</I> (while yet he had such good use of 
 his reason and speech as to be able to talk thus) and on his justice in 
 saying that it was without cause.  Yet it is true that as, on the one 
 hand, there are many who are chargeable with more sin than the common 
 infirmities of human nature, and yet feel no more sorrow than that of 
 the common calamities of human life, so, on the other hand, there are 
 many who feel more than the common calamities of human life and yet are 
 conscious to themselves of no more than the common infirmities of human 
 nature.

 (4.) He was in no capacity at all to make his part good with God,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 [1.] Not by force of arms. "I dare not enter the lists with the 
 Almighty; for <I>if I speak of strength,</I> and think to come off by 
 that, <I>lo, he is strong,</I> stronger than I, and will certainly 
 overpower me." There is no disputing (said one once to C&aelig;sar) 
 with him that commands legions.  Much less is there any with him that 
 has legions of angels at command.  <I>Can thy heart endure</I> (thy 
 courage and presence of mind) <I>or can thy hands be strong</I> to 
 defend thyself, <I>in the days that I shall deal with thee?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+22:14">Ezek. xxii. 14</A>.

 [2.] Not by force of arguments.  "I dare not try the merits of the
 cause. <I>If I speak of judgment,</I> and insist upon my right, <I>who 
 will set me a time to plead?</I> There is no higher power to which I 
 may appeal, no superior court to appoint a hearing of the cause; for he 
 is supreme and from him proceeds every man's judgment, which he must 
 abide by."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He knew so much of himself that he durst not stand a trial,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 "<I>If I</I> go about to <I>justify myself,</I> and to plead a 
 righteousness of my own, my defence will be my offence, and <I>my own 
 mouth shall condemn me</I> even when it goes about to acquit me." A 
 good man, who knows the deceitfulness of his own heart, and is jealous 
 over it with a godly jealousy, and has often discovered that amiss 
 there which had long lain undiscovered, is suspicious of more evil in 
 himself than he is really conscious of, and therefore will by no means 
 think of justifying himself before God. <I>If we say we have no sin, 
 we</I> not only <I>deceive ourselves,</I> but we affront God; for we 
 sin in saying so, and give the lie to the scripture, which has 
 <I>concluded all under sin. "If I say, I am perfect,</I> I am sinless, 
 God has nothing to lay to my charge, my very saying so shall <I>prove 
 me perverse,</I> proud, ignorant, and presumptuous. Nay, <I>though I 
 were perfect,</I> though God should pronounce me just, <I>yet would I 
 not know my soul,</I> I would not be in care about the prolonging of my 
 life while it is loaded with all these miseries." Or, "Though I were 
 free from gross sin, though my conscience should not charge me with any 
 enormous crime, yet would I not believe my own heart so far as to 
 insist upon my innocency nor think my life worth striving for with 
 God." In short, it is folly to contend with God, and our wisdom, as 
 well as duty, to submit to him and throw ourselves at his feet.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here Job touches briefly upon the main point now in dispute between him 
 and his friends. They maintained that those who are righteous and good 
 always prosper in this world, and none but the wicked are in misery and 
 distress; he asserted, on the contrary, that it is a common thing for 
 the wicked to prosper and the righteous to be greatly afflicted. This 
 is the one thing, the chief thing, wherein he and his friends differed; 
 and they had not proved their assertion, therefore he abides by his: "I 
 said it, and say it again, that all things come alike to all." Now,

 1.  It must be owned that there is very much truth in what Job here 
 means, that temporal judgments, when they are sent abroad, fall both 
 upon good and bad, and the destroying angel seldom distinguishes 
 (though once he did) between the houses of Israelites and the houses of 
 Egyptians. In the judgment of Sodom indeed, which is called <I>the 
 vengeance of eternal fire</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:7">Jude 7</A>),

 <I>far be it from</I> God to <I>slay the righteous with the wicked, and
 that the righteous should be as the wicked</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+18:25">Gen. xviii. 25</A>);

 but, in judgments merely temporal, the righteous have their share, and
 sometimes the greatest share. <I>The sword devours one as well as 
 another,</I> Josiah as well as Ahab. Thus God <I>destroys the perfect 
 and the wicked,</I> involves them both in the same common ruin; good 
 and bad were sent together into Babylon, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+24:5,9">Jer. xxiv. 5, 9</A>.

 <I>If the scourge slay suddenly,</I> and sweep down all before it, God
 will be well pleased to see how the same scourge which is the perdition 
 of the wicked is the trial of the innocent and of their faith, which 
 <I>will be found unto praise, and honour, and glory,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:7,Ps+66:10">1 Pet. i. 7; Ps. lxvi. 10</A>.</P>

 Let this reconcile God's children to their troubles; they are but 
 trials, designed for their honour and benefit, and, if God be pleased 
 with them, let not them be displeased; if he <I>laugh at the trial of 
 the innocent,</I> knowing how glorious the issue of it will be, at 
 destruction and famine let them also laugh 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+5:22"><I>ch.</I> v. 22</A>),

 and triumph over them, saying, <I>O death! where is thy sting?</I> On
 the other hand, the wicked are so far from being made the marks of 
 God's judgments that <I>the earth is given into their hand,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>

 (they enjoy large possessions and great power, have what they will and
 do what they will), <I>into the hand of the wicked one</I> (in the 
 original, the word is singular); the devil, that wicked one, is called 
 <I>the god of this world,</I> and boasts that into his hands it is 
 delivered, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+4:6">Luke iv. 6</A>.

 Or <I>into the hand of a wicked man,</I> meaning (as bishop Patrick and
 the Assembly's Annotations conjecture) some noted tyrant then living in 
 those parts, whose great wickedness and great prosperity were well 
 known both to Job and his friends. The wicked have the earth given 
 them, but the righteous have heaven given them, and which is 
 better--heaven without earth or earth without heaven?  God, in his 
 providence, advances wicked men, while he <I>covers the faces of</I> 
 those who are fit to be <I>judges,</I> who are wise and good, and 
 qualified for government, and buries them alive in obscurity, perhaps 
 suffers them to be run down and condemned, and to have their faces 
 covered as criminals by those wicked ones into whose hand the earth is 
 given. We daily see that this is done; <I>if</I> it be <I>not</I> God 
 that does it, <I>where and who is he</I> that does it?  To whom can it 
 be ascribed but to him that rules in the kingdoms of men, and gives 
 them to whom he will? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:32">Dan. iv. 32</A>.
 
 Yet, 

 2. It must be owned that there is too much passion in what Job here
 says. The manner of expression is peevish. When he meant that God 
 afflicts he ought not to have said, <I>He destroys</I> both <I>the 
 perfect and the wicked;</I> when he meant that God pleases himself with 
 the trial of the innocent he ought not to have said, <I>He laughs at 
 it,</I> for he doth not afflict willingly. When the spirit is heated, 
 either with dispute or with discontent, we have need to set a watch 
 before the door of our lips, that we may observe a due decorum in 
 speaking of divine things.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job here grows more and more querulous, and does not conclude this 
 chapter with such reverent expressions of God's wisdom and justice as 
 he began with. Those that indulge a complaining humour know not to what 
 indecencies, nay, to what impieties, it will hurry them. <I>The 
 beginning of</I> that <I>strife</I> with God <I>is as the letting forth 
 of water; therefore leave it off before it be meddled with.</I> When we 
 are in trouble we are allowed to complain to God, as the Psalmist 
 often, but must by no means complain of God, as Job here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. His complaint here of the passing away of the days of his prosperity 
 is proper enough 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>):

 "<I>My days</I> (that is, all my good days) are gone, never to return, 
 gone of a sudden, gone ere I was aware. Never did any courier that went 
 express" (like Cushi and Ahimaaz) "with good tidings make such haste as 
 all my comforts did from me. Never did ship sail to its port, never did 
 eagle fly upon its prey, with such incredible swiftness; nor does there 
 remain any trace of my prosperity, any more than there does of an eagle 
 in the air or a ship in the sea," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:19">Prov. xxx. 19</A>.

 See here, 

 1. How swift the motion of time is.  It is always upon the wing, 
 hastening to its period; it stays for no man. What little need have we 
 of pastimes, and what great need to redeem time, when time runs out, 
 runs on so fast towards eternity, which comes as time goes! 

 2. How vain the enjoyments of time are, which we may be quite deprived
 of while yet time continues. Our day may be longer than the sun-shine 
 of our prosperity; and, when that is gone, it is as if it had not been.  
 The remembrance of having done our duty will be pleasing afterwards; so 
 will not the remembrance of our having got a great deal of worldly 
 wealth when it is all lost and gone. "<I>They flee away,</I> past 
 recall; <I>they see no good,</I> and leave none behind them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His complaint of his present uneasiness is excusable, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>.

 1.  It should seem, he did his endeavour to quiet and compose himself
 as his friends advised him. That was the good he would do: he would 
 fain <I>forget his complaints</I> and praise God, would <I>leave off 
 his heaviness and comfort himself,</I> that he might be fit for 
 converse both with God and man; but, 

 2. He found he could not do it: "<I>I am afraid of all my sorrows.</I>
 When I strive most against my trouble it prevails most over me and 
 proves too hard for me!" It is easier, in such a case, to know what we 
 should do than to do it, to know what temper we should be in than to 
 get into that temper and keep in it. It is easy to preach patience to 
 those that are in trouble, and to tell them they must forget their 
 complaints and comfort themselves; but it is not so soon done as said. 
 Fear and sorrow are tyrannizing things, not easily brought into the 
 subjection they ought to be kept in to religion and right reason.  
 But,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His complaint of God as implacable and inexorable was by no means 
 to be excused. It was the language of his corruption. He knew better, 
 and, at another time, would have been far from harbouring any such hard 
 thoughts of God as now broke in upon his spirit and broke out in these 
 passionate complaints. Good men do not always speak like themselves; 
 but God, who considers their frame and the strength of their 
 temptations, gives them leave afterwards to unsay what was amiss by 
 repentance and will not lay it to their charge.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Job seems to speak here, 

 (1.) As if he despaired of obtaining from God any relief or redress of 
 his grievances, though he should produce ever so good proofs of his 
 integrity: "<I>I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</I> My 
 afflictions have continued so long upon me, and increased so fast, that 
 I do not expect thou wilt ever clear up my innocency by delivering me 
 out of them and restoring me to a prosperous condition. Right or wrong, 
 I must be treated as a wicked man; my friends will continue to think so 
 of me, and God will continue upon me the afflictions which give them 
 occasion to think so. <I>Why then do I labour in vain</I> to clear 
 myself and maintain my own integrity?" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:29"><I>v.</I>  29</A>.

 It is to no purpose to speak in a cause that is already prejudged.  
 With men it is often labour in vain for the most innocent to go about 
 to clear themselves; they must be adjudged guilty, though the evidence 
 be ever so plain for them. But it is not so in our dealings with God, 
 who is the patron of oppressed innocency and to whom it was never in 
 vain to commit a righteous cause. Nay, he not only despairs of relief, 
 but expects that his endeavour to clear himself will render him yet 
 more obnoxious 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:30,31"><I>v.</I> 30, 31</A>):

 "<I>If I wash myself with snow-water,</I> and make my integrity ever so 
 evident, it will be all to no purpose; judgment must go against me. 
 <I>Thou shalt plunge me in the ditch</I>" (the pit of destruction, so 
 some, or rather the filthy kennel, or sewer), "which will make me so 
 offensive in the nostrils of all about me that <I>my own clothes shall 
 abhor me</I> and I shall even loathe to touch myself." He saw his 
 afflictions coming from God. Those were the things that blackened him 
 in the eye of his friends; and, upon that score, he complained of them, 
 and of the continuance of them, as the ruin, not only of his comfort, 
 but of his reputation. Yet these words are capable of a good 
 construction. If we be ever so industrious to justify ourselves before 
 men, and to preserve our credit with them,--if we keep our hands ever 
 so clean from the pollutions of gross sin, which fall under the eye of 
 the world,--yet God, who knows our hearts, can charge us with so much 
 secret sin as will for ever take off all our pretensions to purity and 
 innocency, and make us see ourselves odious in the sight of the holy 
 God. Paul, while a Pharisee, made his hands very clean; but when the 
 commandment came and discovered to him his heart-sins, made him know 
 lust, that <I>plunged him in the ditch.</I>

 (2.) As if he despaired to have a fair hearing with God, and that were 
 hard indeed.

 [1.] He complains that he was not upon even terms with God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>):
 
 "<I>He is not a man, as I am.</I> I could venture to dispute with a man
 like myself (the potsherds may strive with the potsherds of the earth), 
 but he is infinitely above me, and therefore I dare not enter the lists 
 with him; I shall certainly be cast if I contend with him." Note, 
 <I>First,</I> God is not a man as we are. Of the greatest princes we 
 may say, "They are men as we are," but not of the great God.  His 
 thoughts and ways are infinitely above ours, and we must not measure 
 him by ourselves. Man is foolish and weak, frail and fickle, but God is 
 not. We are depending dying creatures; he is the independent an 
 immortal Creator.  <I>Secondly,</I> The consideration of this should 
 keep us very humble and very silent before God. Let us not make 
 ourselves equal with God, but always eye him as infinitely above us.  
 
 [2.] That there was no arbitrator or umpire to adjust the differences 
 between him and God and to determine the controversy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>):
 
 <I>Neither is there any days-man between us.</I> This complaint that 
 there was not is in effect a wish that there were, and so the LXX.  
 reads it: <I>O that there were a mediator between us!</I> Job would 
 gladly refer the matter, but no creature was capable of being a 
 referee, and therefore he must even refer it still to God himself and 
 resolve to acquiesce in his judgment. Our Lord Jesus is the blessed 
 days-man, who has mediated between heaven and earth, has laid his hand 
 upon us both; to him the Father has committed all judgment, and we 
 must. But this matter was not then brought to so clear a light as it is 
 now by the gospel, which leaves no room for such a complaint as this.  
 
 [3.] That the terrors of God, which set themselves in array against 
 him, put him into such confusion that he knew not how to address God 
 with the confidence with which he was formerly wont to approach him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+9:34,35"><I>v.</I> 34, 35</A>.

 "Besides the distance which I am kept at by his infinite transcendency, 
 his present dealings with me are very discouraging: <I>Let him take his 
 rod away from me.</I>" He means not so much his outward afflictions as 
 the load which lay upon his spirit from the apprehensions of God's 
 wrath; that was <I>his fear</I> which <I>terrified him.</I> "Let that 
 be removed; let me recover the sight of his mercy, and not be amazed 
 with the sight of nothing but his terrors, and <I>then I would 
 speak</I> and order my cause before him. <I>But it is not so with 
 me;</I> the cloud is not at all dissipated; the wrath of God still 
 fastens upon me, and preys on my spirits, as much as ever; and what to 
 do I know not."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. From all this let us take occasion, 

 (1.) To stand in awe of God, and to fear the power of his wrath. If 
 good men have been put into such consternation by it, <I>where shall 
 the ungodly and the sinner appear?</I> 

 (2.) To pity those that are wounded in spirit, and pray earnestly for 
 them, because in that condition they know not how to pray for 
 themselves. 

 (3.) Carefully to keep up good thoughts of God in our minds, for hard 
 thoughts of him are the inlets of much mischief. 

 (4.) To bless God that we are not in such a disconsolate condition as 
 poor Job was here in, but that we walk in the light of the Lord; let us 
 rejoice therein, but <I>rejoice with trembling.</I></P>
