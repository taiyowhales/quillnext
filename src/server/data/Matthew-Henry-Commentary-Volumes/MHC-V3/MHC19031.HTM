 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 It is probable that David penned this psalm when he was persecuted by
 Saul; some passages in it agree particularly to the narrow escapes he
 had, at Keilah 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:13">1 Sam. xxiii. 13</A>),

 then in the wilderness of Maon, when Saul marched on one side of the
 hill and he on the other, and, soon after, in the cave in the 
 wilderness of En-gedi; but that it was penned upon any of those 
 occasions we are not told. It is a mixture of prayers, and praises, and 
 professions of confidence in God, all which do well together and are 
 helpful to one another. 

 I. David professes his cheerful confidence in God, and, in that
 confidence, prays for deliverance out of his present troubles, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. He complains of the very deplorable condition he was in, and, in
 the sense of his calamities, still prays that God would graciously 
 appear for him against his persecutors, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:9-18">ver. 9-18</A>.

 III. He concludes the psalm with praise and triumph, giving glory to
 God, and encouraging himself and others to trust in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:19-24">ver. 19-24</A>.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>,
 do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy
 righteousness.
 &nbsp; 2  Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my
 strong rock, for a house of defence to save me.
 &nbsp; 3  For thou <I>art</I> my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy
 name's sake lead me, and guide me.
 &nbsp; 4  Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me:
 for thou <I>art</I> my strength.
 &nbsp; 5  Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O
 L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> God of truth.
 &nbsp; 6  I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 7  I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast
 considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;
 &nbsp; 8  And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast
 set my feet in a large room.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Faith and prayer must go together. He that believes, let him pray--<I>I
 believe, therefore I have spoken:</I> and he that prays, let him 
 believe, for the prayer of faith is the prevailing prayer. We have both 
 here.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. David, in distress, is very earnest with God in prayer for succour 
 and relief. This eases a burdened spirit, fetches in promised mercies, 
 and wonderfully supports and comforts the soul in the expectation of 
 them. He prays, 

 1. That God would deliver him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 that his life might be preserved from the malice of his enemies, and 
 that an end might be put to their persecutions of him, that God, not 
 only in his mercy, but in righteousness, would deliver him, as a 
 righteous Judge betwixt him and his unrighteous persecutors, that he 
 would bow down his ear to his petitions, to his appeals, and deliver 
 him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 It is condescension in God to take cognizance of the case of the 
 greatest and best of men; he humbles himself to do it. The psalmist 
 prays also that he would deliver him speedily, lest, if the deliverance 
 were long deferred, his faith should fail. 

 2. That if he did not immediately deliver him out of his troubles, yet 
 he would protect and shelter him in his troubles; "<I>Be thou my strong 
 rock,</I> immovable, impregnable, as a fastness framed by nature, and 
 my <I>house of defence,</I> a fortress framed by art, and all <I>to 
 save me.</I>" Thus we may pray that God's providence would secure to us 
 our lives and comforts, and that by his grace we may be enabled to 
 think ourselves safe in him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+18:10">Prov. xviii. 10</A>.

 3. That his case having much in it of difficulty, both in respect of
 duty and in respect of prudence, he might be under the divine guidance: 
 "<I>Lord, lead me and guide me</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 so order my steps, so order my spirit, that I may never do any thing 
 unlawful and unjustifiable--against my conscience, nor unwise and 
 indiscreet--against my interest." Those that resolve to follow God's 
 direction may in faith pray for it.

 4. That his enemies being very crafty, as well as very spiteful, God 
 would frustrate and baffle their designs against him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me,</I> and 
 keep me from the sin, the trouble, the death, they aim to entrap me 
 in."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. In this prayer he gives glory to God by a repeated profession of 
 his confidence in him and dependence on him. This encouraged his 
 prayers and qualified him for the mercies he prayed for 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>In thee, O Lord! do I put my trust,</I> and not in myself, or any 
 sufficiency of my own, or in any creature; <I>let me never be 
 ashamed,</I> let me not be disappointed of any of that good which thou 
 hast promised me and which therefore I have promised myself in thee."

 1. He had chosen God for his protector, and God had, by his promise, 
 undertaken to be so 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Thou art my rock and my fortress,</I> by thy covenant with me and 
 my believing consent to that covenant; therefore <I>be my strong 
 rock,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Those that have in sincerity avouched the Lord for theirs may expect 
 the benefit of his being so; for God's relations to us carry with them 
 both name and thing. <I>Thou art my strength,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 If God be our strength, we may hope that he will both put his strength 
 in us and put forth his strength for us.

 2.  He gave up his soul in a special manner to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Into thy hands I commit my spirit.</I>

 (1.) If David here looks upon himself as a dying man, by these words he 
 resigns his departing soul to God who gave it, and to whom, at death, 
 the spirit returns. "Men can but kill the body, but I trust in God to 
 <I>redeem my soul from the power of the grave,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:15">Ps. xlix. 15</A>.

 He is willing to die if God will have it so; but let my soul <I>fall 
 into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies are great.</I> With these 
 words our Lord Jesus yielded up the ghost upon the cross, and made his 
 soul an offering, a free-will offering for sin, voluntarily laying down 
 his life a ransom. By Stephen's example we are taught in, our dying 
 moment, to eye Christ at God's right hand, and to commit our spirits to 
 him: <I>Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</I> But,

 2. David is here to be looked upon as a man in distress and trouble.
 And, 

 [1.] His great care is about his soul, his spirit, his better part. 
 Note, Our outward afflictions should increase our concern for our 
 souls. Many think that while they are perplexed about their worldly 
 affairs, and Providence multiplies their cares about them, they may be 
 excused if they neglect their souls; whereas the greater hazard our 
 lives and secular interests lie at the more we are concerned to look to 
 our souls, that, though the outward man perish, the inward man may 
 suffer no damage

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:16">2 Cor. iv. 16</A>),

 and that we may keep possession of our souls when we can keep 
 possession of nothing else, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+21:19">Luke xxi. 19</A>.

 [2.] He thinks the best he can do for the soul is to commit it into the
 hand of God, and lodge that great trust with him. He had prayed 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>)
 
 to be plucked out of the net of outward trouble, but, as not insisting 
 upon that (God's will be done), he immediately lets fall that petition, 
 and commits the spirit, the inward man, into God's hand. "Lord, however 
 it goes with me, as to my body, let it go well with my soul." Note, It 
 is the wisdom and duty of every one of us solemnly to commit our 
 spirits into the hands of God, to be sanctified by his grace, devoted 
 to his honour, employed in his service, and fitted for his kingdom. 
 That which encourages us to commit our spirits into the hand of God is 
 that he has not only created, but redeemed, them; the particular 
 redemptions of the Old-Testament church and the Old-Testament saints 
 were typical of our redemption by Jesus Christ, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+48:16">Gen. xlviii. 16</A>.

 The redemption of the soul is so precious that it must have ceased for
 ever if Christ had not undertaken it; but, by redeeming our souls, he 
 has not only acquired an additional right and title to them, which 
 obliges us to commit them to him as his own, but has shown the 
 extraordinary kindness and concern he has for them, which encourages us 
 to commit them to him, to be preserved to his heavenly kingdom

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+1:12">2 Tim. i. 12</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth!</I> redeem me according 
 to a promise which thou wilt be true to."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He disclaimed all confederacy with those that made an arm of flesh 
 their confidence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>I have hated those that regard lying vanities</I>--idolaters (to 
 some), who expect aid from false gods, which are vanity and a 
 lie--astrologers, and those that give heed to them, so others. David 
 abhorred the use of enchantments and divinations; he consulted not, nor 
 even took notice of, the flight of birds or entrails of beasts, good 
 omens or bad omens; they are lying vanities, and he not only did not 
 regard them himself, but hated the wickedness of those that did. He 
 trusted in God only, and not in any creature. His interest in the court 
 or country, his retreats or strongholds, even Goliath's sword 
 itself--these were lying vanities, which he could not depend upon, but 
 trusted in the Lord only. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+40:4,Jer+17:5">Ps. xl. 4; Jer.  xvii. 5</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He comforted himself with his hope in God, and made himself, not 
 only easy, but cheerful, with it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Having relied on God's mercy, he will be glad and rejoice in it; and 
 those know not how to value their hope in God who cannot find joy 
 enough in that hope to counterbalance their grievances and silence 
 their griefs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He encouraged himself in this hope with the experiences he had had 
 of late, and formerly, of God's goodness to him, which he mentions to 
 the glory of God; he that has delivered doth and will. 

 1. God had taken notice of his afflictions and all the circumstances of 
 them: "<I>Thou hast considered my trouble,</I> with wisdom to suit 
 relief to it, with condescension and compassion regarding the low 
 estate of they servant." 

 2. He had observed the temper of his spirit and the workings of his 
 heart under his afflictions: "<I>Thou hast known my soul in 
 adversities,</I> with a tender concern and care for it." God's eye is 
 upon our souls when we are in trouble, to see whether they be humbled 
 for sin, submissive to the will of God, and bettered by the affliction.  
 If the soul, when cast down under affliction, has been lifted up to him 
 in true devotion, he knows it. 

 3. He had rescued him out of the hands of Saul when he had him safe
 enough in Keilah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:7">1 Sam. xxiii. 7</A>):

 "<I>Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy,</I> but set me 
 at liberty, in a <I>large room,</I> where I may shift for my own 
 safety,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 Christ's using those words 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>)

 upon the cross may warrant us to apply all this to Christ, who trusted
 in his Father and was supported and delivered by him, and (because he 
 humbled himself) highly exalted, which it is proper to think of when we 
 sing

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:1-8">these verses</A>,

 as also therein to acknowledge the experience we have had of God's
 gracious presence with us in our troubles and to encourage ourselves to 
 trust in him for the future.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Have mercy upon me, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, for I am in trouble: mine eye is
 consumed with grief, <I>yea,</I> my soul and my belly.
 &nbsp; 10  For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing:
 my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are
 consumed.
 &nbsp; 11  I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially
 among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that
 did see me without fled from me.
 &nbsp; 12  I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken
 vessel.
 &nbsp; 13  For I have heard the slander of many: fear <I>was</I> on every
 side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised
 to take away my life.
 &nbsp; 14  But I trusted in thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>: I said, Thou <I>art</I> my God.
 &nbsp; 15  My times <I>are</I> in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine
 enemies, and from them that persecute me.
 &nbsp; 16  Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy
 mercies' sake.
 &nbsp; 17  Let me not be ashamed, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>; for I have called upon thee:
 let the wicked be ashamed, <I>and</I> let them be silent in the grave.
 &nbsp; 18  Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous
 things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:1-8">foregoing verses</A>

 David had appealed to God's righteousness, and
 pleaded his relation to him and dependence on him; here he appeals to 
 his mercy, and pleads the greatness of his own misery, which made his 
 case the proper object of that mercy.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The complaint he makes of his trouble and distress 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 "<I>Have mercy upon me, O Lord! for I am in trouble,</I> and need thy 
 mercy." The remembrance he makes of his condition is not much unlike 
 some even of Job's complaints.

 1. His troubles had fixed a very deep impression upon his mind and made 
 him a man of sorrows. So great was his grief that his very soul was 
 consumed with it, and his life spent with it, and he was continually 
 sighing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>.

 Herein he was a type of Christ,--who was intimately acquainted with 
 grief and often in tears. We may guess by David's complexion, which was 
 ruddy and sanguine, by his genius for music, and by his daring 
 enterprises in his early days, that his natural disposition was both 
 cheerful and firm, that he was apt to be cheerful, and not to lay 
 trouble to his heart; yet here we see what he is brought to: he has 
 almost wept out his eyes, and sighed away his breath. Let those that 
 are airy and gay take heed of running into extremes, and never set 
 sorrow at defiance; God can find out ways to make them melancholy if 
 they will not otherwise learn to be serious.

 2.  His body was afflicted with the sorrows of his mind 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>My strength fails, my bones are consumed,</I> and all <I>because of 
 my iniquity.</I> As to Saul, and the quarrel he had with him, he could 
 confidently insist upon his righteousness; but, as it was an affliction 
 God laid upon him, he owns he had deserved it, and freely confesses his 
 iniquity to have been the procuring cause of all his trouble; and the 
 sense of sin touched him to the quick and wasted him more than all his 
 calamities.

 3. His friends were unkind and became shy of him. He was <I>a fear to
 his acquaintance,</I> when they saw him they <I>fled from him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 They durst not harbour him nor give him any assistance, durst not show
 him any countenance, nor so much as be seen in his company, for fear of 
 being brought into trouble by it, now that Saul had proclaimed him a 
 traitor and outlawed him. They saw how dearly Ahimelech the priest had 
 paid for aiding and abetting him, though ignorantly; and therefore, 
 though they could not but own he had a great deal of wrong done him, 
 yet they had not the courage to appear for him.  He was forgotten by 
 them, <I>as a dead man out of mind</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 and looked upon with contempt <I>as a broken vessel.</I> Those that 
 showed him all possible respect when he was in honour at court, now 
 that he had fallen into disgrace, though unjustly, were strange to him. 
 Such swallow-friends the world is full of, that are gone in winter. Let 
 those that fall on the losing side not think it strange if they be thus 
 deserted, but make sure a friend in heaven, that will not fail them, 
 and make use of him.

 4. His enemies were unjust in their censures of him. They would not 
 have persecuted him as they did if they had not first represented him 
 as a bad man; he was a <I>reproach among all his enemies, but 
 especially among his neighbours,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Those that had been the witnesses of his integrity, and could not but 
 be convinced in their consciences that he was an honest man, were the 
 most forward to represent him quite otherwise, that they might curry 
 favour with Saul.  Thus he <I>heard the slander of many;</I> every one 
 had a stone to throw at him, because <I>fear was in every side;</I> 
 that is, they durst not do otherwise, for he that would not join with 
 his neighbours to accuse David was looked upon as disaffected to Saul. 
 Thus the best of men have been represented under the worst characters 
 by those that resolved to give them the worst treatment.

 5. His life was aimed at and he went in continual peril of it. Fear was
 on every side, and he knew that, whatever counsel his enemies took 
 against him, the design was not to take away his liberty, but to take 
 away his life

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 a life so valuable, so useful, to the good services of which all Israel
 owed so much, and which was never forfeited. Thus, in all the plots of 
 the Pharisees and Herodians against Christ, still the design was to 
 take away his life, such are the enmity and cruelty of the serpent's 
 seed.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His confidence in God in the midst of these troubles. Every thing 
 looked black and dismal round about him, and threatened to drive him to 
 despair: "<I>But I trusted in thee, O Lord!</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 and was thereby kept from sinking." His enemies robbed him of his 
 reputation among men, but they could not rob him of his comfort in God, 
 because they could not drive him from his confidence in God. Two things 
 he comforted himself with in his straits, and he went to God and 
 pleaded them with him:--

 1.  "<I>Thou art my God;</I> I have chosen thee for mine, and thou hast
 promised to be mine;" and, if he be ours and we can by faith call him 
 so, it is enough, when we can call nothing else ours. "Thou art my God; 
 and therefore to whom shall I go for relief but to thee?" Those need 
 not be straitened in their prayers who can plead this; for, if God 
 undertake to be our God, he will do that for us which will answer the 
 compass and vast extent of the engagement.

 2. <I>My times are in thy hand.</I> Join this with the former and it 
 makes the comfort complete.  If God have our times in his hand, he can 
 help us; and, if he be our God, he will help us; and then what can 
 discourage us? It is a great support to those who have God for their 
 God that their times are in his hand and he will be sure to order and 
 dispose of them for the best, to all those who commit their spirits 
 also into his hand, to suit them to their times, as David here, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 The time of life is in God's hands, to lengthen or shorten, embitter or
 sweeten, as he pleases, according to the counsel of his will. Our times 
 (all events that concern us, and the timing of them) are at God's 
 disposal; they are not in our own hands, for the way of man is not in 
 himself, not in our friends' hands, nor in our enemies' hands, but in 
 God's; <I>every man's judgment proceedeth from him.</I> David does not, 
 in his prayers, prescribe to God, but subscribe to him. "Lord, my times 
 are in thy hand, and I am well pleased that they are so; they could not 
 be in a better hand. Thy will be done." </P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His petitions to God, in this faith and confidence, 

 1. He prays that God would deliver him out of the hand of his enemies 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),
 
 and save him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 and this for his mercies' sake, and not for any merit of his own. Our 
 opportunities are in God's hand (so some read it), and therefore he
 knows how to choose the best and fittest time for our deliverance, and 
 we must be willing to wait that time.  When David had Saul at his mercy 
 in the cave those about him said, "<I>This is the time</I> in which God 
 will deliver thee,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+24:4">1 Sam. xxiv. 4</A>.

 "No," says David, "the time has not come for my deliverance till it can
 be wrought without sin; and I will wait for that time; for it is God's 
 time, and that is the best time." 

 2. That God would give him the comfort of his favour in the mean time 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 "<I>Make thy face to shine upon thy servant;</I> let me have the
 comfortable tokens and evidences of thy favour to me, and that shall 
 put gladness in my heart in the midst of all my griefs."

 3. That his prayers to God might be answered and his hopes in God
 accomplished 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Let me not be ashamed</I> of my hopes and prayers, <I>for I have 
 called upon thee,</I> who never saidst to thy people, Seek in vain, and 
 hope in vain."

 4. That shame and silence might be the portion of wicked people, and 
 particularly of his enemies.  They were confident of their success 
 against David, and that they should run him down and ruin him. "Lord," 
 says he, "let them be made ashamed of that confidence by the 
 disappointment of their expectations," as those that opposed the 
 building of the wall about Jerusalem, when it was finished, were 
 <I>much cast down in their own eye,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+6:16">Neh. vi. 16</A>.

 <I>Let them be silent in the grave.</I> Note, Death will silence the
 rage and clamour of cruel persecutors, whom reason would not silence. 
 In the grave the wicked cease from troubling.  Particularly, he prays 
 for (that is, he prophesies) the silencing of those that reproach and 
 calumniate the people of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>Let lying lips be put to silence, that speak grievous things proudly 
 and contemptuously against the righteous.</I> This is a very good 
 prayer which,

 (1.) We have often occasion to put up to God; for those that set their
 mouth against the heavens commonly revile the heirs of heaven.  
 Religion, in the strict and serious professors of it, are every where 
 spoken against,

 [1.] With a great deal of malice: They speak <I>grievous things,</I> on 
 purpose to vex them, and hoping, with what they say, to do them a real 
 mischief. They speak <I>hard things</I> (so the word is), which bear
 hard upon them, and by which they hope to fasten indelible characters 
 of infamy upon them. 

 [2.] With a great deal of falsehood: They are <I>lying lips,</I> taught 
 by the father of lies and serving his interest.  

 [3.] With a great deal of scorn and disdain: They speak <I>proudly and 
 contemptuously,</I> as if the righteous, whom God has honoured, were 
 the most despicable people in the world, and not worthy to be set with 
 the dogs of their flock. One would think they thought it no sin to tell 
 a deliberate lie if it might but serve to expose a good man either to 
 hatred or contempt. <I>Hear, O our God! for we are despised.</I> 

 (2.) We may pray in faith; for these lying lips shall be put to 
 silence. God has many ways of doing it. Sometimes he convinces the 
 consciences of those that reproach his people, and turns their hearts. 
 Sometimes by his providence he visibly confutes their calumnies, and 
 brings forth the righteousness of his people as the light. However, 
 there is a day coming when God will convince ungodly sinners of the 
 falsehood of all the hard speeches that have spoken against his people 
 and will execute judgment upon them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14,15">
 Jude 14, 15</A>.

 Then shall this prayer be fully answered, and to that day we should
 have an eye in the singing of it, engaging ourselves likewise by
 well-doing, if possible, to <I>silence the ignorance of foolish
 men,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:15">1 Pet.  ii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have three things in these verses:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The believing acknowledgment which David makes of God's goodness to 
 his people in general, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:19,20"><I>v.</I> 19, 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. God is good to all, but he is, in a special manner, good to Israel.
 His goodness to them is wonderful, and will be, to eternity, matter of 
 admiration: <I>O how great is thy goodness!</I> How profound are the 
 counsels of it! how rich are the treasures of it! how free and 
 extensive are the communications of it! Those very persons whom men 
 load with slanders God loads with benefits and honours. Those who are 
 interested in this goodness are described to be such as fear God and 
 trust in him, as stand in awe of his greatness and rely on his grace. 
 This goodness is said to be <I>laid up for them</I> and <I>wrought for 
 them.</I> 

 (1.) There is a goodness laid up for them in the other world, an 
 inheritance <I>reserved in heaven</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:4">1 Pet. i. 4</A>),

 and there is a goodness wrought for them in this world, goodness
 wrought in them.  There is enough in God's goodness both for the 
 portion and inheritance of all his children when they come to their 
 full age, and for their maintenance and education during their 
 minority.  There is enough in bank and enough in hand. 

 (2.) This goodness is laid up in his promise for all that fear God, to 
 whom assurance is given that they shall want no good thing. But it is 
 wrought, in the actual performance of the promise, for those that trust 
 in him--that by faith take hold of the promise, put it in suit, and 
 draw out to themselves the benefit and comfort of it. If what is laid 
 up for us in the treasures of the everlasting covenant be not wrought 
 for us, it is our own fault, because we do not believe. But those that 
 trust in God, as they have the comfort of his goodness in their own 
 bosoms, so they have the credit of it (and the credit of an estate goes 
 far with some); it is wrought for them <I>before the sons of men.</I> 
 God's goodness to them puts an honour upon them and rolls away their 
 reproach; <I>for all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they 
 are the seed which the Lord hath blessed,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+61:9">Isa.  lxi. 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God preserves man and beast; but he is, in a special manner, the 
 protector of his own people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 <I>Thou shalt hide them.</I> As his goodness is hid and reserved for 
 them, so they are hid and preserved for it. The saints are God's hidden 
 ones.  See here,

 (1.) The danger they are in, which arises from the pride of man and 
 from the strife of tongues; proud men insult over them and would 
 trample on them and tread them down; contentious men pick quarrels with 
 them; and, when tongues are at strife, good people often go by the 
 worst. The pride of men endangers their liberty; the strife of tongues 
 in perverse disputings endangers truth. But, 

 (2.) See the defence they are under: <I>Thou shalt hide them in the 
 secret of thy presence, in a pavilion.</I> God's providence shall keep 
 them safe form the malice of their enemies. He has many ways of 
 sheltering them. When Baruch and Jeremiah were sought for <I>the Lord 
 hid them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+36:36">Jer. xxxvi. 26</A>.

 God's grace shall keep them safe from the evil of the judgments that
 are abroad; to them they have no sting; and they shall be hidden in the
 day of the Lord's anger, for there is no anger at them. His comforts 
 shall keep them easy and cheerful; his sanctuary, where they have 
 communion with him, shelters then from the fiery darts of terror and 
 temptation; and the mansions in his house above shall be shortly, shall 
 be eternally, their hiding-place from all danger and fear.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The thankful returns which David makes for God's goodness to him in 
 particular, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.

 Having admired God's goodness to all the saints, he here owns how good 
 he had found him.

 1. Without were fightings; but God had wonderfully preserved his life: 
 "<I>He has shown me his marvellous loving-kindness,</I> he has given me 
 an instance of his care for me and favour to me, beyond what I could 
 have expected." God's loving-kindness to his people, all things 
 considered, is wonderful; but some instances of it, even in this world, 
 are in a special manner marvelous in their eyes; as this here, when God 
 preserved David from the sword of Saul, in caves and woods, as safe as 
 if he had been in a strong city. In Keilah, that strong city, God 
 showed him great mercy, both in making him an instrument to rescue the 
 inhabitants out of the hands of the Philistines and then in rescuing 
 him from the same men who would have ungratefully delivered him up into 
 the hand of Saul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+23:5,12">1 Sam. xxiii. 5, 12</A>.

 This was marvellous loving-kindness indeed, upon which he writes, with
 wonder and thankfulness, <I>Blessed be the Lord.</I> Special 
 preservations call for particular thanksgivings. 

 2. Within were fears; but God was better to him than his fears, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>.
 
 He here keeps an account,

 (1.) Of his own folly, in distrusting God, which he acknowledges, to 
 his shame. Though he had express promises to build upon, and great 
 experience of God's care concerning him in many straits, yet he had 
 entertained this hard and jealous thought of God, and could not forbear 
 telling it him to his face. "<I>I am cut off before thy eyes;</I> thou 
 hast quite forsaken me, and I must not expect to be looked upon or 
 regarded by thee any more. <I>I shall one day perish by the hand of 
 Saul,</I> and so be cut off before thy eyes, be ruined while thou 
 lookest on,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+27:1">1 Sam. xxvii. 1</A>.

 This he said in his <I>flight</I> (so some read it), which denotes the
 distress of his affairs. Saul was just at his back, and ready to seize 
 him, which made the temptation strong. <I>In my haste</I> (so we read 
 it), which denotes the disturbance and discomposure of his mind, which 
 made the temptation surprising, so that it found him off his guard. 
 Note, It is a common thing to speak amiss when we speak in haste and 
 without consideration; but what we speak amiss in haste we must repent 
 of at leisure, particularly that which we have spoken distrustfully of 
 God.  

 (2.) Of God's wonderful goodness to him notwithstanding. Though his 
 faith failed, God's promise did not: <I>Thou hearest the voice of my 
 supplication,</I> for all this. He mentions his own unbelief as a foil 
 to God's fidelity, serving to make his loving-kindness the more 
 marvellous, the more illustrious. When we have thus distrusted God he 
 might justly take us at our word, and bring our fears upon us, as he 
 did on Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:28,Isa+66:4">Num. xiv. 28; Isa. lxvi. 4</A>.

 But he has pitied and pardoned us, and our unbelief has not made his
 promise and grace of no effect; for he knows our frame.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The exhortation and encouragement which he hereupon gives to all 
 the saints, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:23,24"><I>v.</I> 23, 24</A>.

 1. He would have them set their love on God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:23"><I>v.</I>  23</A>):

 <I>O love the Lord! all you his saints.</I> Those that have their own 
 hearts full of love to God cannot but desire that others also may be in 
 love with him; for in his favour there is no need to fear a rival. It 
 is the character of the saints that they do love God; and yet they must 
 still be called upon to love him, to love him more and love him better, 
 and give proofs of their love. We must love him, not only for his 
 goodness, because <I>he preserves the faithful,</I> but for his 
 justice, because he <I>plentifully rewards the proud doer</I> (who 
 would ruin those whom he preserves), according to their pride.  Some 
 take it in a good sense; he plentifully rewards the magnificent (or 
 excellent) doer, that is daringly good, whose heart, like 
 Jehoshaphat's, is lifted up in the ways of the Lord. He rewards him 
 that does well, but plentifully rewards him that does excellently well.  

 2. He would have them set their hope in God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:24">
 <I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 "<I>Be of good courage;</I> have a good heart on it; whatever 
 difficulties or dangers you may meet with, the God you trust in shall 
 by that trust strengthen your heart." Those that hope in God have 
 reason to be of good courage, and let their hearts be strong, for, as 
 nothing truly evil can befal them, so nothing truly good for them shall 
 be wanting to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this we should animate ourselves and one another to proceed 
 and persevere in our Christian course, whatever threatens us, and 
 whoever frowns upon us.</P>
