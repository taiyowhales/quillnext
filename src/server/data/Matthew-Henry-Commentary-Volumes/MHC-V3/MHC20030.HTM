 This and the following chapter are an appendix to Solomon's proverbs; 
 but they are both expressly called prophecies in the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:1,31:1">first verses of both</A>,

 by which it appears that the penmen of them, whoever they were, were
 divinely inspired. This chapter was penned by one that bears the name 
 of "Agur Ben Jakeh." What tribe he was of, or when he lived, we are not 
 told; what he wrote, being indited by the Holy Ghost, is here kept upon 
 record. We have here,

 I. His confession of faith, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:1-6">ver. 1-6</A>.

 II. His prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:7-9">ver. 7-9</A>.

 III. A caution against wronging servants, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:10">ver. 10</A>.

 IV. Four wicked generations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:11-14">ver. 11-14</A>.

 V. Four things insatiable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>),

 to which is added fair warning to undutiful children, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:17">ver. 17</A>.

 VI. Four things unsearchable,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:18-20">ver. 18-20</A>.

 VII. Four things intolerable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:21-23">ver. 21-23</A>.

 VIII. Four things little and wise,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:24-28">ver. 24-28</A>.

 IX. Four things stately,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:29-33">ver. 29 to the end</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, <I>even</I> the prophecy: the
 man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,
 &nbsp; 2  Surely I <I>am</I> more brutish than <I>any</I> man, and have not the
 understanding of a man.
 &nbsp; 3  I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.
 &nbsp; 4  Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath
 gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a
 garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what
 <I>is</I> his name, and what <I>is</I> his son's name, if thou canst tell?
 &nbsp; 5  Every word of God <I>is</I> pure: he <I>is</I> a shield unto them that
 put their trust in him.
 &nbsp; 6  Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou
 be found a liar.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Some make <I>Agur</I> to be not the name of this author, but his 
 character; he was a <I>collector</I> (so it signifies), a gatherer, one 
 that did not compose things himself, but collected the wise sayings and 
 observations of others, made abstracts of the writings of others, which 
 some think is the reason why he says 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 "<I>I</I> have not <I>learned wisdom</I> myself, but have been a
 scribe, or amanuensis, to other wise and learned men." Note, We must
 not bury our talent, though it be but one, but, as we have received the 
 gift, so minister the same, if it be but to collect what others have 
 written. But we rather suppose it to be his name, which, no doubt, was 
 well known then, though not mentioned elsewhere in scripture. <I>Ithiel 
 and Ucal</I> are mentioned, either, 

 1. As the names of his pupils, whom he instructed, or who consulted him
 as an oracle, having a great opinion of his wisdom and goodness. 
 Probably they wrote from him what he dictated, as Baruch wrote from the 
 mouth of Jeremiah, and by their means it was preserved, as they were 
 ready to attest it to be his, for it was spoken to them; they were two 
 witnesses of it. Or, 

 2. As the subject of his discourse. <I>Ithiel</I> signifies <I>God
 with me,</I> the application of <I>Immanuel, God with us.</I> The word 
 calls him <I>God with us;</I> faith appropriates this, and calls him 
 "<I>God with me,</I> who loved me, and gave himself for me, and into 
 union and communion with whom I am admitted." <I>Ucal</I> signifies 
 <I>the Mighty One,</I> for it is upon one that is mighty that help is 
 laid for us. Many good interpreters therefore apply this to the
 Messiah, for to him all the prophecies bear witness, and why not this 
 then? It is what Agur spoke concerning <I>Ithiel, even</I> concerning 
 <I>Ithiel</I> (that is the name on which the stress is laid) <I>with 
 us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+7:14">Isa. vii. 14</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Three things the prophet here aims at:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To abase himself. Before he makes confession of his faith he makes 
 confession of his folly and the weakness and deficiency of reason, 
 which make it so necessary that we be guided and governed by faith. 
 Before he speaks concerning the Saviour he speaks of himself as needing 
 a Saviour, and as nothing without him; we must go out of ourselves 
 before we go into Jesus Christ. 

 1. He speaks of himself as wanting a righteousness, and having done
 foolishly, very foolishly. When he reflects upon himself he owns, 
 <I>Surely I am more brutish than any man. Every man has become 
 brutish,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:14">Jer. x. 14</A>.

 But he that knows his own heart knows so much more evil of himself than
 he does of any other that he cries out, "<I>Surely</I> I cannot but 
 think that <I>I am more brutish than any man;</I> surely no man has 
 such a corrupt deceitful heart as I have. I have acted as one that has 
 <I>not the understanding</I> of Adam, as one that is wretchedly 
 degenerated from the knowledge and righteousness in which man was at 
 first created; nay, I have not the common sense and reason of a man, 
 else I should not have done as I have done." Agur, when he was applied 
 to by others as wiser than most, acknowledged himself more foolish than 
 any. Whatever high opinion others may have of us, it becomes us to have 
 low thoughts of ourselves.

 2. He speaks of himself as wanting a revelation to guide him in the
 ways of truth and wisdom. He owns

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>)

 "<I>I neither learned wisdom</I> by any power of my own (the depths of
 it cannot be fathomed by my line and plummet) <I>nor know I the 
 knowledge of the holy</I> ones, the angels, our first parents in 
 innocency, nor of the holy things of God; I can get no insight into 
 them, nor make any judgment of them, further than God is pleased to 
 make them known to me." The natural man, the natural powers, perceive 
 not, nay, they <I>receive not, the things of the Spirit of God.</I> 
 Some suppose Agur to be asked, as Apollo's oracle was of old, <I>Who 
 was the wisest man?</I> The answer is, <I>He that is sensible of his 
 own ignorance,</I> especially in divine things. <I>Hoc tantum scio, me 
 nihil scire</I>--<I>All that I know is that I know nothing.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To advance Jesus Christ, and the Father in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Who ascended up into heaven,</I> &c.

 1. Some understand this of God and of his works, which are both
 incomparable and unsearchable. He challenges all mankind to give an 
 account of the heavens above, of the winds, the waters, the earth: "Who 
 can pretend to have <I>ascended up to heaven,</I> to take a view of the 
 orbs above, and then to have descended, to give us a description of 
 them? Who can pretend to have had the command of the winds, to have 
 grasped them in his hand and managed them, as God does, or to have 
 bound the waves of the sea with a swaddling band, as God has done? Who 
 has <I>established the ends of the earth,</I> or can describe the 
 strength of its foundations or the extent of its limits? Tell me what 
 is <I>the man's name</I> who can undertake to vie with God or to be of 
 his cabinet-council, or, if he be dead, what is his name to whom he has 
 bequeathed this great secret." 

 2. Others refer it to Christ, to Ithiel and Ucal, the Son of God, for
 it is the Son's name, as well as the Father's, that is here enquired 
 after, and a challenge given to any to vie with him. We must now exalt 
 Christ as one revealed; they then magnified him as one concealed, as 
 one they had heard something of but had very dark and defective ideas 
 of. <I>We have heard the fame of him with our ears,</I> but cannot 
 describe him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+28:22">Job xxviii. 22</A>);

 certainly it is God that has <I>gathered the wind in his fists</I> and
 <I>bound the waters as in a garment;</I> but <I>what is his name?</I> 
 It is, <I>I am that I am</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:14">Exod. iii. 14</A>),

 a name to be adored, not to be understood. What is <I>his Son's
 name,</I> by whom he does all these things? The Old-Testament saints 
 expected the Messiah to be the <I>Son of the Blessed,</I> and he is 
 here spoken of as a person distinct from the Father, but his name as 
 yet secret. Note, The great Redeemer, in the glories of his providence 
 and grace, can neither be paralleled nor found out to perfection.

 (1.) The glories of the kingdom of his grace are unsearchable and
 unparalleled; for who besides has <I>ascended into heaven and 
 descended?</I> Who besides is perfectly acquainted with both worlds, 
 and has himself a free correspondence with both, and is therefore fit 
 to settle a correspondence between them, as Mediator, as Jacob's 
 ladder? He was <I>in heaven</I> in the <I>Father's bosom</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+1:1,18">John i. 1, 18</A>);

 thence he descended to take our nature upon him; and never was there
 such condescension. In that nature he again ascended

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:9">Eph. iv. 9</A>),

 to receive the promised glories of his exalted state; and who besides
 has done this? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+10:6">Rom. x. 6</A>.

 (2.) The glories of the kingdom of his providence are likewise
 unsearchable and unparalleled. The same that reconciles heaven and 
 earth was the Creator of both and governs and disposes of all. His 
 government of the three lower elements of <I>air, water,</I> and 
 <I>earth,</I> is here particularized. 

 [1.] The motions of the air are of his directing. Satan pretends to be
 <I>the prince of the power of the air,</I> but even there Christ has 
 <I>all power;</I> he <I>rebuked the winds</I> and they obeyed him. 

 [2.] The bounds of the water are of his appointing: He <I>binds the
 waters as in a garment; hitherto they shall come, and no further,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:9-11">Job xxxviii. 9-11</A>.

 [3.] The foundations of the earth are of his establishing. He founded
 it at first; he upholds it still. If Christ had not interposed, the 
 foundations of the earth would have sunk under the load of the curse 
 upon the ground, for man's sin. Who and what is the mighty He that does 
 all this? We cannot <I>find out God,</I> nor the <I>Son of God, unto 
 perfection. Oh the depth of that knowledge!</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. To assure us of the truth of the word of God, and to recommend it 
 to us, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>.

 Agur's pupils expect to be instructed by him in the things of God.
 "Alas!" says he, "I cannot undertake to instruct you; go to the word of 
 God; see what he has there revealed of himself, and of his mind and 
 will; you need know no more than what that will teach you, and that you 
 may rely upon as sure and sufficient. <I>Every word of God is pure;</I> 
 there is not the least mixture of falsehood and corruption in it." The 
 words of men are to be heard and read with jealousy and with allowance, 
 but there is not the least ground to suspect any deficiency in the word 
 of God; it is <I>as silver purified seven times</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+12:6">Ps. xii. 6</A>),

 without the least dross or alloy. <I>Thy word is very pure,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:140">Ps. cxix. 140</A>.

 1. It is sure, and therefore we must trust to it and venture our souls
 upon it. God in his word, God in his promise, is <I>a shield,</I> a 
 sure protection, to all those that put themselves under his protection 
 and <I>put their trust in him.</I> The word of God, applied by faith, 
 will make us easy in the midst of the greatest dangers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+46:1,2">Ps. xlvi. 1, 2</A>.

 2. It is sufficient, and therefore we must not add to it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>Add thou not unto his words,</I> because they are pure and perfect.
 This forbids the advancing of any thing, not only in contradiction to 
 the word of God, but in competition with it; though it be under the 
 plausible pretence of explaining it, yet, if it pretend to be of equal 
 authority with it, it is <I>adding to his words,</I> which is not only 
 a reproach to them as insufficient, but opens a door to all manner of 
 errors and corruptions; for, that one absurdity being granted, that the 
 word of any man, or company of men, is to be received with the same 
 faith and veneration as the word of God, a thousand follow. We must be 
 content with what God has thought fit to make known to us of his mind, 
 and not covet to be <I>wise above what is written;</I> for,

 (1.) God will resent it as a heinous affront: "<I>He</I> will
 <I>reprove thee,</I> will reckon with thee as a traitor against his 
 crown and dignity, and lay thee under the heavy doom of those that add 
 to his words, or diminish from them," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+4:2,12:32">Deut. iv. 2; xii. 32</A>.

 (2.) We shall run ourselves into endless mistakes: "Thou wilt be found
 a liar, a corrupter of the word of truth, a broacher of heresies, and 
 guilty of the worst of forgeries, counterfeiting the broad seal of 
 heaven, and pretending a divine mission and inspiration, when it is all 
 a cheat. Men may be thus deceived, but <I>God is not mocked.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Two <I>things</I> have I required of thee; deny me <I>them</I> not
 before I die:
 &nbsp; 8  Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty
 nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:
 &nbsp; 9  Lest I be full, and deny <I>thee,</I> and say, Who <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>?
 or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God <I>in
 vain.</I>
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 After Agur's confession and creed, here follows his litany, where we 
 may observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The preface to his prayer: <I>Two things have I required</I> (that 
 is, <I>requested</I>) of thee, O God! Before we go to pray it is good 
 to consider what we need, and what the things are which we have to ask 
 of God.--What does our case require? What do our hearts desire? What
 would we that God should do for us?--that we may not have to seek for
 our petition and request when we should be presenting it. He begs, 
 <I>Deny me not before I die.</I> In praying, we should think of dying, 
 and pray accordingly. "Lord, give me pardon, and peace, and grace,
 before I die, <I>before I go hence and be no more;</I> for, if I be not 
 renewed and sanctified before I die, the work will not be done after; 
 if I do not prevail in prayer before I die, prayers afterwards will not 
 prevail, no, not <I>Lord, Lord.</I> There is none of this wisdom or 
 working in the grave. <I>Deny me not</I> thy grace, for, if thou do, I 
 die, I perish; if thou be silent to me, <I>I am like those that go down 
 to the pit,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+28:1">Ps. xxviii. 1</A>.

 <I>Deny me not before I die;</I> as long as I continue in the land of
 the living, let me continue under the conduct of thy grace and good 
 providence."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The prayer itself. The <I>two things</I> he requires are grace 
 sufficient and food convenient. 

 1. Grace sufficient for his soul: "<I>Remove from me vanity and
 lies;</I> deliver me from sin, from all corrupt principles, practices, 
 and affections, from error and mistake, which are at the bottom of all 
 sin, from the love of the world and the things of it, which are all 
 <I>vanity and a lie.</I>" Some understand it as a prayer for the pardon 
 of sin, for, when God forgives sin, he removes it, he takes it away. 
 Or, rather, it is a prayer of the same import with that, <I>Lead us not 
 into temptation.</I> Nothing is more mischievous to us than sin, and 
 therefore there is nothing which we should more earnestly pray against 
 than that we may <I>do no evil.</I> 

 2. Food convenient for his body. Having prayed for the operations of
 divine grace, he here begs the favours of the divine Providence, but 
 such as may tend to the good and not to the prejudice of the soul.

 (1.) He prays that of God's free gift he might receive a competent
 portion of the good things of this life: "<I>Feed me with the bread of 
 my allowance,</I> such bread as thou thinkest fit to allow me." As to 
 all the gifts of the divine Providence, we must refer ourselves to the 
 divine wisdom. Or, "<I>the bread that is fit for me,</I> as a man, a 
 master of a family, that which is agreeable to my rank and condition in 
 the world." For <I>as is the man so is his competency.</I> Our Saviour 
 seems to refer to this when he teaches us to pray, <I>Give us this day 
 our daily bread,</I> as this seems to refer to Jacob's vow, in which he 
 wished for no more than <I>bread to eat and raiment to put on.</I> Food 
 convenient for us is what we ought to be content with, though we have 
 not dainties, varieties, and superfluities--what is for necessity, 
 though we have not for delight and ornament; and it is what we may in 
 faith pray for and depend upon God for.

 (2.) He prays that he may be kept from every condition of life that
 would be a temptation to him.

 [1.] He prays against the extremes of abundance and want: <I>Give me
 neither poverty nor riches.</I> He does not hereby prescribe to God, 
 nor pretend to teach him what condition he shall allot to him, nor does 
 he pray against poverty or riches absolutely, as in themselves evil, 
 for either of them, by the grace of God, may be sanctified and be a 
 means of good to us; but, <I>First,</I> He hereby intends to express 
 the value which wise and good men have for a middle state of life, and, 
 with submission to the will of God, desires that that might be his 
 state, neither great honour nor great contempt. We must learn how to 
 manage both (as St. Paul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:12">Phil. iv. 12</A>),

 but rather wish to be always between both. <I>Optimus pecuni&aelig;
 modus qui nec in paupertatem cedit nec procul &agrave; paupertate
 discedit--The best condition is that which neither implies poverty nor 
 yet recedes far from it.</I> Seneca. <I>Secondly,</I> He hereby
 intimates a holy jealousy he had of himself, that he could not keep his 
 ground against the temptations either of an afflicted or a prosperous 
 condition. Others may preserve their integrity in either, but he is 
 afraid of both, and therefore grace teaches him to pray against riches 
 as much as nature against poverty; but <I>the will of the Lord be 
 done.</I> 

 [2.] He gives a pious reason for his prayer, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 He does not say, "<I>Lest I be rich,</I> and cumbered with care, and
 envied by my neighbours, and eaten up with a multitude of servants, or, 
 <I>lest I be poor</I> and trampled on, and forced to work hard and fare 
 hard;" but, "<I>Lest I be rich</I> and sin, or <I>poor</I> and sin." 
 Sin is that which a good man is afraid of in every condition and under 
 every event; witness Nehemiah

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:13"><I>ch.</I> vi. 13</A>),
 
 <I>that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin. First,</I> He dreads
 the temptations of a prosperous condition, and therefore even 
 deprecates that: <I>Lest I be full and deny thee</I> (as Jeshurun, who 
 <I>waxed fat and kicked,</I> and <I>forsook God who made him,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+32:15">Deut. xxxii. 15</A>),

 and say, as Pharaoh in his pride, <I>Who is the Lord, that I should
 obey his voice?</I> Prosperity makes people proud and forgetful of God, 
 as if they had no need of him and were therefore under no obligation to 
 him. <I>What can the Almighty do for them?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:17">Job xxii. 17</A>.

 And therefore they will do nothing for him. Even good men are afraid of
 the worst sins, so deceitful do they think their own hearts to be; and 
 they know that the greatest gains of the world will not balance the 
 least guilt. <I>Secondly,</I> He dreads the temptations of a poor 
 condition, and for that reason, and no other, deprecates that: <I>Lest 
 I be poor and steal.</I> Poverty is a strong temptation to dishonesty, 
 and such as many are overcome by, and they are ready to think it will 
 be their excuse; but it will not bear them out at God's bar any more 
 than at men's to say, "I stole because I was poor;" yet, if a man 
 <I>steal for the satisfying of his soul when he is hungry,</I> it is a 
 case of compassion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:30"><I>ch.</I> vi. 30</A>)

 and what even those that have some principles of honesty in them may be
 drawn to. But observe why Agur dreads this, not because he should 
 endanger himself by it, "Lest I steal, and be hanged for it, whipped or 
 put in the stocks, or sold for a bondman," as among the Jews poor 
 thieves were, who had not wherewithal to make restitution; but lest he 
 should dishonour God by it: "<I>Lest I should steal, and take the name 
 of my God in vain,</I> that is, discredit my profession of religion by 
 practices disagreeable to it." Or, "Lest I steal, and, when I am 
 charged with it, forswear myself." He <I>therefore</I> dreads one sin, 
 because it would draw on another, for the way of sin is downhill. 
 Observe, He calls God <I>his God,</I> and <I>therefore</I> he is afraid 
 of doing any thing to offend him because of the relation he stands in 
 to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee,
 and thou be found guilty.
 &nbsp; 11  <I>There is</I> a generation <I>that</I> curseth their father, and
 doth not bless their mother.
 &nbsp; 12  <I>There is</I> a generation <I>that are</I> pure in their own eyes,
 and <I>yet</I> is not washed from their filthiness.
 &nbsp; 13  <I>There is</I> a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and
 their eyelids are lifted up.
 &nbsp; 14  <I>There is</I> a generation, whose teeth <I>are as</I> swords, and
 their jaw teeth <I>as</I> knives, to devour the poor from off the
 earth, and the needy from <I>among</I> men.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. A caution not to abuse other people's servants any more than our 
 own, nor to make mischief between them and their masters, for it is an 
 ill office, invidious, and what will make a man odious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.
 
 Consider,

 1. It is an injury to the servant, whose poor condition makes him an
 object of pity, and therefore it is barbarous to add affliction to him 
 that is afflicted: <I>Hurt not a servant with thy tongue</I> (so the 
 margin reads it); for it argues a sordid disposition to smite any body 
 secretly with the scourge of the tongue, especially a servant, who is 
 not a match for us, and whom we should rather protect, if his master be 
 severe with him, than exasperate him more. 

 2. "It will perhaps be an injury to thyself. If a servant be thus
 provoked, perhaps he will curse thee, will accuse thee and bring thee 
 into trouble, or give thee an ill word and blemish thy reputation, or 
 appeal to God against thee, and imprecate <I>his</I> wrath upon thee, 
 who is the patron and protector of oppressed innocency."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An account, upon occasion of this caution, of some wicked 
 generations of men, that are justly abominable to all that are virtuous 
 and good. 

 1. Such as are abusive to their parents, give them bad language and
 wish them ill, call them bad names and actually injure them. <I>There 
 is a generation</I> of such; young men of that black character commonly 
 herd together, and irritate one another against their parents. A 
 <I>generation of vipers</I> those are who curse their natural parents, 
 or their magistrates, or their ministers, because they cannot endure 
 the yoke; and those are near of kin to them who, though they have not 
 yet arrived at such a pitch of wickedness as to curse their parents, 
 yet do not bless them, cannot give them a good word, and will not pray 
 for them. 

 2. Such as are conceited of themselves, and, under a show and pretence
 of sanctity, hide from others, and perhaps from themselves too, 
 abundance of reigning wickedness in secret

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 they are <I>pure in their own eyes,</I> as if they were in all respects
 such as they should be. They have a very good opinion of themselves and 
 their own character, that they are not only righteous, but <I>rich and 
 increased with goods</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:17">Rev. iii. 17</A>),

 and yet <I>are not cleansed from their filthiness,</I> the filthiness
 of their hearts, which they pretend to be the best part of them. They 
 are, it may be, swept and garnished, but they are not washed, nor 
 sanctified; as the Pharisees that within were <I>full of all 
 uncleanness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+23:25,26">Matt. xxiii. 25, 26</A>.

 3. Such as are haughty and scornful to those about them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 He speaks of them with amazement at their intolerable pride and 
 insolence: "<I>Oh how lofty are their eyes!</I> With what disdain do 
 they look upon their neighbours, as not worthy to be set with the dogs 
 of their flock! What a distance do they expect every body should keep; 
 and, when they look upon themselves, how do they strut and vaunt like 
 the peacock, thinking they make themselves illustrious when really they 
 make themselves ridiculous!" There is a generation of such, on whom he 
 that <I>resists the proud</I> will pour contempt. 

 4. Such as are cruel to the poor and barbarous to all that lie at their
 mercy

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>);

 their teeth are iron and steel, <I>swords and knives,</I> instruments
 of cruelty, with which they <I>devour the poor</I> with the greatest 
 pleasure imaginable, and as greedily as hungry men cut their meat and 
 eat it. God has so ordered it that the <I>poor we shall always have 
 with us,</I> that they shall <I>never cease out of the land;</I> but 
 there are those who, because they hate to relieve them, would, if they 
 could, abolish them <I>from the earth, from among men,</I> especially 
 God's poor. Some understand it of those who wound and ruin others by
 slanders and false accusations, and severe censures of their
 everlasting state; their tongues, and their teeth too (which are
 likewise organs of speech), are <I>as swords and knives,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  The horseleach hath two daughters, <I>crying,</I> Give, give.
 There are three <I>things that</I> are never satisfied, <I>yea,</I> four
 <I>things</I> say not, <I>It is</I> enough:
 &nbsp; 16  The grave; and the barren womb; the earth <I>that</I> is not
 filled with water; and the fire <I>that</I> saith not, <I>It is</I> enough.
 &nbsp; 17  The eye <I>that</I> mocketh at <I>his</I> father, and despiseth to
 obey <I>his</I> mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
 and the young eagles shall eat it.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 He had spoken before of those that devoured the poor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 and had spoken of them last, as the worst of all the four generations
 there mentioned; now here he speaks of their insatiableness in doing 
 this. The temper that puts them upon it is made up of cruelty and
 covetousness. Now those are <I>two daughters</I> of the 
 <I>horse-leech,</I> its genuine offspring, that still cry, "<I>Give, 
 give,</I> give more blood, give more money;" for the bloody are still 
 blood-thirsty; being drunk with blood, they add thirst to their 
 drunkenness, and will seek it yet again. Those also that <I>love 
 silver</I> shall never <I>be satisfied with silver.</I> Thus, while 
 from these two principles they are devouring the poor, they are 
 continually uneasy to themselves, as David's enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+59:14,15">Ps. lix. 14, 15</A>.
 
 Now, for the further illustration of this,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He specifies four other things which are insatiable, to which those 
 devourers are compared, which say not, <I>It is enough,</I> or <I>It is 
 wealth.</I> Those are never rich that are always coveting. Now these 
 four things that are always craving are, 

 1. The grave, into which multitudes fall, and yet still more will fall,
 and it swallows them all up, and returns none, <I>Hell and destruction 
 are never full,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:20"><I>ch.</I> xxvii. 20</A>.
 
 When it comes to our turn we shall find the grave ready for us,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+17:1">Job xvii. 1</A>.

 2. The <I>barren womb,</I> which is impatient of its affliction in
 being barren, and cries, as Rachel did, <I>Give me children.</I> 

 3. The <I>parched ground</I> in time of drought (especially in those
 hot countries), which still soaks in the rain that comes in abundance 
 upon it and in a little time wants more. 

 4. The <I>fire,</I> which, when it has consumed abundance of fuel, yet
 still devours all the combustible matter that is thrown into it. So 
 insatiable are the corrupt desires of sinners, and so little 
 satisfaction have they even in the gratification of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He adds a terrible threatening to disobedient children 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 for warning to the first of those four wicked generations, that curse
 their parents

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and shows here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Who they are that belong to that generation, not only those that 
 curse their parents in heat and passion, but, 

 (1.) Those that <I>mock</I> at them, though it be but with a scornful
 eye, looking with disdain upon them because of their bodily 
 infirmities, or looking sour or dogged at them when they instruct or 
 command, impatient at their checks and angry at them. God takes notice 
 with what eye children look upon their parents, and will reckon for the 
 leering look and the casts of the evil eye as well as for the bad 
 language given them.

 (2.) Those that <I>despise to obey</I> them, that think it a thing
 below them to be dutiful to their parents, especially to the 
 <I>mother,</I> they scorn to be controlled by her; and thus she that 
 bore them in sorrow in greater sorrow bears their manners.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. What their doom will be. Those that dishonour their parents shall be 
 set up as monuments of God's vengeance; they shall be hanged in chains, 
 as it were, for the birds of prey to pick out their eyes, those eyes 
 with which they looked so scornfully on their good parents. The dead 
 bodies of malefactors were not to hang all night, but before night the 
 ravens would have picked out their eyes. If men do not punish undutiful 
 children, God will, and will load those with the greatest infamy that 
 conduct themselves haughtily towards their parents. Many who have come 
 to an ignominious end have owned that the wicked courses that brought 
 them to it began in a contempt of their parents' authority.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>18  There be three <I>things which</I> are too wonderful for me, yea,
 four which I know not:
 &nbsp; 19  The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a
 rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a
 man with a maid.
 &nbsp; 20  Such <I>is</I> the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and
 wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.
 &nbsp; 21  For three <I>things</I> the earth is disquieted, and for four
 <I>which</I> it cannot bear:
 &nbsp; 22  For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled
 with meat;
 &nbsp; 23  For an odious <I>woman</I> when she is married; and an handmaid
 that is heir to her mistress.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. An account of four things that are unsearchable, <I>too 
 wonderful</I> to be fully known. And here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The first three are natural things, and are only designed as 
 comparisons for the illustration of the last. We cannot trace, 

 (1.) <I>An eagle in the air.</I> Which way she has flown cannot be
 discovered either by the footstep or by the scent, as the way of a 
 beast may upon ground; nor can we account for the wonderful swiftness 
 of her flight, how soon she has gone beyond our ken.

 (2.) <I>A serpent upon a rock.</I> The way of a serpent in the sand we
 may find by the track, but not of a serpent upon the hard rock; nor can 
 we describe how a serpent will, without feet, in a little time creep to 
 the top of a rock.

 (3.) <I>A ship in the midst of the sea.</I> The leviathan indeed
 <I>makes a path to shine after him, one would think the deep to be 
 hoary</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+41:32">Job xli. 32</A>),

 but a ship leaves no mark behind it, and sometimes it is so tossed upon
 the waves that one would wonder how it lives at sea and gains its 
 point. The kingdom of nature is full of wonders, marvellous things 
 which the God of nature does, <I>past finding out.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The fourth is a mystery of iniquity, more unaccountable than any of 
 these; it belongs to the depths of Satan, that deceitfulness and that 
 desperate wickedness of the heart which none can know, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+17:9">Jer. xvii. 9</A>.

 It is twofold:--

 (1.) The cursed arts which a vile adulterer has to debauch a maid, and
 to persuade her to yield to his wicked and abominable lust. This is
 what a wanton poet wrote a whole book of, long since, <I>De arte 
 amandi--On the art of love.</I> By what pretensions and protestations 
 of love, and all its powerful charms, promises of marriage, assurances 
 of secresy and reward, is many an unwary virgin brought to sell her 
 virtue, and honour, and peace, and soul, and all to a base traitor; for 
 so all sinful lust is in the kingdom of love. The more artfully the 
 temptation is managed the more watchful and resolute ought every pure 
 heart to be against it.

 (2.) The cursed arts which a vile adulteress has to conceal her
 wickedness, especially from her husband, from whom she treacherously 
 departs; so close are her intrigues with her lewd companions, and so 
 craftily disguised, that it is as impossible to discover her as to 
 track an <I>eagle in the air.</I> She eats the forbidden fruit, after 
 the similitude of Adam's transgression, and then <I>wipes her 
 mouth,</I> that it may not betray itself, and with a bold and impudent 
 face says, <I>I have done no wickedness.</I> 

 [1.] To the world she denies the fact, and is ready to swear it that
 she is as chaste and modest as any woman, and never did the wickedness 
 she is suspected of. Those are the works of darkness which are
 industriously kept from coming to the light. 

 [2.] To her own conscience (if she have any left) she denies the fault,
 and will not own that that <I>great wickedness</I> is any wickedness at 
 all, but an innocent entertainment. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+12:7,8">Hos. xii. 7, 8</A>.

 Thus multitudes ruin their souls by calling evil good and out-facing
 their convictions with a self-justification.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An account of four things that are intolerable, that is, four sorts 
 of persons that are very troublesome to the places where they live and 
 the relations and companies they are in; the earth is <I>disquieted for 
 them,</I> and groans under them as a burden it cannot bear, and they 
 are all much alike:--

 1. <I>A servant</I> when he is advanced, and entrusted with power, who
 is, of all others, most insolent and imperious; witness Tobiah the 
 servant, the Ammonite, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ne+2:10">Neh. ii. 10</A>.

 2. <I>A fool,</I> a silly, rude, boisterous, vicious man, who when he
 has grown rich, and is partaking of the pleasures of the table, will 
 disturb all the company with his extravagant talk and the affronts he 
 will put upon those about him. 

 3. An ill-natured, cross-grained, <I>woman,</I> when she gets a
 husband, one who, having made herself odious by her pride and sourness, 
 so that one would not have thought any body would ever love her, yet, 
 if at last she be married, that honourable estate makes her more 
 intolerably scornful and spiteful than ever. It is a pity that that 
 which should sweeten the disposition should have a contrary effect. A 
 gracious woman, when she is married, will be yet more obliging. 

 4. An old maid-servant that has prevailed with her mistress, by
 humouring her, and, as we say, getting the length of her foot, to leave 
 her what she has, or is as dear to her as if she was to be her heir, 
 such a one likewise will be intolerably proud and malicious, and think 
 all too little that her mistress gives her, and herself wronged if any 
 thing be left from her. Let those therefore whom Providence has 
 advanced to honour from mean beginnings carefully watch against that 
 sin which will most easily beset them, pride and haughtiness, which 
 will in them, of all others, be most insufferable and inexcusable; and 
 let them humble themselves with the remembrance of the rock out of 
 which they were hewn.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>24  There be four <I>things which are</I> little upon the earth, but
 they <I>are</I> exceeding wise:
 &nbsp; 25  The ants <I>are</I> a people not strong, yet they prepare their
 meat in the summer;
 &nbsp; 26  The conies <I>are but</I> a feeble folk, yet make they their
 houses in the rocks;
 &nbsp; 27  The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by
 bands;
 &nbsp; 28  The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings'
 palaces.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Agur, having specified four things that seem great and yet are 
 really contemptible, here specifies four things that are little and yet 
 are very admirable, great in miniature, in which, as bishop Patrick 
 observes, he teaches us several good lessons; as, 

 1. Not to admire bodily bulk, or beauty, or strength, nor to value
 persons or think the better of them for such advantages, but to judge 
 of men by their wisdom and conduct, their industry and application to 
 business, which are characters that deserve respect. 

 2. To admire the wisdom and power of the Creator in the smallest and
 most despicable animals, in an ant as much as in an elephant. 

 3. To blame ourselves who do not act so much for our own true interest
 as the meanest creatures do for theirs. 

 4. Not to despise the weak things of the world; there are those that
 are <I>little upon the earth,</I> poor in the world and of small 
 account, and yet <I>are exceedingly wise,</I> wise for their souls and 
 another world, and those <I>are exceedingly wise, wiser than their 
 neighbours.</I> Margin, <I>They are wise, made wise</I> by the special 
 instinct of nature. All that are wise to salvation are made wise by the 
 grace of God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Those he specifies are, 

 1. The <I>ants,</I> minute animals and very weak, and yet they are very
 industrious in gathering proper food, and have a strange sagacity to do 
 it in the summer, the proper time. This is so great a piece of wisdom 
 that we may learn of them to be wise for futurity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+6:6"><I>ch.</I> vi. 6</A>.

 When the ravening <I>lions lack, and suffer hunger,</I> the laborious
 ants have plenty, and know no want. 

 2. The <I>conies,</I> or, as some rather understand it, the Arabian
 mice, field mice, weak creatures, and very timorous, yet they have so 
 much wisdom as to <I>make their houses in the rocks,</I> where they are 
 well guarded, and their feebleness makes them take shelter in those 
 natural fastnesses and fortifications. Sense of our own indigence and
 weakness should drive us to him that is a <I>rock higher than we</I> 
 for shelter and support; there let us make our habitation. 

 3. The <I>locusts;</I> they are little also, and <I>have no king,</I>
 as the bees have, but <I>they go forth all of them by bands,</I> like 
 an army in battle-array; and, observing such good order among 
 themselves, it is not any inconvenience to them that they <I>have no 
 king.</I> They are called God's <I>great army</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joe+2:25">Joel ii. 25</A>);

 for, when he pleases, he musters, he marshals them, and wages war by
 them, as he did upon Egypt. <I>They go forth all of them gathered
 together</I> (so the margin); sense of weakness should engage us to 
 keep together, that we may strengthen the hands of one another.

 4. The <I>spider,</I> an insect, but as great an instance of industry
 in our houses as the ants are in the field. Spiders are very ingenious 
 in weaving their webs with a fineness and exactness such as no art can 
 pretend to come near: They <I>take hold with their hands,</I> and spin 
 a fine thread out of their own bowels, with a great deal of art; and 
 they are not only in poor men's cottages, but in <I>kings' palaces,</I> 
 notwithstanding all the care that is there taken to destroy them.
 Providence wonderfully keeps up those kinds of creatures, not only 
 which men provide not for, but which every man's hand is against and 
 seeks the destruction of. Those that will mind their business, and 
 <I>take hold</I> of it <I>with their hands,</I> shall be <I>in kings' 
 palaces;</I> sooner or later, they will get preferment, and may go on 
 with it, notwithstanding the difficulties and discouragements they meet 
 with. If one well-spun web be swept away, it is but making another.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>29  There be three <I>things</I> which go well, yea, four are comely
 in going:
 &nbsp; 30  A lion <I>which is</I> strongest among beasts, and turneth not
 away for any;
 &nbsp; 31  A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom
 <I>there is</I> no rising up.
 &nbsp; 32  If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if
 thou hast thought evil, <I>lay</I> thine hand upon thy mouth.
 &nbsp; 33  Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the
 wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of
 wrath bringeth forth strife.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. An enumeration of four things which are majestic and stately in 
 their going, which look great:--

 1. <I>A lion,</I> the king of beasts, because <I>strongest among
 beasts.</I> Among beasts it is strength that gives the pre-eminence, 
 but it is a pity that it should do so among men, whose <I>wisdom</I> is 
 their honour, not their <I>strength</I> and <I>force.</I> The lion 
 <I>turns not away,</I> nor alters his pace, for fear of any pursuers, 
 since he knows he is too hard for them. Herein <I>the righteous are 
 bold as a lion,</I> that they <I>turn not away</I> from their duty for 
 fear of any difficulty they meet with in it. 

 2. <I>A greyhound</I> that is girt in the loins and fit for running;
 or (as the margin reads it) <I>a horse,</I> which ought not to be 
 omitted among the creatures that <I>are comely in going,</I> for so he 
 is, especially when he is dressed up in his harness or trappings. 

 3. <I>A he-goat,</I> the comeliness of whose going is when he goes
 first and leads the flock. It is the comeliness of a Christian's going 
 to go first in a good work and to lead others in the right way. 

 4. <I>A king,</I> who, when he appears in his majesty, is looked upon
 with reverence and awe, and all agree that <I>there is no rising up 
 against</I> him; none can vie with him, none can contend with him, 
 whoever does it, it is at his peril. And, if <I>there is no rising 
 up</I> against an earthly prince, <I>woe to him</I> then <I>that 
 strives with his Maker.</I> It is intended that we should learn courage 
 and fortitude in all virtuous actions from the <I>lion</I> and <I>not 
 to turn away for any</I> difficulty we meet with; from the 
 <I>greyhound</I> we may learn quickness and despatch, from the 
 <I>he-goat</I> the care of our family and those under our charge, and 
 from <I>a king</I> to have our children in subjection with all gravity, 
 and from them all to <I>go well,</I> and to order the steps of our 
 conversation so as that we may not only be safe, but <I>comely, in 
 going.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. A caution to us to keep our temper at all times and under all 
 provocations, and to take heed of carrying our resentments too far upon 
 any occasion, especially when there is <I>a king</I> in the case, 
 <I>against whom there is no rising up,</I> when it is a ruler, or one 
 much our superior, that is offended; nay, the rule is always the 
 same.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. We must bridle and suppress our own passion, and take shame to 
 ourselves, whenever we are justly charged with a fault, and not insist 
 upon our own innocency: If we have <I>lifted up ourselves,</I> either 
 in a proud conceit of ourselves or a peevish opposition to those that 
 are over us, if we have transgressed the laws of our place and station, 
 we have therein <I>done foolishly.</I> Those that magnify themselves 
 over others or against others, that are haughty and insolent, do but 
 shame themselves and betray their own weakness. Nay, if we have but 
 <I>thought evil,</I> if we are conscious to ourselves that we have 
 harboured an ill design in our minds, or it has been suggested to us, 
 we must <I>lay our hand upon our mouth,</I> that is,

 (1.) We must humble ourselves for what we have done amiss, and even lie
 in the dust before God, in sorrow for it, as Job did, when he repented
 of what he had said foolishly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+40:4"><I>ch.</I> xl. 4</A>,

 <I>I will lay my hand upon my mouth</I>), and as the convicted leper,
 who <I>put a covering upon his upper lip.</I> If we have <I>done 
 foolishly,</I> we must not stand to it before men, but by silence own 
 our guilt, which will be the best way of appeasing those we have 
 offended. 

 2. We must keep the evil thought we have conceived in our minds from
 breaking out in any evil speeches. Do not give the evil thought an 
 <I>imprimatur--a license;</I> allow it not to be published; but <I>lay 
 thy hand upon thy mouth;</I> use a holy violence with thyself, if need 
 be, and enjoin thyself silence; as Christ <I>suffered not the evil 
 spirits to speak.</I> It is bad to think ill, but it is much worse to 
 speak it, for that implies a consent to the evil thought and a 
 willingness to infect others with it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. We must not irritate the passions of others. Some are so very 
 provoking in their words and conduct that they even <I>force wrath,</I> 
 they make those about them angry whether they will or no, and put those 
 into a passion who are not only not inclined to it, but resolved 
 against it. Now this <I>forcing of wrath brings forth strife,</I> and 
 where that <I>is there is confusion and every evil work.</I> As the 
 violent agitation of the cream fetches all the good out of the milk,
 and the hard <I>wringing of the nose</I> will extort blood from it, so 
 this <I>forcing of wrath</I> wastes both the body and spirits of a man, 
 and robs him of all the good that is in him. Or, as it is in <I>the 
 churning of milk and the wringing of the nose, that</I> is done by 
 force which otherwise would not be done, so the spirit is heated by 
 degrees with strong passions; one angry word begets another, and that a 
 third; one passionate debate makes work for another, and so it goes on 
 till it ends at length in irreconcilable feuds. Let nothing therefore
 be said or done with violence, but every thing with softness and 
 calmness.</P>
