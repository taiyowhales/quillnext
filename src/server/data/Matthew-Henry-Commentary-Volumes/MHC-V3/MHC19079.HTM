 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm, if penned with any particular event in view, is with most 
 probability made to refer to the destruction of Jerusalem and the 
 temple, and the woeful havoc made of the Jewish nation by the Chaldeans 
 under Nebuchadnezzar. It is set to the same tune, as I may say, with 
 the Lamentations of Jeremiah, and that weeping prophet borrows two 
 verses out of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:6,7">ver. 6, 7</A>)

 and makes use of them in his prayer,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+10:25">Jer. x. 25</A>.

 Some think it was penned long before by the spirit of prophecy,
 prepared for the use of the church in that cloudy and dark day. Others
 think that it was penned then by the spirit of prayer, either by a
 prophet named Asaph or by some other prophet for the sons of Asaph.
 Whatever the particular occasion was, we have here,

 I. A representation of the very deplorable condition that the people of
 God were in at this time,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. A petition to God for succour and relief, that their enemies might
 be reckoned with 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:6,7,10,12">ver. 6, 7, 10, 12</A>),

 that their sins might be pardoned

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>),

 and that they might be delivered,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:11">ver. 11</A>.

 III. A plea taken from the readiness of his people to praise him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:13">ver. 13</A>.

 In times of the church's peace and prosperity this psalm may, in the 
 singing of it, give us occasion to bless God that we are not thus 
 trampled on and insulted. But it is especially seasonable in a day of
 treading down and perplexity, for the exciting of our desires towards 
 God and the encouragement of our faith in him as the church's 
 patron.</P>

 <P>A psalm of Asaph.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O God, the heathen are come into thine
 inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid
 Jerusalem on heaps.
 &nbsp; 2  The dead bodies of thy servants have they given <I>to be</I> meat
 unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the
 beasts of the earth.
 &nbsp; 3  Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
 and <I>there was</I> none to bury <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 4  We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and
 derision to them that are round about us.
 &nbsp; 5  How long, L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy
 jealousy burn like fire?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here a sad complaint exhibited in the court of heaven. The 
 world is full of complaints, and so is the church too, for it suffers, 
 not only with it, but from it, as <I>a lily among thorns.</I> God is 
 complained to; whither should children go with their grievances, but to 
 their father, to such a father as is able and willing to help? The 
 heathen are complained of, who, being themselves aliens from the 
 commonwealth of Israel, were sworn enemies to it. Though they knew not 
 God, nor owned him, yet, God having them in chain, the church very 
 fitly appeals to him against them; for he is King of nations, to 
 overrule them, to judge among the heathen, and King of saints, to 
 favour and protect them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They complain here of the anger of their enemies and the outrageous 
 fury of the oppressor, exerted,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Against places, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.
 
 They did all the mischief they could,

 (1.) To the holy land; they invaded that, and made inroads into it: 
 "<I>The heathen have come into thy inheritance,</I> to plunder that, 
 and lay it waste." Canaan was dearer to the pious Israelites as it was 
 God's inheritance than as it was their own, as it was the land in which 
 God was known and his name was great rather than as it was the land in 
 which they were bred and born and which they and their ancestors had 
 been long in possession of. Note, Injuries done to religion should
 grieve us more than even those done to common right, nay, to our own 
 right. We should better bear to see our own inheritance wasted than 
 God's inheritance. This psalmist had mentioned it in the foregoing 
 psalm as an instance of God's great favour to Israel that he had 
 <I>cast out the heathen before them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:55">Ps. lxxviii. 55</A>.

 But see what a change sin made; now the heathen are suffered to pour in 
 upon them.

 (2.) To the holy city: <I>They have laid Jerusalem on heaps,</I> heaps
 of rubbish, such heaps as are raised over graves, so some. The 
 inhabitants were buried in the ruins of their own houses, and their 
 dwelling places became their sepulchres, their long homes. 

 (3.) To the holy house. That sanctuary which God had built like high 
 palaces, and which was thought to be established as the earth, was now 
 laid level with the ground: <I>Thy holy temple have they defiled,</I>
 by entering into it and laying it waste. God's own people had defiled 
 it by their sins, and therefore God suffered their enemies to defile it 
 by their insolence.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Against persons, against the bodies of God's people; and further 
 their malice could not reach. 

 (1.) They were prodigal of their blood, and killed them without mercy; 
 their eye did not spare, nor did they give any quarter 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Their blood have they shed like water,</I> wherever they met with 
 them, <I>round about Jerusalem,</I> in all the avenues to the city; 
 whoever <I>went out or came in</I> was <I>waited for of the sword.</I> 
 Abundance of human blood was shed, so that the channels of water ran 
 with blood. And they shed it with no more reluctancy or regret than if 
 they had spilt so much water, little thinking that every drop of it 
 will be reckoned for in the day when <I>God shall make inquisition for 
 blood.</I>

 (2.) They were abusive to their dead bodies. When they had killed them 
 they would let none bury them. Nay, those that were buried, even the 
 <I>dead bodies of God's servants, the flesh of his saints,</I> whose 
 names and memories they had a particular spite at, they dug up again, 
 and <I>gave them to be meat to the fowls of the heaven and to the 
 beasts of the earth;</I> or, at least, they left those so exposed whom 
 they slew; they hung them in chains, which was in a particular manner 
 grievous to the Jews to see, because God had given them an express law 
 against this, as a barbarous thing,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+21:23">Deut. xxi. 23</A>.
 
 This inhuman usage of Christ's witnesses is foretold
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:9">Rev. xi. 9</A>),

 and thus even the dead bodies were witnesses against their persecutors.
 This is mentioned (says Austin, <I>De Civitate Dei, lib.</I> 1 
 <I>cap.</I> 12) not as an instance of the misery of the persecuted (for 
 the bodies of the saints shall rise in glory, however they became meat 
 to the birds and the fowls), but of the malice of the persecutors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. Against their names 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>We that survive have become a reproach to our neighbours;</I> they 
 all study to abuse us and load us with contempt, and represent us as 
 ridiculous, or odious, or both, upbraiding us with our sins and with 
 our sufferings, or giving the lie to our relation to God and 
 expectations from him; so that we have become <I>a scorn and derision 
 to those that are round about us.</I>" If God's professing people 
 degenerate from what themselves and their fathers were, they must 
 expect to be told of it; and it is well if a just reproach will help to 
 bring us to a true repentance. But it has been the lot of the 
 gospel-Israel to be made unjustly a reproach and derision; the apostles 
 themselves were <I>counted as the offscouring of all things.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They wonder more at God's anger, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 This they discern in the anger of their neighbours, and this they
 complain most of: <I>How long, Lord, wilt thou be angry?</I> Shall it 
 be <I>for ever?</I> This intimates that they desired no more than that 
 God would be reconciled to them, that his anger might be turned away, 
 and then the remainder of men's wrath would be restrained. Note, Those 
 who desire God's favour as better than life cannot but dread and 
 deprecate his wrath as worse than death.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee,
 and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
 &nbsp; 7  For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling
 place.
 &nbsp; 8  O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender
 mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
 &nbsp; 9  Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name:
 and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
 &nbsp; 10  Wherefore should the heathen say, Where <I>is</I> their God? let
 him be known among the heathen in our sight <I>by</I> the revenging of
 the blood of thy servants <I>which is</I> shed.
 &nbsp; 11  Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according
 to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are
 appointed to die;
 &nbsp; 12  And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom
 their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
 &nbsp; 13  So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee
 thanks for ever: we will show forth thy praise to all
 generations.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The petitions here put up to God are very suitable to the present 
 distresses of the church, and they have pleas to enforce them, 
 interwoven with them, taken mostly from God's honour.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. They pray that God would so turn away his anger from them as to turn 
 it upon those that persecuted and abused them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Pour out thy wrath,</I> the full vials of it, <I>upon the 
 heathen;</I> let them wring out the dregs of it, and drink them." This 
 prayer is in effect a prophecy, in which the <I>wrath of God is 
 revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of 
 men.</I> Observe here,

 1. The character of those he prays against; they are such as have not 
 known God, nor called upon his name. The reason why men do not call 
 upon God is because they do not know him, how able and willing he is to 
 help them. Those that persist in ignorance of God, and neglect of 
 prayer, are the ungodly, who live <I>without God in the world.</I> 
 There are kingdoms that know not God and obey not the gospel, but 
 neither their multitude nor their force united will secure them from 
 his just judgments. 

 2. Their crime: <I>They have devoured Jacob,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 That is crime enough in the account of him who reckons that those who
 touch his people touch the apple of his eye. They have not only 
 disturbed, but devoured, Jacob, not only encroached upon his dwelling 
 place, the land of Canaan, but laid it waste by plundering and 
 depopulating it.

 (3.) Their condemnation: "<I>Pour out thy wrath</I> upon them; do not 
 only restrain them from doing further mischief, but reckon with them 
 for the mischief they have done."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They pray for the pardon of sin, which they own to be the procuring 
 cause of all their calamities. How unrighteous soever men were, God was 
 righteous in permitting them to do what they did. They pray, 

 1. That God would not <I>remember against them their former 
 iniquities</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 either their own former iniquities, that now, when they were old, they 
 might not be made to possess the iniquities of their youth, or the 
 former iniquities of their people, the sins of their ancestors. In the 
 captivity of Babylon former iniquities were brought to account; but God 
 promises not again to do so

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+31:29,30">Jer. xxxi. 29, 30</A>),

 and so they pray, "Remember not against us our first sins," which some
 make to look as far back as the golden calf, because God said, <I>In 
 the day when I visit I will visit for this sin</I> of theirs <I>upon 
 them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:34">Exod. xxxii. 34</A>.

 If the children by repentance and reformation cut off the entail of the
 parents' sin, they may in faith pray that God will not <I>remember them 
 against them.</I> When God pardons sin he blots it out and remembers it 
 no more. 

 2. That he would purge away the sins they had been lately guilty of, by
 the guilt of which their minds and consciences had been defiled: 
 <I>Deliver us, and purge away our sins,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 Then deliverances from trouble are granted in love, and are mercies
 indeed, when they are grounded upon the pardon of sin and flow from 
 that; we should therefore be more earnest with God in prayer for the 
 removal of our sins than for the removal of our afflictions, and the 
 pardon of them is the foundation and sweetness of our deliverances.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. They pray that God would work deliverance for them, and bring 
 their troubles to a good end and that speedily: <I>Let thy tender 
 mercies speedily prevent us,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.

 They had no hopes but from God's mercies, his tender mercies; their
 case was so deplorable that they looked upon themselves as the proper 
 objects of divine compassion, and so near to desperate that, unless 
 divine mercy did speedily interpose to prevent their ruin, they were 
 undone. This whets their importunity: "<I>Lord, help us; Lord, deliver 
 us;</I> help us under our troubles, that we may bear them well; help us 
 out of our troubles, that the spirit may not fail. Deliver us from sin, 
 from sinking." Three things they plead:--

 1. The great distress they were reduced to: "<I>We are brought very 
 low,</I> and, being low, shall be lost if thou help us not." The lower 
 we are brought the more need we have of help from heaven and the more 
 will divine power be magnified in raising us up.

 2. Their dependence upon him: "Thou art the <I>God of our
 salvation,</I> who alone canst help. <I>Salvation belongs to the 
 Lord,</I> from whom we expect help; for <I>in the Lord alone is the 
 salvation of his people.</I>" Those who make God the God of their 
 salvation shall find him so. 

 3. The interest of his own honour in their case. They plead no merit of 
 theirs; they pretend to none; but, "<I>Help us for the glory of thy 
 name;</I> pardon us for thy name's sake." The best encouragements in 
 prayer are those that are taken from God only, and those things whereby 
 he has made himself known. Two things are insinuated in this plea:--

 (1.) That God's name and honour would be greatly injured if he did not 
 deliver them; for those that derided them blasphemed God, as if he were 
 weak and could not help them, or had withdrawn and would not; therefore 
 they plead 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 "<I>Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God?</I> He has 
 forsaken them, and forgotten them; and this they get by worshipping a 
 God whom they cannot see." (<I>Nil pr&aelig;ter nubes et c&oelig;li 
 numen adorant.</I> Juv.--<I>They adore no other divinity than the 
 clouds and the sky.</I>) That which was their praise (that they served 
 a God that is every where) was now turned to their reproach and his 
 too, as if they served a God that is nowhere. "Lord," say they, "make
 it to appear that thou art by making it to appear that thou art with us 
 and for us, that when we are asked, <I>Where is your God?</I> we may be 
 able to say, He is nigh unto us in all that which we call upon him for, 
 and you see he is so by what he does for us."

 (2.) That God's name and honour would be greatly advanced if he did 
 deliver them; his mercy would be glorified in delivering those that 
 were so miserable and helpless. By making bare his everlasting arm on 
 their behalf he would make unto himself an everlasting name; and their 
 deliverance would be a type and figure of the great salvation, which in 
 the fulness of time Messiah the Prince would work out, to the glory of 
 God's name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. They pray that God would avenge them on their adversaries, 

 1. For their cruelty and barbarity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 "Let the avenging of our blood" (according to the ancient law, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+9:6">Gen. ix. 6</A>)

 "be known among the heathen; let them be made sensible that what
 judgments are brought upon them are punishments of the wrong they have 
 done to us; let this be in our sight, and by this means <I>let God be 
 known among the heathen</I> as <I>the God to whom vengeance belongs</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:1">Ps. xciv. 1</A>)

 and the God that espouses his people's cause." Those that have
 intoxicated themselves with the blood of the saints shall have <I>blood 
 given them to drink,</I> for they are worthy. 

 2. For their insolence and scorn 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>Render to them their reproach.</I> The indignities which by word 
 and deed they have done to the people of God himself and his name let 
 them be repaid to them with interest." The reproach wherewith men have 
 reproached us only we must leave it to God whether he will render to 
 them or no, and must pray that he would forgive them; but the reproach
 wherewith they have blasphemed God himself we may in faith pray that 
 God would render seven-fold into their bosoms, so as to strike at their 
 hearts, to humble them, and bring them to repentance. This prayer is a
 prophecy, of the same import with that of Enoch, that God will convince 
 sinners of all their hard speeches which they have spoken against him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:15">Jude 15</A>)

 and will return them into their own bosoms by everlasting terrors at
 the remembrance of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. They pray that God would find out a way for the rescue of his poor 
 prisoners, especially the condemned prisoners, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 The case of their brethren who had fallen into the hands of the enemy
 was very sad; they were kept close prisoners, and, because they durst 
 not be heard to bemoan themselves, they vented their griefs in deep and 
 silent sighs. All their breathing was sighing, and so was their
 praying. They were appointed to die, as sheep for the slaughter, and 
 had received the sentence of death within themselves. This deplorable 
 case the psalmist recommends,

 1. To the divine pity: "<I>Let their sighs come up before thee,</I> and 
 be thou pleased to take cognizance of their moans." 

 2. To the divine power: "<I>According to the greatness of thy arm,</I>
 which no creature can contest with, <I>preserve thou those that are 
 appointed to die</I> from the death to which they are appointed." Man's 
 extremity is God's opportunity to appear for his people. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:8-10">2 Cor. i. 8-10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 <I>Lastly,</I> They promise the returns of praise for the answers of 
 prayer 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 <I>So we will give thee thanks for ever.</I> Observe,

 1. How they please themselves with their relation to God. "Though we 
 are oppressed and brought low, yet we are the sheep of thy pasture, not 
 disowned and cast off by thee for all this: <I>We are thine; save 
 us.</I>" 

 2. How they promise themselves an opportunity of praising God for their
 deliverance, which they <I>therefore</I> desired, and would bid 
 welcome, because it would furnish them with matter for thanksgiving and 
 put their hearts in tune for that excellent work, the work of heaven. 

 3. How they oblige themselves not only to give God thanks at present, 
 but to <I>show forth his praise unto all generations,</I> that is, to 
 do all they could both to perpetuate the remembrance of God's favours 
 to them and to engage their posterity to keep up the work of praise. 

 4. How they plead this with God: "Lord, appear for us against our
 enemies; for, if they get the better, they will <I>blaspheme thee</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+79:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 but, if we be delivered, we will praise thee. Lord, we are that people 
 of thine which thou hast <I>formed for thyself, to show forth thy 
 praise;</I> if we be cut off, whence shall that rent, that tribute, be 
 raised?" Note, Those lives that are entirely devoted to God's praise 
 are assuredly taken under his protection.</P>
