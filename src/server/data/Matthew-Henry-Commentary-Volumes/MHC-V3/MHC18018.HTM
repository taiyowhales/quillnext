 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this chapter Bildad makes a second assault upon Job. In his first 
 discourse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+8:1-22"><I>ch.</I> viii.</A>)

 he had given him encouragement to hope that all should yet be well with
 him. But here there is not a word of that; he has grown more peevish,
 and is so far from being convinced by Job's reasonings that he is but 
 more exasperated. 

 I. He sharply reproves Job as haughty and passionate, and obstinate in
 his opinion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:1-4">ver. 1-4</A>.

 II. He enlarges upon the doctrine he had before maintained, concerning
 the miser of wicked people and the ruin that attends them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:5-21">ver. 5-21</A>.

 In this he seems, all along, to have an eye to Job's complaints of the
 miserable condition he was in, that he was in the dark, bewildered, 
 ensnared, terrified, and hastening out of the world. "This," says 
 Bildad, "is the condition of a wicked man; and therefore thou art 
 one."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
 &nbsp; 2  How long <I>will it be ere</I> ye make an end of words? mark, and
 afterwards we will speak.
 &nbsp; 3  Wherefore are we counted as beasts, <I>and</I> reputed vile in
 your sight?
 &nbsp; 4  He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken
 for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Bildad here shoots his arrows, even bitter words, against poor Job, 
 little thinking that, though he was a wise and good man, in this 
 instance he was serving Satan's design in adding to Job's 
 affliction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He charges him with idle endless talk, as Eliphaz had done
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+15:2,3"><I>ch.</I> xv. 2, 3</A>):

 <I>How long will it be ere you make an end of words?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 Here he reflects, not only upon Job himself, but either upon all the 
 managers of the conference (thinking perhaps that Eliphaz and Zophar 
 did not speak so closely to the purpose as they might have done) or 
 upon some that were present, who possibly took part with Job, and put 
 in a word now and then in his favour, though it be not recorded. Bildad 
 was weary of hearing others speak, and impatient till it came to his 
 turn, which cannot be observed to any man's praise, for we ought to be 
 swift to hear and slow to speak. It is common for contenders to 
 monopolize the reputation of wisdom, and then to insist upon it as 
 their privilege to be dictators. How unbecoming this conduct is in 
 others every one can see; but few that are guilty of it can see it in 
 themselves. Time was when Job had the last word in all debates

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:22"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 22</A>):

 <I>After my words they spoke not again.</I> Then he was in power and
 prosperity; but now that he was impoverished and brought low he could 
 scarcely be allowed to speak at all, and every thing he said was as 
 much vilified as formerly it had been magnified. <I>Wisdom</I> 
 therefore (as the world goes) <I>is good with an inheritance</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:11">Eccl. vii. 11</A>);

 for <I>the poor man's wisdom is despised,</I> and, because he is poor,
 <I>his words are not heard,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:16">Eccl. ix. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. With a regardlessness of what was said to him, intimated in that, 
 <I>Mark, and afterwards we will speak.</I> And it is to no purpose to 
 speak, though what is said be ever so much to the purpose, if those to 
 whom it is addressed will not mark and observe it. Let the <I>ear be 
 opened to hear as the learned,</I> and then the tongues of the learned 
 will do good service 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:4">Isa. l. 4</A>)

 and not otherwise. It is an encouragement to those that speak of the
 things of God to see the hearers attentive.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. With a haughty contempt and disdain of his friends and of that 
 which they offered 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>Wherefore are we counted as beasts?</I> This was invidious. Job had 
 indeed called them <I>mockers,</I> had represented them both as unwise 
 and as unkind, wanting both in the reason and tenderness of men, but he 
 did not count them beasts; yet Bildad so represents the matter,

 1. Because his high spirit resented what Job had said as if it had been
 the greatest affront imaginable.  Proud men are apt to think themselves 
 slighted more than really they are. 

 2. Because his hot spirit was willing to find a pretence to be hard 
 upon Job. Those that incline to be severe upon others will have it 
 thought that others have first been so upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. With outrageous passion: <I>He teareth himself in his anger,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.
 
 Herein he seems to reflect upon what Job had said
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+13:14"><I>ch.</I> xiii. 14</A>):
 
 <I>Wherefore did I take my flesh in my teeth?</I> "It is thy own
 fault," says Bildad. Or he reflected upon what he said 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:9"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 9</A>,

 where he seemed to charge it upon God, or, as some think, upon Eliphaz:
 <I>He teareth me in his wrath.</I> "No," says Bildad; "thou alone shalt 
 bear it." <I>He teareth himself in his anger.</I> Note, Anger is a sin 
 that is its own punishment. Fretful passionate people tear and torment 
 themselves. <I>He teareth his soul</I> (so the word is); every sin 
 wounds the soul, tears that, wrongs that 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:36">Prov. viii. 36</A>),

 unbridled passion particularly.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. With a proud and arrogant expectation to give law even to Providence 
 itself: "<I>Shall the earth be forsaken for thee?</I> Surely not; there 
 is no reason for that, that the course of nature should be changed and 
 the settled rules of government violated to gratify the humour of one 
 man. Job, dost thou think the world cannot stand without thee; but 
 that, if thou art ruined, all the world is ruined and forsaken with 
 thee?" Some make it a reproof of Job's justification of himself, 
 falsely insinuating that either Job was a wicked man or we must deny a 
 Providence and suppose that God has forsaken the earth and the rock of 
 ages is removed. It is rather a just reproof of his passionate 
 complaints. When we quarrel with the events of Providence we forget 
 that, whatever befals us, it is, 

 1. According to the eternal purpose and counsel of God. 

 2. According to the written word. Thus it is written that in the world 
 we must have tribulation, that, since we sin daily, we must expect to 
 smart for it; and, 

 3. According to the usual way and custom, the track of Providence,
 nothing but what is common to men; and to expect that God's counsels 
 should change, his method alter, and his word fail, to please us, is as 
 absurd and unreasonable as to think <I>the earth should be forsaken for 
 us and the rock removed out of its place.</I></P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The rest of Bildad's discourse is entirely taken up in an elegant 
 description of the miserable condition of a wicked man, in which there 
 is a great deal of certain truth, and which will be of excellent use if 
 duly considered--that a sinful condition is a sad condition, and that
 iniquity will be men's ruin if they do not repent of it. But it is not 
 true that all wicked people are visibly and openly made thus miserable 
 in this world; nor is it true that all who are brought into great 
 distress and trouble in this world are <I>therefore</I> to be deemed 
 and adjudged wicked men, when no other proof appears against them; and 
 therefore, though Bildad thought the application of it to Job was easy, 
 yet it was not safe nor just. In these verses we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The destruction of the wicked foreseen and foretold, under the 
 similitude of darkness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:5,6"><I>v.</I> 5, 6</A>):

 <I>Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out.</I> Even his 
 <I>light,</I> the best and brightest part of him, shall be put out; 
 even that which he rejoiced in shall fail him.  Or the <I>yea</I> may 
 refer to Job's complaints of the great distress he was in and the 
 darkness he should shortly make his bed in. "Yea," says Bildad, "So it 
 is; thou art clouded, and straitened, and made miserable, and no better 
 could be expected; for <I>the light of the wicked shall be put out,</I> 
 and therefore thine shall." Observe here,

 1. The wicked may have some light for a while, some pleasure, some joy, 
 some hope within, as well as wealth, and honour, and power without. But 
 his light is but a spark 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 a little thing and soon extinguished.  It is but a candle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),
 
 wasting, and burning down, and easily blown out. It is not the light of 
 the Lord (that is sun-light), but the <I>light of his own fire</I> and 
 <I>sparks of his own kindling,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+50:11">Isa. l. 11</A>.

 2. His light will certainly be put out at length, quite put out, so 
 that not the least spark of it shall remain with which to kindle 
 another fire. Even while he is in his tabernacle, while he is in the 
 body, which is the tabernacle of the soul

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+5:1">2 Cor. v. 1</A>),

 the light shall be dark; he shall have no true solid comfort, no joy
 that is satisfying, no hope that is supporting. Even <I>the light that 
 is in him is darkness;</I> and <I>how great is that darkness!</I> But, 
 when he is put out of this tabernacle by death, <I>his candle shall be 
 put out with him.</I> The period of his life will be the final period 
 of all his days and will turn all his hopes into endless despair. 
 <I>When a wicked man dies his expectation shall perish,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+11:7">Prov. xi. 7</A>.

 <I>He shall lie down in sorrow.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The preparatives for that destruction represented under the 
 similitude of a beast or bird caught in a snare, or a malefactor 
 arrested and taken into custody in order to his punishment, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:7-10"><I>v.</I> 7-10</A>.

 1.  Satan is preparing for his destruction. He is <I>the robber that
 shall prevail against him</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>);

 for, as he was a murderer, so he was a robber, from the beginning. He, 
 as the tempter, lays snares for sinners in the way, wherever they go, 
 and he shall prevail. If he make them sinful like himself, he will make 
 them miserable like himself. He <I>hunts for the precious life.</I>

 2. He is himself preparing for his own destruction by going on in sin, 
 and so <I>treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath.</I> God gives 
 him up, as he deserves and desires, to his own counsels, and then 
 <I>his own counsels cast him down,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 His sinful projects and pursuits bring him into mischief. He is <I>cast 
 into a net by his own feet</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>),

 runs upon his own destruction, is <I>snared in the work of his own 
 hands</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:16">Ps. ix. 16</A>);

 his <I>own tongue falls upon him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:8">Ps. lxiv. 8</A>.

 <I>In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare.</I>

 3. God is preparing for his destruction. The sinner by his sin is
 preparing the fuel and then God by his wrath is preparing the fire. See 
 here,

 (1.) How the sinner is infatuated, to run himself into the snare; and 
 whom God will destroy he infatuates. 

 (2.) How he is embarrassed: <I>The steps of his strength,</I> his 
 mighty designs and efforts, <I>shall be straitened,</I> so that he 
 shall not compass what he intended; and the more he strives to 
 extricate himself the more will he be entangled.  Evil men wax worse 
 and worse. 

 (3.) How he is secured and kept from escaping the judgments of God that 
 are in pursuit of him. <I>The gin shall take him by the heel.</I> He 
 can no more escape the divine wrath that is in pursuit of him than a 
 man, so held, can flee from the pursuer. God <I>knows how to reserve 
 the wicked for the day of judgment,</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive
 him to his feet.
 &nbsp; 12  His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction <I>shall
 be</I> ready at his side.
 &nbsp; 13  It shall devour the strength of his skin: <I>even</I> the
 firstborn of death shall devour his strength.
 &nbsp; 14  His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it
 shall bring him to the king of terrors.
 &nbsp; 15  It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because <I>it is</I> none of
 his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
 &nbsp; 16  His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his
 branch be cut off.
 &nbsp; 17  His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall
 have no name in the street.
 &nbsp; 18  He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out
 of the world.
 &nbsp; 19  He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor
 any remaining in his dwellings.
 &nbsp; 20  They that come after <I>him</I> shall be astonied at his day, as
 they that went before were affrighted.
 &nbsp; 21  Surely such <I>are</I> the dwellings of the wicked, and this <I>is</I>
 the place <I>of him that</I> knoweth not God.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Bildad here describes the destruction itself which wicked people are 
 reserved for in the other world, and which, in some degree, often 
 seizes them in this world. Come, and see what a miserable condition the 
 sinner is in when his day comes to fall.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. See him disheartened and weakened by continual terrors arising from 
 the sense of his own guilt and the dread of God's wrath 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>):
 
 <I>Terror shall make him afraid on every side.</I> The terrors of his 
 own conscience shall haunt him, so that he shall never be easy. 
 Wherever he goes, these shall follow him; which way soever he looks, 
 these shall stare him in the face. It will make him tremble to see 
 himself fought against by the whole creation, to see Heaven frowning on 
 him, hell gaping for him, and earth sick of him. He that carries his 
 own accuser, and his own tormentor, always in his bosom, cannot but be 
 afraid on every side. This will drive him to his feet, like the 
 malefactor, who, being conscious of his own guilt, takes to his heels 
 and <I>flees when none pursues,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+28:1">Prov. xxviii. 1</A>.

 But his feet will do him no service; they are fast in the snare,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The sinner may as soon overpower the divine omnipotence as flee from 
 the divine omniscience,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Am+9:2,3">Amos ix. 2, 3</A>.

 No marvel that the sinner is dispirited and distracted with fear, for,

 1. He sees his ruin approaching: <I>Destruction shall be ready at his
 side,</I> to seize him whenever justice gives the word, so that he is 
 <I>brought into desolation in a moment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:19">Ps. lxxiii. 19</A>.

 2. He feels himself utterly unable to grapple with it, either to escape 
 it or to bear up under it. That which he relied upon as <I>his 
 strength</I> (his wealth, power, pomp, friends, and the hardiness of 
 his own spirit) <I>shall</I> fail him in the time of need, and <I>be 
 hunger-bitten,</I> that is, it shall do him no more service than a 
 famished man, pining away for hunger, would do in work or war. The case 
 being thus with him, no marvel that he is a terror to himself. Note, 
 The way of sin is a way of fear, and leads to everlasting confusion, of 
 which the present terrors of an impure and unpacified conscience are 
 earnests, as they were to Cain and Judas.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. See him devoured and swallowed up by a miserable death; and 
 miserable indeed a wicked man's death is, how secure and jovial soever 
 his life was. 

 1. See him dying, arrested by <I>the first-born of death</I> (some
 disease, or some stroke that has in it a more than ordinary resemblance 
 of death itself; <I>so great a death,</I> as it is called,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:10">2 Cor. i. 10</A>,

 a messenger of death that has in it an uncommon strength and terror),
 weakened by the harbingers of death, which <I>devour the strength of 
 his skin,</I> that is, it shall bring rottenness into his bones and 
 consume them. <I>His confidence shall then be rooted out of his 
 tabernacle</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 that is, all that he trusted to for his support shall be taken from 
 him, and he shall have nothing to rely upon, no, not his own 
 tabernacle. His own soul was his confidence, but that shall be rooted 
 out of the tabernacle of the body, as a tree that cumbered the ground. 
 "Thy soul shall be required of thee."

 2. See him dead, and see his case then with an eye of faith.

 (1.) He is then brought to <I>the king of terrors.</I> He was 
 surrounded with terrors while he lived 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 and death was the king of all those terrors; they fought against the 
 sinner in death's name, for it is by reason of death that sinners are 
 <I>all their lifetime subject to bondage</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:15">Heb. ii. 15</A>),

 and at length they will be brought to that which they so long feared,
 as a captive to the conqueror. Death is terrible to nature; our Saviour 
 himself prayed, <I>Father, save me from this hour.</I> But to the 
 wicked it is in a special manner <I>the king of terrors,</I> both as it 
 is a period to that life in which they placed their happiness and a 
 passage to that life where they will find their endless misery. How 
 happy then are the saints, and how much indebted to the Lord Jesus, by 
 whom death is so far abolished, and the property of it altered, that 
 this king of terrors becomes a friend and servant!

 (2.) He is then <I>driven from the light into darkness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:18"><I>v.</I>  18</A>),
 
 from the light of this world, and his prosperous condition in it, into 
 darkness, the darkness of the grave, the darkness of hell, into utter 
 darkness, never to see light 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+49:19">Ps. xlix. 19</A>),

 not the least gleam, nor any hopes of it.

 (3.) He is then <I>chased out of the world,</I> hurried and dragged 
 away by the messengers of death, sorely against his will, chased as 
 Adam out of paradise, for the world is his paradise. It intimates that 
 he would fain stay here; he is loth to depart, but go he must; all the 
 world is weary of him, and therefore chases him out, as glad to get rid 
 of him. This is death to a wicked man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. See his family sunk and cut off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>.

 The wrath and curse of God light and lie, not only upon his head and 
 heart, but upon his house too, to consume it with the <I>timber and 
 stones thereof,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+5:4">Zech. v. 4</A>.

 Death itself shall dwell in his tabernacle, and, having expelled him, 
 shall take possession of his house, to the terror and destruction of 
 all that he leaves behind. Even the dwelling shall be ruined for the 
 sake of its owner: <I>Brimstone shall be scattered upon his 
 habitation,</I> rained upon it as upon Sodom, to the destruction of 
 which this seems to have reference. Some think he here upbraids Job 
 with the burning of his sheep and servants with fire from heaven. The 
 reason is here given why his tabernacle is thus marked for ruin: 
 <I>Because it is none of his;</I> that is, it was unjustly got, and 
 kept, from the rightful owner, and therefore let him not expect either 
 the comfort or the continuance of it. His children shall perish, either 
 with him or after him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 So that, <I>his roots being</I> in his own person <I>dried up beneath, 
 above his branch</I> (every child of his family) <I>shall be cut 
 off.</I> Thus the houses of Jeroboam, Baasha, and Ahab, were cut off; 
 none that descended from them were left alive. Those who take root in 
 the earth may expect it will thus be dried up; but, if we be rooted in 
 Christ, even our leaf shall not wither, much less shall our branch be 
 cut off. Those who consult the true honour of their family, and the 
 welfare of its branches, will be afraid of withering it by sin. The 
 extirpation of the sinner's family is mentioned again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>He shall neither have son nor nephew,</I> child nor grandchild, to 
 enjoy his estate and bear up his name, <I>nor</I> shall there be <I>any 
 remaining in his dwelling</I> akin to him. Sin entails a curse upon 
 posterity, and the iniquity of the fathers is often visited upon the 
 children. Herein, also, it is probable that Bildad reflects upon the 
 death of Job's children and servants, as a further proof of his being a 
 wicked man; whereas all that are written childless are not thereby 
 written graceless; there is a name <I>better than that of sons and 
 daughters.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. See his memory buried with him, or made odious; he shall either be 
 forgotten or spoken of with dishonour 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>His remembrance shall perish from the earth;</I> and, if it perish 
 thence, it perishes wholly, for it was never written in heaven, as the 
 names of the saints are,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+10:20">Luke x. 20</A>.

 All his honour shall be laid and lost in the dust, or stained with
 perpetual infamy, so that <I>he shall have no name in the street,</I> 
 departing without being desired. Thus the judgments of God follow him, 
 after death, in this world, as an indication of the misery his soul is 
 in after death, and an earnest of that everlasting shame and contempt 
 to which he shall rise in the great day. <I>The memory of the just is 
 blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rot,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+10:7">Prov. x. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. See a universal amazement at his fall, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Those that see it are affrighted, so sudden is the change, so dreadful 
 the execution, so threatening to all about him: and those that come 
 after, and hear the report of it, are astonished at it; their ears are 
 made to tingle, and their hearts to tremble, and they cry out, <I>Lord, 
 how terrible art thou in thy judgments!</I> A place or person utterly 
 ruined is said to be <I>made an astonishment,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+28:37,2Ch+7:21,Jer+25:9,18">Deut. xxviii. 37; 
 2 Chron. vii. 21; Jer. xxv. 9, 18</A>.

 Horrible sins bring strange punishments.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. See all this averred as the unanimous sense of the patriarchal age, 
 grounded upon their knowledge of God and their many observations of his 
 providence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+18:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the 
 place</I> (this the condition) <I>of him that knows not God!</I> See 
 here what is the beginning, and what is the end, of the wickedness of 
 this wicked world.

 1. The beginning of it is ignorance of God, and it is a wilful
 ignorance, for there is that to be known of him which is sufficient to 
 leave them for ever inexcusable. They know not God, and then they 
 commit all iniquity. Pharaoh knows not the Lord, and therefore will not 
 obey his voice. 

 2. The end of it, and that is utter destruction.  <I>Such,</I> so 
 miserable, <I>are the dwellings of the wicked.</I> Vengeance will be 
 taken of those that <I>know not God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:8">2 Thess. i. 8</A>.

 For those whom he has not honour from he will get himself honour upon.
 Let us therefore stand in awe and not sin, for it will certainly be 
 bitterness in the latter end.</P>
