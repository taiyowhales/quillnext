 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is concerning the kingdom of Jesus Christ, 

 I. His providential kingdom, by which he rules the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The kingdom of his grace, by which he rules in his church.

 1. Concerning the subjects of that kingdom; their character
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:4,6">ver. 4, 6</A>),
 
 their charter, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:5">ver. 5</A>.

 2. Concerning the King of that kingdom; and a summons to all to give
 him admission, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:7-10">ver. 7-10</A>.

 It is supposed that the psalm was penned upon occasion of David's
 bringing up the ark to the place prepared for it, and that the
 intention of it was to lead the people above the pomp of external
 ceremonies to a holy life and faith in Christ, of whom the ark was a
 type.</P>

 <P>A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  The earth <I>is</I> the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s, and the
 fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
 &nbsp; 2  For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon
 the floods.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is,

 I. God's absolute propriety in this part of the creation where our lot
 is cast,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 We are not to think that the heavens, even the heavens only, are the
 Lord's, and the numerous and bright inhabitants of the upper world, and
 that this earth, being so small and inconsiderable a part of the 
 creation, and at such a distance from the royal palace above, is 
 neglected, and that he claims no interest in it. No, even the earth is
 his, and this lower world; and, though he has prepared the throne of 
 his glory in the heavens, yet his kingdom rules over all, and even the 
 worms of this earth are not below his cognizance, nor from under his 
 dominion. 

 1. When God gave the earth to the children of men he still reserved to 
 himself the property, and only let it out to them as tenants, or 
 usufructuaries: <I>The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof.</I> 
 The mines that are lodged in the bowels of it, even the richest, the 
 fruits it produces, all the beasts of the forest and the cattle upon a 
 thousand hills, our lands and houses, and all the improvements that are 
 made of this earth by the skill and industry of man, are all his. These 
 indeed, in the kingdom of grace, are justly looked upon as emptiness; 
 for they are vanity of vanities, nothing to a soul; but, in the kingdom 
 of providence, they are fulness. <I>The earth is full of God's riches, 
 so is the great and wide sea also.</I> All the parts and regions of the 
 earth are the Lord's, all under his eye, all in his hand: so that, 
 wherever a child of God goes, he may comfort himself with this, that he 
 does not go off his Father's ground. That which falls to our share of 
 the earth and its productions is but lent to us; it is the Lord's; what 
 is our own against all the world is not so against his claims. That 
 which is most remote from us, as that which passes through the paths of 
 the sea, or is hidden in the bottom of it, is the Lord's and he knows 
 where to find it. 
 
 2. The habitable part of this earth

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:31">Prov. viii. 31</A>)

 is his in a special manner--<I>the world and those that dwell
 therein.</I> We ourselves are not our own, our bodies, our souls, are 
 not. <I>All souls are mine,</I> says God; for he is the former of our 
 bodies and the Father of our spirits. Our tongues are not our own; they 
 are to be at his service. Even those of the children of men that know
 him not, nor own their relation to him, are his. Now this comes in here 
 to show that, though God is graciously pleased to accept the devotions 
 and services of his peculiar chosen people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>),

 it is not because he needs them, or can be benefited by them, for the
 earth is his and all in it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+19:5,Ps+50:12">Exod. xix. 5; Ps. l. 12</A>.

 It is likewise to be applied to the dominion Christ has, as Mediator,
 over the utmost parts of the earth, which are given him for his 
 possession: the Father loveth the Son and hath given all things into 
 his hand, power over all flesh. The apostle quotes this scripture twice 
 together in his discourse about things offered to idols,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:26,28">1 Cor. x. 26, 28</A>.

 "If it be sold in the shambles, eat it, and ask no questions; <I>for
 the earth is the Lord's;</I> it is God's good creature, and you have a 
 right to it. But, if one tell you it was offered to an idol, forbear, 
 <I>for the earth is the Lord's,</I> and there is enough besides." This 
 is a good reason why we should be content with our allotment in this 
 world, and not envy others theirs; <I>the earth is the Lord's,</I> and 
 may he not do what he will with his own, and give to some more of it, 
 to others less, as it pleases him?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The ground of this propriety. The earth is his by an indisputable 
 title, <I>for he hath founded it upon the seas</I> and <I>established 
 it upon the floods,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 It is his; for,

 1. He made it, formed it, founded it, and fitted it for the use of man.
 The matter is his, for he made it out of nothing; the form is his, for 
 he made it according to the eternal counsels and ideas of his own mind. 
 He made it himself, he made it for himself; so that he is sole, entire, 
 and absolute owner, and none can let us a title to any part, but by, 
 from, and under him; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:11,12">Ps. lxxxix. 11, 12</A>.

 2. He made it so as no one else could. It is the creature of
 omnipotence, for it is founded upon the seas, upon the floods, a weak 
 and unstable foundation (one would think) to build the earth upon, and 
 yet, if almighty power please, it shall serve to bear the weight of 
 this earth. The waters which at first covered the earth, and rendered 
 it unfit to be a habitation for man, were ordered under it, that the 
 dry land might appear, and so they are as a foundation to it; see 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:8,9">Ps. civ. 8, 9</A>.

 3. He continues it, he has <I>established</I> it, fixed it, so that,
 though one generation passes and another comes, the earth abides, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+1:4">Eccl. i. 4</A>.
 
 And his providence is a continued creation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:90">Ps. cxix. 90</A>.

 The founding of the earth upon the floods should remind us how slippery
 and uncertain all earthly things are; their foundation is not only 
 sand, but water; it is therefore our folly to build upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>3  Who shall ascend into the hill of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>? or who shall
 stand in his holy place?
 &nbsp; 4  He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not
 lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
 &nbsp; 5  He shall receive the blessing from the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and
 righteousness from the God of his salvation.
 &nbsp; 6  This <I>is</I> the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy
 face, O Jacob. Selah.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 From this world, and the fulness thereof, the psalmist's meditations 
 rise, of a sudden to the great things of another world, the foundation 
 of which is not on the seas, nor on the floods. The things of this 
 world God has given to the children of men and we are much indebted to 
 his providence for them; but they will not make a portion for us. And 
 therefore,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is an enquiry after better things, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 This earth is God's footstool; but, if we had ever so much of it, we
 must be here but a while, must shortly go hence, and <I>Who then shall 
 ascend into the hill of the Lord?</I> Who shall go to heaven hereafter, 
 and, as an earnest of that, shall have communion with God in holy 
 ordinances now? A soul that knows and considers its own nature,
 origin, and immortality, when it has viewed the earth and the fulness 
 thereof, will sit down unsatisfied; there is not found among all the 
 creatures a help meet for man, and therefore it will think of ascending 
 towards God, towards heaven, will ask, "What shall I do to rise to that 
 high place, that hill, where the Lord dwells and manifests himself, 
 that I may be acquainted with him, and to abide in that happy holy 
 place where he meets his people and makes them holy and happy? What 
 shall I do that I may be of those whom God owns for his peculiar people 
 and who are his in another manner than the earth is his and its 
 fulness?" This question is much the same with that, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+15:1">Ps. xv. 1</A>.

 The hill of Zion on which the temple was built typified the church, 
 both visible and invisible. When the people attended the ark to its 
 holy place David puts them in mind that these were but patterns of 
 heavenly things, and therefore that by them they should be led to 
 consider the heavenly things themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An answer to this enquiry, in which we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The properties of God's peculiar people, who shall have communion 
 with him in grace and glory. 

 (1.) They are such as keep themselves from all the gross acts of sin. 
 They have <I>clean hands;</I> not spotted with the pollutions of the 
 world and the flesh. None that were ceremonially unclean might enter 
 into the mountain of the temple, which signified that cleanness of 
 conversation which is required in all those that have fellowship with 
 God. The hands lifted up in prayer must be pure hands, no blot of 
 unjust gain cleaving to them, nor any thing else that defiles the man 
 and is offensive to the holy God.

 (2.) They are such as make conscience of being really (that is, of 
 being inwardly) as good as they seem to be outwardly. They have <I>pure 
 hearts.</I> We make nothing of our religion if we do not make 
 heart-work of it. It is not enough that our hands be clean before men, 
 but we must also wash our hearts from wickedness, and not allow 
 ourselves in any secret heart-impurities, which are open before the eye 
 of God. Yet in vain do those pretend to have pure and good hearts whose 
 hands are defiled with the acts of sin. That is a pure heart which is 
 sincere and without guile in covenanting with God, which is carefully 
 guarded, that the wicked one, the unclean spirit, touch it not, which
 is purified by faith, and conformed to the image and will of God; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:8">Matt. v. 8</A>.

 (3.) They are such as do not set their affections upon the things of
 this world, do not <I>lift up their souls unto vanity,</I> whose hearts 
 are not carried out inordinately towards the wealth of this world, the 
 praise of men, or the delights of sense, who do not choose these things 
 for their portion, nor reach forth after them, because they believe 
 them to be vanity, uncertain and unsatisfying.

 (4.) They are such as deal honestly both with God and man. In their 
 covenant with God, and their contracts with men, they have not sworn 
 deceitfully, nor broken their promises, violated their engagements, nor 
 taken any false oath. Those that have no regard to the obligations of
 truth or the honour of God's name are unfit for a place in God's holy 
 hill.

 (5.) They are a praying people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>This is the generation of those that seek him.</I> In every age
 there is a remnant of such as these, men of this character, who are 
 <I>accounted to the Lord for a generation,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:30">Ps. xxii. 30</A>.

 And they are such as seek God, <I>that seek thy face, O Jacob!</I>

 [1.] They join themselves to God, to seek him, not only in earnest 
 prayer, but in serious endeavours to obtain his favour and keep 
 themselves in his love. Having made it the summit of their happiness, 
 they make it the summit of their ambition to be accepted of him, and 
 therefore take care and pains to approve themselves to him. It is to 
 the hill of the Lord that we must ascend, and, the way being up-hill, 
 we have need to put forth ourselves to the utmost, as those that seek 
 diligently. 

 [2.] They join themselves to the people of God, to seek God with them. 
 Being brought into communion with God, they come into communion of 
 saints; conforming to the patterns of the saints that have gone before 
 (so some understand this), they seek God's face, as Jacob (so some), 
 who was <I>therefore</I> surnamed <I>Israel,</I> because he wrestled 
 with God and prevailed, sought him and found him; and, associating with 
 the saints of their own day, they shall court the favour of God's 
 church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:9">Rev. iii. 9</A>),

 shall be glad of an acquaintance with God's people

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+8:23">Zech. viii. 23</A>),

 shall incorporate themselves with them, and, when they <I>subscribe
 with their hands to the Lord,</I> shall <I>call themselves by the name
 of Jacob,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+44:5">Isa. xliv. 5</A>.

 As soon as ever Paul was converted he <I>joined himself to the
 disciples,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+9:26">Acts ix. 26</A>.

 They shall seek God's face <I>in Jacob</I> (so some), that is, in the
 assemblies of his people. <I>Thy face, O God of Jacob!</I> so our
 margin supplies it, and makes it easy. As all believers are the
 spiritual seed of Abraham, so all that strive in prayer are the
 spiritual seed of Jacob, to whom God never said, <I>Seek you me in
 vain.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The privileges of God's peculiar people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 They shall be made truly and for ever happy.

 (1.) They shall be blessed: they shall receive the blessing from the
 Lord, all the fruits and gifts of God's favour, according to his 
 promise; and those whom God blesses are blessed indeed, for it is his 
 prerogative to command the blessing.

 (2.) They shall be justified and sanctified. These are the spiritual 
 blessings in heavenly things which they shall receive, even 
 righteousness, the very thing they hunger and thirst after,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+5:5">Matt. v. 6</A>.

 Righteousness is blessedness, and it is from God only that we must 
 expect it, for we have no righteousness of our own. They shall receive 
 the reward of their righteousness (so some), the <I>crown of
 righteousness which the righteous Judge shall give,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ti+4:8">2 Tim. iv. 8</A>.
 
 (3.) They shall be saved; for God himself will be the God of their
 salvation. Note, Where God gives righteousness he certainly designs 
 salvation. Those that are made meet for heaven shall be brought safely 
 to heaven, and then they will find what they have been seeking, to 
 their endless satisfaction.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 What is spoken once is spoken a second time in these verses; such
 repetitions are usual in songs, and have much beauty in them. Here is, 

 1. Entrance once and again demanded for the King of glory; the doors 
 and gates are to be thrown open, thrown wide open, to give him 
 admission, for behold he stands at the door and knocks, ready to come 
 in. 

 2. Enquiry once and again made concerning this mighty prince, in whose 
 name entrance is demanded: <I>Who is this King of glory?</I> As, when 
 any knock at our door, it is common to ask, <I>Who is there?</I> 

 3. Satisfaction once and again given concerning the royal person that
 makes the demand: <I>It is the Lord, strong and mighty, the Lord, 
 mighty in battle, the Lord of hosts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:8,10"><I>v.</I> 8, 10</A>.
 
 Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. This splendid entry here described it is probable refers to the 
 solemn bringing in of the ark into the tent David pitched for it or the 
 temple Solomon built for it; for, when David prepared materials for the 
 building of it, it was proper for him to prepare a psalm for the 
 dedication of it. The porters are called upon to open the doors, and 
 they are called <I>everlasting doors,</I> because much more durable 
 than the door of the tabernacle, which was but a curtain. They are 
 taught to ask, <I>Who is this King of glory?</I> And those that bore 
 the ark are taught to answer in the language before us, and very fitly, 
 because the ark was a symbol or token of God's presence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+3:11">Josh. iii. 11</A>.

 Or it may be taken as a poetical figure designed to represent the
 subject more affectingly. God, in his word and ordinances, is thus to 
 be welcomed by us, 

 1. With great readiness: the doors and gates must be thrown open to 
 him. Let the word of the Lord come into the innermost and uppermost 
 place in our souls; and, if we had 600 necks, we should bow them all to 
 the authority of it. 

 2. With all reverence, remembering how great a God he is with whom we 
 have to do, in all our approaches to him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Doubtless it points at Christ, of whom the ark, with the 
 mercy-seat, was a type. 

 1. We may apply it to the ascension of Christ into heaven and the 
 welcome given to him there. When he had finished his work on earth he 
 ascended <I>in the clouds of heaven,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:13,14">Dan. vii. 13, 14</A>.

 The gates of heaven must then be opened to him, those doors that may be
 truly called <I>everlasting,</I> which had been shut against us, to 
 keep the way of the tree of life, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:24">Gen. iii. 24</A>.

 Our Redeemer found them shut, but, having by his blood made atonement
 for sin and gained a title to <I>enter into the holy place</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+9:12">Heb. ix. 12</A>),

 as one having authority, he demanded entrance, not for himself only,
 but for us; for, as the forerunner, he has for us entered and <I>opened 
 the kingdom of heaven to all believers.</I> The keys not only of hell 
 and death, but of heaven and life, must be put into his hand. His 
 approach being very magnificent, the angels are brought in asking, 
 <I>Who is this King of glory?</I> For angels keep the gates of the New 
 Jerusalem, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+21:12">Rev. xxi. 12</A>.

 When the first-begotten was brought into the upper world the angels
 were to worship him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+1:6">Heb. i. 6</A>);

 and accordingly, they here ask with wonder, "Who is he?--this that
 cometh <I>with dyed garments from Bozrah?</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:1-3">Isa. lxiii. 1-3</A>),

 for he appears in that world <I>as a Lamb that had been slain.</I>" It
 is answered that he is <I>strong and mighty, mighty in battle,</I> to 
 save his people and subdue his and their enemies. 

 2. We may apply it to Christ's entrance into the souls of men by his 
 word and Spirit, that they may be his temples. Christ's presence in 
 them is like that of the ark in the temple; it sanctifies them. 
 <I>Behold, he stands at the door and knocks,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+3:20">Rev. iii. 20</A>.

 It is required that the gates and doors of the heart be opened to him,
 not only as admission is given to a guest, but as possession is 
 delivered to the rightful owner, after the title has been contested. 
 This is the gospel call and demand, that we let Jesus Christ, the King 
 of glory, come into our souls, and welcome him with hosannas, 
 <I>Blessed is he that cometh.</I> That we may do this aright we are 
 concerned to ask, <I>Who is this King of glory?</I>--to acquaint 
 ourselves with him, whom we are to believe in, and to love above all.
 And the answer is ready: He is <I>Jehovah,</I> and will be <I>Jehovah 
 our righteousness,</I> an all-sufficient Saviour to us, if we give him 
 entrance and entertainment. He is <I>strong and mighty,</I> and <I>the 
 Lord of hosts;</I> and therefore it is at our peril if we deny him 
 entrance; for he is able to avenge the affront; he can force his way, 
 and can break those in pieces with his iron rod that will not submit to 
 his golden sceptre.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this let our hearts cheerfully answer to this call, as it is 
 in the first words of the next psalm, <I>Unto thee, O Lord! do I lift
 up my soul.</I></P>
