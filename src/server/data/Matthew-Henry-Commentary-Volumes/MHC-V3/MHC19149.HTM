 <HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=50>
 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The foregoing psalm was a hymn of praise to the Creator; this is a hymn 
 of praise to the Redeemer. It is a psalm of triumph in the God of 
 Israel, and over the enemies of Israel. Probably it was penned upon
 occasion of some victory which Israel was blessed and honoured with. 
 Some conjecture that it was penned when David had taken the strong-hold 
 of Zion, and settled his government there. But it looks further, to the 
 kingdom of the Messiah, who, in the chariot of the everlasting gospel, 
 goes forth conquering and to conquer. To him, and his graces and 
 glories, we must have an eye, in singing this psalm, which proclaims, 
 
 I. Abundance of joy to all the people of God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+149:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. Abundance of terror to the proudest of their enemies,

 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The calls given to God's Israel to praise. <I>All his works</I> 
 were, in the foregoing psalm, excited to <I>praise him;</I> but here 
 his saints in a particular manner are required to bless him. Observe 
 then, 

 1. Who are called upon to praise God. <I>Israel</I> in general, the
 body of the church

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+149:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>),

 <I>the children of Zion</I> particularly, the inhabitants of that holy 
 hill, who are nearer to God than other Israelites; those that have the 
 word and ordinances of God near to them, that are not required to 
 travel far to them, are justly expected to do more in praising God than 
 others. All true Christians may call themselves <I>the children of 
 Zion,</I> for in faith and hope <I>we have come unto Mount Zion,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22">Heb. xii. 22</A>.

 The saints must praise God, saints in profession, saints in power, for 
 this is the intention of their sanctification; they are devoted to the 
 glory of God, and renewed by the grace of God, that <I>they may be unto 
 him for a name and a praise.</I> 

 2. What must be the principle of this praise, and that is holy joy in
 God: <I>Let Israel rejoice,</I> and <I>the children of Zion be 
 joyful,</I> and <I>the saints be joyful in glory.</I> Our praises of 
 God should flow from a heart filled with delight and triumph in God's 
 attributes, and our relation to him. Much of the power of godliness in 
 the heart consists in making God our chief joy and solacing ourselves 
 in him; and our faith in Christ is described by our rejoicing in him. 
 We then give honour to God when we take pleasure in him. We must <I>be 
 joyful in glory,</I> that is, in him as our glory, and in the interest 
 we have in him; and let us look upon it as our glory to be of those 
 that rejoice in God. 

 3. What must be the expressions of this praise. We must by all proper
 ways show forth the praises of God: <I>Sing to the Lord.</I> We must 
 entertain ourselves, and proclaim his name, by <I>singing praises to 
 him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+149:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 <I>singing aloud</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+149:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 for we should sing psalms with all our heart, as those that are not 
 only not ashamed of it, but are enlarged in it. We must sing a <I>new 
 song,</I> newly composed upon every special occasion, sing with new 
 affections, which make the song new, though the words have been used 
 before, and keep them from growing threadbare. Let God be <I>praised in 
 the dance with timbrel and harp,</I> according to the usage of the 
 Old-Testament church very early 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:20">Exod. xv. 20</A>),

 where we find God praised with <I>timbrels and dances.</I> Those who 
 from this urge the use of music in religious worship must by the same 
 rule introduce dancing, for they went together, as in David's dancing 
 before the ark, and 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+21:21">Judg. xxi. 21</A>.

 But, whereas many scriptures in the New Testament keep up singing as a 
 gospel-ordinance, none provide for the keeping up of music and dancing; 
 the gospel-canon for psalmody is to <I>sing with the spirit</I> and 
 <I>with the understanding.</I> 

 4. What opportunities must be taken for praising God, none must be let
 slip, but particularly,

 (1.) We must praise God in public, in the <I>solemn assembly</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+149:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),

 <I>in the congregation of saints.</I> The more the better; it is the 
 more like heaven. Thus God's name must be owned before the world; thus 
 the service must have a solemnity put upon it, and we must mutually 
 excite one another to it. The principle, end, and design of our coming 
 together in religious assemblies is that we may join together in 
 praising God. Other parts of the service must be in order to this. 

 (2.) We must praise him in private. <I>Let the saints</I> be so
 transported with their joy in God as to <I>sing aloud upon their 
 beds,</I> when they awake in the night, full of the praises of God, as 
 David,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:62">Ps. cxix. 62</A>.

 When God's Israel are brought to a quiet settlement, let them enjoy 
 that, with thankfulness to God; much more may true believers, that have 
 entered into God's rest, and find repose in Jesus Christ, sing aloud 
 for joy of that. Upon their sick-beds, their death-beds, let them sing 
 the praises of their God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The cause given to God's Israel for praise. Consider, 

 1. God's doings for them. They have reason to rejoice in God, to
 devote themselves to his honour and employ themselves in his service; 
 for it is he that made them. He gave us our being as men, and we have 
 reason to praise him for that, for it is a noble and excellent being. 
 He gave Israel their being as a people, as a church, made them what 
 they were, so very different from other nations. Let that people 
 therefore praise him, for he formed them for himself, on purpose that 
 they might <I>show forth his praise,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+43:21">Isa. xliii. 21</A>.

 Let Israel <I>rejoice in his Makers</I> (so it is in the original); for
 God said, <I>Let us make man;</I> and in this, some think, is the 
 mystery of the Trinity. 

 2. God's dominion over them. This follows upon the former: if he made
 them, he is their King; he that gave being no doubt may give law; and 
 this ought to be the matter of our joy and praise that we are under the 
 conduct and protection of such a wise and powerful King. <I>Rejoice 
 greatly, O daughter of Zion! for behold thy king comes,</I> the king 
 Messiah, whom God has <I>set upon his holy hill of Zion;</I> let all 
 the children of Zion <I>be joyful</I> in him, and go forth to meet him 
 with their hosannas,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zec+9:9">Zech. ix. 9</A>.

 3. God's delight in them. He is a king that rules by love, and
 therefore to be praised; for <I>the Lord takes pleasure in his 
 people,</I> in their services, in their prosperity, in communion with 
 them, and in the communications of his favour to them. He that is
 infinitely happy in the enjoyment of himself, and to whose felicity no 
 accession can be made, yet graciously condescends to <I>take pleasure 
 in his people,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+147:11">Ps. cxlvii. 11</A>.

 4. God's designs concerning them. Besides the present complacency he
 has in them, he has prepared for their future glory: <I>He will 
 beautify the meek,</I> the humble, and lowly, and contrite in heart, 
 that tremble at his word and submit to it, that are patient under their 
 afflictions and <I>show all meekness towards all men.</I> These men 
 vilify and asperse, but God will justify them, and wipe off their 
 reproach; nay, he will beautify them; they shall appear not only clear, 
 but comely, before all the world, with the comeliness that he puts upon 
 them. He will beautify them with salvation, with temporal salvations 
 (when God works remarkable deliverances for his people those that had 
 <I>been among the pots become as the wings of a dove covered with 
 silver,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+68:13">Ps. lxviii. 13</A>),

 but especially with eternal salvation. The righteous shall be
 beautified in that day when they <I>shine forth as the sun.</I> In the 
 hopes of this, let them now, in the darkest day, <I>sing a new 
 song.</I></P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  <I>Let</I> the high <I>praises</I> of God <I>be</I> in their mouth, and a
 twoedged sword in their hand;
 &nbsp; 7  To execute vengeance upon the heathen, <I>and</I> punishments upon
 the people;
 &nbsp; 8  To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with
 fetters of iron;
 &nbsp; 9  To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Israel of God are here represented triumphing over their enemies, 
 which is both the matter of their praise (let them give to God the 
 glory of those triumphs) and the recompence of their praise; those that 
 are truly thankful to God for their tranquillity shall be blessed with 
 victory. Or it may be taken as a further expression of their praise 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+149:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>let the high praises of God be in their mouth,</I> and then, in a 
 holy zeal for his honour, let them take a <I>two-edged sword in their 
 hand,</I> to fight his battles against the enemies of his kingdom. Now 
 this may be applied, 

 1. To the many victories which God blessed his people Israel with over
 the nations of Canaan and other nations that were devoted to 
 destruction. These began in Moses and Joshua, who, when they taught 
 Israel <I>the high praises of the Lord,</I> did withal put <I>a 
 two-edged sword in their hand;</I> David did so too, for, as he was the 
 sweet singer of Israel, so he was the captain of their hosts, and 
 taught the children of Judah the use of the bow

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+1:18">2 Sam. i. 18</A>),
 
 taught their hands to war, as God had taught his. Thus he and they
 went on victoriously, fighting the Lord's battles, and avenging 
 Israel's quarrels on those that had oppressed them; then they 
 <I>executed vengeance upon the heathen</I> (the Philistines, Moabites, 
 Ammonites, and others,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+8:1">2 Sam. viii. 1</A>,

 &c.) <I>and punishments upon the people,</I> for all the wrong they had
 done to God's people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+149:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 Their kings and nobles were taken prisoners 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+149:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>)

 and on some of them the judgment written was executed, as by Joshua on 
 the kings of Canaan, by Gideon on the princes of Midian, by Samuel on 
 Agag. The honour of this redounded to all the Israel of God; and to him 
 who put it upon them they return it entirely in their hallelujahs.
 Jehoshaphat's army had at the same time <I>the high praises of God in 
 their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand,</I> for they went 
 forth to war singing the praises of God, and then their sword did 
 execution, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:23">2 Chron. xx. 23</A>.

 Some apply it to the time of the Maccabees, when the Jews sometimes 
 gained great advantages against their oppressors. And if it seem 
 strange that the meek should, notwithstanding that character, be thus 
 severe, and upon kings and nobles too, here is one word that justifies 
 them in it; it is <I>the judgment written.</I> They do not do it from 
 any personal malice and revenge, or any bloody politics that they 
 govern themselves by, but by commission from God, according to his 
 direction, and in obedience to his command; and Saul lost his kingdom 
 for disobeying a command of this nature. Thus the kings of the earth 
 that shall be employed in the destruction of the New-Testament Babylon 
 will but <I>execute the judgment written,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+17:16,17">Rev. xvii. 16, 17</A>.

 But, since now no such special commissions can be produced, this will 
 by no means justify the violence either of subjects against their 
 princes or of princes against their subjects, or both against their 
 neighbours, under pretence of religion; for Christ never intended that 
 his gospel should be propagated by fire and sword or his righteousness 
 wrought by the wrath of man. When the high praises of God are in our 
 mouth with them we should have an olive-branch of peace in our hands. 
 
 2. To Christ's victories by the power of his gospel and grace over
 spiritual enemies, in which all believers are more than conquerors. The 
 word of God is the <I>two-edged sword</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+4:12">Heb. iv. 12</A>),

 the <I>sword of the Spirit</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+6:17">Eph. vi. 17</A>),

 which it is not enough to have in our armoury, we must have it in our 
 hand also, as our Master had, when he said, <I>It is written.</I> Now, 
 
 (1.) With this two-edged sword the first preachers of the gospel
 obtained a glorious victory over the powers of darkness; vengeance was 
 executed upon the gods of the heathen, by the conviction and conversion 
 of those that had been long their worshippers, and by the consternation 
 and confusion of those that would not repent

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+6:15">Rev. vi. 15</A>);

 the strongholds of Satan were cast down 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+10:4,5">2 Chron. x. 4, 5</A>);

 great men were made to tremble at the word, as Felix; Satan, the god of 
 this world, was cast out, according to the judgment given against him.
 <I>This</I> is the honour of all Christians, that their holy religion 
 has been so victorious. 

 (2.) With this two-edged sword believers fight against their own
 corruptions, and, through the grace of God, subdue and mortify them; 
 the sin that had dominion over them is crucified; self, that once sat 
 king, is bound with chains and brought into subjection to the yoke of 
 Christ; the tempter is foiled and bruised under their feet. <I>This
 honour have all the saints.</I>

 (3.) The complete accomplishment of this will be in the judgment of the
 great day, when <I>the Lord</I> shall come <I>with ten thousands of his 
 saints, to execute judgment upon all,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:14,15">Jude 14, 15</A>.

 Vengeance shall then be <I>executed upon the heathen</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+9:17">Ps. ix. 17</A>),

 <I>and punishments,</I> everlasting punishments, <I>upon the people. 
 Kings and nobles,</I> that cast away the bands and cords of Christ's 
 government 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:3">Ps. ii. 3</A>),

 shall not be able to cast away the chains and fetters of his wrath and 
 justice. Then shall be executed <I>the judgment written,</I> for <I>the 
 secrets of men shall be judged according to the gospel. This</I>
 honour shall all the saints have, that, as assessors with Christ, they 
 shall <I>judge the world,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+6:2">1 Cor. vi. 2</A>.

 In the prospect of that let them praise the Lord, and continue Christ's 
 faithful servants and soldiers to the end of their lives.</P>
