 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We must give glory to God by making confession, not only of his
 goodness but our own badness, which serve as foils to each other. Our
 badness makes his goodness appear the more illustrious, as his goodness
 makes our badness the more heinous and scandalous. The foregoing psalm
 was a history of God's goodness to Israel; this is a history of their
 rebellions and provocations, and yet it begins and ends with
 Hallelujah; for even sorrow for sin must not put us out of tune for
 praising God. Some think it was penned at the time of the captivity in
 Babylon and the dispersion of the Jewish nation thereupon, because of
 that prayer in the close,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:47">ver. 47</A>.

 I rather think it was penned by David at the same time with the 
 foregoing psalm, because we find the first verse and the last two 
 verses in that psalm which David delivered to Asaph, at the bringing up 
 of the ark to the place he had prepared for it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:1,47,48,1Ch+16:34-36">1 Chron. xvi. 34-36</A>),

 "Gather us from among the heathen;" for we may suppose that in Saul's 
 time there was a great dispersion of pious Israelites, when David was
 forced to wander. In this psalm we have,

 I. The preface to the narrative, speaking honour to God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>),

 comfort to the saints

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:3">ver. 3</A>),

 and the desire of the faithful towards God's favour,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 II. The narrative itself of the sins of Israel, aggravated by the
 great things God did for them, an account of which is intermixed. Their
 provocations at the Red Sea 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:6-12">ver. 6-12</A>),

 lusting 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:13-15">ver. 13-15</A>),
 
 mutinying
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:16-18">ver. 16-18</A>),
 
 worshipping the golden calf 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:19-23">ver. 19-23</A>),
 
 murmuring 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:24-27">ver. 24-27</A>),
 
 joining themselves to Baal-peor 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:28-31">ver. 28-31</A>),

 quarrelling with Moses 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:32,33">ver. 32, 33</A>),

 incorporating themselves with the nations of Canaan, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:34-39">ver. 34-39</A>.

 To this is added an account how God had rebuked them for their sins,
 and yet saved them from ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:40-46">ver. 40-46</A>.

 III. The conclusion of the psalm with prayer and praise, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:47,48">ver. 47, 48</A>.

 It may be of use to us to sing this psalm, that, being put in mind by
 it of our sins, the sins of our land, and the sins of our fathers, we
 may be humbled before God and yet not despair of mercy, which even
 rebellious Israel often found with God.</P>

 good: for his mercy <I>endureth</I> for ever.

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here taught,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. To bless God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>):

 <I>Praise you the Lord,</I> that is, 

 1. Give him thanks for his goodness, the manifestation of it to us, and
 the many instances of it. <I>He is good</I> and <I>his mercy endures
 for ever;</I> let us therefore own our obligations to him and make him 
 a return of our best affections and services. 

 2. Give him the glory of his greatness, his <I>mighty acts,</I> proofs 
 of his almighty power, wherein he has done great things, and such as 
 would be opposed. <I>Who can utter these?</I> Who is worthy to do it? 
 Who is able to do it? They are so many that they cannot be numbered, so 
 mysterious that they cannot be described; when we have said the most we 
 can of the mighty acts of the Lord, the one half is not told; still 
 there is more to be said; it is a subject that cannot be exhausted. We 
 must <I>show forth his praise;</I> we may show forth some of it, but 
 <I>who can show forth all?</I> Not the angels themselves. This will not 
 excuse us in not doing what we can, but should quicken us to do all we 
 can.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. To bless the people of God, to call and account them happy 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 <I>Those that keep judgment are blessed,</I> for they are fit to be 
 employed in praising God. God's people are those whose principles are 
 sound--<I>They keep judgment</I> (they adhere to the rules of wisdom and
 religion, and their practices are agreeable); they <I>do 
 righteousness,</I> are just to God and to all men, and herein they are 
 steady and constant; they do it <I>at all times,</I> in all manner of 
 conversation, at every turn, in every instance, and herein persevering 
 to the end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. To bless ourselves in the favour of God, to place our happiness in 
 it, and to seek it, accordingly, with all seriousness, as the psalmist 
 here, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 1. He has an eye to the lovingkindness of God, as the fountain of all
 happiness: "<I>Remember me, O Lord!</I> to give me that mercy and grace 
 which I stand in need of, <I>with the favour which thou bearest to thy 
 people.</I>" As there are a people in the world who are in a peculiar 
 manner God's people, so there is a peculiar favour which God bears to 
 that people, which all gracious souls desire an interest in; and we 
 need desire no more to make us happy. 

 2. He has an eye to the salvation of God, the great salvation, that of 
 the soul, as the foundation of happiness: <I>O visit me with thy 
 salvation.</I> "Afford me (says Dr. Hammond) that pardon and that
 grace which I stand in need of, and can hope for from none but thee." 
 Let that salvation be my portion for ever, and the pledges of it my 
 present comfort. 

 3. He has an eye to the blessedness of the righteous, as that which
 includes all good

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>That I may see the good of thy chosen</I> and be as happy as the 
 saints are; and happier I do not desire to be." God's people are here 
 called his <I>chosen,</I> his <I>nation,</I> his <I>inheritance;</I> 
 for he has set them apart for himself, incorporated them under his own 
 government, is served by them and glorified in them. The chosen people
 of God have a good which is peculiar to them, which is the matter both 
 of their gladness and of their glorying, which is their pleasure, and 
 their praise. God's people have reason to be a cheerful people, and to 
 boast in their God all the day long; and those who have that gladness, 
 that glory, need not envy any of the children of men their pleasure or 
 pride. The gladness of God's nation, and the glory of his inheritance,
 are enough to satisfy any man; for they have everlasting joy and glory 
 at the end of them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity,
 we have done wickedly.
 &nbsp; 7  Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they
 remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked <I>him</I>
 at the sea, <I>even</I> at the Red sea.
 &nbsp; 8  Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might
 make his mighty power to be known.
 &nbsp; 9  He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led
 them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
 &nbsp; 10  And he saved them from the hand of him that hated <I>them,</I>
 and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
 &nbsp; 11  And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of
 them left.
 &nbsp; 12  Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here begins a penitential confession of sin, which was in a special 
 manner seasonable now that the church was in distress; for thus we must 
 justify God in all that he brings upon us, acknowledging that 
 <I>therefore</I> he has done right, because <I>we have done 
 wickedly;</I> and the remembrance of former sins, notwithstanding which 
 God did not cast off his people, is an encouragement to us to hope 
 that, though we are justly corrected for our sins, yet we shall not be 
 utterly abandoned.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. God's afflicted people here own themselves guilty before God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):
 
 "<I>We have sinned with our fathers,</I> that is, like our fathers, 
 after the similitude of their transgression. We have added to the stock 
 of hereditary guilt, and filled up the measure of our fathers' 
 iniquity, <I>to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord,</I>" 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+32:14,Mt+23:32">Num. xxxii. 14; Matt. xxiii. 32</A>.

 And see how they lay a load upon themselves, as becomes penitents:
 "<I>We have committed iniquity,</I> that which is in its own nature
 sinful, and <I>we have done wickedly;</I> we have sinned with a high
 hand presumptuously." Or this is a confession, not only of their
 imitation of, but their interest in, their fathers' sins: <I>We have
 sinned with our fathers,</I> for we were in their loins and we <I>bear
 their iniquity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+5:7">Lam. v. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. They bewail the sins of their fathers when they were first formed into a people, which, since children often smart for, they are concerned to sorrow for, even further than to the third and fourth generation. Even we now ought to take occasion from

 the history of Israel's rebellions to lament the depravity and 
 perverseness of man's nature and its unaptness to be amended by the 
 most probable means. Observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The strange stupidity of Israel in the midst of the favours God 
 bestowed upon them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 <I>They understood not thy wonders in Egypt.</I> They saw them, but 
 they did not rightly apprehend the meaning and design of them. 
 <I>Blessed are those that have not seen, and yet have</I> understood. 
 They thought the plagues of Egypt were intended for their deliverance, 
 whereas they were intended also for their instruction and conviction, 
 not only to force them out of their Egyptian slavery, but to cure them 
 of their inclination to Egyptian idolatry, by evidencing the sovereign 
 power and dominion of the God of Israel, above all gods, and his 
 particular concern for them. We lose the benefit of providences for 
 want of understanding them. And, as their understandings were dull, so 
 their memories were treacherous; though one would think such 
 astonishing events should never have been forgotten, yet they 
 remembered them not, at least <I>they remembered not the multitude 
 of</I> God's <I>mercies</I> in them. <I>Therefore</I> God is
 distrusted because his favours are not remembered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Their perverseness arising from this stupidity: <I>They provoked him 
 at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</I> The provocation was, despair of 
 deliverance (because the danger was great) and wishing they had been 
 left in Egypt still, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:11,12">Exod. xiv. 11, 12</A>.

 Quarrelling with God's providence, and questioning his power, goodness,
 and faithfulness, are as great provocations to him as any whatsoever. 
 The place aggravated the crime; it was <I>at the sea, at the Red 
 Sea,</I> when they had newly come out of Egypt and the wonders God had 
 wrought for them were fresh in their minds; yet they reproach him, as 
 if all that power had no mercy in it, but he had brought them out of 
 Egypt on purpose to <I>kill them in the wilderness.</I> They never lay 
 at God's mercy so immediately as in their passage through the Red Sea, 
 yet there they affront it, and provoke his wrath.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. The great salvation God wrought for them notwithstanding their 
 provocations, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:8-11"><I>v.</I> 8-11</A>.

 (1.) He forced a passage for them through the sea: <I>He rebuked the
 Red Sea</I> for standing in their way and retarding their march, <I>and 
 it was dried up</I> immediately; as, in the creation, <I>at God's 
 rebuke the waters fled,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:7">Ps. civ. 7</A>.

 Nay, he not only prepared them a way, but, by the pillar of cloud and 
 fire, he <I>led them</I> into the sea, and, by the conduct of Moses, 
 led them through it as readily as <I>through the wilderness.</I> He 
 encouraged them to take those steps, and subdued their fears, when 
 those were their most dangerous and threatening enemies. See 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+63:12-14">Isa. lxiii. 12-14</A>.

 (2.) He interposed between them and their pursuers, and prevented them
 from cutting them off, as they designed. The Israelites were all on 
 foot, and the Egyptians had all of them chariots and horses, with which 
 they were likely to overtake them quickly, but God <I>saved them from 
 the hand of him that hated them,</I> namely, Pharaoh, who never loved 
 them, but now hated them the more for the plagues he had suffered on 
 their account. <I>From the hand of</I> his <I>enemy,</I> who was just 
 ready to seize them, <I>God redeemed them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 interposing himself, as it were, in the pillar of fire, between the 
 persecuted and the persecutors. 

 (3.) To complete the mercy, and turn the deliverance into a victory, 
 the Red Sea, which was a lane to them, was a grave to the Egyptians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The waters covered their enemies,</I> so as to slay them, but not so 
 as to conceal their shame; for, the next tide, they were thrown up dead 
 upon the shore,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:30">Exod. xiv. 30</A>.

 <I>There was not one of them left</I> alive, to bring tidings of what
 had become of the rest. And why did God do this for them? Nay, why did
 he not cover them, as he did their enemies, for their unbelief and
 murmuring? He tells us 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 it was <I>for his name's sake.</I> Though they did not deserve this 
 favour, he designed it; and their undeservings should not alter his 
 designs, nor break his measures, nor make him withdraw his promise, or 
 fail in the performance of it. He did this for his own glory, <I>that 
 he might make his mighty power to be known,</I> not only in dividing 
 the sea, but in doing it notwithstanding their provocations. Moses
 prays

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:17,19">Num. xiv. 17, 19</A>),

 <I>Let the power of my Lord be great and pardon the iniquity of this 
 people.</I> The power of the God of grace in pardoning sin and sparing 
 sinners is as much to be admired as the power of the God of nature in 
 dividing the waters.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. The good impression this made upon them for the present 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):
 
 <I>Then believed they his words,</I> and acknowledged that God was with
 them of a truth, and had, in mercy to them, brought them out of Egypt, 
 and not with any design to slay them in the wilderness; then <I>they 
 feared the Lord and his servant Moses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+14:31">Exod. xiv. 31</A>.

 Then <I>they sang his praise,</I> in that song of Moses penned on this
 great occasion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:1">Exod. xv. 1</A>.

 See in what a gracious and merciful way God sometimes silences the
 unbelief of his people, and turns their fears into praises; and so it
 is written, <I>Those that erred in spirit shall come to
 understanding,</I> and <I>those that murmured shall learn doctrine,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+29:24">Isa. xxix. 24</A>.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>13  They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
 &nbsp; 14  But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in
 the desert.
 &nbsp; 15  And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their
 soul.
 &nbsp; 16  They envied Moses also in the camp, <I>and</I> Aaron the saint of
 the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 17  The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the
 company of Abiram.
 &nbsp; 18  And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up
 the wicked.
 &nbsp; 19  They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
 &nbsp; 20  Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox
 that eateth grass.
 &nbsp; 21  They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things
 in Egypt;
 &nbsp; 22  Wondrous works in the land of Ham, <I>and</I> terrible things by
 the Red sea.
 &nbsp; 23  Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses
 his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his
 wrath, lest he should destroy <I>them.</I>
 &nbsp; 24  Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
 word:
 &nbsp; 25  But murmured in their tents, <I>and</I> hearkened not unto the
 voice of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 26  Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow
 them in the wilderness:
 &nbsp; 27  To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to
 scatter them in the lands.
 &nbsp; 28  They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the
 sacrifices of the dead.
 &nbsp; 29  Thus they provoked <I>him</I> to anger with their inventions: and
 the plague brake in upon them.
 &nbsp; 30  Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and <I>so</I> the
 plague was stayed.
 &nbsp; 31  And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
 generations for evermore.
 &nbsp; 32  They angered <I>him</I> also at the waters of strife, so that it
 went ill with Moses for their sakes:
 &nbsp; 33  Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake
 unadvisedly with his lips.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This is an abridgment of the history of Israel's provocations in the
 wilderness, and of the wrath of God against them for those
 provocations: and this abridgment is abridged by the apostle, with
 application to us Christians

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:5">1 Cor. x. 5</A>,

 &c.); for these things were
 <I>written for our admonition,</I> that we sin not like them, lest we 
 suffer like them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The cause of their sin was disregard to the works and word of God, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 1. They minded not what he had done for them: <I>They soon forgot his
 works,</I> and lost the impressions they had made upon them. Those
 that do not improve God's mercies to them, nor endeavour in some 
 measure to render according to the benefit done unto them, do indeed 
 forget them. This people soon forgot them (God took notice of this,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:8">Exod. xxxii. 8</A>,

 <I>They have turned aside quickly): They made haste, they forgot his
 works</I> (so it is in the margin), which some make to be two separate 
 instances of their sin. <I>They made haste;</I> their expectations 
 anticipated God's promises; they expected to be in Canaan shortly, and 
 because they were not they questioned whether they should ever be there 
 and quarrelled with all the difficulties they met with in their way; 
 whereas <I>he that believeth does not make haste,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:16">Isa. xxviii. 16</A>.

 And, withal, <I>they forgot his works,</I> which were the undeniable
 evidences of his wisdom, power, and goodness, and denied the conclusion 
 as confidently as if they had never seen the premises proved. This is 
 mentioned again 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>):

 <I>They forgot God their Saviour;</I> that is, they forgot that he had 
 been their Saviour. Those that forget the works of God forget God 
 himself, who makes himself known by his works. They forgot what was
 done but a few days before, which we may suppose they could not but 
 talk of, even then, when, because they did not make a good use of it, 
 they are said to forget it: it was what God did for them <I>in Egypt, 
 in the land of Ham,</I> and <I>by the Red Sea,</I> things which we at 
 this distance cannot, or should not, be unmindful of. They are called 
 <I>great things</I> (for, though the great God does nothing mean, yet 
 he does some things that are in a special manner great), <I>wondrous 
 works,</I> out of the common road of Providence, therefore observable, 
 therefore memorable, and <I>terrible things,</I> awful to them, and 
 dreadful to their enemies, and yet soon forgotten. Even miracles that
 were seen passed away with them as tales that are told. 

 2. They minded not what God had said to them nor would they depend upon 
 it: <I>They waited not for his counsel,</I> did not attend his word, 
 though they had Moses to be his mouth to them; they took up resolves 
 about which they did not consult him and made demands without calling 
 upon him. They would be in Canaan directly, and had not patience to
 tarry God's time. The delay was intolerable, and therefore the 
 difficulties were looked upon as insuperable. This is explained

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>They believed not his word,</I> his promise that he would make them 
 masters of Canaan; and 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>),

 <I>They hearkened not to the voice of the Lord,</I> who gave them 
 counsel which they would not wait for, not only by Moses and Aaron, but 
 by Caleb and Joshua,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:6,7">Num. xiv. 6, 7</A>,

 &c. Those that will not wait for God's counsel shall justly be given up
 to their own hearts' lusts, to walk in their own counsels.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Many of their sins are here mentioned, together with the tokens of 
 God's displeasure which they fell under for those sins.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They would have flesh, and yet would not believe that God could give 
 it to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>They lusted a lust</I> (so the word is) <I>in the wilderness;</I> 
 there, where they had bread enough and to spare, yet nothing would 
 serve them but they must have flesh to eat. They were now purely at 
 God's finding, being supported entirely by miracles, so that this was a 
 reflection upon the wisdom and goodness of their Creator. They were 
 also, in all probability, within a step of Canaan, yet had not patience 
 to stay for dainties till they came thither. They had flocks and herds 
 of their own, but they will not kill them; God must give them flesh as 
 he gave them bread, or they will never give him credit, or their good 
 word. They did not only wish for flesh, <I>but</I> they <I>lusted 
 exceedingly</I> after it. A desire, even of lawful things, when it is 
 inordinate and violent, becomes sinful; and therefore this is called 
 <I>lusting after evil things</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+10:6">1 Cor. x. 6</A>),
 
 though the quails, as God's gift, were good things, and were so spoken
 of, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+105:40">Ps. cv. 40</A>.

 Yet this was not all: <I>They tempted God in the desert,</I> where they
 had had such experience of his goodness and power, and questioned
 whether he could and would gratify them herein. See
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+78:19,20">Ps. lxxviii. 19, 20</A>.

 Now how did God show his displeasure against them for this. We are told
 how 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>He gave them their request,</I> but gave it them in anger, and with 
 a curse, for he <I>sent leanness into their soul;</I> he filled them 
 with uneasiness of mind, and terror of conscience, and a self-reproach, 
 occasioned by their bodies being sick with the surfeit, such as 
 sometimes drunkards experience after a great debauch. Or this is put 
 for that great plague with which the Lord smote them, <I>while the 
 flesh was yet between their teeth,</I> as we read,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+11:33">Num. xi. 33</A>.

 It was the consumption of the life. Note, 

 (1.) What is asked in passion is often given in wrath.

 (2.) Many that fare deliciously every day, and whose bodies are 
 healthful and fat, have, at the same time, leanness in their souls, no 
 love to God, no thankfulness, no appetite to the bread of life, and 
 then the soul must needs be lean. Those wretchedly forget themselves 
 that feast their bodies and starve their souls. <I>Then</I> God gives 
 the good things of this life in love, when with them he gives grace to 
 glorify him in the use of them; for then <I>the soul delights itself in 
 fatness,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+55:2">Isa. lv. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They quarrelled with the government which God had set over them both 
 in church and state 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>They envied Moses</I> his authority <I>in the camp,</I> as 
 generalissimo of the armies of Israel and chief justice in all their 
 courts; they envied <I>Aaron</I> his power, as <I>saint of the 
 Lord,</I> consecrated to the office of high priest, and Korah would 
 needs put in for the pontificate, while Dathan and Abiram, as princes 
 of the tribe of Reuben, Jacob's eldest son, would claim to be chief 
 magistrates, by the so-much-admired right of primogeniture. Note,
 Those are preparing ruin for themselves who envy those whom God has put 
 honour upon and usurp the dignities they were never designed for. And 
 justly will contempt be poured upon those who put contempt upon any of 
 the saints of the Lord. How did God show his displeasure for this? We 
 are told how, and it is enough to make us tremble 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:17,18"><I>v.</I> 17, 18</A>);

 we have the story,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:32,35">Num. xvi. 32, 35</A>.

 (1.) Those that flew in the face of the civil authority were punished 
 by <I>the earth,</I> which <I>opened and swallowed them up,</I> as not 
 fit to go upon God's ground, because they would not submit to God's 
 government. 

 (2.) Those that would usurp the ecclesiastical authority in things 
 pertaining to God suffered the vengeance of heaven, for <I>fire came 
 out from the Lord and consumed them,</I> and the pretending sacrificers 
 were themselves sacrificed to divine justice. <I>The flame burnt up the 
 wicked;</I> for though they vied with <I>Aaron, the saint of the 
 Lord,</I> for holiness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+16:3,5">Num. xvi. 3, 5</A>),

 yet God adjudged them wicked, and as such cut them off, as in due time 
 he will destroy the man of sin, that wicked one, notwithstanding his 
 proud pretensions to holiness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They made and worshipped the golden calf, and this in Horeb, where
 the law was given, and where God had expressly said, <I>Thou shalt</I> 
 neither <I>make any graven image</I> nor <I>bow down</I> to it; they 
 did both: <I>They made a calf and worshipped</I> it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Herein they bade defiance to, and put an affront upon, the two 
 great lights which God has made to rule the moral world:--

 [1.] That of human reason; for <I>they changed their glory,</I> their 
 God, at least the manifestation of him, which always had been in a 
 cloud (either a dark cloud or a bright one), without any manner of 
 visible similitude, <I>into the similitude of</I> Apis, one of the 
 Egyptian idols, <I>an ox that eateth grass,</I> than which nothing 
 could be more grossly and scandalously absurd,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 Idolaters are perfectly besotted, and put the greatest disparagement
 possible both upon God, in representing him by the image of a beast,
 and upon themselves, in worshipping it when they have so done. That
 which is here said to be the changing of their glory is explained by
 St. Paul 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:23">Rom. i. 23</A>)

 to be the <I>changing of the glory of the incorruptible God.</I> 

 [2.] That of divine revelation, which was afforded to them, not only in 
 the words God spoke to them, but in the works he wrought for them, 
 <I>wondrous works,</I> which declared aloud that the Lord Jehovah is 
 the only true and living God and is alone to be worshipped,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:21,22"><I>v.</I> 21, 22</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) For this God showed his displeasure by declaring the decree that 
 he would cut them off from being a people, as they had, as far as lay 
 in their power, in effect cut him off from being a God; he <I>spoke of 
 destroying them</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 and certainly he would have done it if <I>Moses, his chosen, had not 
 stood before him in the breach</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>),

 if he had not seasonably interposed to deal with God as an advocate 
 about the breach or ruin God was about to devote them to and 
 wonderfully prevailed to turn away his wrath. See here the mercy of 
 God, and how easily his anger is turned away, even from a provoking 
 people. See the power of prayer, and the interest which God's chosen 
 have in heaven. See a type of Christ, God's <I>chosen,</I> his 
 <I>elect, in whom his soul delights,</I> who <I>stood before him in the 
 breach</I> to <I>turn away</I> his wrath from a provoking world, and 
 ever lives, for this end, making intercession.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They gave credit to the report of the evil spies concerning the land 
 of Canaan, in contradiction to the promise of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 <I>They despised the pleasant land.</I> Canaan was a pleasant land,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:7">Deut. viii. 7</A>.
 
 They undervalued it when they thought it not worth venturing for, no,
 not under the guidance of God himself, and therefore were for making a 
 captain and returning to Egypt again. They <I>believed not God's 
 word</I> concerning it, but <I>murmured in their tents,</I> basely 
 charging God with a design upon them in bringing them thither that they 
 might become a prey to the Canaanites, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:2,3">Num. xiv. 2, 3</A>.

 And, when they were reminded of God's power and promise, they were so 
 far from hearkening to that voice of the Lord that they attempted to 
 stone those who spoke to them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+14:10">Num. xiv. 10</A>.

 The heavenly Canaan is a pleasant land. A promise is left us of
 entering into it; but there are many that despise it, that neglect and 
 refuse the offer of it, that prefer the wealth and pleasure of this 
 world before it, and grudge the pains and hazards of this life to 
 obtain that. This also was so displeasing to God that <I>he lifted up 
 his hand against them,</I> in a way of threatening, <I>to destroy them 
 in the wilderness;</I> nay, in a way of swearing, for he swore in his 
 wrath that they should not enter into his rest 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+95:11,Nu+14:28">Ps. xcv. 11; Num. xiv. 28</A>);

 nay, and he threatened that their children also should be <I>overthrown 
 and scattered</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:26,27"><I>v.</I> 26, 27</A>),

 and the whole nation dispersed and disinherited; but Moses prevailed 
 for mercy for their seed, that they might enter Canaan. Note, Those who 
 despise God's favours, and particularly the pleasant land, forfeit his 
 favours, and will be shut out for ever from the pleasant land.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. They were guilty of a great sin in the matter of Peor; and this was 
 the sin of the new generation, when they were within a step of Canaan 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>):

 <I>They joined themselves to Baal-peor,</I> and so were entangled both 
 in idolatry and in adultery, in corporeal and in spiritual whoredom,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:1-3">Num. xxv. 1-3</A>.

 Those that did often partake of the altar of the living God now <I>ate 
 the sacrifices of the dead,</I> of the idols of Moab (that were dead 
 images, or dead men canonized or deified), or sacrifices to the 
 infernal deities on the behalf of their dead friends. <I>Thus they 
 provoked God to anger with their inventions</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 in contempt of him and his institutions, his commands, and his 
 threatenings. The iniquity of Peor was so great that, long after, it is 
 said, <I>They were not cleansed from it,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+22:17">Josh. xxii. 17</A>.

 God testified his displeasure at this, 

 (1.) By sending a plague among them, which in a little time swept away 
 24,000 of those impudent sinners. 

 (2.) By stirring up Phinehas to use his power as a magistrate for the 
 suppressing of the sin and checking the contagion of it. He stood up in 
 his zeal for the Lord of hosts, and executed judgment upon Zimri and 
 Cozbi, sinners of the first rank, genteel sinners; he put the law in 
 execution upon them, and this was a service so pleasing to God that 
 upon it <I>the plague was stayed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 By this, and some other similar acts of public justice on that occasion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+25:4,5">Num. xxv. 4, 5</A>),
 
 the guilt ceased to be national, and the general controversy was let
 fall. When the proper officers did their duty God left it to them, and
 did not any longer keep the work in his own hands by the plague. Note, 
 National justice prevents national judgments. But, Phinehas herein 
 signalizing himself, a special mark of honour was put upon him, for 
 what he did was <I>counted to him for righteousness to all 
 generations</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>),

 and, in recompence of it, the priesthood was entailed on his family. 
 <I>He</I> shall make an atonement by offering up the sacrifices, who 
 had so bravely made an atonement (so some read it, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>)

 by offering up the sinners. Note, It is the honour of saints to be
 zealous against sin.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. They continued their murmurings to the very last of their 
 wanderings; for in the fortieth year they <I>angered God at the waters 
 of strife</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>),
 
 which refers to that story,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+20:3-5">Num. xx. 3-5</A>.

 And that which aggravated it now was that <I>it went ill with Moses for 
 their sakes;</I> for, though he was the meekest of all the men in the 
 earth, yet their clamours at that time were so peevish and provoking 
 that they put him into a passion, and, having now grown very old and 
 off his guard, <I>he spoke unadvisedly with his lips</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>),

 and not as became him on that occasion; for he said in a heat, <I>Hear 
 now, you rebels, must we fetch water out of this rock for you?</I> This 
 was Moses's infirmity, and is written for our admonition, that we may 
 learn, when we are in the midst of provocation, to keep our mouth as 
 with a bridle

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:1-3">Ps. xxxix. 1-3</A>),

 and to <I>take heed to our spirits,</I> that they admit not resentments 
 too much; for, when the spirit is provoked, it is much ado, even for 
 those that have a great deal of wisdom and grace, not to <I>speak 
 unadvisedly.</I> But it is charged upon the people as their sin: 
 <I>They provoked his spirit</I> with that with which they angered God 
 himself. Note, We must answer not only for our own passions, but for 
 the provocation which by them we give to the passions of others, 
 especially of those who, if not greatly provoked, would be meek and 
 quiet. God shows his displeasure against this sin of theirs by shutting 
 Moses and Aaron out of Canaan for their misconduct upon this occasion, 
 by which, 

 (1.) God discovered his resentment of all such intemperate heats, even 
 in the dearest of his servants. If he deals thus severely with Moses 
 for one unadvised word, what does their sin deserve who have spoken so 
 many presumptuous wicked words? <I>If this was done in the green tree, 
 what shall be done in the dry?</I> 

 (2.) God deprived them of the blessing of Moses's guidance and 
 government at a time when they most needed it, so that his death was 
 more a punishment to them than to himself. It is just with God to 
 remove those relations from us that are blessings to us, when we are 
 peevish and provoking to them and grieve their spirits.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here, 

 I. The narrative concludes with an account of Israel's conduct in 
 Canaan, which was of a piece with that in the wilderness, and God's 
 dealings with them, wherein, as all along, both justice and mercy 
 appeared.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They were very provoking to God. The miracles and mercies which 
 settled them in Canaan made no more deep and durable impressions upon 
 them than those which fetched them out of Egypt; for by the time they 
 were just settled in Canaan they corrupted themselves, and forsook God.
 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) The steps of their apostasy. 

 [1.] They spared the nations which God had doomed to destruction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>);

 when they had got the good land God had promised them they had no zeal 
 against the wicked inhabitants whom the Lord commanded them to 
 extirpate, pretending pity; but so merciful is God that no man needs to 
 be in any case more compassionate than he. 

 [2.] When they spared them they promised themselves that, 
 notwithstanding this, they would not join in any dangerous affinity 
 with them. But the way of sin is down-hill; omissions make way for 
 commissions; when they neglect to <I>destroy the heathen</I> the next 
 news we hear is, They were <I>mingled among the heathen,</I> made 
 leagues with them and contracted an intimacy with them, so that they 
 <I>learned their works,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:35"><I>v.</I> 35</A>.
 
 That which is rotten will sooner corrupt that which is sound than be
 cured or made sound by it. 

 [3.] When they mingled with them, and learned some of their works that 
 seemed innocent diversions and entertainments, yet they thought they 
 would never join with them in their worship; but by degrees they 
 learned that too

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:36"><I>v.</I> 36</A>):

 <I>They served their idols</I> in the same manner, and with the same 
 rites, that they served them; and they became <I>a snare to them.</I> 
 That sin drew on many more, and brought the judgments of God upon them, 
 which they themselves could not but be sensible of and yet knew not how 
 to recover themselves. 

 [4.] When they joined with them in some of their idolatrous services, 
 which they thought had least harm in them, they little thought that 
 ever they should be guilty of that barbarous and inhuman piece of 
 idolatry the sacrificing of their living children to their dead gods; 
 but they came to that at last

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:37,38"><I>v.</I> 37, 38</A>),

 in which Satan triumphed over his worshippers, and regaled himself in 
 blood and slaughter: <I>They sacrificed their sons and daughters,</I> 
 pieces of themselves, to devils, and added murder, the most unnatural 
 murder, to their idolatry; one cannot think of it without horror. They 
 <I>shed innocent blood,</I> the most innocent, for it was infant-blood, 
 nay, it was the <I>blood of their sons and their daughters.</I> See the 
 power of the spirit that works in the children of disobedience, and see 
 his malice. The beginning of idolatry and superstition, like that of 
 strife, is as the letting forth of water, and there is no villany which 
 those that venture upon it can be sure they shall stop short of, for 
 God justly <I>gives them up to a reprobate mind,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:28">Rom. i. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Their sin was, in part, their own punishment; for by it, 

 [1.] They wronged their country: <I>The land was polluted with 
 blood,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:38"><I>v.</I> 38</A>.
 
 That pleasant land, that holy land, was rendered uncomfortable to
 themselves, and unfit to receive those kind tokens of God's favour and 
 presence in it which were designed to be its honour. 

 [2.] They wronged their consciences

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:39"><I>v.</I> 39</A>):

 <I>They went a whoring with their own inventions,</I> and so debauched 
 their own minds, and were <I>defiled with their own works,</I> and 
 rendered odious in the eyes of the holy God, and perhaps of their own 
 consciences.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. God brought his judgments upon them; and what else could be 
 expected? For his name is Jealous, and he is a jealous God. 

 (1.) He fell out with them for it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:40"><I>v.</I> 40</A>.

 He was angry with them: <I>The wrath of God,</I> that consuming fire,
 <I>was kindled against his people;</I> for from them he took it as more 
 insulting and ungrateful than from the heathen that never knew him. 
 Nay, he was sick of them: <I>He abhorred his own inheritance,</I> which 
 once he had taken pleasure in; yet the change was not in him, but in 
 them. This is the worst thing in sin, that it makes us loathsome to 
 God; and the nearer any are to God in profession the more loathsome are 
 they if they rebel against him, like a dunghill at our door. 

 (2.) Their enemies then fell upon them, and, their defence having 
 departed, made an easy prey of them

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:41,42"><I>v.</I> 41, 42</A>):
 
 <I>He gave them into the hands of the heathen.</I> Observe here how the 
 punishment answered to the sin: They <I>mingled with the heathen and 
 learned their works;</I> from them they willingly took the infection of 
 sin, and therefore God justly made use of them as the instruments of 
 their correction. Sinners often see themselves ruined by those by whom 
 they have suffered themselves to be debauched. Satan, who is a tempter, 
 will be a tormentor. The heathen hated them. Apostates lose all the 
 love on God's side, and get none on Satan's; and when those that 
 <I>hated them ruled over them,</I> and they were brought into 
 subjection under them, no marvel that they oppressed them and ruled 
 them with rigour; and thus God made them know the difference between 
 <I>his service and the service of the kings of the countries,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+12:8">2 Chron. xii. 8</A>.

 (3.) When God granted them some relief, yet they went on in their sins,
 and their troubles also were continued, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:43"><I>v.</I> 43</A>.

 This refers to the days of the Judges, when God often raised up
 deliverers and wrought deliverances for them, and yet they relapsed to 
 idolatry and <I>provoked God with their counsel,</I> their idolatrous 
 inventions, to deliver them up to some other oppressor, so that at last 
 they <I>were brought</I> very <I>low for their iniquity.</I> Those that 
 by sin disparage themselves, and will not by repentance humble 
 themselves, are justly debased, and humbled, and brought low, by the 
 judgments of God.

 (4.) At length they cried unto God, and God returned in favour to them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:44-46"><I>v.</I> 44-46</A>.

 They were chastened for their sins, but not destroyed, cast down, but
 not cast off. God appeared for them, 

 [1.] As a God of mercy, who looked upon their grievances, <I>regarded 
 their affliction, beheld when distress was upon them</I> (so some), who 
 looked over their complaints, for he <I>heard their cry</I> with tender 
 compassion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+3:7">Exod. iii. 7</A>)

 and overlooked their provocations; for though he had said, and had
 reason to say it, that he would destroy them, yet he <I>repented, 
 according to the multitude of his mercies,</I> and reversed the 
 sentence. Though he is not a <I>man that he should repent,</I> so as to 
 change his mind, yet he is a gracious God, who pities us, and changes 
 his way.

 [2.] As a God of truth, who <I>remembered for them his covenant,</I> 
 and made good every word that he had spoken; and therefore, bad as they 
 were, he would not break with them, because he would not break his own 
 promise. 

 [3.] As a God of power, who has all hearts in his hand, and turns them 
 which way soever he pleases. <I>He made them to be pitied even of those 
 that carried them captives,</I> and hated them, and ruled them with 
 rigour. He not only restrained the remainder of their enemies' wrath, 
 that it should not utterly consume them, but he infused compassion even 
 into their stony hearts, and made them relent, which was more than any 
 art of man could have done with the utmost force of rhetoric. Note, God 
 can change lions into lambs, and, <I>when a man's ways please the 
 Lord,</I> will make even <I>his enemies to pity him</I> and <I>be at 
 peace with him.</I> When God pities men shall. <I>Tranquillus Deus
 tranquillat omnia--A God at peace with us makes every thing at 
 peace.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The psalm concludes with prayer and praise. 

 1. Prayer for the completing of his people's deliverance. Even when the
 Lord brought back the captivity of his people still there was occasion 
 to pray, <I>Lord, turn again our captivity</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+126:1,4">Ps. cxxvi. 1, 4</A>);

 so here 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:47"><I>v.</I> 47</A>),

 <I>Save us, O Lord our God! and gather us from among the heathen.</I> 
 We may suppose that many who were forced into foreign countries, in the 
 times of the Judges (as Naomi was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:1">Ruth i. 1</A>),

 had not returned in the beginning of David's reign, Saul's time being
 discouraging, and therefore it was seasonable to pray, Lord, gather the 
 dispersed Israelites <I>from among the heathen, to give thanks to thy 
 holy name,</I> not only that they may have cause to give thanks and 
 hearts to give thanks, that they may have opportunity to do it in the 
 courts of the Lord's house, from which they were now banished, and so 
 may <I>triumph in thy praise,</I> over those that had in scorn 
 challenged them to <I>sing the Lord's song in a strange land.</I>

 2. Praise for the beginning and progress of it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+106:48"><I>v.</I> 48</A>):

 <I>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to 
 everlasting.</I> He is a blessed God from eternity, and will be so to 
 eternity, and so let him be praised by all his worshippers. Let the 
 priests say this, and then <I>let all the people say, Amen, 
 Hallelujah,</I> in token of their cheerful concurrence in all these 
 prayers, praises, and confessions. According to this rubric, or
 directory, we find that when this psalm (or at least the closing verses 
 of it) was sung all the people said <I>Amen,</I> and praised the Lord 
 by saying, <I>Hallelujah.</I> By these two comprehensive words it is 
 very proper, in religious assemblies, to testify their joining with 
 their ministers in the prayers and praises which, as their mouth, they 
 offer up to God, according to his will, saying <I>Amen</I> to the 
 prayers and <I>Hallelujah</I> to the praises.</P>
