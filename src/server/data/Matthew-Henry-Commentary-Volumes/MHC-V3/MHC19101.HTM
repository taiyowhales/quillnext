 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David was certainly the penman of this psalm, and it has in it the 
 genuine spirit of the man after God's own heart; it is a solemn vow 
 which he made to God when he took upon him the charge of a family and 
 of the kingdom. Whether it was penned when he entered upon the 
 government, immediately after the death of Saul (as some think), or 
 when he began to reign over all Israel, and brought up the ark to the 
 city of David (as others think), is not material; it is an excellent 
 plan or model for the good government of a court, or the keeping up of 
 virtue and piety, and, by that means, good order, in it: but it is 
 applicable to private families; it is the householder's psalm. It 
 instructs all that are in any sphere of power, whether larger or 
 narrower, to use their power so as to make it a terror to evil-doers, 
 but a praise to those that do well. Here is, 

 I. The general scope of David's vow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:1,2">ver. 1, 2</A>.

 II. The particulars of it, that he would detest and discountenance all
 manner of wickedness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:3-5,7,8">ver. 3-5, 7, 8</A>)

 and that he would favour and encourage such as were virtuous,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:6">ver. 6</A>.
 
 Some think this may fitly be accommodated to Christ, the Son of David, 
 who governs his church, the city of the Lord, by these rules, and who 
 loves righteousness and hates wickedness. In singing this psalm 
 families, both governors and governed, should teach, and admonish, and 
 engage themselves and one another to walk by the rule of it, that peace 
 may be upon them and God's presence with them.</P>

 <P>A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto
 thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, will I sing.
 &nbsp; 2  I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt
 thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect
 heart.
 &nbsp; 3  I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work
 of them that turn aside; <I>it</I> shall not cleave to me.
 &nbsp; 4  A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a
 wicked <I>person.</I>
 &nbsp; 5  Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off:
 him that hath a high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.
 &nbsp; 6  Mine eyes <I>shall be</I> upon the faithful of the land, that they
 may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall
 serve me.
 &nbsp; 7  He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he
 that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.
 &nbsp; 8  I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may
 cut off all wicked doers from the city of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 David here cuts out to himself and others a pattern both of a good 
 magistrate and a good master of a family; and, if these were careful to 
 discharge the duty of their place, it would contribute very much to a 
 universal reformation.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The chosen subject of the psalm 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>I will sing of mercy and judgment,</I> that is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Of God's mercy and judgment, and then it looks back upon the 
 dispensations of Providence concerning David since he was first 
 anointed to be king, during which time he had met with many a rebuke 
 and much hardship on the one hand, and yet, on the other hand, had had 
 many wonderful deliverances wrought for him and favours bestowed upon 
 him; of these he will sing unto God. Note, 

 (1.) God's providences concerning his people are commonly 
 mixed--<I>mercy and judgment;</I> God has set the one over-against the 
 other, and appointed them April-days, showers and sunshine. It was so 
 with David and his family; when there was mercy in the return of the 
 ark there was judgment in the death of Uzza. 

 (2.) When God in his providence exercises us with a mixture of mercy 
 and judgment it is our duty to sing, and sing unto him, both of the one 
 and of the other; we must be suitably affected with both, and make 
 suitable acknowledgments to God for both. The Chaldee-paraphrase of 
 this is observable: <I>If thou bestowest mercy upon me,</I> or <I>If 
 thou bring any judgment upon me, before thee, O Lord! will I sing my 
 hymns for all.</I> Whatever our outward condition is, whether joyful or 
 sorrowful, still we must give glory to God, and sing praises to him; 
 neither the laughter of a prosperous condition nor the tears of an 
 afflicted condition must put us out of tune for sacred songs.  Or,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It may be understood of David's mercy and judgment; he would, in 
 this psalm, promise to be merciful, and just, or wise, for judgment is 
 often put for discretion. To do justly and love mercy is the sum of our 
 duty; these he would covenant to make conscience of in that place and 
 relation to which God had called him and this in consideration of the 
 various providences of God that had occurred to him. Family-mercies and 
 family-afflictions are both of them calls to family-religion. David put 
 his vow into a song or psalm, that he might the better keep it in his 
 own mind and frequently repeat it, and that it might the better be 
 communicated to others and preserved in his family, for a pattern to 
 his sons and successors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The general resolution David took up to conduct himself carefully 
 and conscientiously in his court, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 We have here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. A good purpose concerning his conversation--concerning his
 conversation in general (how he would behave himself in every thing; he 
 would live by rule, and not at large, not walk at all adventures; he 
 would, though a king, by a solemn covenant bind himself to his good 
 behaviour), and concerning his conversation in his family particularly, 
 not only how he would walk when he appeared in public, when he sat in 
 the throne, but how he would <I>walk within his house,</I> where he was 
 more out of the eye of the world, but where he still saw himself under 
 the eye of God. It is not enough to put on our religion when we go 
 abroad and appear before men; but we must govern ourselves by it in our 
 families. Those that are in public stations are not thereby excused 
 from care in governing their families; nay, rather, they are more 
 concerned to set a good example of <I>ruling their own houses well,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+3:4">1 Tim. iii. 4</A>.

 When David had his hands full of public affairs, yet he returned to 
 bless his house,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Sa+6:20">2 Sam. vi. 20</A>.

 He resolves, 

 (1.) To act conscientiously and with integrity, to <I>walk in a perfect 
 way,</I> in the way of God's commandments; that is <I>a perfect 
 way,</I> for <I>the law of the Lord is perfect.</I> This he will walk 
 in <I>with a perfect heart,</I> with all sincerity, not dissembling 
 either with God or men.  When we make the word of God our rule, and are 
 ruled by it, the glory of God our end, and aim at it, then we walk 
 <I>in a perfect way with a perfect heart.</I> 

 (2.) To act considerately and with discretion: <I>I will behave myself 
 wisely; I will understand</I> or <I>instruct myself</I> in a perfect 
 way, so some. I will walk circumspectly. Note, We must all resolve to 
 walk by the rules of Christian prudence in the ways of Christian piety. 
 We must never turn aside out of the perfect way, under pretence of 
 <I>behaving ourselves wisely;</I> but, while we keep to the good way, 
 we must be <I>wise as serpents.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. A good prayer: <I>O when wilt thou come unto me?</I> Note, It is a 
 desirable thing, when a man has a house of his own, to have God come to 
 him and dwell with him in it; and those may expect God's presence that 
 walk with <I>a perfect heart</I> in <I>a perfect way.</I> If we compare 
 the account which the historian gives of David 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+18:14">1 Sam. xviii. 14</A>),

 we shall find how exactly it answers his purpose and prayer, and that
 neither was in vain. David, as he purposed, <I>behaved himself wisely 
 in all his ways; and,</I> as he prayed, <I>the Lord was with 
 him.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. His particular resolution to practise no evil himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):
 
 "<I>I will set no wicked thing before my eyes;</I> I will not design 
 nor aim at any thing but what is for the glory of God and the public 
 welfare." He will never have it in his eye to enrich himself by 
 impoverishing his subjects, or enlarge his own prerogative by 
 encroaching on their property. In all our worldly business we must see 
 that what we set our eyes upon be right and good and not any forbidden 
 fruit, and that we never seek that which we cannot have without sin. It 
 is the character of a good man that he shuts his eyes from seeing evil, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:15">Isa. xxxiii. 15</A>.

 "Nay, I <I>hate the work of those that turn aside</I> from the paths of
 equity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:7">Job xxxi. 7</A>),

 not only I avoid it, but I abhor it; <I>it shall not cleave to me.</I>
 If any blot of injustice should come on my hands, it shall be washed 
 off quickly."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. His further resolution not to keep bad servants, nor to employ 
 those about him that were vicious. He will not countenance them, nor 
 show them any favour, lest thereby he should harden them in their 
 wickedness, and encourage others to do like them.  He will not converse 
 with them himself, nor admit them into the company of his other 
 servants, lest they should spread the infection of sin in his family. 
 He will not confide in them, nor put them in power under him; for those 
 who hated to be reformed would certainly hinder every thing that is 
 good. When he comes to mention particulars he does not mention 
 drunkards, adulterers, murderers or blasphemers; such gross sinners as 
 these he was in no danger of admitting into his house, nor did he need 
 to covenant particularly against having fellowship with them; but he 
 mentions those whose sins were less scandalous, but no less dangerous, 
 and in reference to whom he needed to stand upon his guard with caution 
 and to behave himself wisely. He will have nothing to do, 

 1. With spiteful malicious people, who are ill-natured, and will bear a
 grudge a great while, and care not what mischief they do to those they 
 have a pique against

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>A froward heart</I> (one that delights to be cross and perverse) 
 <I>shall depart from me,</I> as not fit for society, the bond of which 
 is love. <I>I will not know,</I>" that is, "I will have no acquaintance 
 or conversation, if I can help it, with such <I>a wicked person;</I> 
 for a little of the leaven of malice and wickedness will leaven the 
 whole lump." 

 2. With slanderers, and those who take a pleasure in wounding their 
 neighbour's reputation secretly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>Whoso privily slanders his neighbour,</I> either raises or spreads 
 false stories, to the prejudice of his good name, <I>him will I cut 
 off</I> from my family and court." Many endeavour to raise themselves 
 into the favour of princes by unjust representations of persons and 
 things, which they think will please their prince. <I>If a ruler 
 hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+29:12">Prov. xxix. 12</A>.

 But David will not only not hearken to them, but will prevent the 
 preferment of those that hope thus to curry favour with him: he will 
 punish not only him that falsely accuses another in open court, but him 
 that privily slanders another. I wish David had remembered this vow in 
 the case of Mephibosheth and Ziba. 

 3. With haughty, conceited, ambitious people; none do more mischief in
 a family, in a court, in a church, for <I>only by pride comes 
 contention:</I> "Therefore him <I>that has a high look and a proud 
 heart will I not suffer;</I> I will have no patience with those that 
 are still grasping at all preferments, for it is certain that they do 
 not aim at doing good, but only at aggrandizing themselves and their 
 families." God resists the proud, and so will David. 

 4. With false deceitful people, that scruple not to tell lies, or 
 commit frauds

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>He that worketh deceit,</I> though he may insinuate himself into my 
 family, yet, as soon as he is discovered, <I>shall not dwell within my 
 house.</I>" Some great men know how to serve their own purposes by such 
 as are skilful to deceive, and they are fit tools for them to work by; 
 but David will make use of no such persons as agents for him: <I>He 
 that tells lies shall not tarry in my sight,</I> but shall be expelled 
 the house with indignation. Herein David was <I>a man after God's own 
 heart,</I> for a proud look and a lying tongue are things which God 
 hates; and he was also a type of Christ, who will, in the great day, 
 banish from his presence <I>all that love and make a lie,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+22:15">Rev.  xxii. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. His resolution to put those in trust under him that were honest and 
 good 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 <I>My eyes shall be upon the faithful in the land.</I> In choosing his 
 servants and ministers of state he kept to the land of Israel and would 
 not employ foreigners; none shall be preferred but true-born 
 Israelites, and those such as were Israelites indeed, the <I>faithful 
 in the land;</I> for even in that land there were those that were 
 unfaithful. These faithful ones his eyes shall be upon, to discover 
 them and find them out; for they were modest, did not crowd into the 
 city to court preferment, but lived retired in the land, in the 
 country, out of the way of it. Those are commonly most fit for places 
 of honour and trust that are least fond of them; and therefore wise 
 princes will spy out such in their recesses and privacies, and take 
 them to dwell with them and act under them. <I>He that walks in a 
 perfect way,</I> that makes conscience of what he says and does, 
 <I>shall serve me.</I> The kingdom must be searched for honest men to 
 make courtiers of; and, if any man is better than another, he must be 
 preferred. This was a good resolution of David's; but either he did not 
 keep to it or else his judgment was imposed upon when he made 
 Ahithophel his right hand. It should be the care and endeavour of all 
 masters of families, for their own sakes and their children's, to take 
 such servants into their families as they have reason to hope fear God.  
 The Son of David has his eyes upon <I>the faithful in the land;</I> his 
 secret is with them, and they <I>shall dwell with him.</I> Saul chose 
 servants for their goodliness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+8:16">1 Sam. viii. 16</A>),

 but David for their goodness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. His resolution to extend his zeal to the reformation of the city 
 and country, as well as of the court 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+101:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>I will early destroy all the wicked of the land,</I> all that are 
 discovered and convicted; the law shall have its course against them." 
 He would do his utmost to <I>destroy all the wicked,</I> so that there 
 might be none left that were notoriously wicked. He would do it early; 
 he would lose no time and spare no pains; he would be forward and 
 zealous in promoting the reformation of manners and suppression of 
 vice; and those must rise betimes that will do anything to purpose in 
 the work. That which he aimed at was not only the securing of his own 
 government and the peace of the country, but the honour of God in the 
 purity of his church, <I>That I may cut off all wicked doers from the 
 city of the Lord.</I> Not Jerusalem only, but the whole land, was the 
 <I>city of the Lord;</I> so is the gospel-church. It is the interest of 
 the <I>city of the Lord</I> to be purged from <I>wicked doers,</I> who 
 both blemish it and weaken it; and it is therefore the duty of all to 
 do what they can, in their places, towards so good a work, and to be 
 zealously affected in it. The day is coming when the Son of David shall 
 cut off all wicked doers from the new Jerusalem, for there shall not 
 enter into it any that do iniquity.</P>
