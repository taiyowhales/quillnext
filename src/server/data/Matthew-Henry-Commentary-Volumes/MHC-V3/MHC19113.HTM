 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm begins and ends with "Hallelujah;" for, as many others, it 
 is designed to promote the great and good work of praising God. 

 I. We are here called upon and urged to praise God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. We are here furnished with matter for praise, and words are put
 into our mouths, in singing which we must with holy fear and love give 
 to God the glory of, 
 
 1. The elevations of his glory and greatness,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:4,5">ver. 4, 5</A>.

 2. The condescensions of his grace and goodness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:6-9">ver. 6-9</A>),

 which very much illustrate one another, that we may be duly affected
 with both.</P>

 of his people.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this psalm,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are extorted to give glory to God, to give him the glory due to 
 his name.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The invitation is very pressing: <I>praise you the Lord,</I> and 
 again and again, <I>Praise him, praise him; blessed be his name,</I> 
 for it is to be praised, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:1-3"><I>v.</I> 1-3</A>.

 This intimates,

 (1.) That it is a necessary and most excellent duty, greatly pleasing 
 to God, and has a large room in religion. 

 (2.) That it is a duty we should much abound in, in which we should be 
 frequently employed and greatly enlarged.

 (3.) That it is work which we are very backward to, and which we need 
 to be engaged and excited to by precept upon precept and line upon 
 line. 

 (4.) That those who are much in praising God themselves will court 
 others to it, both because they find the weight of the work, and that 
 there is need of all the help they can fetch in (there is employment 
 for all hearts, all hands, and all little enough), and because they 
 find the pleasure of it, which they wish all their friends may share 
 in.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The invitation is very extensive. Observe, 

 (1.) From whom God has praise--from his own people; they are here 
 called upon to praise God, as those that will answer the call: 
 <I>Praise, O you servants of the Lord!</I> They have most reason to 
 praise him; for those that attend him as his servants know him best and 
 receive most of his favours. And it is their business to praise him; 
 that is the work required of them as his servants: it is easy pleasant 
 work to speak well of their Master, and do him what honour they can; if 
 they do not, who should? Some understand it of the Levites; but, if
 so, all Christians are a royal priesthood, <I>to show forth the praises 
 of him that has called them,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+2:9">1 Pet. ii. 9</A>.

 The angels are the servants of the Lord; they need not be called upon 
 by us to praise God, yet it is a comfort to us that they do praise him, 
 and that they praise him better than we can. 

 (2.) From whom he ought to have praise.

 [1.] From all ages 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 --<I>from this time forth for evermore.</I> Let not this work die with 
 us, but let us be doing it in a better world, and let those that come 
 after us be doing it in this. Let not our seed degenerate, but let God
 be praised through all the generations of time, and not in this only. 
 We must bless the Lord in our day, by saying, with the psalmist, 
 <I>Blessed be his name now and always.</I>

 [2.] From all places--<I>from the rising of the sun to the going down 
 of the same,</I> that is, throughout the habitable world. Let all that
 enjoy the benefit of the sun rising (and those that do so must count 
 upon it that the sun will set) give thanks for that light to the Father
 of lights. God's <I>name is to be praised;</I> it ought to be praised 
 by all nations; for in every place, from east to west, there appear the 
 manifest proofs and products of his wisdom, power, and goodness; and it 
 is to be lamented that so great a part of mankind are ignorant of him, 
 and give that praise to others which is due to him alone. But perhaps 
 there is more in it; as the

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:2">former verse</A>

 gave us a glimpse of the kingdom of glory, intimating that God's name
 shall be <I>blessed for ever</I> (when time shall be no more that
 praise shall be the work of heaven), so this verse gives us a glimpse
 of the kingdom of grace in the gospel-dispensation of it. When the
 church shall no longer be confined to the Jewish nation, but shall 
 spread itself all the world over, when in <I>every place</I> spiritual 
 <I>incense shall be offered to our God</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mal+1:11">Mal. i. 11</A>),

 then from <I>the rising to the setting of the sun the Lord's name shall 
 be praised</I> by some in all countries.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are here directed what to give him the glory of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let us look up with an eye of faith, and see how high his glory is 
 in the upper world, and mention that to his praise, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:4,5"><I>v.</I> 4, 5</A>.

 We are, in our praises, to exalt his name, for he is high, his glory is
 high.

 (1.) <I>High above all nations,</I> their kings though ever so pompous, 
 their people though ever so numerous. Whether it be true of an earthly 
 king or no that though he is <I>major singulis--greater than 
 individuals,</I> he is <I>minor universis--less than the whole,</I> we 
 will not dispute; but we are sure it is not true of the King of kings.
 Put all the nations together, and he is above them all; they are before 
 him as the <I>drop of the bucket and the small dust of the balance,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+60:15,17">Isa. lx. 15, 17</A>.

 Let all nations think and speak highly of God, for he is high above 
 them all. 

 (2.) High <I>above the heavens;</I> the throne of his glory is in the 
 highest heavens, which should raise our hearts in praising him,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:41">Lam. iii. 41</A>.

 <I>His glory is above the heavens,</I> that is, above the angels; he is 
 above what they are, for their brightness is nothing to his,--above what
 they do, for they are under his command and do his pleasure,--and above
 what even they can speak him to be. He is exalted above <I>all blessing 
 and praise,</I> not only all ours, but all theirs. We must therefore 
 say, with holy admiration, <I>Who is like unto the Lord our God?</I> 
 who of all the princes and potentates of the earth? who of all the 
 bright and blessed spirits above? None can equal him, none dare compare 
 with him. God is to be praised as transcendently, incomparably, and 
 infinitely great; for he <I>dwells on high,</I> and from on high sees 
 all, and rules all, and justly attracts all praise to himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Let us look around with an eye of observation, and see how extensive 
 his goodness is in the lower world, and mention that to his praise. He 
 is a God <I>who exalts himself to dwell, who humbles himself in heaven, 
 and in earth.</I> Some think there is a transposition, <I>He exalts 
 himself to dwell in heaven,</I> he <I>humbles himself to behold on 
 earth;</I> but the sense is plain enough as we take it, only observe, 
 God is said to <I>exalt himself</I> and to <I>humble himself,</I> both 
 are his own act and deed; as he is self-existent, so he is both the 
 fountain of his own honour and the spring of his own grace; God's 
 condescending goodness appears,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) In the cognizance he takes of the world below him. His glory is 
 <I>above the nations</I> and <I>above the heavens,</I> and yet neither 
 is neglected by him. <I>God is great,</I> yet <I>he despises not 
 any,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+36:5">Job xxxvi. 5</A>.

 <I>He humbles himself to behold</I> all his creatures, all his 
 subjects, though he is infinitely above them. Considering the infinite
 perfection, sufficiency, and felicity of the divine nature, it must be 
 acknowledged as an act of wonderful condescension that God is pleased 
 to take into the thoughts of his eternal counsel, and into the hand of 
 his universal Providence, both the armies of heaven and the inhabitants 
 of the earth 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:35">Dan. iv. 35</A>);
 
 even in this dominion he humbles himself.
 
 [1.] It is condescension in him to behold the things in heaven, to 
 support the beings, direct the motions, and accept the praises and 
 services, of the angels themselves; for he needs them not, nor is 
 benefited by them. 

 [2.] Much more is it condescension in him to <I>behold the things that 
 are in the earth,</I> to visit the sons of men, and regard them, to 
 order and overrule their affairs, and to take notice of what they say 
 and do, that he may fill the earth with his goodness, and so set us an 
 example of stooping to do good, of taking notice of, and concerning 
 ourselves about, our inferiors. If it be such condescension for God to 
 behold things in heaven and earth, what an amazing condescension was it 
 for the Son of God to come from heaven to earth and take our nature 
 upon him, that he might <I>seek and save those that were lost!</I> 
 Herein indeed he humbled himself.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) In the particular favour he sometimes shows to the least and 
 lowest of the inhabitants of this meaner lower world. He not only 
 beholds the great things in the earth, but the meanest, and those 
 things which great men commonly overlook. Not does he merely behold 
 them, but does wonders for them, and things that are very surprising, 
 out of the common road of providence and chain of causes, which shows 
 that the world is governed, not by a course of nature, for that would 
 always run in the same channel, but by a God of nature, who delights in 
 doing things we looked not for. 

 [1.] Those that have been long despicable are sometimes, on a sudden, 
 made honourable

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:78"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>):

 <I>He raises up the poor out of the dust, that he may set him with 
 princes. First,</I> Thus God does sometimes magnify himself, and his
 own wisdom, power, and sovereignty. When he has some great work to do 
 he chooses to employ those in it that were least likely, and least 
 thought of for it by themselves or others, to the highest post of 
 honour: Gideon is fetched from threshing, Saul from seeking the asses, 
 and David from keeping the sheep; the apostles are sent from fishing to 
 be <I>fishers of men.</I> The treasure of the gospel is put into 
 earthen vessels, and the weak and foolish ones of the world are pitched 
 upon to be preachers of it, to confound the <I>wise and mighty</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:27,28">1 Cor. i. 27, 28</A>),

 that the excellency of the power may be of God, and all may see that 
 promotion comes from him. <I>Secondly,</I> Thus God does sometimes 
 reward the eminent piety and patience of his people who have long 
 groaned under the burden of poverty and disgrace. When Joseph's virtue 
 was tried and manifested he was raised from the prison-dust and <I>set 
 with princes.</I> Those that are wise will observe such returns of 
 Providence, and will understand by them <I>the loving-kindness of the 
 Lord.</I> Some have applied this to the work of redemption by Jesus 
 Christ, and not unfitly; for through him poor fallen men are raised out 
 of the dust (one of the Jewish rabbies applies it to the resurrection 
 of the dead), nay, out of the dunghill of sin, and <I>set among 
 princes,</I> among angels, those princes of his people. Hannah had sung 
 to this purport, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Sa+2:6-8">1 Sam. ii. 6-8</A>.

 [2.] Those that have been long barren are sometimes, on a sudden, made 
 fruitful, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+113:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 This may look back to Sarah and Rebecca, Rachel, Hannah, and Samson's
 mother, or forward to Elizabeth; and many such instances there have 
 been, in which God has looked on the affliction of his handmaids and 
 taken away their reproach. <I>He makes the barren woman to keep 
 house,</I> not only builds up the family, but thereby finds the heads 
 of the family something to do. Note, Those that have the comfort of a 
 family must take the care of it; <I>bearing children</I> and <I>guiding 
 the house</I> are put together,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:14">1 Tim. v. 14</A>.

 When God <I>sets the barren in a family</I> he expects that she should 
 <I>look well to the ways of her household,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:27">Prov. xxxi. 27</A>.

 She is said to <I>be a joyful mother of children,</I> not only because, 
 even in common cases, the pain is forgotten, <I>for joy that a 
 man-child is born into the world,</I> but there is particular joy when 
 a child is born to those that have been long childless (as 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+1:14">Luke i. 14</A>)
 
 and therefore there ought to be particular thanksgiving. <I>Praise you 
 the Lord.</I> Yet, in this case, <I>rejoice with trembling;</I> for, 
 though the sorrowful mother be made joyful, the joyful mother may be 
 made sorrowful again, if the children be either removed from her or 
 embittered to her. This, therefore, may be applied to the gospel-church 
 among the Gentiles (the building of which is illustrated by this 
 similitude, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:1">Isa. liv. 1</A>,

 <I>Sing, O barren! thou that didst not bear,</I> and

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:27">Gal. iv. 27</A>),

 for which we, who, being sinners of the Gentiles, are children of the 
 desolate, have reason to say, <I>Praise you the Lord.</I></P>
