 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Job having warmly given vent to his passion, and so broken the ice, his 
 friends here come gravely to give vent to their judgment upon his case, 
 which perhaps they had communicated to one another apart, compared 
 notes upon it and talked it over among themselves, and found they were 
 all agreed in their verdict, that Job's afflictions certainly proved 
 him to be a hypocrite; but they did not attack Job with this high 
 charge till by the expressions of his discontent and impatience, in 
 which they thought he reflected on God himself, he had confirmed them 
 in the bad opinion they had before conceived of him and his character. 
 Now they set upon him with great fear. The dispute begins, and it soon 
 becomes fierce. The opponents are Job's three friends. Job himself is 
 respondent. Elihu appears, first, as moderator, and at length God 
 himself gives judgment upon the controversy and the management of it. 
 The question in dispute is whether Job was an honest man or no, the 
 same question that was in dispute between God and Satan in the first 
 two chapters. Satan had yielded it, and durst not pretend that his 
 cursing his day was a constructive cursing of his God; no, he cannot 
 deny but that Job still holds fast his integrity; but Job's friends 
 will needs have it that, if Job were an honest man, he would not have 
 been thus sorely and thus tediously afflicted, and therefore urge him 
 to confess himself a hypocrite in the profession he had made of 
 religion: "No," says Job, "that I will never do; I have offended God, 
 but my heart, notwithstanding, has been upright with him;" and still he 
 holds fast the comfort of his integrity. Eliphaz, who, it is likely, 
 was the senior, or of the best quality, begins with him in this 
 chapter, in which, 

 I. He bespeaks a patient hearing, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:2">ver. 2</A>.

 II. He compliments Job with an acknowledgment of the eminence and
 usefulness of the profession he had made of religion, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:3,4">ver. 3, 4</A>.

 III. He charges him with hypocrisy in his profession, grounding his
 charge upon his present troubles and his conduct under them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:5,6">ver. 5, 6</A>.

 IV. To make good the inference, he maintains that man's wickedness is 
 that which always brings God's judgments, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:7-11">ver. 7-11</A>.

 V. He corroborates his assertion by a vision which he had, in which he
 was reminded of the incontestable purity and justice of God, and the 
 meanness, weakness, and sinfulness of man, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:12-21">ver. 12-21</A>.

 By all this he aims to bring down Job's spirit and to make him both
 penitent and patient under his afflictions.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
 &nbsp; 2  <I>If</I> we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but
 who can withhold himself from speaking?
 &nbsp; 3  Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened
 the weak hands.
 &nbsp; 4  Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast
 strengthened the feeble knees.
 &nbsp; 5  But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth
 thee, and thou art troubled.
 &nbsp; 6  <I>Is</I> not <I>this</I> thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the
 uprightness of thy ways?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Eliphaz excuses the trouble he is now about to give to Job by his 
 discourse 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>If we assay a word with thee,</I> offer a word of reproof and
 counsel, wilt thou be grieved and take it ill?" We have reason to fear 
 thou wilt; but there is no remedy: "<I>Who can refrain from words?</I>" 
 Observe, 

 1. With what modesty he speaks of himself and his own attempt. He will
 not undertake the management of the cause alone, but very humbly joins 
 his friends with him: "We will commune with thee." Those that plead 
 God's cause must be glad of help, lest it suffer through their 
 weakness. He will not promise much, but begs leave to assay or attempt, 
 and try if he could propose any thing that might be pertinent, and suit 
 Job's case. In difficult matters it becomes us to pretend no further, 
 but only to try what may be said or done. Many excellent discourses 
 have gone under the modest title of <I>Essays.</I> 

 2. With what tenderness he speaks of Job, and his present afflicted
 condition: "If we tell thee our mind, <I>wilt thou be grieved?</I> Wilt 
 thou take it ill? Wilt thou lay it to thy own heart as thy affliction 
 or to our charge as our fault? Shall we be reckoned unkind and cruel if 
 we deal plainly and faithfully with thee? We desire we may not; we hope 
 we shall not, and should be sorry if that should be ill resented which 
 is well intended." Note, We ought to be afraid of grieving any, 
 especially those that are already in grief, lest we add affliction to 
 the afflicted, as David's enemies, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+69:26">Ps. lxix. 26</A>.

 We should show ourselves backward to say that which we foresee will be
 grievous, though ever so necessary. God himself, though he afflicts 
 justly, does not afflict willingly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:33">Lam. iii. 33</A>.

 3. With what assurance he speaks of the truth and pertinency of what he
 was about to say: <I>Who can withhold himself from speaking?</I> Surely 
 it was a pious zeal for God's honour, and the spiritual welfare of Job, 
 that laid him under this necessity of speaking. "Who can forbear 
 speaking in vindication of God's honour, which we hear reproved, in 
 love to thy soul, which we see endangered?" Note, It is foolish pity 
 not to reprove our friends, even our friends in affliction, for what 
 they say or do amiss, only for fear of offending them. Whether men take 
 it well or ill, we must with wisdom and meekness do our duty and 
 discharge a good conscience.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He exhibits a twofold charge against Job.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As to his particular conduct under this affliction. He charges him 
 with weakness and faint-heartedness, and this article of his charge 
 there was too much ground for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:3-5"><I>v.</I> 3-5</A>.
 
 And here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) He takes notice of Job's former serviceableness to the comfort of 
 others. He owns that Job had instructed many, not only his own children 
 and servants, but many others, his neighbours and friends, as many as 
 fell within the sphere of his activity. He did not only encourage
 those who were teachers by office, and countenance them, and pay for 
 the teaching of those who were poor, but he did himself instruct many. 
 Though a great man, he did not think it below him (king Solomon was a 
 preacher); though a man of business, he found time to do it, went among 
 his neighbours, talked to them about their souls, and gave them good 
 counsel. O that this example of Job were imitated by our great men! If 
 he met with those who were ready to fall into sin, or sink under their 
 troubles, his words upheld them: a wonderful dexterity he had in 
 offering that which was proper to fortify persons against temptations, 
 to support them under their burdens, and to comfort afflicted 
 consciences. He had, and used, the tongue of the learned, knew how to 
 speak a word in season to those that were weary, and employed himself 
 much in that good work. With suitable counsels and comforts he 
 <I>strengthened the weak hands</I> for work and service and the 
 spiritual warfare, and the feeble knees for bearing up the man in his 
 journey and under his load. It is not only our duty to <I>lift up our 
 own hands that hang down,</I> by quickening and encouraging ourselves 
 in the way of duty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:12">Heb. xii. 12</A>),

 but we must also strengthen the weak hands of others, as there is
 occasion, and do what we can to confirm their feeble knees, by saying 
 <I>to those that are of a fearful heart, Be strong,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:3,4">Isa. xxxv. 3, 4</A>.

 The expressions seem to be borrowed thence. Note, Those should abound
 in spiritual charity. A good word, well and wisely spoken, may do more 
 good than perhaps we think of. But why does Eliphaz mention this here?

 [1.] Perhaps he praises him thus for the good he had done that he might 
 make the intended reproof the more passable with him. Just commendation 
 is a good preface to a just reprehension, will help to remove 
 prejudices, and will show that the reproof comes not from ill will. 
 Paul praised the Corinthians before he chided them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+11:2">1 Cor. xi. 2</A>.

 [2.] He remembers how Job had comforted others as a reason why he might
 justly expect to be himself comforted; and yet, if conviction was 
 necessary in order to comfort, they must be excused if they applied 
 themselves to that first. The <I>Comforter shall reprove,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+16:8">John xvi. 8</A>.

 [3.] He speaks this, perhaps, in a way of pity, lamenting that through
 the extremity of his affliction he could not apply those comforts to 
 himself which he had formerly administered to others. It is easier to 
 give good counsel than to take it, to preach meekness and patience than 
 to practise them. <I>Facile omnes, cum valemus, rectum consilium 
 &aelig;grotis damus--We all find it easy, when in health, to give good
 advice to the sick.--Terent.</I> 

 [4.] Most think that he mentions it as an aggravation of his present 
 discontent, upbraiding him with his knowledge, and the good offices he 
 had done for others, as if he had said, "Thou that hast taught others, 
 why dost thou not teach thyself? Is not this an evidence of thy
 hypocrisy, that thou hast prescribed that medicine to others which thou 
 wilt not now take thyself, and so contradictest thyself, and actest 
 against thy own known principles? Thou that teachest another to faint,
 dost thou faint? 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+2:21">Rom. ii. 21</A>.

 Physician, heal thyself." Those who have rebuked others must expect to
 hear of it if they themselves become obnoxious to rebuke.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) He upbraids him with his present low-spiritedness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.
 
 "<I>Now</I> that <I>it has come upon thee,</I> now that it is thy turn
 to be afflicted, and the bitter cup that goes round is put into thy 
 hand, now that <I>it touches thee, thou faintest, thou art
 troubled.</I>" Here, 

 [1.] He makes too light of Job's afflictions: "It <I>touches</I> thee." 
 The very word that Satan himself had used,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:11,2:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 11, ii. 5</A>.

 Had Eliphaz felt but the one-half of Job's affliction, he would have
 said, "It smites me, it wounds me;" but, speaking of Job's afflictions, 
 he makes a mere trifle of it: "It touches thee and thou canst not bear 
 to be touched." <I>Noli me tangere--Touch me not.</I> 

 [2.] He makes too much of Job's resentments, and aggravates them: "Thou 
 faintest, or thou art beside thyself; thou ravest, and knowest not what 
 thou sayest." Men in deep distress must have grains of allowance, and a 
 favourable construction put upon what they say; when we make the worst 
 of every word we do not as we would be done by.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. As to his general character before this affliction. He charges him
 with wickedness and false-heartedness, and this article of his charge 
 was utterly groundless and unjust. How unkindly does he banter him, and 
 upbraid him with the great profession of religion he had made, as if it
 had all now come to nothing and proved a sham 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>):

 "<I>Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness
 of thy ways?</I> Does it not all appear now to be a mere pretence? For, 
 hadst thou been sincere in it, God would not thus have afflicted thee, 
 nor wouldst thou have behaved thus under the affliction." This was the 
 very thing Satan aimed at, to prove Job a hypocrite, and disprove the 
 character God had given of him. When he could not himself do this to 
 God, but he still saw and said, <I>Job is perfect and upright,</I> then 
 he endeavoured, by his friends, to do it to Job himself, and to 
 persuade him to confess himself a hypocrite. Could he have gained that 
 point he would have triumphed. <I>Habes confitentem reum--Out of thy 
 own mouth will I condemn thee.</I> But, by the grace of God, Job was 
 enabled to hold fast his integrity, and would not bear false witness 
 against himself. Note, Those that pass rash and uncharitable censures 
 upon their brethren, and condemn them as hypocrites, do Satan's work, 
 and serve his interest, more than they are aware of. I know not how it 
 comes to pass that

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:6">this verse</A>

 is differently read in several editions of our common English Bibles;
 the original, and all the ancient versions, put <I>thy hope</I> before
 <I>the uprightness of thy ways.</I> So does the Geneva, and most of the
 editions of the last translation; but I find one of the first, in 1612,
 has it, <I>Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, the uprightness of thy 
 ways, and thy hope?</I> Both the Assembly's Annotations and Mr. Pool's 
 have that reading: and an edition in 1660 reads it, "<I>Is not thy fear 
 thy confidence, and the uprightness of thy ways thy hope?</I> Does it 
 not appear now that all the religion both of thy devotion and of thy 
 conversation was only in hope and confidence that thou shouldst grow 
 rich by it? Was it not all mercenary?" The very thing that Satan 
 suggested. <I>Is not thy religion thy hope, and are not thy ways thy
 confidence?</I> so Mr. Broughton. Or, "Was it not? Didst thou not
 think that that would be thy protection? But thou art deceived." Or, 
 "Would it not have been so? If it had been sincere, would it not have 
 kept thee from this despair?" It is true, <I>if thou faint in the day 
 of adversity, thy strength,</I> thy grace, <I>is small</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+24:10">Prov. xxiv. 10</A>);

 but it does not therefore follow that thou hast no grace, no strength
 at all. A man's character is not to be taken from a single act.</P>

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Eliphaz here advances another argument to prove Job a hypocrite, and 
 will have not only his impatience under his afflictions to be evidence 
 against him but even his afflictions themselves, being so very great 
 and extraordinary, and there being no prospect at all of his 
 deliverance out of them. To strengthen his argument he here lays down 
 these two principles, which seem plausible enough:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That good men were never thus ruined. For the proof of this he 
 appeals to Job's own observation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>):

 "<I>Remember, I pray thee;</I> recollect all that thou hast seen,
 heard, or read, and give me an instance of any one that was innocent 
 and righteous, and yet perished as thou dost, and was cut off as thou 
 art." If we understand it of a final and eternal destruction, his 
 principle is true. None that are innocent and righteous perish for 
 ever: it is only a <I>man of sin</I> that is a <I>son of perdition,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:3">2 Thess. ii. 3</A>.

 But then it is ill applied to Job; he did not thus perish, nor was he
 cut off: a man is never undone till he is in hell. But, if we 
 understand it of any temporal calamity, his principle is not true. 
 <I>The righteous perish</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+57:1">Isa. lvii. 1</A>):

 <I>there is one event both to the righteous and to the wicked</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+9:2">Eccl. ix. 2</A>),

 both in life and death; the great and certain difference is after
 death. Even before Job's time (as early as it was) there were instances 
 sufficient to contradict this principle. Did not righteous Abel 
 <I>perish being innocent?</I> and was he not cut off in the beginning 
 of his days? Was not righteous Lot burnt out of house and harbour, and 
 forced to retire to a melancholy cave? Was not righteous Jacob <I>a 
 Syrian ready to perish?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+26:5">Deut. xxvi. 5</A>.

 Other such instances, no doubt, there were, which are not on
 record.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That wicked men were often thus ruined. For the proof of this he 
 vouches his own observation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "<I>Even as I have seen,</I> many a time, <I>those that plough
 iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap accordingly; by the blast of God 
 they perish,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 We have daily instances of that; and therefore, since thou dost thus
 perish and art consumed, we have reason to think that, whatever 
 profession of religion thou hast made, thou hast but ploughed iniquity 
 and sown wickedness. Even as I have seen in others, so do I see in
 thee."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He speaks of sinners in general, politic busy sinners, that take 
 pains in sin, for they plough iniquity; and expect gain by sin, for 
 they sow wickedness. Those that plough plough in hope, but what is the 
 issue? <I>They reap the same.</I> They shall of the <I>flesh reap 
 corruption</I> and ruin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+6:7,8">Gal. vi. 7, 8</A>.

 The harvest will be <I>a heap in the day of grief and desperate
 sorrow,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+17:11">Isa. xvii. 11</A>.

 He shall reap <I>the same,</I> that is, the proper product of that
 seedness. That which the sinner sows, he <I>sows not that body that 
 shall be,</I> but God will give it a body, a body of death, <I>the end 
 of those things,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:21">Rom. vi. 21</A>.

 Some, by iniquity and wickedness, understand wrong and injury done to
 others. Those who plough and sow them shall reap the same, that is, 
 they shall be paid in their own coin. Those who are troublesome shall 
 be troubled,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+1:6,Jos+7:25">2 Thess. i. 6; Josh. vii. 25</A>.

 The <I>spoilers shall be spoiled</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+33:1">Isa. xxxiii. 1</A>),

 and those that led captive shall <I>go captive,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+13:10">Rev. xiii. 10</A>.

 He further describes their destruction

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>By the blast of God they perish.</I> The projects they take so much
 pains in are defeated; God cuts asunder the cords of those ploughers, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+129:3,4">Ps. cxxix. 3, 4</A>.

 They themselves are destroyed, which is the just punishment of their
 iniquity. <I>They perish,</I> that is, they are destroyed utterly; 
 <I>they are consumed,</I> that is, they are destroyed gradually; and 
 this by the blast and breath of God, that is,

 (1.) By his wrath. His anger is the ruin of sinners, who are therefore 
 called <I>vessels of wrath,</I> and his breath is said to <I>kindle 
 Tophet,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:33">Isa. xxx. 33</A>.

 <I>Who knows the power of his anger?</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+90:11">Ps. xc. 11</A>.

 (2.) By his word. He speaks and it is done, easily and effectually. The 
 Spirit of God, in the word, consumes sinners; with that he slays them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+6:5">Hos. vi. 5</A>.

 Saying and doing are not two things with God. The man of sin is said to
 be consumed with the <I>breath of Christ's mouth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Th+2:8,Isa+11:4,Re+19:21">2 Thess. ii. 8. 
 Compare Isa. xi. 4; Rev. xix. 21</A>.

 Some think that in attributing the destruction of sinners to the blast
 of God, and <I>the breath of his nostrils,</I> he refers to the wind 
 which blew the house down upon Job's children, as if they were 
 therefore <I>sinners above all men because they suffered such 
 things.</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:2">Luke xiii. 2</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He speaks particularly of tyrants and cruel oppressors, under the 
 similitude of lions, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) How he describes their cruelty and oppression. The Hebrew tongue 
 has five several names for lions, and they are all here used to set 
 forth the terrible tearing power, fierceness, and cruelty, of proud 
 oppressors. They roar, and rend, and prey upon all about them, and 
 bring up their young ones to do so too,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+19:3">Ezek. xix. 3</A>.

 The devil is a roaring lion; and they partake of his nature, and do his
 lusts. They are strong as lions, and subtle 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+10:9,17:12">Ps. x. 9; xvii. 12</A>);

 and, as far as they prevail, they lay all desolate about them.

 (2.) How he describes their destruction, the destruction both of their 
 power and of their persons. They shall be restrained from doing further 
 hurt and reckoned with for the hurt they have done. An effectual course 
 shall be taken,

 [1.] That they shall not terrify. The voice of their roaring shall be 
 stopped.

 [2.] That they shall not tear. God will disarm them, will take away
 their power to do hurt: <I>The teeth of the young lions are broken.</I> 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+3:7">Ps. iii. 7</A>.

 Thus shall the remainder of wrath be restrained.

 [3.] That they shall not enrich themselves with the spoil of their 
 neighbours. Even <I>the old lion</I> is famished, and <I>perishes for 
 lack of prey.</I> Those that have surfeited on spoil and rapine are 
 perhaps reduced to such straits as to die of hunger at last.

 [4.] That they shall not, as they promise themselves, leave a 
 succession: <I>The stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad,</I> to 
 seek for food themselves, which the old ones used to bring in for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Na+2:12">Nah. ii. 12</A>.

 <I>The lion did tear in pieces for his whelps,</I> but now they must
 shift for themselves. Perhaps Eliphaz intended, in this, to reflect 
 upon Job, as if he, being the <I>greatest of all the men of the 
 east,</I> had got his estate by spoil and used his power in oppressing 
 his neighbours, but now his power and estate were gone, and his family 
 was scattered: if so, it was a pity that a man whom God praised should 
 be thus abused.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>12  Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear
 received a little thereof.
 &nbsp; 13  In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep
 falleth on men,
 &nbsp; 14  Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to
 shake.
 &nbsp; 15  Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh
 stood up:
 &nbsp; 16  It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an
 image <I>was</I> before mine eyes, <I>there was</I> silence, and I heard a
 voice, <I>saying,</I>
 &nbsp; 17  Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more
 pure than his maker?
 &nbsp; 18  Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he
 charged with folly:
 &nbsp; 19  How much less <I>in</I> them that dwell in houses of clay, whose
 foundation <I>is</I> in the dust, <I>which</I> are crushed before the moth?
 &nbsp; 20  They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for
 ever without any regarding <I>it.</I>
 &nbsp; 21  Doth not their excellency <I>which is</I> in them go away? they
 die, even without wisdom.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Eliphaz, having undertaken to convince Job of the sin and folly of his 
 discontent and impatience, here vouches a vision he had been favoured 
 with, which he relates to Job for his conviction. What comes 
 immediately from God all men will pay a particular deference to, and 
 Job, no doubt, as much as any. Some think Eliphaz had this vision now 
 <I>lately,</I> since he came to Job, putting words into his mouth 
 wherewith to reason with him; and it would have been well if he had 
 kept to the purport of this vision, which would serve for a ground on 
 which to reprove Job for his murmuring, but not to condemn him as a 
 hypocrite. Others think he had it <I>formerly;</I> for God did, in this 
 way, often communicate his mind to the children of men in those first 
 ages of the world, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:15"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 15</A>.

 Probably God had sent Eliphaz this messenger and message some time or
 other, when he was himself in an unquiet discontented frame, to calm 
 and pacify him. Note, As we should comfort others with that wherewith 
 we have been comforted 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+1:4">2 Cor. i. 4</A>),

 so we should endeavour to convince others with that which has been
 powerful to convince us. The people of God had not then any written 
 word to quote, and therefore God sometimes notified to them even common 
 truths by the extraordinary ways of revelation. We that have Bibles 
 have there (thanks be to God) a more sure word to depend upon than even 
 visions and voices,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Pe+1:19">2 Pet. i. 19</A>.

 Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The manner in which this message was sent to Eliphaz, and the 
 circumstances of the conveyance of it to him. 

 1. It was <I>brought to him secretly,</I> or by stealth. Some of the
 sweetest communion gracious souls have with God is in secret, where no 
 eye sees but that of him who is all eye. God has ways of bringing 
 conviction, counsel, and comfort, to his people, unobserved by the 
 world, by private whispers, as powerfully and effectually as by the 
 public ministry. <I>His secret is with them,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:14">Ps. xxv. 14</A>.

 As the evil spirit often steals good words out of the heart

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+13:19">Matt. xiii. 19</A>),

 so the good Spirit sometimes steals good words into the heart, or ever
 we are aware. 

 2. <I>He received a little thereof,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 And it is but a little of divine knowledge that the best receive in
 this world. We know little in comparison with what is to be known, and
 with what we shall know when we come to heaven. <I>How little a portion 
 is heard of God!</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+26:14"><I>ch.</I> xxvi. 14</A>.

 <I>We know but in part,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+13:12">1 Cor. xiii. 12</A>.

 See his humility and modesty. He pretends not to have understood it
 fully, but something of it he perceived. 

 3. It was brought to him in the <I>visions of the night</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 when he had retired from the world and the hurry of it, and all about
 him was composed and quiet. Note, The more we are withdrawn from the
 world and the things of it the fitter we are for communion with God. 
 When we are <I>communing with our own hearts, and are still</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:4">Ps. iv. 4</A>),

 then is a proper time for the Holy Spirit to commune with us. When
 others were asleep Eliphaz was ready to receive this visit from Heaven, 
 and probably, like David, was <I>meditating upon God in the 
 night-watches;</I> in the midst of those good thoughts this thing was 
 brought to him. We should hear more from God if we thought more of him;
 yet some are surprised with convictions in the night,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+33:14,15"><I>ch.</I> xxxiii. 14, 15</A>.

 4. It was prefaced with terrors: <I>Fear came upon him, and
 trembling,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.

 It should seem, before he either heard or saw any thing, he was seized
 with this trembling, which shook his bones, and perhaps the bed under 
 him. A holy awe and reverence of God and his majesty being struck upon 
 his spirit, he was thereby prepared for a divine visit. Whom God 
 intends to honour he first humbles and lays low, and will have us all 
 to serve him with holy fear, and to rejoice with trembling.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The messenger by whom it was sent--<I>a spirit,</I> one of the good
 angels, who are employed not only as the ministers of God's providence, 
 but sometimes as the ministers of his word. Concerning this apparition 
 which Eliphaz saw we are here told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>),

 1. That it was real, and not a dream, not a fancy. <I>An image</I> was
 before his eyes; he plainly saw it; at first it passed and repassed 
 before his face, moved up and down, but at length it <I>stood still</I> 
 to speak to him. If some have been so knavish as to impose false 
 visions on others, and some so foolish as to be themselves imposed 
 upon, it does not therefore follow but that there may have been 
 apparitions of spirits, both good and bad. 

 2. That it was indistinct, and somewhat confused. He <I>could not
 discern the form thereof,</I> so as to frame any exact idea of it in 
 his own mind, much less to give a description of it. His conscience was 
 to be awakened and informed, not his curiosity gratified. We know 
 little of spirits; we are not capable of knowing much of them, nor is 
 it fit that we should: all in good time; we must shortly remove to the 
 world of spirits, and shall then be better acquainted with them. 

 3. That it puts him into a great consternation, so that his hair stood
 on end. Ever since man sinned it has been terrible to him to receive
 an express from heaven, as conscious to himself that he can expect no 
 good tidings thence; apparitions therefore, even of good spirits, have 
 always made deep impressions of fear, even upon good men. How well it 
 is for us that God sends us his messages, not by spirits, but by men 
 like ourselves, <I>whose terror shall not make us afraid!</I> See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+7:28,10:8,9">Dan. vii. 28; x. 8, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The message itself. Before it was delivered <I>there was 
 silence,</I> profound silence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 When we are to speak either from God or to him it becomes us to address
 ourselves to it with a solemn pause, and so to set bounds about the 
 mount on which God is to come down, and not be hasty to utter any 
 thing. It was in a still small voice that the message was delivered, 
 and this was it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 "<I>Shall mortal man be more just than God,</I> the immortal God?
 <I>Shall a man be</I> thought to be, or pretend to be, <I>more pure 
 than his Maker?</I> Away with such a thought!" 

 1. Some think that Eliphaz aims hereby to prove that Job's great
 afflictions were a certain evidence of his being a wicked man. A mortal 
 man would be thought unjust and very impure if he should thus correct 
 and punish a servant or subject, unless he had been guilty of some very 
 great crime: "If therefore there were not some great crimes for which 
 God thus punishes thee, man would be more just than God, which is not 
 to be imagined." 

 2. I rather think it is only a reproof of Job's murmuring and
 discontent: "Shall a man pretend to be more just and pure than God?
 more truly to understand, and more strictly to observe, the rules and 
 laws of equity than God? Shall <I>Enosh,</I> mortal and miserable man, 
 be so insolent; nay, shall <I>Geber,</I> the strongest and most eminent 
 man, man at his best estate, pretend to compare with God, or stand in 
 competition with him?" Note, It is most impious and absurd to think 
 either others or ourselves more just and pure than God. Those that
 quarrel and find fault with the directions of the divine law, the 
 dispensations of the divine grace, or the disposals of the divine 
 providence, make themselves more just and pure than God; and those who 
 thus <I>reprove God, let them answer it.</I> What! sinful man! (for he 
 would not have been mortal if he had not been sinful) short-sighted 
 man! Shall he pretend to be more just, more pure, than God, who, being 
 his Maker, is his Lord and owner? Shall the clay contend with the 
 potter? What justice and purity there is in man, God is the author of 
 it, and therefore is himself more just and pure. See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+94:9,10">Ps. xciv. 9, 10</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. The comment which Eliphaz makes upon this, for so it seems to be;
 yet some take all the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:18-21">following verses</A>

 to be spoken in vision. It comes all to one.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. He shows how little the angels themselves are in comparison with 
 God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 Angels are God's servants, waiting servants, working servants; they are
 his ministers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+104:4">Ps. civ. 4</A>);

 bright and blessed beings they are, but God neither needs them nor is
 benefited by them and is himself infinitely above them, and therefore,

 (1.) He puts no trust in them, did not repose a confidence in them, as 
 we do in those we cannot live without. There is no service in which he 
 employs them but, if he pleased, he could have it done as well without 
 them. He never made them his confidants, or of his cabinet-council,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+24:36">Matt. xxiv. 36</A>.

 He does not leave his business wholly to them, but <I>his own eyes run
 to and fro through the earth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+16:9">2 Chron. xvi. 9</A>.

 See this phrase,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+39:11"><I>ch.</I> xxxix. 11</A>.

 Some give this sense of it: "So mutable is even the angelical nature
 that God would not trust angels with their own integrity; if he had, 
 they would all have done as some did, left their first estate; but he 
 saw it necessary to give them supernatural grace to confirm them." 

 (2.) He charges them with folly, vanity, weakness, infirmity, and
 imperfection, in comparison with himself. If the world were left to the 
 government of the angels, and they were trusted with the sole 
 management of affairs, they would take false steps, and everything 
 would not be done for the best, as now it is. Angels are intelligences, 
 but finite ones. Though not chargeable with iniquity, yet with 
 imprudence. This last clause is variously rendered by the critics. I 
 think it would bear this reading, repeating the negation, which is very 
 common: <I>He will put no trust in his saints; nor will he glory in his 
 angels (in angelis suis non ponet gloriationem) or make his boast</I>
 of them, as if their praises, or services, added any thing to him: it 
 is his glory that he is infinitely happy without them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Thence he infers how much less man is, how much less to be trusted 
 in or gloried in. If there is such a distance between God and angels, 
 what is there between God and man! See how man is represented here in 
 his meanness.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Look upon man in his life, and he is very mean, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 Take man in his best estate, and he is a very despicable creature in
 comparison with the holy angels, though honourable if compared with the 
 brutes. It is true, angels are spirits, and the souls of men are 
 spirits; but,

 [1.] Angels are pure spirits; the souls of men <I>dwell in houses of 
 clay:</I> such the bodies of men are. Angels are free; human souls are 
 housed, and the body is a cloud, a clog, to it; it is its cage; it is 
 its prison. It is a house of clay, mean and mouldering; an earthen 
 vessel, soon broken, as it was first formed, according to the good 
 pleasure of the potter. It is a cottage, not a house of cedar or a 
 house of ivory, but of clay, which would soon be in ruins if not kept 
 in constant repair. 

 [2.] Angels are fixed, but the very <I>foundation</I> of that house of 
 clay in which man dwells <I>is in the dust.</I> A house of clay, if 
 built upon a rock, might stand long; but, if founded in the dust, the 
 uncertainty of the foundation will hasten its fall, and it will sink 
 with its own weight. As man was made out of the earth, so he is 
 maintained and supported by that which cometh out of the earth. Take 
 away that, and his body returns to its earth. We stand but upon the 
 dust; some have a higher heap of dust to stand upon than others, but 
 still it is the earth that stays us up and will shortly swallow us up.

 [3.] Angels are immortal, but man is soon crushed; the <I>earthly house 
 of his tabernacle is dissolved;</I> he <I>dies and wastes away, is 
 crushed like a moth</I> between one's fingers, as easily, as quickly; 
 one may almost as soon kill a man as kill a moth. A little thing will 
 destroy his life. He is <I>crushed before the face of the moth,</I> so 
 the word is. If some lingering distemper, which consumes like a moth, 
 be commissioned to destroy him, he can no more resist it than he can 
 resist an acute distemper, which comes roaring upon him like a lion. 
 See 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:12-14">Hos. v. 12-14</A>.

 Is such a creature as this to be trusted in, or can any service be
 expected from him by that God who puts no trust in angels 
 themselves?</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Look upon him in his death, and he appears yet more despicable, 
 and unfit to be trusted. Men are mortal and dying, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 [1.] In death <I>they are destroyed,</I> and <I>perish for ever,</I> as 
 to this world; it is the final period of their lives, and all the 
 employments and enjoyments here; their place will know them no more.

 [2.] They are dying daily, and continually wasting: <I>Destroyed from 
 morning to evening.</I> Death is still working in us, like a mole 
 digging our grave at each remove, and we so continually lie exposed 
 that we are killed all the day long.

 [3.] Their life is short, and in a little time they are cut off. It 
 lasts perhaps but from morning to evening. It is but a day (so some 
 understand it); their birth and death are but the sun-rise and sun-set 
 of the same day.

 [4.] In death all their excellency passes away; beauty, strength, 
 learning, not only cannot secure them from death, but must die with 
 them, nor shall their pomp, their wealth, or power, descend after them.

 [5.] Their wisdom cannot save them from death: <I>They die without 
 wisdom,</I> die for want of wisdom, by their own foolish management of 
 themselves, digging their graves with their own teeth.

 [6.] It is so common a thing that nobody heeds it, nor takes any notice 
 of it: <I>They perish without any regarding it,</I> or laying it to 
 heart. The deaths of others are much the subject of common talk, but 
 little the subject of serious thought. Some think the eternal
 damnation of sinners is here spoken of, as well as their temporal 
 death: <I>They are destroyed, or broken to pieces, by death, from 
 morning to evening; and, if they repent not, they perish for ever</I> 
 (so some read it), 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 They perish for ever because they regard not God and their duty; they
 <I>consider not their latter end,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+1:9">Lam. i. 9</A>.

 They have no excellency but that which death takes away, and they die,
 they die the second death, for want of wisdom to lay hold on eternal 
 life. Shall such a mean, weak, foolish, sinful, dying creature as this 
 pretend to be <I>more just than God and more pure than his Maker?</I> 
 No, instead of quarrelling with his afflictions, let him wonder that he 
 is out of hell.</P>
