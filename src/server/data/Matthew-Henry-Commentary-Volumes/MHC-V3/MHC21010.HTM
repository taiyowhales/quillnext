 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This chapter seems to be like Solomon's proverbs, a collection of wise 
 sayings and observations, rather than a part of his sermon; but the 
 preacher studied to be sententious, and "set in order many proverbs," 
 to be brought in in his preaching. Yet the general scope of all the 
 observations in this chapter is to recommend wisdom to us, and its 
 precepts and rules, as of great use for the right ordering of our 
 conversation and to caution us against folly. 

 I. He recommends wisdom to private persons, who are in an inferior
 station. 

 1. It is our wisdom to preserve our reputation, in managing our affairs
 dexterously, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 2. To be submissive to our superiors if at any time we have offended
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:4">ver. 4</A>.

 3. To live quiet and peaceable lives, and not to meddle with those that
 are factious and seditious, and are endeavouring to disturb the 
 government and the public repose, the folly and danger of which 
 disloyal and turbulent practices he shows, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:8-11">ver. 8-11</A>.

 4. To govern our tongues well, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:12-15">ver. 12-15</A>.

 5. To be diligent in our business and provide well for our families, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:18-19">ver. 18, 19</A>.
 
 6. Not to speak ill of our rulers, no, not in secret, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:20">ver. 20</A>.
 
 II. He recommends wisdom to rulers; let them not think that, because
 their subjects must be quiet under them, therefore they may do what 
 they please; no, but, 

 1. Let them be careful whom they prefer to places of trust and power, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 2. Let them manage themselves discreetly, be generous and not childish, 
 temperate and not luxurious, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:16,17">ver. 16, 17</A>.

 Happy the nation when princes and people make conscience of their duty
 according to these rules.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth
 a stinking savour: <I>so doth</I> a little folly him that is in
 reputation for wisdom <I>and</I> honour.
 &nbsp; 2  A wise man's heart <I>is</I> at his right hand; but a fool's heart
 at his left.
 &nbsp; 3  Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his
 wisdom faileth <I>him,</I> and he saith to every one <I>that</I> he <I>is</I> a
 fool.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses Solomon shows,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. What great need wise men have to take heed of being guilty of any 
 instance of folly; for <I>a little folly</I> is a great blemish to him 
 that <I>is in reputation for wisdom and honour,</I> and is as hurtful 
 to his good name as <I>dead flies</I> are to a sweet perfume, not only 
 spoiling the sweetness of it, but making it <I>to send forth a stinking 
 savour.</I> Note, 

 1. True wisdom is true honour, and will gain a man a reputation, which 
 is like a box of precious ointment, pleasing and very valuable.

 2. The reputation that is got with difficulty, and by a great deal of
 wisdom, may be easily lost, and by a <I>little folly,</I> because envy 
 fastens upon eminency, and makes the worst of the mistakes and 
 miscarriages of those who are cried up for wisdom, and improves them to 
 their disadvantage; so that the folly which in another would not be 
 taken notice of in them is severely censured. Those who make a great 
 profession of religion have need to walk very circumspectly, to 
 <I>abstain from all appearances of evil,</I> and approaches towards it, 
 because many eyes are upon them, that watch for their halting; their 
 character is soon sullied, and they have a great deal of reputation to 
 lose.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. What a deal of advantage a wise man has above a fool in the 
 management of business 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>A wise man's heart is at his right hand,</I> so that he goes about 
 his business with dexterity, turns his hand readily to it, and goes 
 through it with despatch; his counsel and courage are ready to him, 
 whenever he has occasion for them. But a <I>fool's heart is at his left 
 hand;</I> it is always to seek when he has any thing to do that is of 
 importance, and therefore he goes awkwardly about it, like a man that 
 is left-handed; he is soon at a loss and at his wits' end.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How apt fools are at every turn to proclaim their own folly, and 
 expose themselves; he that is either witless or graceless, either silly 
 or wicked, if he be ever so little from under the check, and left to 
 himself, if he but <I>walk by the way,</I> soon shows what he is; his 
 <I>wisdom fails him,</I> and, by some impropriety or other, <I>he says 
 to every one he meets that he is a fool</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>),

 that is, he discovers his folly as plainly as if he had told them so. 
 He cannot conceal it, and he is not ashamed of it. Sin is the reproach 
 of sinners wherever they go.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not
 thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.
 &nbsp; 5  There is an evil <I>which</I> I have seen under the sun, as an
 error <I>which</I> proceedeth from the ruler:
 &nbsp; 6  Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.
 &nbsp; 7  I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as
 servants upon the earth.
 &nbsp; 8  He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh
 a hedge, a serpent shall bite him.
 &nbsp; 9  Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; <I>and</I> he that
 cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.
 &nbsp; 10  If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must
 he put to more strength: but wisdom <I>is</I> profitable to direct.
 &nbsp; 11  Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a
 babbler is no better.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The scope of these verses is to keep subjects loyal and dutiful to the 
 government. In Solomon's reign the people were very rich, and lived in 
 prosperity, which perhaps made them proud and petulant, and when the 
 taxes were high, though they had enough to pay them with, it is 
 probable that many conducted themselves insolently towards the 
 government and threatened to rebel. To such Solomon here gives some 
 necessary cautions.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Let not subjects carry on a quarrel with their prince upon any 
 private personal disgust 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee,</I> if upon some 
 misinformation given him, or some mismanagement of thine, he is 
 displeased at thee, and threaten thee, yet <I>leave not thy place,</I> 
 forget not the duty of a subject, revolt not from thy allegiance, do 
 not, in a passion, quit thy post in his service and throw up thy 
 commission, as despairing ever to regain his favour. No, wait awhile, 
 and thou wilt find he is not implacable, but that <I>yielding pacifies 
 great offences.</I>" Solomon speaks for himself, and for every wise and 
 good man that is a master, or a magistrate, that he could easily 
 forgive those, upon their submission, whom yet, upon their provocation, 
 he had been very angry with. It is safer and better to yield to an 
 angry prince than to contend with him.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Let not subjects commence a quarrel with their prince, though the 
 public administration be not in every thing as they would have it. He 
 grants <I>there is an evil often seen under the sun,</I> and it is a 
 king's-evil, an evil which the king only can cure, for <I>it is an 
 error which proceeds from the ruler</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>);

 it is a mistake which rulers, consulting their personal affections more 
 than the public interests, are too often guilty of, that men are not 
 preferred according to their merit, but <I>folly is set in great 
 dignity,</I> men of shattered brains, and broken fortunes, are put in 
 places of power and trust, while the rich men of good sense and good 
 estates, whose interest would oblige them to be true to the public, and 
 whose abundance would be likely to set them above temptations to 
 bribery and extortion, yet sit in low places, and can get no preferment 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>),

 either the ruler knows not how to value them or the terms of preferment 
 are such as they cannot in conscience comply with. It is ill with a 
 people when vicious men are advanced and men of worth are kept under 
 hatches. This is illustrated

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 "<I>I have seen servants upon horses,</I> men not so much of mean 
 extraction and education (if that were all, it were the more excusable, 
 nay, there is many a wise servant who with good reason <I>has rule over 
 a son that causes shame</I>), but of sordid, servile, mercenary 
 dispositions. I have seen these riding in pomp and state as princes, 
 while princes, men of noble birth and qualities, fit to rule a kingdom, 
 have been forced to <I>walk as servants upon the earth,</I> poor and 
 despised." Thus God, in his providence, punishes a wicked people; but, 
 as far as it is the ruler's act and deed, it is certainly his 
 <I>error,</I> and a <I>great evil,</I> a grievance to the subject and 
 very provoking; but it is <I>an error under the sun,</I> which will 
 certainly be rectified above the sun, and when it shall shine no more, 
 for in heaven it is only wisdom and holiness that are set in great 
 dignity. But, if the prince be guilty of his error, yet let not the
 subjects <I>leave their place,</I> nor rise up against the government, 
 nor form any project for the alteration of it; nor let the prince carry 
 on the humour too far, nor set such servants, such beggars, on 
 horseback, as will ride furiously over the ancient land-marks of the 
 constitution, and threaten the subversion of it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Let neither prince nor people violently attempt any changes, nor 
 make a forcible entry upon a national settlement, for they will both 
 find it of dangerous consequence, which he shows here by four 
 similitudes, the scope of which is to give us a caution not to meddle 
 to our own hurt. Let not princes invade the rights and liberties of 
 their subjects; let not subjects mutiny and rebel against their 
 princes; for, 

 (1.) <I>He that digs a pit</I> for another, it is ten to one but he 
 <I>falls into it</I> himself, and his violent dealing returns upon his 
 own head. If princes become tyrants, or subjects become rebels, all 
 histories will tell both what is likely to be their fate and that it is 
 at their utmost peril, and it were better for both to be content within 
 their own bounds. 

 (2.) <I>Whoso breaks a hedge,</I> an old hedge, that has long been a 
 land-mark, let him expect that a <I>serpent,</I> or <I>adder,</I> such 
 as harbour in rotten hedges, will <I>bite him;</I> some viper or other 
 will fasten upon his hand, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+28:3">Acts xxviii. 3</A>.

 God, by his ordinance, as by a hedge, has inclosed the prerogatives and
 powers of princes; their persons are under his special protection; 
 those therefore that form any treasonable designs against their peace, 
 their crown, and dignity, are but twisting halters for themselves.

 (3.) <I>Whoso removes stones,</I> to pull down a wall or building, does 
 but pluck them upon himself; he shall be <I>hurt therewith,</I> and 
 will wish that he had let them alone. Those that go about to alter a 
 well-modelled well-settled government, under colour of redressing some 
 grievances and correcting some faults in it, will quickly perceive not 
 only that it is easier to find fault than to mend, to demolish that 
 which is good than to build up that which is better, but that they 
 thrust their own fingers into the fire and overwhelm themselves in the 
 ruin they occasion. 

 (4.) <I>He that cleaves the wood,</I> especially if, as it follows, he 
 has sorry tools 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 <I>shall be endangered thereby;</I> the chips, or his own axe-head, 
 will fly in his face. If we meet with knotty pieces of timber, and we 
 think to master them by force and violence, and hew them to pieces, 
 they may not only prove too hard for us, but the attempt may turn to 
 our own damage.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Rather let both prince and people act towards each other with 
 prudence, mildness, and good temper: <I>Wisdom is profitable to 
 direct</I> the ruler how to manage a people that are inclined to be 
 turbulent, so as neither, on the one hand, by a supine negligence to 
 embolden and encourage them, nor, on the other hand, by rigour and 
 severity to exasperate and provoke them to any seditious practices. It 
 is likewise profitable to direct the subjects how to act towards a 
 prince that is inclined to bear hard upon them, so as not to alienate 
 his affections from them, but to win upon him by humble remonstrances 
 (not insolent demands, such as the people made upon Rehoboam), by 
 patient submissions and peaceable expedients. The same rule is to be 
 observed in all relations, for the preserving of the comfort of them. 
 Let wisdom direct to gentle methods and forbear violent ones. 

 (1.) Wisdom will teach us to whet the tool we are to make use of, 
 rather than, by leaving it blunt, oblige ourselves to exert so much the 
 <I>more strength,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 We might save ourselves a great deal of labour, and prevent a great
 deal of danger, if we did whet before we cut, that is, consider and 
 premeditate what is fit to be said and done in every difficult case, 
 that we may accommodate ourselves to it and may do our work smoothly 
 and easily both to others and to ourselves. Wisdom will direct how to
 sharpen and put an edge upon both ourselves and those we employ, not to 
 <I>work deceitfully</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+52:2">Ps. lii. 2</A>),

 but to work cleanly and cleverly. The mower loses no time when he is
 whetting his scythe.

 (2.) Wisdom will teach us to enchant the serpent we are to contend 
 with, rather than think to out-hiss it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 <I>The serpent will bite</I> if he be not by singing and music charmed 
 and enchanted, against which therefore he <I>stops his ears</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+58:4,5">Ps. lviii. 4, 5</A>);

 <I>and a babbler is no better</I> to all those who enter the lists with
 him, who therefore must not think by dint of words to out-talk him, but 
 be prudent management to enchant him. <I>He that is lord of the
 tongue</I> (so the phrase is), a ruler that has liberty of speech and 
 may say what he will, it is as dangerous dealing with him as with a 
 serpent uncharmed; but, if you use the enchantment of a mild and humble 
 submission, you may be safe and out of danger; herein <I>wisdom,</I> 
 the meekness of wisdom, <I>is profitable to direct. By long forbearing 
 is a prince persuaded,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+25:15">Prov. xxv. 15</A>.

 Jacob enchanted Esau with a present and Abigail David. To those that
 may say any thing it is wisdom to say nothing that is provoking.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon, having shown the benefit of wisdom, and of what great 
 advantage it is to us in the management of our affairs, here shows the 
 mischief of folly and how it exposes men, which perhaps comes in as a 
 reflection upon those rulers who <I>set folly in great dignity.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Fools talk a great deal to no purpose, and they show their folly as 
 much by the multitude, impertinence, and mischievousness of their 
 words, as by any thing; whereas <I>the words of a wise man's mouth are 
 gracious,</I> are grace, manifest grace in his heart and minister grace 
 to the hearers, are good, and such as become him, and do good to all 
 about him, <I>the lips of a fool</I> not only expose him to reproach 
 and make him ridiculous, but <I>will swallow up himself</I> and bring 
 him to ruin, by provoking the government to take cognizance of his 
 seditious talk and call him to an account for it. Adonijah foolishly 
 <I>spoke against his own life,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ki+2:23">1 Kings ii. 23</A>.

 Many a man has been sunk by having <I>his own tongue fall upon him,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:8">Ps. lxiv. 8</A>.
 
 See what a fool's talk is.

 1. It takes rise from his own weakness and wickedness: <I>The beginning 
 of the words of his mouth is foolishness,</I> the foolishness bound up 
 in his heart, that is the corrupt spring out of which all these 
 polluted streams flow, the evil treasure out of which evil things are 
 brought. As soon as he begins to speak you may perceive his folly; at 
 the very first he talks idly, and passionately, and like himself. 

 2. It rises up to fury, and tends to the hurt and injury of others:
 <I>The end of his talk,</I> the end it comes to, <I>is madness.</I> He 
 will presently talk himself into an indecent heat, and break out into 
 the wild extravagancies of a distracted man. The end he aims at is 
 mischief; as, at first, he appeared to have little government of 
 himself, so, at last, it appears he has a great deal of malice to his 
 neighbours; that root of bitterness bears gall and wormwood. Note, It 
 is not strange if those that begin foolishly end madly; for an 
 ungoverned tongue, the more liberty is allowed, grows the more violent.

 3. It is all the same over and over 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>A fool also is full of words,</I> a passionate fool especially, that 
 runs on endlessly and never knows when to leave off. He will have the 
 last word, though it be but the same with that which was the first. 
 What is wanting in the weight and strength of his words he endeavours 
 in vain to make up in the number of them; and they must be repeated, 
 because otherwise there is nothing in them to make them regarded. Note, 
 Many who are empty of sense are <I>full of words;</I> and the least 
 solid are the most noisy. The following words may be taken either,

 (1.) As checking him for his vainglorious boasting in the multitude of 
 his words, what he will do and what he will have, not considering that 
 which every body knows that <I>a man cannot tell what shall be</I> in 
 his own time, while he lives 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+27:1">Prov. xxvii. 1</A>),

 much less can one tell <I>what shall be after him,</I> when he is dead
 and gone. Would we duly consider our own ignorance of, and uncertainty 
 about, future events, it would cut off a great many of the idle words 
 we foolishly multiply. Or,

 (2.) As mocking him for his tautologies. He is <I>full of words,</I> 
 for if he do but speak the most trite and common thing, <I>a man cannot 
 tell what shall be,</I> because he loves to hear himself talk, he will 
 say it again, <I>what shall be after him who can tell him?</I> like 
 Battus in Ovid:</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Fools toil a great deal to no purpose 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>);

 <I>The labour of the foolish,</I> to accomplish their designs, 
 <I>wearies every one of them.</I>

 1. They weary themselves in that labour which is very foolish and 
 absurd. All their labour is for the world and the body, and the meat 
 that perishes, and in this labour they spend their strength, and 
 exhaust their spirits, and <I>weary themselves for very vanity,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Hab+2:13,Isa+55:2">Hab. ii. 13; Isa. lv. 2</A>.

 They choose that service which is perfect drudgery rather than that
 which is perfect liberty.

 2. That labour which is necessary, and would be profitable, and might
 be gone through with ease, wearies them, because they go about it 
 awkwardly and foolishly, and so make their business a toil to them, 
 which, if they applied themselves to it prudently, would be a pleasure 
 to them. Many complain of the labours of religion as grievous, which 
 they would have no reason to complain of if the exercises of Christian 
 piety were always under the direction of Christian prudence. The 
 foolish tire themselves in endless pursuits, and never bring any thing 
 to pass, <I>because they know not how to go to the city,</I> that is, 
 because they have not capacity to apprehend the plainest thing, such as 
 the entrance into a great city is, where one would think it were 
 impossible for a man to miss his road. Men's imprudent management of 
 their business robs them both of the comfort and of the benefit of it. 
 But it is the excellency of the way to the heavenly city that it is a 
 high-way, in which the <I>wayfaring men, though fools, shall not 
 err</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+35:8">Isa. xxxv. 8</A>);
 
 yet sinful folly makes men miss that way.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>16  Woe to thee, O land, when thy king <I>is</I> a child, and thy
 princes eat in the morning!
 &nbsp; 17  Blessed <I>art</I> thou, O land, when thy king <I>is</I> the son of
 nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not
 for drunkenness!
 &nbsp; 18  By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through
 idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.
 &nbsp; 19  A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but
 money answereth all <I>things.</I>
 &nbsp; 20  Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the
 rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the
 voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.

 Solomon here observes,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How much the happiness of a land depends upon the character of its 
 rulers; it is well or ill with the people according as the princes are 
 good or bad. 

 1. The people cannot be happy when their princes are childish and 
 voluptuous 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):

 <I>Woe unto thee, O land!</I> even the land of Canaan itself, though 
 otherwise the glory of all lands, when <I>thy king is a child,</I> not 
 so much in age (Solomon himself was young when his kingdom was happy in 
 him) as in understanding; when the prince is weak and foolish as a 
 child, fickle and fond of changes, fretful and humoursome, easily 
 imposed upon, and hardly brought to business, it is ill with the 
 people. The body staggers if the head be giddy. Perhaps Solomon wrote 
 this with a foresight of his son Rehoboam's ill conduct 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+13:7">2 Chron. xiii. 7</A>);
 
 he was a child all the days of his life and his family and kingdom
 fared the worse for it. Nor is it much better with a people when their 
 princes <I>eat in the morning,</I> that is, make a god of their belly 
 and make themselves slaves to their appetites. If the king himself be a 
 child, yet if the princes and privy-counsellors are wise and faithful, 
 and apply themselves to business, the land may do the better; but if 
 they addict themselves to their pleasures, and prefer the 
 gratifications of the flesh before the despatch of the public business, 
 which they disfit themselves for by eating and drinking <I>in a 
 morning,</I> when judges are epicures, and do not eat to live, but live 
 to eat, what good can a nation expect!

 2. The people cannot but be happy when their rulers are generous and
 active, sober and temperate, and men of business, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>.

 The land is then blessed,

 (1.) When the sovereign is governed by principles of honour, <I>when 
 the king is the son of nobles,</I> actuated and animated by a noble 
 spirit, which scorns to do any thing base and unbecoming so high a 
 character, which is solicitous for the public welfare, and prefers that 
 before any private interests. Wisdom, virtue, and the fear of God, 
 beneficence, and a readiness to do good to all mankind, these ennoble 
 the royal blood. 

 2. When the subordinate magistrates are more in care to discharge their
 trusts than to gratify their appetites; when they <I>eat in due 
 season</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+145:15">Ps. cxlv. 15</A>);

 let us not take ours unseasonable, lest we lose the comfort of seeing
 God give it to us. Magistrates should <I>eat for strength,</I> that
 their bodies may be fitted to serve their souls in the service of God 
 and their country, <I>and not for drunkenness,</I> to make themselves 
 unfit to do any thing either for God or man, and particularly to <I>sit 
 in judgment,</I> for they will <I>err through wine</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:7">Isa. xxviii. 7</A>),

 will <I>drink and forget the law,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:5">Prov. xxxi. 5</A>.

 It is well with a people when their princes are examples of temperance,
 when those that have most to spend upon themselves know how to deny 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Of what ill consequence slothfulness is both to private and public 
 affairs 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>By much slothfulness and idleness of the hands,</I> the neglect of 
 business, and the love of ease and pleasure, <I>the building decays, 
 drops through</I> first, and by degrees drops down. If it be not kept 
 well covered, and care be not taken to repair the breaches, as any 
 happen, it will rain in, and the timber will rot, and the house will 
 become unfit to dwell in. It is so with the family and the affairs of 
 it; if men cannot find in their hearts to take pains in their callings, 
 to tend their shops and look after their own business, they will soon 
 run in debt and go behind-hand, and, instead of making what they have 
 more for their children, will make it less. It is so with the public; 
 if the king be <I>a child</I> and will take no care, if the <I>princes 
 eat in the morning</I> and will take no pains, the affairs of the 
 nation suffer loss, and its interests are prejudiced, its honour is 
 sullied, its power is weakened, its borders are encroached upon, the 
 course of justice is obstructed, the treasure is exhausted, and all its 
 foundations are out of course, and all this through the slothfulness of 
 self-seeking of those that should be the <I>repairers of its breaches 
 and the restorers of paths to dwell in,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+58:12">Isa. lviii. 12</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. How industrious generally all are, both princes and people, to get 
 money, because that serves for all purposes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 He seems to prefer money before mirth: <I>A feast is made for
 laughter,</I> not merely for eating, but chiefly for pleasant 
 conversation and the society of friends, not the laughter of the fool, 
 which is madness, but that of wise men, by which they fit themselves 
 for business and severe studies. Spiritual feasts are made for
 spiritual laughter, holy joy in God. <I>Wine makes merry, makes glad
 the</I> life, <I>but money</I> is the measure of all things and 
 <I>answers all things. Pecuni&aelig; obediunt omnia--Money commands all 
 things.</I> Though <I>wine make merry,</I> it will not be a house for 
 us, nor a bed, nor clothing, nor provisions and portions for children; 
 <I>but money,</I> if men have enough of it, will be all these. The 
 feast cannot be made without money, and, though men have wine, they are 
 not so much disposed to be merry unless they have money for the 
 necessary supports of life. Money of itself answers nothing; it will 
 neither feed nor clothe; but, as it is the instrument of commerce, it 
 answers all the occasions of this present life. What is to be had may 
 be had for money. But it answers nothing to the soul; it will not 
 procure the pardon of sin, the favour of God, the peace of conscience; 
 the soul, as it is not redeemed, so it is not maintained, with 
 <I>corruptible things as silver and gold.</I> Some refer this to 
 rulers; it is ill with the people when they give up themselves to 
 luxury and riot, feasting and making merry, not only because their 
 business is neglected, but because money must be had to <I>answer 
 all</I> these <I>things,</I> and, in order to that, the people squeezed 
 by heavy taxes.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. How cautious subjects have need to be that they harbour not any 
 disloyal purposes in their minds, nor keep up any factious cabals or 
 consultations against the government, because it is ten to one that 
 they are discovered and brought to light, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+10:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.

 "Though rulers should be guilty of some errors, yet be not, upon all
 occasions, arraigning their administration and running them down, but 
 make the best of them." Here,

 1. The command teaches us our duty "<I>Curse not the king, no, not in 
 thy thought,</I> do not wish ill to the government in thy mind." All 
 sin begins there, and therefore the first risings of it must be curbed 
 and suppressed, and particularly that of treason and sedition.
 "<I>Curse not the rich,</I> the princes and governors, <I>in thy 
 bed-chamber,</I> in a conclave or club of persons disaffected to the 
 government; associate not with such; <I>come not into their secret;</I> 
 join not with them in speaking ill of the government or plotting 
 against it." 

 2. The reason consults our safety. "Though the design be carried on
 ever so closely, <I>a bird of the air shall carry the voice</I> to the 
 king, who has more spies about than thou art aware of, <I>and that 
 which has wings shall tell the matter,</I> to thy confusion and ruin." 
 God sees what men do, and hears what they say, in secret; and, when he 
 pleases, he can bring it to light by strange and unsuspected ways. 
 Wouldst <I>thou then not be</I> hurt by <I>the powers</I> that be, nor 
 <I>be afraid of</I> them? <I>Do that which is good and thou shalt have 
 praise of the same; but, if thou do that which is evil, be afraid,</I>
