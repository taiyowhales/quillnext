 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently
 what <I>is</I> before thee:
 &nbsp; 2  And put a knife to thy throat, if thou <I>be</I> a man given to
 appetite.
 &nbsp; 3  Be not desirous of his dainties: for they <I>are</I> deceitful
 meat.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The sin we are here warned against is luxury and sensuality, and the 
 indulgence of the appetite in eating and drinking, a sin that most 
 easily besets us. 

 1. We are here told when we enter into temptation, and are in most
 danger of falling into this sin: "<I>When thou sittest to eat with a
 ruler</I> thou has great plenty before thee, varieties and dainties, 
 such a table spread as thou has seldom seen; thou are ready to think, 
 as Haman did, of nothing but the honour hereby done thee 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Es+5:12">Esth. v. 12</A>),
 
 and the opportunity thou hast of pleasing thy palate, and forgettest 
 that there is a snare laid for thee." Perhaps the temptation may be 
 stronger, and more dangerous, to one that is not used to such 
 entertainments, than to one that always sits down to a good table. 

 2.  We are here directed to double our guard at such a time.  We must,

 (1.) Apprehend ourselves to be in danger: "<I>Consider diligently what
 is before thee,</I> what meat and drink are before thee, that thou 
 mayest choose that which is safest for thee and which thou art least 
 likely to eat and drink of to excess. Consider what company is before 
 thee, the ruler himself, who, if he be wise and good, will take it as 
 an affront for any of his guests to disorder themselves at his table." 
 And, if when we sit to eat with a ruler, much more when we sit to eat 
 with the ruler of rulers at the Lord's table, must we <I>consider 
 diligently what is before us,</I> that we may not in any respect <I>eat 
 and drink unworthily,</I> unbecomingly, lest that table become a snare. 
 
 (2.) We must alarm ourselves into temperance and moderation: "<I>Put a
 knife to thy throat,</I> that is, restrain thyself, as it were with a 
 sword hanging over thy head, from all excess. Let these words, <I>Take 
 heed lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and 
 drunkenness, and so that day come upon you unawares</I>--or those, 
 <I>For all these things, God shall bring thee into judgment</I>--or 
 those, <I>Drunkards, shall not inherit the kingdom of God,</I> be a 
 knife to the throat." The Latins call luxury <I>gula</I>--<I>the 
 throat.</I> "Take up arms against that sin. Rather be so abstemious 
 that thy craving appetite will begin to think thy throat cut than 
 indulge thyself in voluptuousness." We must never <I>feed ourselves 
 without fear</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:12">Jude 12</A>),

 but we must in a special manner fear when temptation is before us.

 (3.) We must reason ourselves into a holy contempt of the
 gratifications of sense: "<I>If thou be a man given to appetite,</I> 
 thou must, by a present solution, and an application of the terrors of 
 the Lord, restrain thyself. When thou art in danger of falling into any 
 excess <I>put a knife to thy throat;</I> that may serve for once. But 
 that is not enough: lay the axe to the root; mortify that appetite 
 which has such a power over thee: <I>Be not desirous of dainties.</I>" 
 Note, We ought to observe what is our own iniquity, and, if we find 
 ourselves addicted to flesh-pleasing, we must not only stand upon our 
 guard against temptations from without, but subdue the corruption 
 within. Nature is desirous of food, and we are taught to pray for it, 
 but it is lust that is desirous of dainties, and we cannot in faith 
 pray for them, for frequently they are not food convenient for mind, 
 body, or estate. They are deceitful meat, and therefore David, instead 
 of praying for them, prays against them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+141:4">Ps.  cxli. 4</A>.

 They are pleasant to the palate, but perhaps rise in the stomach, turn 
 sour there, upbraid a man, and make him sick. They do not yield men the 
 satisfaction they promised themselves from them; for those that are 
 given to appetite, when they have that which is very dainty, are not 
 pleased; they are soon weary of it; they must have something else more 
 dainty. The more a luxurious appetite is humoured and indulged the more 
 humour some and troublesome it grows, and the more hard to please; 
 dainties will surfeit, but never satisfy. But especially they are upon 
 <I>this</I> account deceitful meat, that, while they please the body, 
 they prejudice the soul, they overcharge the heart, and unfit it for 
 the service of God, nay, they take away the heart, and alienate the 
 mind from spiritual delights, and spoil its relish of them. Why then 
 should we covet that which will certainly cheat us?</P>

 &nbsp; 5  Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for <I>riches</I>
 certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward
 heaven.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 As some are given to appetite 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 so others to covetousness, and those Solomon here takes to task. Men
 cheat themselves as much by setting their hearts on money (though it 
 seems most substantial) as by setting them on dainties.  Observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. How he dissuades the covetous man from toiling and tormenting 
 himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>).

 "Do not <I>aim to be rich,</I> to raise an estate, and to make what
 thou hast in abundance more than it is." We must endeavor to live 
 comfortably, and provide for our children and families, according as 
 our rank and condition are, but we must not seek great things. Be not 
 of those that will be rich, that desire it as their chief good and 
 design it as their highest end,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+6:9">1 Tim. vi. 9</A>.

 Covetous men think it is their wisdom, imagining that if they be rich 
 to such a degree they shall be completely happy. <I>Cease from that 
 wisdom,</I> for it is a mistake; <I>a man's life consists not in the 
 abundance of the things which he possesses,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+12:15">Luke xii. 15</A>.

 1. Those that aim at great things fill their hands with business more
 than they can grasp, so that their life is both a perfect drudgery and 
 a perpetual hurry; but be not thou such a fool; <I>labour not to be 
 rich.</I> What thou hast, or doest, be master of it, and not a slave to 
 it as those that <I>rise up early, sit up late,</I> and <I>eat the 
 bread of carefulness,</I> and all to be rich. Moderate labour, <I>that 
 we may have to give,</I> is our wisdom and duty, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+4:28">Eph. iv. 28</A>.

 Immoderate labour, that we may have to hoard, is our sin and folly.

 2. They fill their heads with projects more than they understand, so 
 that their life is a constant toss of care and fear; but do not thou 
 thus vex thyself: <I>Cease from thy own wisdom;</I> go on quietly in 
 the way of thy business, not contriving new ways and setting thy wits 
 to work to find out new inventions. Acquiesce in God's wisdom, and 
 cease from thy own,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+3:5,6"><I>ch.</I> iii. 5, 6</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. How he dissuades the covetous man from cheating and deceiving 
 himself by an inordinate love and pursuit of that which is vanity and 
 vexation of spirit; for,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It is not substantial and satisfying: "<I>Wilt thou</I> be such a 
 fool as to <I>set thy eyes,</I> to cause thy eyes to fly with eagerness 
 and violence, <I>upon that which is not?</I>" Note, 

 (1.) The things of this world are things that are not.  They have a
 real existence in nature and are the real gifts of Providence, but in 
 the kingdom of grace they are things that are not; they are not a 
 happiness and portion for a soul, are not what they promise to be nor 
 what we expect them to be; they are a show, a shadow, a sham upon the 
 soul that trusts to them. They are not, for in a little while they will 
 not be, they will not be ours; they perish in the using; the fashion of 
 them passes away. 

 (2.) It is therefore folly for us to set our eyes upon them, to admire 
 them as the best things, to appropriate them to ourselves as our good 
 things, and to aim at them as our mark at which all our actions are 
 levelled, to fly upon them as the eagle upon her prey. "Wilt thou do a 
 thing so absurd in itself? What thou, a reasonable creature, wilt thou 
 dote upon shadows? The eyes are put for rational and intellectual 
 powers; wilt thou throw those away upon such undeserving objects? To 
 set the hands and feet upon the world is well enough, but not the eyes, 
 the eyes of the mind; those were made to contemplate better things.  
 Wilt thou, my son, that professest religion, put such an affront upon 
 God (towards whom the eyes should ever be) and such an abuse upon thy 
 soul?"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It is not durable and abiding. Riches are very uncertain things; 
 certainly they are so: <I>They make themselves wings, and fly away.</I> 
 The more we cause our eyes to fly upon them the more likely they are to 
 fly away from us. 

 (1.) Riches will leave us. Those that hold them ever so fast cannot
 hold them long; either they must be taken from us or we must be taken 
 from them. The goods are said to flow away as a stream 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:28">Job xx. 28</A>),
 
 here to flee as a bird. 

 (2.) Perhaps they may leave us suddenly, when we have taken a great 
 deal of pains for them and begin to take a great deal of pride and 
 pleasure in them. The covetous man sits hatching upon his wealth, and 
 brooding over it, till it is fledged, as the young ones under the hen, 
 and then it is gone. Or, as if a man should be fond of a flight of 
 wild-fowl that light in his field, and call them his own because they 
 are upon his ground, whereas, if he offers to come near them, they take 
 wing immediately and are gone to another man's field.  

 (3.) The wings they fly away upon are of their own making. They have in
 themselves the principles of their own corruption, their own moth and 
 rust. They are wasting in their own nature, and like a handful of dust, 
 which, if it be grasped, slips through the fingers. Snow will last 
 awhile, and look pretty, if it be left to lie on the ground where it 
 fell, but, if gathered up and laid in the bosom, it is dissolved and 
 gone immediately. 

 (4.) They go irresistibly and irrecoverably, as <I>an eagle toward 
 heaven,</I> that flies strongly (there is no stopping her), and flies 
 out of sight and out of call (there is no bringing her back); thus do 
 riches leave men, and leave them in grief and vexation if they set 
 their hearts upon them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Those that are voluptuous and given to appetite 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>)

 are glad to be where there is good cheer stirring, and those that are
 covetous and saving, that they may spare at home, will be glad to get a 
 dinner at another man's table; and therefore both are here advised not 
 to be forward to accept of every man's invitation, but especially not 
 to thrust themselves in uninvited. Observe,

 1. There are those that pretend to bid their friends welcome that are
 not hearty and sincere in it. They have a fair tongue, and know what 
 they should say: <I>Eat and drink, saith he,</I> because it is expected 
 that the master of the feast should so compliment his guests; but they 
 have <I>an evil eye,</I> and grudge their guests every bit they eat, 
 especially if they eat freely.  They would seem to be liberal in making
 the entertainment, and would have the credit of it, but they have so 
 great a love to their money, and so little to their friends, that they 
 cannot have the comfort of it, nor any enjoyment of themselves or their 
 friends. The miser's feast is his penance. If a man be so very selfish, 
 and sordid, and mean that he cannot find in his heart to bid his 
 friends welcome to what he has, he ought not to add to that the guilt 
 of dissimulation by inviting them, but let him own himself to be what 
 he is, that <I>the vile person may not be called liberal nor the churl 
 bountiful,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+32:5">Isa.  xxxii. 5</A>.

 2. One can have no comfort in accepting the entertainments that are 
 given grudgingly: "<I>Eat not thou the bread</I> of such a man; let him 
 keep it to himself. Do not sponge upon those that are bountiful, nor 
 make thyself burdensome to any; but especially scorn to be beholden to 
 those that are paltry and not sincere. Better have a dinner of herbs, 
 and true welcome, than <I>dainty meats</I> without it.  Therefore,"

 (1.) "Judge of the man as his mind is. Thou thinkest to pay thy respect
 to him as a friend, so thou takest him to be, because he compliments 
 thee, but <I>as he thinks in his heart so is he,</I> not as he speaks 
 with his tongue." We are that really, both to God and man, which we are 
 inwardly; and neither religion nor friendship is worth any thing 
 further than as it is sincere. 

 (2.) "Judge of the meat as the digestion is and as it agrees with thee. 
 He bids thee eat freely, but, first or last, he will discover his 
 sordid covetous humour, and <I>as he thinks in his heart</I> so will he 
 look, and give thee to understand that thou art not welcome, and then 
 <I>the morsel thou hast eaten thou shalt vomit up;</I> the very thought 
 of that will make thee even to vomit the meat thou hast eaten, and eat 
 the words thou has spoken in returning his compliments and giving him 
 thanks for his civilities.  Thou shalt <I>lose thy sweet words,</I> 
 which he has given thee and thou has given him."</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>9  Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We are here directed not to <I>cast pearls before swine</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+7:6">Matt. vii. 6</A>)

 and not to expose things sacred to the contempt and ridicule of profane 
 scoffers. It is our duty to take all fit occasions to speak of divine 
 things; but, 

 1. There are some that will make a jest of every thing, though it be
 ever so prudently and pertinently spoken, that will not only despise a 
 wise man's words, but despise even the wisdom of them, that in them 
 which is most improvable for their own edification; they will 
 particularly reproach that, as if it had an ill design upon them, which 
 they must guard against. 

 2. Those that do so forfeit the benefit of good advice and instruction, 
 and a wise man is not only allowed, but advised, not to <I>speak in the 
 ears</I> of such fools; let them be foolish still, and let not precious 
 breath be thrown away upon them. If what a wise man says in his wisdom 
 will not be heard, let him hold his peace, and try whether the wisdom 
 of that will be regarded.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>10  Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields
 of the fatherless:
 &nbsp; 11  For their redeemer <I>is</I> mighty; he shall plead their cause
 with thee.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Note, 

 1. The fatherless are taken under God's special protection; with him 
 they not only find mercy shown to them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+14:3">Hos. xiv. 3</A>)

 but justice done for them. He is <I>their Redeemer,</I> their 
 <I>Go&euml;l,</I> their near kinsman, that will take their part and 
 stand up for them with jealousy, as taking himself affronted in the 
 injuries done to them. As their Redeemer <I>he will plead their 
 cause</I> against those that do them any injury, and, one way or other, 
 will not only defend their right, and recover it for them, but avenge 
 the wrongs done to them. And he <I>is mighty,</I> almighty; his 
 omnipotence is engaged and employed for their protection, and their 
 proudest and most powerful oppressors will not only find themselves an 
 unequal match for this, but will find that it is at their peril to 
 contend with it.

 2. Every man therefore must be careful not to injure them in any thing,
 or to invade their rights, either by a clandestine removal of the old 
 land-marks or by a forcible entry into their fields. Being fatherless, 
 they have none to redress their wrongs, and, being in their childhood, 
 they do not so much as apprehend the wrong that is done them. Sense of 
 honour, and much more the fear of God, would restrain men from offering 
 injury to children, especially fatherless children.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A parent instructing his child. He is here brought in persuading him 
 to give his mind to his book, and especially to the scriptures and his 
 catechism, to attend <I>to the words of knowledge,</I> by which he 
 might come to know his duty, and danger, and interest, and not to think 
 it enough to give them the hearing, but to apply his heart to them, to 
 delight in them, and bow his will to the authority of them. The heart 
 is <I>then</I> applied to the instruction when the instruction is 
 applied to the heart. 

 2. A parent correcting his child. A tender parent can scarcely find in
 his heart to do this; it goes much against the grain. But he finds it 
 is necessary; it is his duty, and therefore he dares not <I>withhold 
 correction</I> when there is occasion for it (<I>spare the rod and 
 spoil the child</I>); he <I>beats him with the rod,</I> gives him a 
 gentle correction, the <I>stripes of the sons of men,</I> not such as 
 we give to beasts. <I>Beat him with the rod and he shall not die.</I> 
 The rod will not kill him; nay, it will prevent his killing himself by 
 those vicious courses which the rod will be necessary to restrain him 
 from. For the present <I>it is not joyous, but grievous,</I> both to 
 the parent and to the child; but when it is given with wisdom, designed 
 for good, accompanied with prayer, and blessed of God, it may prove a 
 happy means of preventing his utter destruction and <I>delivering his 
 soul from hell.</I> Our great care must be about our children's souls; 
 we must not see them in danger of hell without using all possible 
 means, with the utmost care and concern, to snatch them as brands out 
 of everlasting burnings. Let the body smart, so that the spirit be 
 <I>saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</I> 

 3. A parent encouraging his child, telling him,

 (1.) What was all he expected, nothing but what would be for his own
 good, that <I>his heart be wise</I> and that his <I>lips speak right 
 things,</I> that he be under the government of good principles, and 
 that by those principles he particularly maintain a good environment of 
 his tongue.  It is to be hoped that those will do <I>right things</I> 
 when they grow up who learn to <I>speak right things</I> when they are 
 young, and dare not speak any bad words. 

 (2.) What a comfort it would be to him if herein he answered his
 expectation: "<I>If thy heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice,</I> 
 shall rejoice in thee, <I>even mine,</I> who have taken so much care 
 and pains about thee, my heart, that has many a time ached for thee, 
 for which thou shouldst study thus to make a grateful requital." Note, 
 The wisdom of children will be the joy of their parents and teachers, 
 who have no greater joy than to see them <I>walk in the truth,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=3Jo+1:4">3 John 4</A>.

 "Children, if you be wise and good, devout and conscientious, God will
 be pleased with you, and that will be our joy: we shall think our 
 labour in instructing you well bestowed; it will be a comfortable 
 answer for the many prayers we have put up for you; we shall be eased 
 of a great deal of care, shall not need to be so strict and severe in 
 watching over you, and shall consequently be the easier both to you and 
 to ourselves. We shall rejoice in hope that you will be a credit and 
 comfort to us, if we should live to be old, that you will bear up the 
 name of Christ in your generation, that you will live comfortably in 
 this world and happily in another."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 1. A necessary caution against entertaining any favourable thoughts of
 prospering profaneness: "<I>Let not thy heart envy sinners;</I> do not 
 grudge them either the liberty they take to sin or the success they are 
 to be pitied rather than envied. Their prosperity is their portion 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+17:14">Ps.  xvii. 14</A>),
 
 nay, it is their poison,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+1:32">Prov. i. 32</A>.

 We must not harbour in our hearts any secret discontent at the
 providence of God, though it seem to smile upon them, nor wish 
 ourselves in their condition. "<I>Let not thy heart imitate 
 sinners</I>" (so some read it); do not as they do; walk not in the way 
 with them; use not the methods they take to enrich themselves, though 
 they thrive by them.

 2.  An excellent direction to maintain high thoughts of God in our
 minds at all times: <I>Be thou in the fear of the Lord</I> every day 
 and <I>all the day long.</I> We must be in the fear of the Lord as in 
 our employment, exercising ourselves in holy adorings of God, in 
 subjection to his precepts, submission to his providences, and a 
 constant care to please him; we must be in it as in our element, taking 
 a pleasure in contemplating God's glory and complying with his will. We 
 must be <I>devoted to his fear</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+119:38">Ps. cxix. 38</A>);

 and governed by it as our commanding principle in all we say and do. 
 All the days of our life we must constantly keep up an awe of God upon 
 our spirits, must pay a deference to his authority, and have a dread of 
 his wrath. We must be always so in his fear as never to be out of it.

 3. A good reason for both of these

 <I>Surely there is an end,</I> an end and expectation, as

 <I>There will be an end of the prosperity of the wicked,</I> therefore

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is good advice for parents to give to their children; words are 
 put into their mouths, that they may <I>train them up in the way they 
 should go.</I> Here we have,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. An earnest call to young people to attend to the advice of their 
 godly parents, not only to this that is here given, but to all other 
 profitable instructions: "<I>Here, my son, and be wise,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 This will be an evidence that thou art wise and a means to make thee
 wiser." Wisdom, as <I>faith, comes by hearing.</I> And again

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):
 
 "<I>Hearken unto thy father who begot thee,</I> and who therefore has 
 an authority over thee and an affection for thee, and, thou mayest be 
 sure, can have no other design than thy own good." We ought to <I>give 
 reverence to the fathers of our flesh,</I> who begot us, and were the 
 instruments of our being; much more ought we to obey and be in 
 subjection to the <I>Father of our spirits,</I> who made us and is the 
 author of our being. And since <I>the mother</I> also, from a sense of 
 duty to God and from love to her child, gives him good instructions, 
 let him not <I>despise her,</I> nor her advice, <I>when she is old.</I> 
 When the mother was grown old we may suppose the children to be grown 
 up; but let them not think themselves past being taught, even by her, 
 but rather respect her the more for the multitude of her years and the 
 wisdom which they teach. Scornful and insolent young men will make a 
 jest, it may be, of the good advice of an aged mother, and think 
 themselves not concerned to heed what an old woman says; but such will 
 have a great deal to answer for another day, not only as having set at 
 nought good counsel, but as having slighted and grieved a good mother, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:17"><I>ch.</I> xxx. 17</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. An argument to enforce this call, taken from the great comfort 
 which this will be to their parents, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:24,25"><I>v.</I> 24, 25</A>.
 
 Note,

 1. It is the duty of children to study how they may gladden the hearts
 of their good parents, and do it yet more and more, so that they may 
 <I>greatly rejoice</I> in them, even when the <I>evil days come and the 
 years of which they say they have no pleasure in them</I> but this, to 
 see their children do well, as <I>Barzillai</I> to see <I>Chimham</I> 
 preferred.  

 2. Children will be a joy to their parents if they be <I>righteous and
 wise.</I> Righteousness is true wisdom; those who do good so well for 
 themselves. Those are completely such as they should be who are not 
 only <I>wise</I> (that is, knowing and learned), but <I>righteous</I> 
 (that is, honest and good), and not only <I>righteous</I> (that is, 
 conscientious and well-meaning), but <I>wise</I> (that is, prudent and 
 discreet) in the management of themselves. If such the children be, 
 especially all the children, the father and mother will be glad, and 
 think nothing too much that they have done, or do, for them; they will 
 please themselves in them, and give God thanks for them; particularly 
 she that bore them with pain, and nursed them with pains, will rejoice 
 in them, and reckon herself well requited, and the sorrow more than 
 forgotten, because a wise and good man is the product of it, who is a 
 blessing to the world he was born into.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. Some general precepts of wisdom and virtue.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. <I>Guide thy heart in the way,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>.

 It is the heart that must be taken care of and directed aright; the
 motions and affections of the soul must be towards right objects and 
 under a steady guidance. If the heart be guided in the way, the steps 
 will be guided and the conversation well ordered.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. <I>Buy the truth and sell it not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 Truth is that by which the heart must be guided and governed, for 
 without truth there is no goodness; no regular practices without right 
 principles. It is by the power of truth, known and believed, that we 
 must be kept back from sin and constrained to duty. The understanding 
 must be well-informed with wisdom and instruction, and therefore,

 (1.) We must buy it, that is, be willing to part with any thing for it.
 He does not say at what rate we must buy it, because we cannot buy it 
 too dear, but must have it at any rate; whatever it costs us, we shall 
 not repent the bargain. When we are at expense for the means of 
 knowledge, and resolved not to starve so good a cause, then we <I>buy 
 the truth.</I> Riches should be employed for the getting of knowledge, 
 rather than knowledge for the getting of riches. When we are at pains 
 in searching after truth, that we may come to the knowledge of it and 
 may distinguish between it and error, then we buy it. <I>Dii laboribus 
 omnia vendunt--Heaven concedes every thing to the laborious.</I> When 
 we choose rather to suffer loss in our temporal interest than to deny 
 or neglect the truth then we buy it; and it is a pearl of such great
 price that we must be willing to part with all to purchase it, must 
 make shipwreck of estate, trade, preferment, rather than of faith and a 
 good conscience. 

 (2.) We must not sell it. Do not part with it for pleasures, honours,
 riches, any things in this world. Do not neglect the study of it, nor 
 throw off the profession of it, nor revolt from under the dominion of 
 it, for the getting or saving of any secular interest whatsoever. 
 <I>Hold fast the form of sound words,</I> and never let it go upon any 
 terms.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. <I>Give me thy heart,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>.

 God in this exhortation, speaks to us as unto children: "Son, Daughter,
 <I>Give my thy heart.</I>" The heart is that which the great God 
 requires and calls for from every one of us; whatever we give, if we do 
 not give him our hearts, it will not be accepted. We must set our love 
 upon him. Our thoughts must converse much with him, and on him, as our 
 highest end. <I>The intents of our hearts</I> must be fastened. We must 
 make it our own act and deed to devote ourselves to the Lord, and we 
 must be free and cheerful in it.  We must not think to divide the heart 
 between God and the world; he will have all or none. <I>Thou shalt love 
 the Lord thy God with all thy heart.</I> To this call we must readily 
 answer, "<I>My father, take my heart,</I> such as it is, and make it 
 such as it should be; take possession of it, and set up thy throne in 
 it."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. <I>Let thy eyes observe my ways;</I> have an eye to the rule of 
 God's word, the conduct of his providence, and the good examples of his 
 people. Our eyes must observe these, as he that writes observes his 
 copy, that we may keep in the right paths and may proceed and persevere 
 in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Some particular cautions against those sins which are, of all sins, 
 the most destructive to the seeds of wisdom and grace in the soul, 
 which impoverish and ruin it. 

 1. Gluttony and drunkenness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:20,21"><I>v.</I> 20, 21</A>.

 The world is full of examples of this sin and temptations to it, which
 all young people are concerned to stand upon their guard against and 
 keep at a distance from <I>Be not a wine-bibber;</I> we are allowed to 
 drink <I>a little wine</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Ti+5:23">1 Tim.  v. 23</A>),

 but not much, not to make a trade of it, never to drink to excess. 
 <I>Be not a riotous eater of flesh,</I> as the Israelites were, who 
 lusted exceedingly after it, saying, <I>Who will give us flesh to 
 eat?</I> Whereas Paul, though he is free to eat flesh, yet resolves 
 that <I>he will eat no flesh while the world stands rather than make 
 his brother to offend;</I> so indifferent is he to it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+8:13">1 Cor. viii. 13</A>.

 <I>Be not an</I> excessive <I>eater of flesh.</I> Intemperance must be 
 avoided in meat as well as drink. <I>Be not a</I> luxurious <I>eater of 
 flesh,</I> not pleased with any thing but what is very nice and 
 delicate, savoury dishes, and forced meat. Some take not only a 
 pleasure, but a pride, in being curious about their diet, and, as they 
 call it, eating well; as if that were the ornament of a gentleman, 
 which is really the shame of a Christian, making a God of the belly.  
 "<I>Be not a wine bibber,</I> and <I>be not a riotous eater;</I> and 
 therefore, <I>be not among wine-bibbers</I> nor <I>among riotous 
 eaters;</I> do not give them countenance, lest thou learn their ways 
 and insensibly fall into those sins, or at least lose the dread and 
 detestation of them. They covet to have thee among them; for those that 
 are debauched themselves are very desirous to debauch others; therefore 
 do not gratify them, lest thou endanger thyself." He fetches an 
 argument against this sin from the expensiveness of it and its tendency 
 to impoverish men: and if men will not be deterred from it by the ruin 
 it brings on their secular interests, which lie nearest their hearts, 
 no marvel that they are not frightened from it by what they are told 
 out of the word of God of the mischief it does them in their spiritual 
 and eternal concerns. <I>The drunkard and the glutton</I> hate to be 
 reformed, though they are told they <I>shall come to poverty,</I> nay, 
 though they are told they shall come to hell. Drunkenness is the cause 
 of <I>drowsiness;</I> it stupefies men, and makes them inattentive to 
 business, and then all goes to wreck and ruin: thus men that have lived 
 creditably come to be <I>clothed with rags.</I>

 2. Whoredom. This is another sin which <I>takes away the heart</I> that
 should be given to God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+4:11">Hos. iv. 11</A>.

 He shows the danger which attends that sin, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:27,28"><I>v.</I> 27, 28</A>,

 (1.) It is a sin from which few recover themselves when once they are
 entangled in it.  It is like <I>a deep ditch</I> and <I>a narrow 
 pit,</I> which it is almost impossible to get out of; and therefore it 
 is wisdom to keep far enough from the brink of it. Take heed of making 
 any approaches towards this sin, because it is so hard to make a 
 retreat from it, conscience, which should head the retreat, being 
 debauched by it, and divine grace forfeited. 

 (2.) It is a sin which bewitches men to their ruin: <I>The adulteress
 lies in wait as a robber,</I> pretending friendship, but designing the 
 greatest mischief, to rob them of all they have that is valuable, to 
 strip them both of their armour and of their ornaments.  Even those 
 who, being virtuously educated, endeavour to shun the adulteress, she 
 will <I>lie in wait</I> for, that she may assault them when they are 
 off their guard and she has them at an advantage. Let none therefore be 
 at any time secure.  

 (3.) It is a sin that contributes more than any other to the spreading
 of vice and immorality in a kingdom: It <I>increases the transgressors 
 among men.</I> One adulteress may be the ruin of many a precious soul 
 and may help to debauch a whole town. It increases the treacherous or 
 perfidious ones; it not only occasions husbands to be false to their 
 wives and servants to their masters, but many that have professed 
 religion to throw off their profession and break their covenants with 
 God. Houses of uncleanness are therefore such pest-houses as ought to 
 be suppressed by those whose office it is to take care of the public 
 welfare.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>29  Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who
 hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of
 eyes?
 &nbsp; 30  They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed
 wine.

 his colour in the cup, <I>when</I> it moveth itself aright.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Solomon here gives fair warning against the sin of drunkenness, to
 confirm what he had said,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He cautions all people to keep out of the way of temptations to this 
 sin 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 <I>Look not thou upon the wine when it is red.</I> Red wine was in 
 Canaan looked upon as the best wine, it is therefore called <I>the
 blood of the grape.</I> Critics judge of wine, among other indications, 
 by the colour of it; some wine, they say, looks charmingly, looks so 
 well that it even says, "Come and drink me;" <I>it moves itself 
 aright,</I> goes down very smoothly, or perhaps the roughness of it is 
 grateful.  It is said of generous strong-bodied wine that it even 
 <I>causes the lips of those that are asleep to speak,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+7:9">Cant. vii. 9</A>.

 But <I>look not thou upon it.</I>

 1. "Be not ruled by sense, but by reason and religion. Covet not that
 which pleases the eye, in hopes that it will please the taste; but let 
 thy serious thoughts correct the errors of thy senses and convince thee 
 that that which seems delightful is really hurtful, and resolve against 
 it accordingly.  Let not the heart walk after the eye, for it is a 
 deceitful guide." 

 2.  "Be not too bold with the charms of this or any other sin; <I>look
 not,</I> lest thou lust, lest thou take the forbidden fruit." Note 
 Those that would be kept from any sin must keep themselves from all the 
 occasions and beginnings of it, and be afraid of coming within the 
 reach of its allurements, lest they be overcome by them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He shows the many pernicious consequences of the sin of 
 drunkenness, for the enforcement of this caution. Take heed of the 
 bait, for fear of the hook: <I>At the last it bites,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:32"><I>v.</I> 32</A>.

 All sin will be bitterness in the end, and this sin particularly. <I>It
 bites like a serpent,</I> when the drunkard is made sick by his 
 surfeit, thrown by it into a dropsy or some fatal disease, beggared and 
 ruined in his estate, especially when his conscience is awakened and he 
 cannot reflect upon it without horror and indignation at himself, but 
 worst of all, at last, when the cup of drunkenness shall be turned into 
 a cup of trembling, the cup of the Lord's wrath, the dregs of which he 
 must be for ever drinking, and shall not have a drop of water to cool 
 his inflamed tongue. To take off the force of the temptation that there 
 is in the pleasure of the sin, foresee the punishment of it, and what 
 it will at last end in if repentance prevent not. In <I>its latter end 
 it bites</I> (so the word is); think therefore what will be <I>in the 
 end thereof.</I> But the inspired writer chooses to specify those 
 pernicious consequences of this sin which are present and sensible.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. It embroils men in quarrels, makes them quarrel with others, and say 
 and do that which gives others occasion to quarrel with them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>.

 He asks, <I>Who hath woe? Who hath sorrow?</I> Who has not, in this
 world?  Many have woe and sorrow, and cannot help it; but drunkards 
 wilfully create woe and sorrow to themselves. Those that have 
 <I>contentions</I> have <I>woe and sorrow;</I> and drunkards are the 
 fools whose <I>lips enter into contention.</I> When the wine is in the 
 wit is out and the passions are up; and thence come drunken scuffles, 
 and drunken frays, and drunken disputes over the cups; many a vexatious 
 ruining law-suit has begun thus. There is <I>babbling,</I> quarrels in 
 word and the exchanging of scurrilous language; yet it rests not there: 
 you shall have <I>wounds without cause,</I> for causes are things which 
 drunkards are in no capacity to judge of, and therefore they deal blows 
 about without the least consideration why or wherefore, and must expect 
 to be in like manner treated themselves. The wounds which men receive 
 in defence of their country and its just rights are their honour; but 
 <I>wounds without cause,</I> received in the service of their lusts, 
 are marks of their infamy. Nay, drunkards wound themselves in a tender 
 part, for they have <I>redness of eyes,</I> symptoms of an inward 
 inflammation; their sight is weakened by it, and their looks are 
 deformed. This comes,

 (1.) Of drinking long, <I>tarrying long at the wine,</I> and spending
 that time in drunken company which should be spent in useful business, 
 or in sleep, which should fit for business, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 O the precious hours which thousands throw away thus, every one of
 which will be brought into the account at the great day!

 (2.) Of drinking that which is strong and intoxicating. <I>They go</I>
 up and down <I>to seek wine</I> that will please them; their great 
 enquiry is, "Where is the best liquor?" <I>They seek mixed wine,</I> 
 which is most palatable, but most heady, so willingly do they sacrifice 
 their reason to please their palate!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It makes men impure and insolent, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:33"><I>v.</I> 33</A>.

 (1.) The <I>eyes</I> grow unruly and <I>behold strange women</I> to
 lust after them, and so let in adultery into the heart. <I>Est Venus in 
 vinis--Wine is oil to the fire of lust. Thy eyes shall behold strange 
 things</I> (so some read it); when men are drunk the house turns round 
 with them, and every thing looks strange to them, so that them they 
 cannot trust their own eyes. 

 (2.) The tongue also grows unruly and talks extravagantly; by it the
 <I>heart utters perverse things,</I> things contrary to reason, 
 religion, and common civility, which they would be ashamed to speak if 
 they were sober. What ridiculous incoherent nonsense men will talk when 
 they are drunk who at another time will speak admirably well and to the 
 purpose!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. It stupefies and besots men, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+23:34"><I>v.</I> 34</A>.

 When men are drunk they know not where they are nor what they say and 
 do.

 (1.) Their heads are giddy, and when they lie down to sleep they are as
 if they were tossed by the rolling waves <I>of the sea,</I> or <I>upon 
 the top of a mast;</I> hence they complain that their heads swim; their 
 sleep is commonly unquiet and not refreshing, and their dreams are 
 tumultuous. 

 (2.) Their judgments are clouded, and they have no more steadiness and
 consistency than he that sleeps <I>upon the top of a mast:</I> they 
 <I>drink and forget the law</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+31:5"><I>ch.</I> xxxi. 5</A>):

 <I>they err through wine</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+28:7">Isa.  xxviii. 7</A>),

 and think as extravagantly as they talk.

 (3.) They are heedless and fearless of danger, and senseless of the
 rebukes they are under either from God or man. They are in imminent 
 danger of death, of damnation, lie as much exposed as if they slept 
 <I>upon the top of a mast,</I> and yet are secure and sleep on. They 
 fear no peril when the terrors of the Lord are laid before them; nay, 
 they feel no pain when the judgments of God are actually upon them; 
 they cry not when he binds them. Set a drunkard in the stocks, and he 
 is not sensible of the punishment. "<I>They have stricken me, and I was 
 not sick; I felt it not:</I> it made no impression at all upon me." 
 Drunkenness turns me into stocks and stones; they are scarcely to be 
 reckoned animals; they are dead while they live.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Worst of all, the heart is hardened in the sin, and the sinner, 
 notwithstanding all these present mischiefs that attend it, obstinately 
 persist in it, and hates to be reformed: <I>When shall I awake?</I> 
 Much ado he has to shake off the chains of his drunken sleep; he can 
 hardly get clear of the fumes of the wine, though he strives with them,
 that (being thirsty in the morning) he may return to it again. So 
 perfectly lost is he to all sense of virtue and honour, and so 
 wretchedly is his conscience seared, that he is not ashamed to say, 
 <I>I will seek it yet again. There is no hope; no, they have loved</I> 
 drunkards, and <I>after them they will go,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+2:25">Jer. ii. 25</A>.

 This is <I>adding drunkenness to thirst,</I> and <I>following strong 
 drink;</I> those that do so may read their doom 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+29:19,20">Deut. xxix. 19, 20</A>,

 their <I>woe</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+5:11">Isa. v. 11</A>,

 and, if this be the end of the sin, with good reason were we directed 
 to stop at the beginning of it: <I>Look not upon the wine when it is 
 red.</I></P>
