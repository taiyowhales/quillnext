 It is a melancholy "But now" which this chapter begins with. Adversity 
 is here described as much to the life as prosperity was in the 
 foregoing chapter, and the height of that did but increase the depth of 
 this. God sets the one over-against the other, and so did Job, that his 
 afflictions might appear the more grievous, and consequently his case 
 the more pitiable. 

 I. He had lived in great honour, but now he had fallen into disgrace,
 and was as much vilified, even by the meanest, as ever he had been 
 magnified by the greatest; this he insists much on, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:1-14">ver.  1-14</A>.

 II. He had had much inward comfort and delight, but now he was a terror
 and burden to himself 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:15,16">ver. 15, 16</A>)

 and overwhelmed with sorrow, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:28-31">ver.  28-31</A>.

 III. He had long enjoyed a good state of health, but now he was sick
 and in pain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:17-19,29,30">
 ver. 17-19, 29, 30</A>.

 IV. Time was when the secret of God was with him, but now his
 communication with heaven was cut off, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:20-22">ver. 20-22</A>.

 V. He had promised himself a long life, but now he saw death at the 
 door, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:23">ver. 23</A>.

 One thing he mentions, which aggravated his affliction, that it 
 surprised him when he looked for peace. But two things gave him some 
 relief:--

 1.  That his troubles would not follow him to the grave, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:24">ver. 24</A>.

 2.  That his conscience witnessed for him that, in his prosperity, he 
 had sympathized with those that were in misery,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  But now <I>they that are</I> younger than I have me in derision,
 whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of
 my flock.
 &nbsp; 2  Yea, whereto <I>might</I> the strength of their hands <I>profit</I> me,
 in whom old age was perished?
 &nbsp; 3  For want and famine <I>they were</I> solitary; fleeing into the
 wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
 &nbsp; 4  Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots <I>for</I>
 their meat.
 &nbsp; 5  They were driven forth from among <I>men,</I> (they cried after
 them as <I>after</I> a thief;)
 &nbsp; 6  To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, <I>in</I> caves of the
 earth, and <I>in</I> the rocks.
 &nbsp; 7  Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were
 gathered together.
 &nbsp; 8  <I>They were</I> children of fools, yea, children of base men:
 they were viler than the earth.
 &nbsp; 9  And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.
 &nbsp; 10  They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit
 in my face.
 &nbsp; 11  Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have
 also let loose the bridle before me.
 &nbsp; 12  Upon <I>my</I> right <I>hand</I> rise the youth; they push away my
 feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
 &nbsp; 13  They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no
 helper.
 &nbsp; 14  They came <I>upon me</I> as a wide breaking in <I>of waters:</I> in
 the desolation they rolled themselves <I>upon me.</I>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here Job makes a very large and sad complaint of the great disgrace he 
 had fallen into, from the height of honour and reputation, which was 
 exceedingly grievous and cutting to such an ingenuous spirit as Job's 
 was. Two things he insists upon as greatly aggravating his 
 affliction:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The meanness of the persons that affronted him. As it added much to 
 his honour, in the day of his prosperity, that princes and nobles 
 showed him respect and paid a deference to him, so it added no less to 
 his disgrace in his adversity that he was spurned by the footmen, and 
 trampled upon by those that were not only every way his inferiors, but 
 were the meanest and most contemptible of all mankind. None can be 
 represented as more base than those are here represented who insulted 
 Job, upon all accounts. 
 
 1. They were young, younger than he
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>),
 
 <I>the youth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 who ought to have behaved themselves respectfully towards him for his 
 age and gravity. Even the children, in their play, played upon him, as 
 the children of Bethel upon the prophet, <I>Go up, thou bald-head.</I> 
 Children soon learn to be scornful when they see their parents so. 

 2.  They were of a mean extraction. Their fathers were so very 
 despicable that such a man as Job would have disdained to take them 
 into the lowest service about his house, as that of tending the sheep 
 and attending the shepherds with the dogs of his flock,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They were so shabby that they were not fit to be seen among his 
 servants, so silly that they were not fit to be employed, and so false 
 that they were not fit to be trusted in the meanest post. Job here 
 speaks of what he might have done, not of what he did: he was not of 
 such a spirit as to set any of the children of men with the dogs of his 
 flock; he knew the dignity of human nature better than to do so. 

 3.  They and their families were the unprofitable burdens of the earth, 
 and good for nothing. Job himself, with all his prudence and patience, 
 could make nothing of them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 The young were not fit for labour, they were so lazy, and went about 
 their work so awkwardly: <I>Whereto might the strength of their hands 
 profit me?</I> The old were not to be advised with in the smallest 
 matters, for in them was old age indeed, but their <I>old age was 
 perished,</I> they were twice children. 

 4.  They were extremely poor,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 They were ready to starve, for they would not dig, and to beg they were 
 ashamed. Had they been brought to necessity by the providence of God, 
 their neighbours would have sought them out as proper objects of 
 charity and would have relieved them; but, being brought into straits 
 by their own slothfulness and wastefulness, nobody was forward to 
 relieve them.  Hence they were forced to flee into the deserts both for 
 shelter and sustenance, and were put to sorry shifts indeed, when they 
 <I>cut up mallows by the bushes,</I> and were glad to eat them, for 
 want of food that was fit for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 See what hunger will bring men to: one half of the world does not know 
 how the other half lives; yet those that have abundance ought to think 
 sometimes of those whose fare is very coarse and who are brought to a 
 short allowance of that too. But we must own the righteousness of God, 
 and not think it strange, if slothfulness clothe men with rags and the 
 idle soul be made to suffer hunger. This beggarly world is full of the 
 devil's poor. 

 5.  They were very scandalous wicked people, not only the burdens, but
 the plagues, of the places where they lived, arrant scoundrels, the 
 scum of the country: <I>They were driven forth from among men,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 They were such lying, thieving, lurking, mischievous people, that the 
 best service the magistrates could do was to rid the country of them, 
 while the very mob cried after them as after a thief. <I>Away with such 
 fellows from the earth; it is not fit they should live.</I> They were 
 lazy and would not work, and therefore they were exclaimed against as 
 thieves, and justly; for those that do not earn their own bread by 
 honest labour do, in effect, steal the bread out of other people's 
 mouths. An idle fellow is a public nuisance; but it is better to drive 
 such into a workhouse than, as here, into a wilderness, which will 
 punish them indeed, but never reform them. They were forced to dwell in 
 <I>caves of the earth,</I> and <I>they brayed</I> like asses <I>among 
 the bushes,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:6,7"><I>v.</I> 6, 7</A>.

 See what is the lot of those that have the cry of the country, the cry 
 of their own conscience, against them; they cannot but be in a 
 continual terror and confusion. <I>They groan among the trees</I> (so 
 Broughton) <I>and smart among the nettles;</I> they are stung and 
 scratched there, where they hoped to be sheltered and protected. See 
 what miseries wicked people bring themselves to in this world; yet this 
 is nothing to what is in reserve for them in the other world. 

 8. They had nothing at all in them to recommend them to any man's 
 esteem. They were a vile kind; yea, a kind without fame, people that 
 nobody could give a good word to nor had a good wish for; they were 
 banished from the earth as being <I>viler than the earth.</I> One would 
 not think it possible that ever the human nature should sink so low, 
 and degenerate so far, as it did in these people. When we thank God 
 that we are men we have reason to thank him that we are not such men. 
 But such as these were abusive to Job,

 (1.) In revenge, because when he was in prosperity and power, like a 
 good magistrate, he put in execution the laws which were in force 
 against vagabonds, and rogues, and sturdy beggars, which these base 
 people now remembered against him.  

 (2.) In triumph over him, because they thought he had now become like 
 one of them. 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+14:10,11">Isa. xiv. 10, 11</A>.

 The abjects, men of mean spirits, insult over the miserable,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+35:15">Ps. xxxv. 15</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The greatness of the affronts that were given him. It cannot be 
 imagined how abusive they were.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They made ballads on him, with which they made themselves and their 
 companions merry 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>I am their song and their byword.</I> Those have a very base spirit 
 that turn the calamities of their honest neighbours into a jest, and 
 can sport themselves with their griefs.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. They shunned him as a loathsome spectacle, abhorred him, fled far 
 from him, 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>),

 as an ugly monster or as one infected. Those that were themselves 
 driven out from among men would have had him driven out.  For,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. They expressed the greatest scorn and indignation against him. They 
 spat in his face, or were ready to do so; they tripped up his heels, 
 pushed away his feet 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>),

 kicked him, either in wrath, because they hated him, or in sport, to 
 make themselves merry with him, as they did with their companions at 
 foot-ball. The best of saints have sometimes received the worst of 
 injuries and indignities from a spiteful, scornful, wicked world, and 
 must not think it strange; our Master himself was thus abused.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. They were very malicious against him, and not only made a jest of 
 him, but made a prey of him--not only affronted him, but set themselves
 to do him all the real mischief they could devise: <I>They raise up 
 against me the ways of their destruction;</I> or (as some read it), 
 <I>They cast upon me the cause of their woe;</I> that is, "They lay the 
 blame of their being driven out upon me;" and it is common for 
 criminals to hate the judges and laws by which they are punished. But 
 under this pretence, 

 (1.) They accused him falsely, and misrepresented his former 
 conversation, which is here called <I>marring his path.</I> They 
 reflected upon him as a tyrant and an oppressor because he had done 
 justice upon them; and perhaps Job's friends grounded their 
 uncharitable censures of him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:6-10"><I>ch.</I> xxii. 6</A>,

 &c.) upon the unjust and
 unreasonable clamours of these sorry people; and it was an instance of 
 their great weakness and inconsideration, for who can be innocent if 
 the accusations of such persons may be heeded? 

 (2.) They not only triumphed in his calamity, but set it forward, and 
 did all they could to add to his miseries and make them more grievous 
 to him. It is a great sin to forward the calamity of any, especially of 
 good people. In this <I>they have no helper,</I> nobody to set them on 
 or to countenance them in it, nobody to bear them out or to protect 
 them, but they do it of their own accord; they are fools in other 
 things, but wise enough to do mischief, and need no help in inventing 
 that. Some read it thus, <I>They hold my heaviness a profit, though 
 they be never the better.</I> Wicked people, though they get nothing by 
 the calamities of others, yet rejoice in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. Those that did him all this mischief were numerous, unanimous, and 
 violent 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>):

 <I>They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters,</I> when the dam 
 is broken; or, "They came as soldiers into a broad breach which they 
 have made in the wall of a besieged city, pouring in upon me with the 
 utmost fury;" and in this they took a pride and a pleasure: <I>They 
 rolled themselves in the desolation</I> as a man rolls himself in a 
 soft and easy bed, and they rolled themselves upon him with all the 
 weight of their malice.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. All this contempt put upon him was caused by the troubles he was 
 in 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>Because he has loosed my cord,</I> has taken away the honour and 
 power with which I was girded

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+12:18"><I>ch.</I> xii. 18</A>),

 has scattered what I had got together and untwisted all my
 affairs--because he has afflicted me, therefore <I>they have let loose
 the bridle before me,</I>" that is, "have given themselves a liberty to 
 say and do what they please against me." Those that by Providence are 
 stripped of their honour may expect to be loaded with contempt by 
 inconsiderate ill-natured people. "Because he hath loosed <I>his</I> 
 cord" (the original has that reading also), that is, "because he has 
 taken off his bridle of restraint from off their malice, they cast away 
 the bridle from me," that is, "they make no account of my authority, 
 nor stand in any awe of me." It is owing to the hold God has of the 
 consciences even of bad men, and the restraints he lays upon them, that 
 we are not continually thus insulted and abused; and, if at any time we 
 meet with such ill treatment, we must acknowledge the hand of God in 
 taking off those restraints, as David did when Shimei cursed him: <I>So 
 let him curse, for the Lord hath bidden him.</I> Now in all this, 

 1. We may see the uncertainty of worldly honour, and particularly of 
 popular applause, how suddenly a man may fail from the height of 
 dignity into the depth of disgrace. What little cause therefore have 
 men to be ambitious or proud of that which may be so easily lost, and 
 what little confidence is to be put in it! Those that to-day cry 
 <I>Hosannah</I> may to-morrow cry <I>Crucify.</I> But there is an 
 honour which comes from God, which if we secure, we shall find it not 
 thus changeable and loseable. 

 2. We may see that it has often been the lot of very wise and good men 
 to be trampled upon and abused. And, 

 3.  That those who look only at the things that are seen despise those 
 whom the world frowns upon, though they are ever so much the favourites 
 of Heaven. Nothing is more grievous in poverty than that it renders men 
 contemptible.  <I>Turba Remi sequitur fortunam, ut semper odit 
 damnatos--The Roman populace, faithful to the turns of fortune, still 
 persecute the fallen.</I> 

 4. We may see in Job a type of Christ, who was thus made a <I>reproach 
 of men</I> and <I>despised of the people</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:6,Isa:53:3">Ps. xxii. 6; Isa. liii. 3</A>),

 and who hid not his face from shame and spitting, but bore the
 indignity better than Job did.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>15  Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind:
 and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
 &nbsp; 16  And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of
 affliction have taken hold upon me.
 &nbsp; 17  My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my
 sinews take no rest.
 &nbsp; 18  By the great force <I>of my disease</I> is my garment changed: it
 bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
 &nbsp; 19  He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and
 ashes.
 &nbsp; 20  I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and
 thou regardest me <I>not.</I>
 &nbsp; 21  Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou
 opposest thyself against me.
 &nbsp; 22  Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride
 <I>upon it,</I> and dissolvest my substance.
 &nbsp; 23  For I know <I>that</I> thou wilt bring me <I>to</I> death, and <I>to</I>
 the house appointed for all living.
 &nbsp; 24  Howbeit he will not stretch out <I>his</I> hand to the grave,
 though they cry in his destruction.
 &nbsp; 25  Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was <I>not</I> my
 soul grieved for the poor?
 &nbsp; 26  When I looked for good, then evil came <I>unto me:</I> and when I
 waited for light, there came darkness.
 &nbsp; 27  My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction
 prevented me.
 &nbsp; 28  I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, <I>and</I> I cried
 in the congregation.
 &nbsp; 29  I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
 &nbsp; 30  My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
 &nbsp; 31  My harp also is <I>turned</I> to mourning, and my organ into the
 voice of them that weep.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this second part of Job's complaint, which is very bitter, and has a 
 great many sorrowful accents in it, we may observe a great deal that he 
 complains of and some little that he comforts himself with.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Here is much that he complains of.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In general, it was a day of great affliction and sorrow. 

 (1.) Affliction seized him, and surprised him. It seized him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>):
 
 <I>The days of affliction have taken hold upon me, have caught me</I> 
 (so some); <I>they have arrested me,</I> as the bailiff arrests the 
 debtor, claps him on the back, and secures him. When trouble comes with 
 commission it will take fast hold, and not lose its hold. It surprised 
 him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>):

 "<I>The days of affliction prevented me,</I>" that is, "they came upon 
 me without giving me any previous warning. I did not expect them, nor 
 make any provision for such an evil day." Observe, He reckons his 
 affliction by days, which will soon be numbered and finished, and are 
 nothing to the ages of eternity,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:17">2 Cor. iv. 17</A>.

 (2.) He was in great sorrow by reason of it. His <I>bowels boiled</I>
 with grief, <I>and rested not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:27"><I>v.</I> 27</A>.

 The sense of his calamities was continually preying upon his spirits 
 without any intermission. He <I>went mourning</I> from day to day, 
 always sighing, always weeping; and such cloud was constantly upon his 
 mind that he went, in effect, <I>without the sun,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:28"><I>v.</I> 28</A>.

 He had nothing that he could take any comfort in. He abandoned himself 
 to perpetual sorrow, as one that, like Jacob, resolved to go to the 
 grave mourning. He walked out of the sun (so some) in dark shady 
 places, as melancholy people use to do. If he went into the 
 congregation, to join with them in solemn worship, instead of standing 
 up calmly to desire their prayers, he <I>stood up and cried</I> aloud, 
 through pain of body, or anguish of mind, like one half distracted. If 
 he appeared in public, to receive visits, when the fit came upon him he 
 could not contain himself, nor preserve due decorum, but stood up and 
 shrieked aloud. Thus he was <I>a brother to dragons and owls</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:29"><I>v.</I> 29</A>),

 both in choosing solitude and retirement, as they do 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+34:13">Isa. xxxiv. 13</A>),

 and in making a fearful hideous noise as they do; his inconsiderate
 complaints were fitly compared to their inarticulate ones.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The terror and trouble that seized his soul were the sorest part of 
 his calamity, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:15,16"><I>v.</I> 15, 16</A>.

 (1.) If he looked forward, he saw every thing frightful before him: if 
 he endeavoured to shake off his terrors, they turned furiously upon 
 him: if he endeavoured to escape from them, they pursued his soul as 
 swiftly and violently as the wind. He complained, at first, of the 
 <I>terrors of God setting themselves in array against him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:4"><I>ch.</I> vi. 4</A>.

 And still, which way soever he looked, they turned upon him; which way
 soever he fled, they pursued him. <I>My soul</I> (Heb., <I>my principal 
 one, my princess</I>); the soul is the principal part of the man; it is 
 our glory; it is every way more excellent than the body, and therefore 
 that which pursues the soul, and threatens that, should be most 
 dreaded. 

 (2.) If he looked back, he saw all the good he had formerly enjoyed 
 removed from him, and nothing left him but the bitter remembrance of 
 it: <I>My welfare</I> and prosperity <I>pass away,</I> as suddenly, 
 swiftly, and irrecoverably, <I>as a cloud.</I> 

 (3.) If he looked within, he found his spirit quite sunk and unable to 
 bear his infirmity, not only wounded, but <I>poured out upon him,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He was not only weak as water, but, in his own apprehension, lost as 
 water spilt upon the ground. Compare 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+22:14">Ps. xxii. 14</A>,

 <I>My heart is melted like wax.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. His bodily diseases were very grievous; for, 

 (1.) He was full of pain, piercing pain, pain that went to the bone, to 
 all his bones, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:17"><I>v.</I>  17</A>.

 It was a <I>sword in his bones,</I> which <I>pierced him in the night 
 season,</I> when he should have been refreshed with sleep. His nerves 
 were affected with strong convulsions; his <I>sinews took no rest.</I> 
 By reason of his pain, he could take no rest, but sleep departed from 
 his eyes. <I>His bones were burnt with heat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 He was in a constant fever, which dried up the radical moisture and 
 even consumed the marrow in his bones. See how frail our bodies are, 
 which carry in themselves the seeds of our own disease and death.

 (2.) He was full of sores. Some that are pained in their bones, yet 
 sleep in a whole skin, but, Satan's commission against Job extending 
 both to his bone and to his flesh, he spared neither. His <I>skin was 
 black upon him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:30"><I>v.</I> 30</A>.

 The blood settled, and the sores suppurated and by degrees scabbed 
 over, which made his skin look black.  Even his garment had its colour 
 changed with the continual running of his boils, and the soft clothing 
 he used to wear had now grown so stiff that all his garments were 
 <I>like his collar,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>.

 It would be noisome to describe what a condition poor Job was in for 
 want of clean linen and good attendance, and what filthy rags all his 
 clothes were.  Some think that, among other diseases, Job was ill of a 
 quinsy or swelling in his throat, and that it was this which bound him 
 about like a stiff collar.  Thus was he <I>cast into the mire</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 <I>compared to mire</I> (so some); his body looked more like a heap of 
 dirt than any thing else. Let none be proud of their clothing nor proud 
 of their cleanness; they know not but some disease or other may 
 <I>change their garments,</I> and even <I>throw them into the mire,</I> 
 and make them noisome both to themselves and others. <I>Instead of 
 sweet smell, there shall be a stench,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+3:24">Isa. iii. 24</A>.

 We are but dust and ashes at the best, and our bodies are vile bodies;
 but we are apt to forget it, till God, by some sore disease, makes us 
 sensibly to feel and own what we are. "<I>I have become already 
 like</I> that <I>dust and ashes</I> into which I must shortly be 
 resolved: wherever I go I carry my grave about with me."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. That which afflicted him most of all was that God seemed to be his 
 enemy and to fight against him. It was <I>he</I> that <I>cast him into 
 the mire</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>),

 and seemed to trample on him when he had him there. This cut him to the 
 heart more than any thing else,

 (1.) That God did not appear for him. He addressed himself to him, but
 gained no grant--appealed to him, but gained no sentence; he was very 
 importunate in his applications, but in vain 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:20"><I>v.</I> 20</A>):

 "<I>I cry unto thee,</I> as one in earnest, <I>I stand up,</I> and cry, 
 as one waiting for an answer, but thou hearest not, <I>thou regardest 
 not,</I> for any thing I can perceive." If our most fervent prayers 
 bring not in speedy and sensible returns, we must not think it strange. 
 Though the seed of Jacob did never seek in vain, yet they have often 
 thought that they did and that God has not only been deaf, but angry, 
 at the prayers of his people, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+80:4">Ps. lxxx. 4</A>.

 (2.) That God did appear against him. That which he here says of God is 
 one of the worst words that ever Job spoke 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:21"><I>v.</I> 21</A>):

 <I>Thou hast become cruel to me.</I> Far be it from the God of mercy 
 and grace that he should be cruel to any (his compassions fail not), 
 but especially that he should be so to his own children. Job was unjust 
 and ungrateful when he said so of him: but harbouring hard thoughts of 
 God was the sin which did, at this time, most easily beset him. Here,

 [1.] He thought God fought against him and stirred up his whole 
 strength to ruin him: <I>With thy strong hand thou opposest 
 thyself,</I> or art an adversary against me. He had better thoughts of 
 God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:6"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 6</A>)

 when he concluded he would <I>not plead against him with his great
 power.</I> God has an absolute sovereignty and an irresistible 
 strength, but he never uses either the one or the other for the 
 crushing or oppressing of any. 

 [2.] He thought he insulted over him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:22"><I>v.</I> 22</A>):

 <I>Thou lifted me up to the wind,</I> as a feather or the chaff which 
 the wind plays with; so unequal a match did Job think himself for 
 Omnipotence, and so unable was he to help himself when he was made to 
 ride, not in triumph, but in terror, upon the wings of the wind, and 
 the judgments of God did even <I>dissolve his substance,</I> as a cloud 
 is dissolved and dispersed by the wind. Man's substance, take him in 
 his best estate, is nothing before the power of God; it is soon 
 dissolved.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 5. He expected no other now than that God, by these troubles, would 
 shortly make an end of him: "If I be made to ride upon the wind, I can 
 count upon no other than to break my neck shortly;" and he speaks as if 
 God had no other design upon him than that in all his dealings with 
 him: "<I>I know that thou wilt bring me,</I> with so much the more 
 terror, <I>to death,</I> though I might have been brought thither 
 without all this ado, for it is <I>the house appointed for all 
 living,</I>" 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 The grave is a house, a narrow, dark, cold, ill-furnished house, but it 
 will be our residence, where we shall rest and be safe. It is our long 
 home, our own home; for it is our mother's lap, and in it we are 
 gathered to our fathers. It is a house appointed for us by him that has 
 appointed us the bounds of all our habitations.  It is appointed for 
 all the living. It is the common receptacle, where rich and poor meet; 
 it is appointed for the general rendezvous. We must all be brought 
 thither shortly. It is God that brings us to it, for the keys of death 
 and the grave are in his hand, and we may all know that, sooner or 
 later, he will bring us thither. It would be well for us if we would 
 duly consider it. <I>The living know that they shall die;</I> let us, 
 each of us, know it with application.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 6. There were two things that aggravated his trouble, and made it the 
 less tolerable:--

 (1.) That it was a very great disappointment to his expectation 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:26"><I>v.</I> 26</A>):

 "<I>When I looked for good,</I> for more good, or at least for the 
 continuance of what I had, <I>then evil came</I>"--such uncertain
 things are all our worldly enjoyments, and such a folly is it to feed
 ourselves with great expectations from them. Those that wait for light
 from the sparks of their creature comforts will be wretchedly
 disappointed and will <I>make their bed in the darkness.</I>

 (2.) That it was a very great change in his condition
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:31"><I>v.</I> 31</A>):

 "<I>My harp is</I> not only laid by, and hung upon the willow-trees, 
 but it is <I>turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of those 
 that weep.</I>" Job, in his prosperity, had taken <I>the timbrel and 
 harp,</I> and <I>rejoiced at the sound of the organ,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+21:12"><I>ch.</I> xxi. 12</A>.

 Notwithstanding his gravity and grace, he had found time to be 
 cheerful; but now his tune was altered. Let those therefore that 
 rejoice be <I>as though they rejoiced not,</I> for they know not how 
 soon their <I>laughter</I> will be <I>turned into mourning and their 
 joy into heaviness.</I> Thus we see how much Job complains of; but,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Here is something in the midst of all with which he comforts 
 himself, and it is but a little. 

 1. He foresees, with comfort, that death will be the period of all his 
 calamities

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>):

 Though God now, with a strong hand, opposed himself against him, "yet," 
 says he, "<I>he will not stretch out his hand to the grave.</I>" The 
 hand of God's wrath would bring him to death, but would not follow him 
 beyond death; his soul would be safe and happy in the world of spirits, 
 his body safe and easy in the dust. Though men <I>cry in his 
 destruction</I> (though, when they are dying, there is a great deal of 
 agony and out-cry, many a sigh, and groan, and complaint), yet in the 
 grave they feel nothing, they fear nothing, but all is quiet there. 
 "Though in hell, which is called <I>destruction,</I> they cry, yet not 
 in the grave; and, being delivered from the second death, the first to 
 me will be an effectual relief." Therefore he wished he might be 
 <I>hidden in the grave,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+14:13"><I>ch.</I> xiv. 13</A>.

 2. He reflects with comfort upon the concern he always had for the
 calamities of others when he was himself at ease 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+30:25"><I>v.</I> 25</A>):

 <I>Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?</I> Some think he herein 
 complains of God, thinking it very hard that he who had shown mercy to 
 others should not himself find mercy. I would rather take it as a 
 quieting consideration to himself; his conscience witnessed for him 
 that he had always sympathized with persons in misery and done what he 
 could to help them, and therefore he had reason to expect that, at 
 length, both God and his friends would pity him. Those who mourn with 
 them that mourn will bear their own sorrows the better when it comes to 
 their turn to drink of the bitter cup. <I>Did not my soul burn for the 
 poor?</I> so some read it, comparing it with that of St. Paul,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+11:29">2 Cor. xi. 29</A>,

 <I>Who is offended, and I burn not?</I> As those who have been
 unmerciful and hard-hearted to others may expect to hear of it from 
 their own consciences, when they are themselves in trouble, so those 
 who have considered the poor and succoured them shall have the 
 remembrance thereof to make their bed easy in their sickness, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:1,3">Ps. xli. 1, 3</A>.</P>
