 "You have heard of the patience of Job," says the apostle, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+5:11">
 Jam. v. 11</A>.

 So we have, and of his impatience too. We wondered that a man should be
 so patient as he was 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:1-2:13"><I>ch.</I> i. and ii.</A>),

 but we wonder also that a good man should be so impatient as he is in
 this chapter, where we find him cursing his day, and, in passion, 

 I. Complaining that he was born,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:1-10">ver. 1-10</A>.

 II. Complaining that he did not die as soon as he was born, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:11-19">ver. 11-19</A>.
 
 III. Complaining that his life was now continued when he was in misery, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:20-26">ver. 20-26</A>.

 In this it must be owned that Job sinned with his lips, and it is 
 written, not for our imitation, but our admonition, that he who thinks
 he stands may take heed lest he fall.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
 &nbsp; 2  And Job spake, and said,
 &nbsp; 3  Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night <I>in
 which</I> it was said, There is a man child conceived.
 &nbsp; 4  Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,
 neither let the light shine upon it.
 &nbsp; 5  Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud
 dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
 &nbsp; 6  As <I>for</I> that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not
 be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the
 number of the months.
 &nbsp; 7  Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come
 therein.
 &nbsp; 8  Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise
 up their mourning.
 &nbsp; 9  Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look
 for light, but <I>have</I> none; neither let it see the dawning of the
 day:
 &nbsp; 10  Because it shut not up the doors of my <I>mother's</I> womb, nor
 hid sorrow from mine eyes.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Long was Job's heart hot within him; and, while he was musing, the fire 
 burned, and the more for being stifled and suppressed. At length he 
 spoke with his tongue, but not such a good word as David spoke after a 
 long pause: <I>Lord, make me to know my end,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:3,4">Ps. xxxix. 3, 4</A>.

 Seven days the prophet Ezekiel sat down astonished with the captives,
 and then (probably on the sabbath day) <I>the word of the Lord came to 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eze+3:15,16">Ezek. iii. 15, 16</A>.

 So long Job and his friends sat thinking, but said nothing; <I>they</I>
 were afraid of speaking what they thought, lest they should grieve him, 
 and <I>he</I> durst not give vent to his thoughts, lest he should 
 offend them. They came to comfort him, but, finding his afflictions 
 very extraordinary, they began to think comfort did not belong to him, 
 suspecting him to be a hypocrite, and therefore they said nothing. But 
 losers think they may have leave to speak, and therefore Job first 
 gives vent to his thoughts. Unless they had been better, it would 
 however have been well if he had kept them to himself. In short, he
 cursed his day, the day of his birth, wished he had never been born, 
 could not think or speak of his own birth without regret and vexation. 
 Whereas men usually observe the annual return of their birth-day with 
 rejoicing, he looked upon it as the unhappiest day of the year, because 
 the unhappiest of his life, being the inlet into all his woe. Now,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. This was bad enough. The extremity of his trouble and the 
 discomposure of his spirits may excuse it in part, but he can by no 
 means be justified in it. Now he has forgotten the good he was born to, 
 the lean kine have eaten up the fat ones, and he is filled with
 thoughts of the evil only, and wishes he had never been born. The
 prophet Jeremiah himself expressed his painful sense of his calamities
 in language not much unlike this: <I>Woe is me, my mother, that thou
 hast borne me!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+15:10">Jer. xv. 10</A>.

 <I>Cursed be the day wherein I was born,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+20:14">Jer. xx. 14</A>,

 &c. We may suppose that Job in his prosperity had
 many a time blessed God for the day of his birth, and reckoned it a 
 happy day; yet now he brands it with all possible marks of infamy. When 
 we consider the iniquity in which we were conceived and born we have 
 reason enough to reflect with sorrow and shame upon the day of our 
 birth, and to say that the <I>day of our death,</I> by which we are 
 <I>freed from sin</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+6:7">Rom. vi. 7</A>),

 is far <I>better.</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:1">Eccl. vii. 1</A>.

 But to curse the day of our birth because then we entered upon the
 calamitous scene of life is to quarrel with the God of nature, to 
 despise the dignity of our being, and to indulge a passion which our 
 own calm and sober thoughts will make us ashamed of. Certainly there is 
 no condition of life a man can be in in this world but he may in it (if 
 it be not his own fault) so honour God, and work out his own salvation, 
 and make sure a happiness for himself in a better world, that he will 
 have no reason at all to wish he had never been born, but a great deal 
 of reason to say that he had his being to good purpose. Yet it must be 
 owned, if there were not another life after this, and divine 
 consolations to support us in the prospect of it, so many are the 
 sorrows and troubles of this that we might sometimes be tempted to say 
 that we were <I>made in vain</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:47">Ps. lxxxix. 47</A>),

 and to wish we had never been. There are those in hell who with good
 reason wish they had never been born, as Judas,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+26:24">Matt. xxvi. 24</A>.

 But, on this side hell, there can be no reason for so vain and
 ungrateful a wish. It was Job's folly and weakness to curse his day. We 
 must say of it, This was his infirmity; but good men have sometimes 
 failed in the exercise of those graces which they have been most 
 eminent for, that we may understand that when they are said to be 
 <I>perfect</I> it is meant that they were upright, not that they were 
 sinless. <I>Lastly,</I> Let us observe it, to the honour of the 
 spiritual life above the natural, that though many have cursed the day 
 of their first birth, never any cursed the day of their new-birth, nor 
 wished they never had had grace, and the Spirit of grace, given them. 
 Those are the most excellent gifts, above life and being itself, and 
 which will never be a burden.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. Yet it was not so bad as Satan promised himself. Job cursed his 
 day, but he did not curse his God--was weary of his life, and would
 gladly have parted with that, but not weary of his religion; he 
 resolutely cleaves to that, and will never let it go. The dispute
 between God and Satan concerning Job was not whether Job had his 
 infirmities, and whether he was subject to like passions as we are 
 (that was granted), but whether he was a hypocrite, who secretly hated 
 God, and if he were provoked, would show his hatred; and, upon trial, 
 it proved that he was no such man. Nay, all this may consist with his 
 being a pattern of patience; for, though he did thus speak unadvisedly 
 with his lips, yet both before and after he expressed great submission 
 and resignation to the holy will of God and repented of his impatience; 
 he condemned himself for it, and therefore God did not condemn him, nor 
 must we, but watch the more carefully over ourselves, lest we sin after
 the similitude of this transgression.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The particular expressions which Job used in cursing his day are 
 full of poetical fancy, flame, and rapture, and create as much 
 difficulty to the critics as the thing itself does to the divines: we 
 need not be particular in our observations upon them. When he would 
 express his passionate wish that he had never been, he falls foul upon 
 the day, and wishes,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) That earth might forget it: <I>Let it perish</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>);

 <I>let it not be joined to the days of the year,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 "Let it be not only not inserted in the calendar in red letters, as the 
 day of the king's nativity useth to be" (and Job was a king,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:25"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 25</A>),

 "but let it be erased and blotted out, and buried in oblivion. Let not
 the world know that ever such a man as I was born into it, and lived in 
 it, who am made such a spectacle of misery."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) That Heaven might frown upon it: <I>Let not God regard it from 
 above,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 "Every thing is indeed as it is with God; that day is honourable on
 which he puts honour, and which he distinguishes and crowns with his 
 favour and blessing, as he did the seventh day of the week; but let my 
 birthday never be so honoured; let it be <I>nigro carbone 
 notandus--marked as with a black coal</I> for an evil day by him that 
 determines the times before appointed. The father and fountain of light 
 appointed the greater light to rule the day and the less lights to rule 
 the night; but let that want the benefit of both."

 [1.] <I>Let that day be darkness</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>);

 and, if the light of the day be darkness, <I>how great is that
 darkness!</I> how terrible! because then we look for light. Let the
 gloominess of the day represent Job's condition, whose sun went down at 
 noon.

 [2.] As for that night too, let it want the benefit of moon and stars, 
 and <I>let darkness seize upon it,</I> thick darkness, darkness that 
 may be felt, which will not befriend the repose of the night by its 
 silence, but rather disturb it with its terrors.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (3.) That all joy might forsake it: "Let it be a melancholy night, 
 solitary, and not a merry night of music and dancing. <I>Let no joyful 
 voice come therein</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>);

 let it be a long night, and not <I>see the eye-lids of the morning</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>),

 which bring joy with them."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (4.) That all curses might follow it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 "Let none ever desire to see it, or bid it welcome when it comes, but,
 on the contrary, <I>let those curse it that curse the day.</I> Whatever 
 day any are tempted to curse, let them at the same time bestow one 
 curse upon my birth-day, particularly those that make it their trade to 
 raise up mourning at funerals with their ditties of lamentation. Let 
 those that curse the day of the death of others in the same breath 
 curse the day of my birth." Or those who are so fierce and daring as to 
 be ready to raise up the <I>Leviathan</I> (for that is the word here), 
 who, being about to strike the whale or crocodile, curse it with the 
 bitterest curse they can invent, hoping by their incantations to weaken 
 it, and so to make themselves master of it. Probably some such custom 
 might there be used, to which our divine poet alludes. "Let it be as 
 odious as <I>the day wherein men bewail the greatest misfortune,</I> or 
 the time <I>wherein they see the most dreadful apparition;</I>" so 
 bishop Patrick, I suppose taking the Leviathan here to signify the 
 devil, as others do, who understand it of the curses used by conjurors 
 and magicians in raising the devil, or when they have raised a devil 
 that they cannot lay.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. But what is the ground of Job's quarrel with the day and night of 
 his birth? It is <I>because it shut not up the doors of his mother's 
 womb,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 See the folly and madness of a passionate discontent, and how absurdly
 and extravagantly it talks when the reins are laid on the neck of it. 
 Is this Job, who was so much admired for his wisdom that <I>unto him 
 men gave ear, and kept silence at his counsel,</I> and <I>after his 
 words they spoke not again?</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+29:21,22"><I>ch.</I> xxix. 21, 11</A>.

 Surely his wisdom failed him, 

 (1.) When he took so much pains to express his desire that he had never 
 been born, which, at the best was a vain wish, for it is impossible to 
 make that which has been not to have been. 

 (2.) When he was so liberal of his curses upon a day and a night that 
 could not be hurt, or made any the worse for his curses.

 (3.) When he wished a thing so very barbarous to his own mother as that 
 she had not brought him forth when her full time had come, which must 
 inevitably have been her death, and a miserable death. 

 (4.) When he despised the goodness of God to him in giving him a being 
 (such a being, so noble and excellent a life, such a life, so far above 
 that of any other creature in this lower world), and undervalued the 
 gift, as not worth the acceptance, only because <I>transit cum 
 onere--it was clogged with a proviso of trouble,</I> which now at 
 length came upon him, after many years' enjoyment of its pleasures. 
 What a foolish thing it was to wish that his eyes had never seen the 
 light, that so they might not have seen sorrow, which yet he might hope 
 to see through, and beyond which he might see joy! Did Job believe and 
 hope that he should <I>in his flesh see God at the latter day</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:26"><I>ch.</I> xix. 26</A>),

 and yet would he wish he had never had a being capable of such a bliss,
 only because, for the present, he had sorrow in the flesh? God by his
 grace arm us against this foolish and hurtful lust of impatience.</P>

 Job, perhaps reflecting upon himself for his folly in wishing he had 
 never been born, follows it, and thinks to mend it, with another, 
 little better, that he had died as soon as he was born, which he 
 enlarges upon in these verses. When our Saviour would set forth a very
 calamitous state of things he seems to allow such a saying as this, 
 <I>Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the paps 
 which never gave suck</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+23:29">Luke xxiii. 29</A>);

 but blessing the barren womb is one thing and cursing the fruitful womb
 is another! It is good to make the best of afflictions, but it is not 
 good to make the worst of mercies. Our rule is, <I>Bless, and curse 
 not.</I> Life is often put for all good, and death for all evil; yet 
 Job here very absurdly complains of life and its supports as a curse 
 and plague to him, and covets death and the grave as the greatest and 
 most desirable bliss. Surely Satan was deceived in Job when he applied
 that maxim to him, <I>All that a man hath will he give for his 
 life;</I> for never any man valued life at a lower rate than he 
 did.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He ungratefully quarrels with life, and is angry that it was not 
 taken from him as soon as it was given him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>):

 <I>Why died not I from the womb?</I> See here, 

 1. What a weak and helpless creature man is when he comes into the
 world, and how slender the thread of life is when it is first drawn. We 
 are ready to die from the womb, and to breathe our last as soon as we 
 begin to breathe at all. We can do nothing for ourselves, as other 
 creatures can, but should drop into the grave if the knees did not 
 prevent us; and the lamp of life, when first lighted, would go out of 
 itself if the breasts given us, that we should suck, did not supply it 
 with fresh oil. 

 2. What a merciful and tender care divine Providence took of us at our
 entrance into the world. It was owing to this that we <I>died not from 
 the womb</I> and did not <I>give up the ghost when we came out of the 
 belly.</I> Why were we not cut off as soon as we were born? Not because 
 we did not deserve it. Justly might such weeds have been plucked up as
 soon as they appeared; justly might such cockatrices have been crushed 
 in the egg. Nor was it because we did, or could, take any care of 
 ourselves and our own safety: no creature comes into the world so 
 shiftless as man. It was not our might, or the power of our hand, that 
 preserved us these beings, but God's power and providence upheld our 
 frail lives, and his pity and patience spared our forfeited lives. It 
 was owing to this that the knees prevented us. Natural affection is put 
 into parents' hearts by the hand of the God of nature: and hence it
 was that the blessings of the breast attended those of the womb. 

 3. What a great deal of vanity and vexation of spirit attends human
 life. If we had not a God to serve in this world, and better things to
 hope for in another world, considering the faculties we are endued with 
 and the troubles we are surrounded with, we should be strongly tempted 
 to wish that we had <I>died from the womb,</I> which would have 
 prevented a great deal both of sin and misery.</P>

 4. The evil of impatience, fretfulness, and discontent. When they thus 
 prevail they are unreasonable and absurd, impious and ungrateful. To 
 indulge them is a slighting and undervaluing of God's favour. How much 
 soever life is embittered, we must say, "It was of the Lord's mercies 
 that we died not from the womb, that we were not consumed." Hatred of 
 life is a contradiction to the common sense and sentiments of mankind, 
 and to our own at any other time. Let discontented people declaim ever 
 so much against life, they will be loth to part with it when it comes 
 to the point. When the old man in the fable, being tired with his 
 burden, threw it down with discontent and called for Death, and Death 
 came to him and asked him what he would have with him, he then 
 answered, "Nothing, but to help me up with my burden."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He passionately applauds death and the grave, and seems quite in 
 love with them. To desire to die that we may be with Christ, that we 
 may be free from sin, and that we may be <I>clothed upon with our house 
 which is from heaven,</I> is the effect and evidence of grace; but to 
 desire to die only that we may be quiet in the grave, and delivered 
 from the troubles of this life, savours of corruption. Job's 
 considerations here may be of good use to reconcile us to death when it 
 comes, and to make us easy under the arrest of it; but they ought not 
 to be made use of as a pretence to quarrel with life while it is 
 continued, or to make us uneasy under the burdens of it. It is our 
 wisdom and duty to make the best of that which is, be it living or 
 dying, and so to <I>live to the Lord</I> and <I>die to the Lord,</I> 
 and to be his in both, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+14:8">Rom. xiv. 8</A>.

 Job here frets himself with thinking that if he had but died as soon as
 he was born, and been carried from the womb to the grave,

 1. His condition would have been as good as that of the best: I would
 have been (says he,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>)

 <I>with kings and counsellors of the earth,</I> whose pomp, power, and
 policy, cannot set them out of the reach of death, nor secure them from 
 the grave, nor distinguish theirs from common dust in the grave. Even 
 princes, who had gold in abundance, could not with it bribe Death to 
 overlook them when he came with commission; and, though they filled 
 their houses with silver, yet they were forced to leave it all behind 
 them, no more to return to it. Some, by the <I>desolate places</I> 
 which the kings and counsellors are here said <I>to build for 
 themselves,</I> understand the sepulchres or monuments they prepared 
 for themselves in their life-time; as Shebna

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+22:16">Isa. xxii. 16</A>)

 <I>hewed himself out a sepulchre;</I> and by the gold which the princes
 had, and the silver with which they filled their houses, they 
 understand the treasures which, they say, it was usual to deposit in 
 the graves of great men. Such arts have been used to preserve their 
 dignity, if possible, on the other side death, and to keep themselves 
 from lying even with those of inferior rank; but it will not do: death 
 is, and will be, an irresistible leveller. <I>Mors sceptra ligonibus
 &aelig;quat--Death mingles sceptres with spades. Rich and poor meet
 together</I> in the grave; and there a <I>hidden untimely birth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>),

 a child that either never saw light or but just opened its eyes and
 peeped into the world, and, not liking it, closed them again and 
 hastened out of it, lies as soft and easy, lies as high and safe, as 
 kings and counsellors, and princes, that had gold. "And therefore,"
 says Job, "would I had lain there in the dust, rather than to lie here 
 in the ashes!" 

 2. His condition would have been much better than now it was

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>):

 "<I>Then should I have lain still, and been quiet,</I> which now I
 cannot do, I cannot be, but am still tossing and unquiet; then <I>I 
 should have slept,</I> whereas now sleep departeth from my eyes; 
 <I>then had I been at rest,</I> whereas now I am restless." Now that 
 life and immortality are brought to a much clearer light by the gospel 
 than before they were placed in good Christians can give a better 
 account than this of the gain of death: "Then should I have been 
 present with the Lord; then should I have seen his glory face to face, 
 and no longer through a glass darkly." But all that poor Job dreamed of 
 was rest and quietness in the grave out of the fear of evil tidings and 
 out of the feeling of sore boils. <I>Then should I have been quiet;</I> 
 and had he kept his temper, his even easy temper still, which he was in 
 as recorded in the two foregoing chapters, entirely resigned to the 
 holy will of God and acquiescing in it, he might have been quiet now; 
 his soul, at least, might have dwelt at ease, even when his body lay in 
 pain, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+25:13">Ps. xxv. 13</A>.

 Observe how finely he describes the repose of the grave, which
 (provided the soul also be at rest in God) may much assist our triumphs 
 over it.

 (1.) Those that now are troubled will there be out of the reach of 
 trouble 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>):

 <I>There the wicked cease from troubling.</I> When persecutors die they
 can no longer persecute; their <I>hatred and envy</I> will then 
 <I>perish.</I> Herod had vexed the church, but, when he became a prey 
 for worms, he ceased from troubling. When the persecuted die they are 
 out of the danger of being any further troubled. Had Job been at rest 
 in his grave, he would have had no disturbance from the Sabeans and 
 Chaldeans, none of all his enemies would have created him any trouble.

 (2.) Those that are now toiled will there see the period of their 
 toils. <I>There the weary are at rest.</I> Heaven is more than a rest 
 to the souls of the saints, but the grave is a rest to their bodies.
 Their pilgrimage is a weary pilgrimage; sin and the world they are 
 weary of; their services, sufferings, and expectations, they are 
 wearied with; but in the grave they <I>rest from all their labours,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+14:13,Isa+57:23">Rev. xiv. 13; Isa. lvii. 23</A>.

 They are easy there, and make no complaints; there believers sleep in
 Jesus.

 (3.) Those that were here enslaved are there at liberty. Death is the 
 prisoner's discharge, the relief of the oppressed, and the servant's 
 manumission 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 <I>There the prisoners,</I> though they walk not at large, yet they
 <I>rest together,</I> and are not put to work, to grind in that 
 prison-house. They are no more insulted and trampled upon, menaced and
 terrified, by their cruel task-masters: <I>They hear not the voice of 
 the oppressor.</I> Those that were here doomed to perpetual servitude, 
 that could call nothing their own, no, not their own bodies, are there 
 no longer under command or control: <I>There the servant is free from 
 his master,</I> which is a good reason why those that have power should 
 use it moderately, and those that are in subjection should bear it 
 patiently, yet a little while.

 (4.) Those that were at a vast distance from others are there upon a 
 level 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:19"><I>v.</I> 19</A>):

 <I>The small and great are there,</I> there the same, there all one,
 all alike free among the dead. The tedious pomp and state which attend 
 the great are at an end there. All the inconveniences of a poor and low 
 condition are likewise over; death and the grave know no 
 difference.</P>

 Job, finding it to no purpose to wish either that he had not been born 
 or had died as soon as he was born, here complains that his life was 
 now continued and not cut off. When men are set on quarrelling there is 
 no end of it; the corrupt heart will carry on the humour. Having cursed 
 the day of his birth, here he courts the day of his death. The 
 beginning of this strife and impatience is as the letting forth of 
 water.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He thinks it hard, in general, that miserable lives should be
 prolonged 

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:20-22"><I>v.</I> 20-22</A>):

 <I>Wherefore is light in life given to those that are bitter in
 soul?</I> Bitterness of soul, through spiritual grievances, makes life 
 itself bitter. <I>Why doth he give light?</I> (so it is in the 
 original): he means <I>God,</I> yet does not name him, though the devil 
 had said, "He will curse thee to thy face;" but he tacitly reflects on 
 the divine Providence as unjust and unkind in continuing life when the 
 comforts of life are removed. Life is called <I>light,</I> because 
 pleasant and serviceable for walking and working. It is candle-light;
 the longer it burns the shorter it is, and the nearer to the socket. 
 This light is said to be given us; for, if it were not daily renewed to 
 us by a fresh gift, it would be lost. But Job reckons that to those who 
 are in misery it is <B><I>doron adoron</I></B>--<I>gift and no 
 gift,</I> a gift that they had better be without, while the light only 
 serves them to see their own misery by. Such is the vanity of human
 life that it sometimes becomes a vexation of spirit; and so alterable 
 is the property of death that, though dreadful to nature, it may become 
 desirable even to nature itself. He here speaks of those, 

 1. Who long for death, when they have out-lived their comforts and
 usefulness, are burdened with age and infirmities, with pain or 
 sickness, poverty or disgrace, and yet it comes not; while, at the same 
 time, it comes to many who dread it and would put it far from them. The 
 continuance and period of life must be according to God's will, not 
 according to ours. It is not fit that we should be consulted how long
 we would live and when we would die; our times are in a better hand 
 than our own. 

 2. Who <I>dig for it as for hidden treasures,</I> that is, would give
 any thing for a fair dismission out of this world, which supposes that 
 <I>then</I> the thought of men's being their own executioners was not 
 so much as entertained or suggested, else those who longed for it 
 needed not take much pains for it, they might soon come at it (as 
 Seneca tells them) if they are pleased. 

 3. Who bid it welcome, and <I>are glad</I> when they can find the grave
 and see themselves stepping into it. If the miseries of this life can 
 prevail, contrary to nature, to make death itself desirable, shall not 
 much more the hopes and prospects of a better life, to which death is 
 our passage, make it so, and set us quite above the fear of it? It may 
 be a sin to long for death, but I am sure it is no sin to long for 
 heaven.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He thinks himself, in particular, hardly dealt with, that he might 
 not be eased of his pain and misery by death when he could not get ease 
 in any other way. To be thus impatient of life for the sake of the 
 troubles we meet with is not only unnatural in itself, but ungrateful 
 to the giver of life, and argues a sinful indulgence of our own passion 
 and a sinful inconsideration of our future state. Let it be our great 
 and constant care to get ready for another world, and then let us leave 
 it to God to order the circumstances of our removal thither as he 
 thinks fit: "Lord, when and how thou pleasest;" and this with such an 
 indifference that, if he should refer it to us, we would refer it to 
 him again. Grace teaches us, in the midst of life's greatest comforts, 
 to be willing to die, and, in the midst of its greatest crosses, to be 
 willing to live. Job, to excuse himself in this earnest desire which he 
 had to die, pleads the little comfort and satisfaction he had in 
 life.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. In his present afflicted state troubles were continually felt, and 
 were likely to be so. He thought he had cause enough to be weary of 
 living, for, 

 (1.) He had no comfort of his life: <I>My sighing comes before I 
 eat,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:24"><I>v.</I> 24</A>.

 The sorrows of life prevented and anticipated the supports of life;
 nay, they took away his appetite for his necessary food. His griefs 
 returned as duly as his meals, and affliction was his daily bread. Nay, 
 so great was the extremity of his pain and anguish that he did not only 
 sigh, but roar, and his <I>roarings were poured out like the waters</I> 
 in a full and constant stream. Our Master was acquainted with grief, 
 and we must expect to be so too.

 (2.) He had no prospect of bettering his condition: <I>His way was 
 hidden,</I> and God had <I>hedged him in,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:23"><I>v.</I> 23</A>.

 He saw no way open of deliverance, nor knew he what course to take; his
 way was <I>hedged up with thorns,</I> that he could not find his path. 
 See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+23:8,La+3:7"><I>ch.</I> xxiii. 8; Lam. iii. 7</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. Even in his former prosperous state troubles were continually 
 feared; so that <I>then</I> he was never easy, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+3:25,26"><I>v.</I> 25, 26</A>.

 He knew so much of the vanity of the world, and the troubles to which,
 of course, he was born, that he was <I>not in safety, neither had he 
 rest</I> then. That which made his grief now the more grievous was that 
 he was not conscious to himself of any great degree either of 
 negligence or security in the day of his prosperity, which might 
 provoke God thus to chastise him.

 (1.) He had not been negligent and unmindful of his affairs, but kept 
 up such a fear of trouble as was necessary to the maintaining of his 
 guard. He was afraid for his children when they were feasting, lest 
 they should offend God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:5"><I>ch.</I> i. 5</A>),

 afraid for his servants lest they should offend his neighbours; he took
 all the care he could of his own health, and managed himself and his 
 affairs with all possible precaution; yet all would not do. 

 (2.) He had not been secure, nor indulged himself in ease and softness, 
 had not trusted in his wealth, nor flattered himself with the hopes of 
 the perpetuity of his mirth; yet trouble came, to convince and remind 
 him of the vanity of the world, which yet he had not forgotten when he 
 lived at ease. Thus his way was hidden, for he knew not wherefore God
 contended with him. Now this consideration, instead of aggravating his 
 grief, might rather serve to alleviate it. Nothing will make trouble 
 easy so much as the testimony of our consciences for us, that, in some 
 measure, we did our duty in a day of prosperity; and an expectation of 
 trouble will make it sit the lighter when it comes. The less it is a 
 surprise the less it is a terror.</P>
