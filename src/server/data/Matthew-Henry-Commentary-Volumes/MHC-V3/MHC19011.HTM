 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In this psalm we have David's struggle with and triumph over a strong 
 temptation to distrust God and betake himself to indirect means for his 
 own safety in a time of danger. It is supposed to have been penned when 
 he began to feel the resentments of Saul's envy, and had had the 
 javelin thrown at him once and again. He was then advised to run his 
 country. "No," says he, "I trust in God, and therefore will keep my 
 ground." Observe, 

 I. How he represents the temptation, and perhaps parleys with it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:1-3">ver. 1-3</A>.

 II. How he answers it, and puts it to silence with the consideration of
 God's dominion and providence 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:4">ver. 4</A>),

 his favour to the righteous, and the wrath which the wicked are
 reserved for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:5-7">ver. 5-7</A>.

 In times of public fear, when the insults of the church's enemies are 
 daring and threatening, it will be profitable to meditate on this 
 psalm.</P>

 <P>To the chief musician. A psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  In the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>
 put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee <I>as</I> a bird to your
 mountain?
 &nbsp; 2  For, lo, the wicked bend <I>their</I> bow, they make ready their
 arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright
 in heart.
 &nbsp; 3  If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Here is, 

 I. David's fixed resolution to make God his confidence: <I>In the Lord 
 put I my trust,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Those that truly fear God and serve him are welcome to put their trust
 in him, and shall not be made ashamed of their doing so. And it is the 
 character of the saints, who have taken God for their God, that they 
 make him their hope. Even when they have other things to stay 
 themselves upon, yet they do not, they dare not, stay upon them, but on 
 God only. Gold is not their hope, nor are horses and chariots their 
 confidence, but God only; and therefore, when second causes frown, yet 
 their hopes do not fail them, because the first cause is still the 
 same, is ever so. The psalmist, before he gives an account of the 
 temptation he was in to distrust God, records his resolution to trust 
 in him, as that which he was resolved to live and die by.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. His resentment of a temptation to the contrary: "<I>How say you to 
 my soul,</I> which has thus returned to God as its rest and reposes in 
 him, <I>Flee as a bird to your mountain,</I> to be safe there out of 
 the reach of the fowler?" This may be taken either,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. As the serious advice of his timorous friends; so many understand 
 it, and with great probability. Some that were hearty well-wishers to 
 David, when they saw how much Saul was exasperated against him and how 
 maliciously he sought his life, pressed him by all means to flee for 
 the same to some place of shelter, and not to depend too much upon the 
 anointing he had received, which, they thought, was more likely to 
 occasion the loss of his head than to save it. That which grieved him
 in this motion was not that to flee now would savour of cowardice, and
 ill become a soldier, but that it would savour of unbelief and would
 ill become a saint who had so often said, <I>In the Lord put I my
 trust.</I> Taking it thus, the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:2,3">two following verses</A>

 contain the reason with which these faint-hearted friends of David
 backed this advice. They would have him flee,

 (1.) Because he could not be safe where he was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.

 "Observe," say they, "how <I>the wicked bend their bow;</I> Saul and 
 his instruments aim at thy life, and the uprightness of thy heart will 
 not be thy security." See what an enmity there is in the wicked against 
 the upright, in the seed of the serpent against the seed of the woman; 
 what pains they take, what preparations they make, to do them a 
 mischief: <I>They privily shoot</I> at them, or, <I>in darkness,</I> 
 that they may not see the evil designed, to avoid it, nor others, to 
 prevent it, no, nor God himself, to punish it.

 (2.) Because he could be no longer useful where he was. "For," say 
 they, "<I>if the foundations be destroyed</I>" (as they were by Saul's 
 mal-administration), "if the civil state and government be unhinged and 
 all out of course" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:3,82:5">Ps. lxxv. 3, lxxxii. 5</A>),

 "what canst thou do with thy righteousness to redress the grievances?
 Alas! it is to no purpose to attempt the saving of a kingdom so 
 wretchedly shattered; whatever the righteous can do signifies nothing." 
 <I>Abi in cellam, et dic, Miserere mei, Domine--Away to thy cell, and 
 there cry, Pity me, O Lord!</I> Many are hindered from doing the 
 service they might do to the public, in difficult times, by a despair 
 of success.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. It may be taken as a taunt wherewith his enemies bantered him, 
 upbraiding him with the professions he used to make of confidence in 
 God, and scornfully bidding him try what stead that would stand him in 
 now. "You say, God is your mountain; flee to him now, and see what the 
 better you will be." Thus they endeavoured to shame the counsel of the 
 poor, saying, There is <I>no help for them in God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+14:6,Ps+3:2">Ps. xiv. 6; iii. 2</A>.
 
 The confidence and comfort which the saints have in God, when all the
 hopes and joys in the creature fail them, are a riddle to a carnal 
 world and are ridiculed accordingly. Taking it thus, the 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:2,3">two following verses</A>

 are David's answer to this sarcasm, in which, 

 (1.) He complains of the malice of those who did thus abuse him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 <I>They bend their bow and make ready their arrows;</I> and we are told 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+64:3">Ps. lxiv. 3</A>)

 what their arrows are, even bitter words, such words as these, by which
 they endeavour to discourage hope in God, which David felt as a sword 
 in his bones.

 (2.) He resists the temptation with a gracious abhorrence, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 He looks upon this suggestion as striking at the foundations which
 every Israelite builds upon: "If you destroy the foundations, if you 
 take good people off from their hope in God, if you can persuade them 
 that their religion is a cheat and a jest and can banter them out of 
 that, you ruin them, and break their hearts indeed, and make them of 
 all men the most miserable." The principles of religion are the 
 foundations on which the faith and hope of the righteous are built.
 These we are concerned, in interest as well as duty, to hold fast 
 against all temptations to infidelity; for, if these be destroyed, if 
 we let these go, <I>What can the righteous do?</I> Good people would be 
 undone if they had not a God to go to, a God to trust to, and a future 
 bliss to hope for.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  The L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> <I>is</I> in his holy temple, the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>'s throne <I>is</I> in

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The shaking of a tree (they say) makes it take the deeper and faster 
 root. The attempt of David's enemies to discourage his confidence in 
 God engages him to cleave so much the more closely to his first 
 principles, and to review them, which he here does, abundantly to his 
 own satisfaction and the silencing of all temptations to infidelity. 
 That which was shocking to his faith, and has been so to the faith of 
 many, was the prosperity of wicked people in their wicked ways, and the 
 straits and distresses which the best men are sometimes reduced to: 
 hence such an evil thought as this was apt to arise, <I>Surely it is 
 vain to serve God,</I> and we may call the proud happy. But, in order 
 to stifle and shame all such thoughts, we are here called to 
 consider,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That there is a God in heaven: <I>The Lord is in his holy temple</I> 
 above, where, though he is out of our sight, we are not out of his. Let 
 not the enemies of the saints insult over them, as if they were at a 
 loss and at their wits' end: no, they have a God, and they know where 
 to find him and how to direct their prayer unto him, as their Father in 
 heaven. Or, He is in his holy temple, that is, in his church; he is a 
 God in covenant and communion with his people, through a Mediator, of 
 whom the temple was a type. We need not say, "Who shall go up to 
 heaven, to fetch us thence a God to trust to?" No, the word is nigh us, 
 and God in the word; his Spirit is in his saints, those living temples, 
 and the Lord is that Spirit.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That this God governs the world. The Lord has not only his 
 residence, but his throne, in heaven, and he has <I>set the dominion 
 thereof in the earth</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:33">Job xxxviii. 33</A>);

 for, having <I>prepared his throne in the heavens, his kingdom ruleth
 over all,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:19">Ps. ciii. 19</A>.
 
 Hence the heavens are said <I>to rule,</I>
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Da+4:26">Dan. iv. 26</A>.

 Let us by faith see God on this throne, on his throne of glory,
 infinitely transcending the splendour and majesty of earthly 
 princes--on his throne of government, giving law, giving motion, and 
 giving aim, to all the creatures--on his throne of judgment, rendering 
 to every man according to his works--and on his throne of grace, to 
 which his people may come boldly for mercy and grace; we shall then see 
 no reason to be discouraged by the pride and power of oppressors, or 
 any of the afflictions that attend the righteous.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That this God perfectly knows every man's true character: <I>His 
 eyes behold, his eye-lids try, the children of men;</I> he not only 
 sees them, but he sees through them, not only knows all they say and 
 do, but knows what they think, what they design, and how they really 
 stand affected, whatever they pretend. We may know what men seem to be, 
 but he knows what they are, as the refiner knows what the value of the 
 gold is when he has tried it. God is said to try <I>with his eyes,</I> 
 and <I>his eye-lids,</I> because he knows men, not as earthly princes 
 know men, by report and representation, but by his own strict 
 inspection, which cannot err nor be imposed upon. This may comfort us 
 when we are deceived in men, even in men that we think we have tried, 
 that God's judgment of men, we are sure, is according to truth.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. That, if he afflict good people, it is for their trial and 
 therefore for their good, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 The Lord tries all the children of men that he may <I>do them good in
 their latter end,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:16">Deut. viii. 16</A>.

 Let not that therefore shake our foundations nor discourage our hope
 and trust in God.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. That, however persecutors and oppressors may prosper and prevail
 awhile, they now lie under, and will for ever perish under, the wrath 
 of God. 

 1. He is a holy God, and therefore hates them, and cannot endure to
 look upon them: <I>The wicked, and him that loveth violence, his soul 
 hateth;</I> for nothing is more contrary to the rectitude and goodness 
 of his nature. Their prosperity is so far from being an evidence of 
 God's love that their abuse of it does certainly make them the objects 
 of his hatred. He that hates nothing that he has made, yet hates those 
 who have thus ill-made themselves. Dr. Hammond offers another reading 
 of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:5">this verse</A>:

 <I>The Lord trieth the righteous and the wicked</I> (distinguishes
 infallibly between them, which is more than we can do), and <I>he that 
 loveth violence hateth his own soul,</I> that is, persecutors bring 
 certain ruin upon themselves 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+8:36">Prov. viii. 36</A>),

 as follows here.

 2. He is a righteous Judge, and therefore he will punish them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.
 
 Their punishment will be,

 (1.) Inevitable: <I>Upon the wicked he shall rain snares.</I> Here is a 
 double metaphor, to denote the unavoidableness of the punishment of 
 wicked men. It shall be rained upon them from heaven 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:23">Job xx. 23</A>),

 against which there is no fence and from which there is no escape; see

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jos+10:11,1Sa+2:10">Josh. x. 11; 1 Sam. ii. 10</A>.

 It shall surprise them as a sudden shower sometimes surprises the
 traveller in a summer's day. It shall be as snares upon them, to hold 
 them fast, and keep them prisoners, till the day of reckoning comes.
 
 (2.) Very terrible. It is <I>fire, and brimstone, and a horrible 
 tempest,</I> which plainly alludes to the destruction of Sodom and 
 Gomorrah, and very fitly, for that destruction was intended for a 
 figure of <I>the vengeance of eternal fire,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jude+1:7">
 Jude 7</A>.

 The fire of God's wrath, fastening upon the brimstone of their own
 guilt, will burn certainly and furiously, will burn to the lowest hell 
 and the utmost line of eternity. What a horrible tempest are the wicked 
 hurried away in at death! What a lake of fire and brimstone must they 
 make their bed in for ever, in the congregation of the dead and damned!
 It is this that is here meant; it is this that shall be the portion of 
 their cup, the heritage appointed them by the Almighty and allotted to 
 them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+20:29">Job xx. 29</A>.

 This is the cup of trembling which shall be put into their hands, which
 they must <I>drink the dregs</I> of,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+75:8">Ps. lxxv. 8</A>.

 Every man has the portion of his cup assigned him. Those who choose the
 Lord for the portion of their cup shall have what they choose, and be 
 for ever happy in their choice

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+16:5">Ps. xvi. 5</A>);

 but those who reject his grace
 shall be made to drink the cup of his fury,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+25:15,Isa+51:17,Hab+2:16">Jer. xxv. 15; 
 Isa. li. 17; Hab. ii. 16</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. That, though honest good people may be run down and trampled upon, 
 yet God does and will own them, and favour them, and smile upon them, 
 and that is the reason why God will severely reckon with persecutors 
 and oppressors, because those whom they oppress and persecute are dear 
 to him; so that <I>whosoever toucheth them toucheth the apple of his 
 eye,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+11:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 1. He loves them and the work of his own grace in them. He is himself
 a righteous God, and therefore loves righteousness wherever he finds it
 and pleads the cause of the righteous that are injured and oppressed;
 he delights to execute judgment for them, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+103:6">Ps. ciii. 6</A>.

 We must herein be followers of God, must love righteousness as he does,
 that we may keep ourselves always in his love. He looks graciously upon 
 them: <I>His countenance doth behold the upright;</I> he is not only at 
 peace with them, and puts gladness into their hearts, by letting them 
 know that he is so. He, like a tender father, looks upon them with 
 pleasure, and they, like dutiful children, are pleased and abundantly 
 satisfied with his smiles. They walk in the light of the Lord.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In singing this psalm we must encourage and engage ourselves to trust 
 in God at all times, must depend upon him to protect our innocence and
 make us happy, must dread his frowns as worse than death and desire his 
 favour as better than life.</P>
