 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Many ancient translations join this psalm to that which goes next 
 before it, the Septuagint particularly, and the vulgar Latin; but it 
 is, in the Hebrew, a distinct psalm. In it we are taught to give glory, 
 
 I. To God, and not to ourselves, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. To God, and not to idols,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:2-8">ver. 2-8</A>.
 
 We must give glory to God, 

 1. By trusting in him, and in his promise and blessing,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:9-15">ver. 9-15</A>.

 2. By blessing him,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:16-18">ver. 16-18</A>.

 Some think this psalm was penned upon occasion of some great distress 
 and trouble that the church of God was in, when the enemies were in 
 insolent and threatening, in which case the church does not so much 
 pour out her complaint to God as place her confidence in God, and 
 triumph in doing so; and with such a holy triumph we ought to sing this 
 psalm.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Not unto us, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, not unto us, but unto thy name give
 glory, for thy mercy, <I>and</I> for thy truth's sake.
 &nbsp; 2  Wherefore should the heathen say, Where <I>is</I> now their God?
 &nbsp; 3  But our God <I>is</I> in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he
 hath pleased.
 &nbsp; 4  Their idols <I>are</I> silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
 &nbsp; 5  They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but
 they see not:
 &nbsp; 6  They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they
 smell not:
 &nbsp; 7  They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but
 they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.
 &nbsp; 8  They that make them are like unto them; <I>so is</I> every one
 that trusteth in them.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Sufficient care is here taken to answer both the pretensions of self 
 and the reproaches of idolaters.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. Boasting is here for ever excluded, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 Let no opinion of our own merits have any room either in our prayers or 
 in our praises, but let both centre in God's glory. 

 1. Have we received any mercy, gone through any service, or gained any
 success? We must not assume the glory of it to ourselves, but ascribe 
 it wholly to God. We must not imagine that we do any thing for God by 
 our own strength, or deserve any thing from God by our own 
 righteousness; but all the good we do is done by the power of his 
 grace, and all the good we have is the gift of his mere mercy, and 
 therefore he must have all the praise. Say not, <I>The power of my
 hand has gotten me this wealth,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+8:17">Deut. viii. 17</A>.

 Say not, <I>For my righteousness the Lord has</I> done these great and 
 kind things for me, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+9:4">Deut. ix. 4</A>.

 No; all our songs must be sung to this humble tune, <I>Not unto us, O 
 Lord!</I> and again, <I>Not unto us, but to thy name,</I> let all the 
 glory be given; for whatever good is wrought in us, or wrought for us, 
 it is for his mercy and his truth's sake, because he will glorify his 
 mercy and fulfil his promise. All our crowns must be cast at the feet 
 of <I>him that sits upon the throne,</I> for that is the proper place 
 for them. 

 2. Are we in pursuit of any mercy and wrestling with God for it? We 
 must take our encouragement, in prayer, from God only, and have an eye 
 to his glory more than to our own benefit in it. "Lord, do so and so 
 for us, not that we may have the credit and comfort of it, but that thy 
 mercy and truth may have the glory of it." This must be our highest and 
 ultimate end in our prayers, and therefore it is made the first 
 petition in the Lord's prayer, as that which guides all the rest, 
 <I>Hallowed be thy name;</I> and, in order to that, <I>Give us our 
 daily bread,</I> &c. This also must satisfy us, if our prayers be not
 answered in the letter of them. Whatever becomes of us, <I>unto thy
 name give glory.</I> See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+12:27,28">John xii. 27, 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The reproach of the heathen is here for ever silenced and justly 
 retorted.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The psalmist complains of the reproach of the heathen 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):
 
 <I>Wherefore should they say, Where is now their God?</I> 

 (1.) "Why do they say so? Do they not know that our God is every where 
 by his providence, and always nigh to us by his promise and grace?" 
 
 (2.) "Why does God permit them to say so? Nay, why is Israel brought so 
 low that they have some colour for saying so? Lord, appear for our 
 relief, that thou mayest vindicate thyself, and glorify thy own 
 name."</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. He gives a direct answer to their question, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 "Do they ask where is our God? We can tell where he is." 

 (1.) "In the upper world is the presence of his glory: <I>Our God is in 
 the heavens,</I> where the gods of the heathen never were, <I>in the 
 heavens,</I> and therefore out of sight; but, though his majesty be 
 unapproachable, it does not therefore follow that his being is 
 questionable." 

 (2.) "In the lower world are the products of his power: <I>He has done 
 whatsoever he pleased,</I> according to the counsel of his will; he has 
 a sovereign dominion and a universal uncontrollable influence. Do you 
 ask where he is? He is at the beginning and end of every thing, <I>and 
 not far from any of us.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. He returns their question upon themselves. They asked, Where is the 
 God of Israel? because he is not seen. He does in effect ask, What are 
 the gods of the heathen? because they are seen. 

 (1.) He shows that their gods, though they are not shapeless things, 
 are senseless things. Idolaters, at first, worshipped the sun and moon

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+31:26">Job xxxi. 26</A>),

 which was bad enough, but not so bad as that which they were now come 
 to (for evil men grow worse and worse), which was the worshipping of 
 images, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 The matter of them was <I>silver and gold,</I> dug out of the earth 
 (<I>man found them poor and dirty in a mine,</I> Herbert), proper 
 things to make money of, but not to make gods of. The make of them was 
 from the artificer; they are creatures of men's vain imaginations and 
 <I>the works of men's hands,</I> and therefore can have no divinity in 
 them. If man is the work of God's hands (as certainly he is, and it was 
 his honour that he was made <I>in the image of God</I>) it is absurd to 
 think that that can be God which is the work of men's hands, or that it 
 can be any other than a dishonour to God to make him in the image of 
 man. The argument is irrefragable: <I>The workmen made it, therefore it 
 is not God,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+8:6">Hos. viii. 6</A>.

 These idols are represented here as the most ridiculous things, a mere 
 jest, that would seem to be something, but were really nothing, fitter 
 for a toy shop than a temple, for children to play with than for men to 
 pray to. The painter, the carver, the statuary, did their part well 
 enough; they made them with <I>mouths</I> and <I>eyes, ears</I> and 
 <I>noses, hands</I> and <I>feet,</I> but they could put no life into 
 them and therefore no sense. They had better have worshipped a dead 
 carcase (for that had life in it once) than a dead image, which neither 
 has life nor can have. <I>They speak not,</I> in answer to those that 
 consult them; the crafty priest must speak for them. In Baal's image 
 there was <I>no voice, neither any that answered. They see not</I> the
 prostrations of their worshippers before them, much less their burdens 
 and wants. <I>They hear not</I> their prayers, though ever so loud;
 <I>they smell not</I> their incense, though ever so strong, ever so 
 sweet; <I>they handle not</I> the gifts presented to them, much less 
 have they any gifts to bestow on their worshippers; they cannot 
 <I>stretch forth their hands to the needy. They walk not,</I> they 
 cannot stir a step for the relief of those that apply to them. Nay, 
 they do not so much as <I>breathe through their throat;</I> they have 
 not the least sign of symptom of life, but are as dead, after the 
 priest has pretended to consecrate them and call a deity into them, as 
 they were before. 

 (2.) He thence infers the sottishness of their worshippers

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>):

 <I>Those that make them</I> images show their ingenuity, and doubtless 
 are sensible men; but <I>those that make them</I> gods show their 
 stupidity and folly, and <I>are like unto them,</I> as senseless 
 blockish things; <I>they see not</I> the invisible things of the true 
 and living God in the works of creation; <I>they hear not</I> the voice 
 of the day and the night, which in every speech and language declare 
 his glory, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+19:2,3">Ps. xix. 2, 3</A>.

 By worshipping these foolish puppets, they make themselves more and 
 more foolish like them, and set themselves at a greater distance from 
 every thing that is spiritual, sinking themselves deeper into the mire 
 of sense; and withal they provoke God to <I>give them up to a reprobate 
 mind, a mind void of judgment,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ro+1:28">Rom. i. 28</A>.

 Those <I>that trust in them</I> act very absurdly and very 
 unreasonably, are senseless, helpless, useless, like them; and they 
 will find it so themselves, to their own confusion. We shall know where 
 our God is, and so shall they, to their cost, when their gods are gone,

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 In these verses,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. We are earnestly exhorted, all of us, to repose our confidence in 
 God, and not suffer our confidence in him to be shaken by the heathens' 
 insulting over us upon the account of our present distresses. It is 
 folly to trust in dead images, but it is wisdom to trust in the living 
 God, for he is a <I>help and a shield</I> to those that do <I>trust in 
 them,</I> a help to furnish them with and forward them in that which is 
 good, and a shield to fortify them against and protect them from every 
 thing that is evil. Therefore, 

 1. Let Israel trust in the Lord; the body of the people, as to their
 public interests, and every particular Israelite, as to his own private 
 concerns, let them leave it to God to dispose of all for them, and 
 believe it will dispose of all for the best and will be <I>their help 
 and shield.</I> 

 2. Let the priests, the Lord's ministers, and all the families of the 
 <I>house of Aaron, trust in the Lord,</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>);

 they are most maligned and struck at by the enemies and therefore of 
 them God takes particular care. They ought to be examples to others of 
 a cheerful confidence in God, and a faithful adherence to him in the 
 worst of times. 

 3. Let the proselytes, who are not of the seed of Israel, but <I>fear
 the Lord,</I> who worship him and make conscience of their duty to him, 
 let them <I>trust in him,</I> for he will not fail nor forsake them,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Note, Wherever there is an awful fear of God, there may be a cheerful 
 faith in him: those that reverence his word may rely upon it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. We are greatly encouraged to trust in God, and good reason is given 
 us why we should stay ourselves upon him with an entire satisfaction. 
 Consider, 
 
 1. What we have experienced
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 <I>The Lord has been mindful of us,</I> and never unmindful, has been 
 so constantly, has been so remarkably upon special occasions. He has 
 been mindful of our case, our wants and burdens, mindful of our prayers 
 to him, his promises to us, and the covenant-relation between him and 
 us. All our comforts are derived from God's <I>thoughts to us-ward;</I> 
 he <I>has been mindful of us,</I> though we have forgotten him. Let 
 <I>this</I> engage us to trust in him, that we have found him faithful. 

 2. What we may expect. From what he has done for us we may infer, <I>He 
 will bless us;</I> he that has been our <I>help and our shield</I> will 
 be so; he that has <I>remembered us in our low estate</I> will not 
 forget us; for he is still the same, his power and goodness the same, 
 and his promise inviolable; so that we have reason to hope that he who 
 has delivered, and does, will yet deliver. Yet this is not all: <I>He 
 will bless us;</I> he has promised that he will; he has pronounced a 
 blessing upon all his people. God's blessing us is not only speaking 
 good to us, but doing well for us; those whom he blesses are blessed 
 indeed. It is particularly promised that <I>he will bless the house of 
 Israel,</I> that is, he will bless the commonwealth, will bless his 
 people in their civil interests. <I>He will bless the house of 
 Aaron,</I> that is, the church, the ministry, will bless his people in 
 their religious concerns. The priests were to bless the people; it was 
 their office 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+6:23">Num. vi. 23</A>);

 but God blessed them, and so blessed their blessings. Nay 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),
 
 <I>he will bless those that fear the Lord,</I> though they be not of 
 the house of Israel or the house of Aaron; for it was a truth, before 
 Peter perceived it, <I>That in every nation he that fears God is 
 accepted of him,</I> and blessed,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ac+10:34,35">Acts x. 34, 35</A>.

 <I>He will bless them both small and great,</I> both young and old. God 
 has blessings in store for those that are good betimes and for those 
 that are old disciples, both those that are poor in the world and those 
 that make a figure. The greatest need his blessing, and it shall not be 
 denied to the meanest that fear him. Both the weak in grace and the 
 strong shall be blessed of God, the lambs and the sheep of his flock.
 It is promised 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>),

 <I>The Lord shall increase you.</I> Whom God blesses he increases; that 
 was one of the earliest and most ancient blessings, <I>Be fruitful and 
 multiply.</I> God's blessing gives an increase--increase in number, 
 building up the family--increase in wealth, adding to the estate and 
 honour--especially an increase in spiritual blessings, with the 
 increasings of God. He will bless you with the increase of knowledge 
 and wisdom, of grace, holiness, and joy; those are blessed indeed whom 
 God thus increases, who are made wiser and better, and fitter for God 
 and heaven. It is promised that this shall be, 

 (1.) A constant continual increase: "<I>He shall increase you more and 
 more;</I> so that, as long as you live, you shall be still increasing, 
 till you come to perfection, as the shining light,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:18">Prov. iv. 18</A>.

 (2.) An hereditary increase: "<I>You and your children;</I> you in your
 children." It is a comfort to parents to see their children increasing 
 in wisdom and strength. There is a blessing entailed upon the seed of 
 those that fear God even in their infancy. For
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>),

 <I>You are blessed of the Lord,</I> you and your children are so; 
 <I>all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed 
 which the Lord has blessed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+59:9">Isa. lix. 9</A>.

 Those that are the blessed of the Lord have encouragement enough to 
 <I>trust in the Lord,</I> as <I>their help and shield,</I> for it is he 
 that <I>made heaven and earth;</I> therefore his blessings are free, 
 for he needs not any thing himself; and therefore they are rich, for he 
 has all things at command for us if we fear him and trust in him. He 
 that <I>made heaven and earth</I> can doubtless make those happy that 
 trust in him, and will do it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. We are stirred up to praise God by the psalmist's example, who 
 concludes the psalm with a resolution to persevere in his praises. 

 1. God is to be praised,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:16"><I>v.</I> 16</A>.

 He is greatly to be praised; for, 

 (1.) His glory is high. See how stately his palace is, and the throne 
 he has prepared in the heavens: <I>The heaven, even the heavens are the 
 Lord's;</I> he is the rightful owner of all the treasures of light and 
 bliss in the upper and better world, and is in the full possession of 
 them, for he is himself infinitely bright and happy. 

 (2.) His goodness is large, for <I>the earth he has given to the 
 children of men,</I> having designed it, when he made it, for their 
 use, to find them with meat, drink, and lodging. Not but that still he
 is proprietor in chief; <I>the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness 
 thereof;</I> but he has let out that vineyard to these unthankful 
 husbandmen, and from them he expects the rents and services; for, 
 though he has given them the earth, his eye is upon them, and he will 
 call them to render an account how they use it. Calvin complains that
 profane wicked people, in his days, perverted this scripture, and made 
 a jest of it, which some in our days do, arguing, in banter, that God, 
 having given the earth to the children of men, will no more look after 
 it, nor after them upon it, but they may do what they will with it, and 
 make the best of it as their portion; it is as it were thrown like a 
 prey among them, Let him seize it that can. It is a pity that such an
 instance as this gives of God's bounty to man, and such a proof as 
 arises from it of man's obligation to God, should be thus abused. From 
 the highest heavens, it is certain, God beholds all the children of 
 men; to them he has given the earth; but to the children of God heaven 
 is given. 
 
 2. The dead are not capable of praising him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:17"><I>v.</I> 17</A>),

 nor <I>any that go into silence.</I> The soul indeed lives in a state 
 of separation from the body and is capable of praising God; and <I>the 
 souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from the burdens of the 
 flesh,</I> do praise God, are still praising him; for they go up to the 
 land of perfect light and constant business. But the dead body cannot 
 praise God; death puts an end to our glorifying God in this world of 
 trial and conflict, to all our services in the field; the grave is a 
 land of darkness and silence, where there is no work or device. This 
 they plead with God for deliverance out of the hand of their enemies, 
 "Lord, if they prevail to cut us off, the idols will carry the day, and 
 there will be none to praise thee, to bear thy name, and to bear a 
 testimony against the worshippers of idols." <I>The dead praise not the 
 Lord,</I> so as we do in the business and for the comforts of this 
 life. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+30:9,88:10">Ps. xxx. 9; lxxxviii. 10</A>.
 
 3. Therefore it concerns us to praise him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>):

 "<I>But we,</I> we that are alive, <I>will bless the Lord;</I> we and 
 those that shall come after us, will do it, <I>from this time forth and 
 for evermore,</I> to the end of time; we and those we shall remove to, 
 <I>from this time forth</I> and to eternity. <I>The dead praise not the 
 Lord,</I> therefore we will do it the more diligently." 

 (1.) Others are dead, and an end is thereby put to their service, and 
 therefore we will lay out ourselves to do so much the more for God, 
 that we may fill up the gap. <I>Moses my servant is dead, now 
 therefore, Joshua, arise.</I> 

 (2.) We ourselves must shortly go to the land of silence; <I>but, while 
 we do live, we will bless the Lord,</I> will improve our time and work 
 that work of him that sent us into the world to praise him before the 
 night comes, and because <I>the night comes, wherein no man can work.
 The Lord will bless us</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+115:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>);

 he will do well for us, and therefore <I>we will bless</I> him, we will 
 speak well of him. Poor returns for such receivings! Nay, we will not 
 only do it ourselves, but will engage others to do it. <I>Praise the 
 Lord;</I> praise him with us; praise him in your places, as we in ours; 
 praise him when we are gone, that he may be praised <I>for evermore.
 Hallelujah.</I></P>
