 We left Job honourably acquitted upon a fair trial between God and 
 Satan concerning him. Satan had leave to touch, to touch and take, all 
 he had, and was confident that he would then curse God to his face; 
 but, on the contrary, he blessed him, and so he was proved an honest 
 man and Satan a false accuser. Now, one would have thought, this would 
 be conclusive, and that Job would never have his reputation called in 
 question again; but Job is known to be armour of proof, and therefore 
 is here set up for a mark, and brought upon his trial, a second time. 
 
 I. Satan moves for another trial, which should touch his bone and his
 flesh, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II. God, for holy ends, permits it,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:6">ver. 6</A>.

 III. Satan smites him with a very painful and loathsome disease, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:7,8">ver. 7, 8</A>.

 IV. His wife tempts him to curse God, but he resists the temptation,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:9,10">ver. 9, 10</A>.

 V. His friends come to condole with him and to comfort him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:11-13">ver. 11-13</A>.
 
 And in this that good man is set forth for an example of suffering 
 affliction and of patience.</P>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present
 themselves before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and Satan came also among them to
 present himself before the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>.
 &nbsp; 2  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And
 Satan answered the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and said, From going to and fro in the
 earth, and from walking up and down in it.
 &nbsp; 3  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
 Job, that <I>there is</I> none like him in the earth, a perfect and an
 upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still
 he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against
 him, to destroy him without cause.
 &nbsp; 4  And Satan answered the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and said, Skin for skin, yea,
 all that a man hath will he give for his life.
 &nbsp; 5  But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his
 flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
 &nbsp; 6  And the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT> said unto Satan, Behold, he <I>is</I> in thine hand;
 but save his life.

 Satan, that sworn enemy to God and all good men, is here pushing 
 forward his malicious prosecution of Job, whom he hated because God 
 loved him, and did all he could to separate between him and his God, to 
 sow discord and make mischief between them, urging God to afflict him 
 and then urging him to blaspheme God. One would have thought that he 
 had enough of his former attempt upon Job, in which he was so 
 shamefully baffled and disappointed; but malice is restless: the devil 
 and his instruments are so. Those that calumniate good people, and
 accuse them falsely, will have their saying, though the evidence to the 
 contrary be ever so plain and full and they have been cast in the issue 
 which they themselves have put it upon. Satan will have Job's cause 
 called over again. The malicious, unreasonable, importunity of that 
 great persecutor of the saints is represented 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:10">Rev. xii. 10</A>)

 by his accusing them before our God day and night, still repeating and
 urging that against them which has been many a time answered: so did 
 Satan here accuse Job day after day. Here is,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The court set, and the prosecutor, or accuser, making his appearance 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:1,2"><I>v.</I> 1, 2</A>),
 
 as before,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+1:6,7"><I>ch.</I> i. 6, 7</A>.

 The angels attended God's throne and Satan among them. One would have
 expected him to come and confess his malice against Job and his mistake 
 concerning him, to cry, <I>Pecavi--I have done wrong,</I> for belying 
 one whom God spoke well of, and to beg pardon; but, instead of that, he 
 comes with a further design against Job. He is asked the same question 
 as before, <I>Whence comest thou?</I> and answers as before, <I>From 
 going to and fro in the earth;</I> as if he had been doing no harm, 
 though he had been abusing that good man.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The judge himself of counsel for the accused, and pleading for him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>Hast thou considered my servant Job</I> better than thou didst, and
 art thou now at length convinced that he is a faithful servant of mine, 
 <I>a perfect and an upright man;</I> for thou seest he <I>still holds 
 fast his integrity?</I>" This is now added to his character, as a 
 further achievement; instead of letting go his religion, and cursing 
 God, he holds it faster than ever, as that which he has now more than 
 ordinary occasion for. He is the same in adversity that he was in 
 prosperity, and rather better, and more hearty and lively in blessing 
 God than ever he was, and takes root the faster for being thus shaken. 
 See,

 1. How Satan is condemned for his allegations against Job: "<I>Thou
 movedst me against him,</I> as an accuser, <I>to destroy him without 
 cause.</I>" Or, "Thou in vain movedst me to destroy him, for I will 
 never do that." Good men, when they are <I>cast down,</I> are <I>not 
 destroyed,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+4:9">2 Cor. iv. 9</A>.

 How well is it for us that neither men nor devils are to be our judges,
 for perhaps they would destroy us, right or wrong; but our judgment 
 proceeds from the Lord, whose judgment never errs nor is biassed. 

 2. How Job is commended for his constancy notwithstanding the attacks
 made upon him: "Still he holds fast his integrity, as his weapon, and 
 thou canst not disarm him--as his treasure, and thou canst not rob him 
 of that; nay, thy endeavours to do it make him hold it the faster; 
 instead of losing ground by the temptation, he gets ground." God speaks 
 of it with wonder, and pleasure, and something of triumph in the power 
 of his own grace; <I>Still he holds fast his integrity.</I> Thus the 
 trial of Job's faith was found to his <I>praise and honour,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+1:7">1 Pet. i. 7</A>.

 Constancy crowns integrity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. The accusation further prosecuted, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>.

 What excuse can Satan make for the failure of his former attempt? What
 can he say to palliate it, when he had been so very confident that he 
 should gain his point? Why, truly, he has this to say, <I>Skin for
 skin, and all that a man has, will he give for his life.</I> Something 
 of truth there is in this, that self-love and self-preservation are 
 very powerful commanding principles in the hearts of men. Men love 
 themselves better than their nearest relations, even their children, 
 that are parts of themselves, will not only venture, but give, their 
 estates to save their lives. All account life sweet and precious, and, 
 while they are themselves in health and at ease, they can keep trouble 
 from their hearts, whatever they lose. We ought to make a good use of 
 this consideration, and, while God continues to us our life and health 
 and the use of our limbs and senses, we should the more patiently bear 
 the loss of other comforts. See

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+6:25">Matt. vi. 25</A>.

 But Satan grounds upon this an accusation of Job, slyly representing
 him, 

 1. As unnatural to those about him, and one that laid not to heart the
 death of his children and servants, nor cared how many of them had
 their skins (as I may say) stripped over their ears, so long as he
 slept in a whole skin himself; as if he that was so tender of his
 children's souls could be careless of their bodies, and, like the
 ostrich, hardened against his young ones, as though they were not his.
 
 2. As wholly selfish, and minding nothing but his own ease and safety;
 as if his religion made him sour, and morose, and ill-natured. Thus are 
 the ways and people of God often misrepresented by the devil and his 
 agents.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. A challenge given to make a further trial of Job's integrity 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 "<I>Put forth thy hand now</I> (for I find my hand too short to reach
 him, and too weak to hurt him) <I>and touch his bone and his flesh</I> 
 (that is with him the only tender part, <I>make him sick with smiting 
 him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mic+6:13">Mic. vi. 13</A>),

 and then, I dare say, <I>he will curse thee to thy face,</I> and let go
 his integrity." Satan knew it, and we find it by experience, that 
 nothing is more likely to ruffle the thoughts and put the mind into 
 disorder than acute pain and distemper of body. There is no disputing 
 against sense. St. Paul himself had much ado to bear a thorn in the 
 flesh, nor could he have borne it without special grace from Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:7,9">2 Cor. xii. 7, 9</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. A permission granted to Satan to make this trial, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 Satan would have had God put forth his hand and do it; but he
 <I>afflicts not willingly,</I> nor takes any pleasure in <I>grieving 
 the children of men,</I> much less his own children

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+3:33">Lam. iii. 33</A>),

 and therefore, if it must be done, let Satan do it, who delights in
 such work: "<I>He is in thy hand,</I> do thy worst with him; but with a 
 proviso and limitation, <I>only save his life,</I> or his soul. Afflict 
 him, but not to death." Satan hunted for the precious life, would have 
 taken that if he might, in hopes that dying agonies would force Job to 
 curse his God; but God had mercy in store for Job after this trial, and 
 therefore he must survive it, and, however he is afflicted, must have 
 his life given him for a prey. If God did not chain up the roaring 
 lion, how soon would he devour us! As far as he permits the wrath of 
 Satan and wicked men to proceed against his people he will make it turn 
 to his praise and theirs, and <I>the remainder thereof he will 
 restrain,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+76:10">Ps. lxxvi. 10</A>.

 "Save his soul," that is, "his reason" (so some), "preserve to him the
 use of that, for otherwise it will be no fair trial; if, in his 
 delirium, he should curse God, that will be no disproof of his 
 integrity. It would be the language not of his heart, but of his 
 distemper." Job, in being thus maligned by Satan, was a type of Christ, 
 the first prophecy of whom was that Satan should <I>bruise his heel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:15">Gen. iii. 15</A>),

 and so he was foiled, as in Job's case. Satan tempted him to let go his
 integrity, his adoption

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+4:6">Matt. iv. 6</A>):

 <I>If thou be the Son of God.</I> He entered into the heart of Judas
 who betrayed Christ, and (some think) with his terrors put Christ into 
 his agony in the garden. He had permission to touch his bone and his
 flesh without exception of his life, because by dying he was to do that 
 which Job could not do--<I>destroy him that had the power of death, 
 that is, the devil.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>7  So went Satan forth from the presence of the L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, and smote
 Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.
 &nbsp; 8  And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he
 sat down among the ashes.
 &nbsp; 9  Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine
 integrity? curse God, and die.
 &nbsp; 10  But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish
 women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God,
 and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with
 his lips.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The devil, having got leave to tear and worry poor Job, presently fell 
 to work with him, as a tormentor first and then as a tempter. His own 
 children he tempts first, and draws them to sin, and afterwards 
 torments, when thereby he has brought them to ruin; but this child of 
 God he tormented with an affliction, and then tempted to make a bad use 
 of his affliction. That which he aimed at was to make Job curse God; 
 now here we are told what course he took both to move him to it and 
 move it to him, both to give him the provocation, else he would not 
 have thought of it: thus artfully in the temptation managed with all 
 the subtlety of the old serpent, who is here playing the same game 
 against Job that he played against our first parents 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:1-24">Gen. iii.</A>),

 aiming to seduce him from his allegiance to his God and to rob him of
 his integrity.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He provokes him to curse God by smiting him with sore boils, and so 
 making him a burden to himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:7,8"><I>v.</I> 7, 8</A>.

 The former attack was extremely violent, but Job kept his ground,
 bravely made good the pass and carried the day. Yet he is still but 
 girding on the harness; there is worse behind. The clouds return after 
 the rain. Satan, by the divine permission, follows his blow, and now 
 <I>deep calls unto deep.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. The disease with which Job was seized was very grievous: Satan 
 <I>smote him with boils, sore boils,</I> all over him, from head to 
 foot, with <I>an evil inflammation</I> (so some render it), an 
 erysipelas, perhaps, in a higher degree. One boil, when it is 
 gathering, is torment enough, and gives a man abundance of pain and 
 uneasiness. What a condition was Job then in, that had boils all over 
 him, and no part free, and those as of raging a heat as the devil could 
 make them, and, as it were, <I>set on fire of hell!</I> The small-pox 
 is a very grievous and painful disease, and would be much more terrible 
 than it is but that we know the extremity of it ordinarily lasts but a 
 few days; how grievous then was the disease of Job, who was smitten all 
 over with sore boils or grievous ulcers, which made him sick at heart, 
 put him to exquisite torture, and so spread themselves over him that he 
 could lie down no way for any ease. If at any time we be exercised with 
 sore and grievous distempers, let us not think ourselves dealt with any 
 otherwise than as God has sometimes dealt with the best of his saints 
 and servants. We know not how much Satan may have a hand (by divine 
 permission) in the diseases with which the children of men, and 
 especially the children of God, are afflicted, what infections that 
 prince of the air may spread, what inflammations may come from that 
 fiery serpent. We read of one whom Satan had bound many years, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Lu+13:16">Luke xiii. 16</A>.

 Should God suffer that roaring lion to have his will against any of us,
 how miserable would he soon make us!</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. His management of himself, in this distemper, was very strange, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) Instead of healing salves, <I>he took a potsherd,</I> a piece of a 
 broken pitcher, <I>to scrape himself withal.</I> A very sad pass this 
 poor man had come to. When a man is sick and sore he may bear it the 
 better if he be well tended and carefully looked after. Many rich 
 people have with a soft and tender hand charitably ministered to the 
 poor in such a condition as this; even Lazarus had some ease from the 
 tongues of the dogs that came and <I>licked his sores;</I> but poor Job 
 has no help afforded him. 

 [1.] Nothing is done to his sore but what he does himself, with his own 
 hands. His children and servants are all dead, his wife unkind,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:17"><I>ch.</I> xix. 17</A>.

 He has not wherewithal to fee a physician or surgeon; and, which is
 most sad of all, none of those he had formerly been kind to had so much 
 sense of honour and gratitude as to minister to him in his distress, 
 and lend him a hand to dress or wipe his running sores, either because 
 the disease was loathsome and noisome or because they apprehended it to 
 be infectious. Thus it was in the former days, as it will be in the 
 last days, men were <I>lovers of their own selves, unthankful, and 
 without natural affection.</I> 

 [2.] All that he does to his sores is to <I>scrape them;</I> they are 
 not bound up with soft rags, not mollified with ointment, not washed or 
 kept clean, no healing plasters laid on them, no opiates, no anodynes, 
 ministered to the poor patient, to alleviate the pain and compose him 
 to rest, nor any cordials to support his spirits; all the operation is 
 the scraping of the ulcers, which, when they had come to a head and 
 began to die, made his body all over like a scurf, as is usual in the 
 end of the small-pox. It would have been an endless thing to dress his 
 boils one by one; he therefore resolves thus to do it by wholesale--a 
 remedy which one would think as bad as the disease.

 [3.] He has nothing to do this with but a <I>potsherd,</I> no surgeon's 
 instrument proper for the purpose, but that which would rather rake 
 into his wounds, and add to his pain, than give him any ease. People 
 that are sick and sore have need to be under the discipline and 
 direction of others, for they are often but bad managers of 
 themselves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Instead of reposing in a soft and warm bed, he <I>sat down among 
 the ashes.</I> Probably he had a bed left him (for, though his fields 
 were stripped, we do not find that his house was burnt or plundered), 
 but he chose to sit in the ashes, either because he was weary of his 
 bed or because he would put himself into the place and posture of a 
 penitent, who, in token of his self-abhorrence, lay in dust and ashes, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+42:6,Isa+58:5,Jon+3:6"><I>ch.</I> xlii. 6; 
 Isa. lviii. 5; Jonah iii. 6</A>.

 Thus did he humble himself under the mighty hand of God, and bring his
 mind to the meanness and poverty of his condition. He complains

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+7:5"><I>ch.</I> vii. 5</A>)

 that his flesh was <I>clothed with worms</I> and <I>clods of dust;</I>
 and therefore <I>dust to dust, ashes to ashes.</I> If God lay him among 
 the ashes, there he will contentedly sit down. A low spirit becomes low 
 circumstances, and will help to reconcile us to them. The LXX. reads 
 it, He sat <I>down upon a dunghill without the city</I> (which is 
 commonly said, in mentioning this story); but the original says no more 
 than that he sat <I>in the midst of the ashes,</I> which he might do in 
 his own house.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He urges him, by the persuasions of his own wife, to curse God, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>.

 The Jews (who covet much to be wise above what is written) say that
 Job's wife was Dinah, Jacob's daughter: so the Chaldee paraphrase. It 
 is not likely that she was; but, whoever it was, she was to him like 
 Michal to David, a scoffer at his piety. She was spared to him, when 
 the rest of his comforts were taken away, for this purpose, to be a 
 troubler and tempter to him. If Satan leaves any thing that he has 
 permission to take away, it is with a design of mischief. It is his 
 policy to send his temptations by the hand of those that are dear to 
 us, as he tempted Adam by Eve and Christ by Peter. We must therefore 
 carefully watch that we be not drawn to say or do a wrong thing by the 
 influence, interest, or entreaty, of any, no, not those for whose 
 opinion and favour we have ever so great a value. Observe how strong 
 this temptation was.

 1. She banters Job for his constancy in his religion: "<I>Dost thou
 still retain thy integrity?</I> Art thou so very obstinate in thy 
 religion that nothing will cure thee of it? so tame and sheepish as 
 thus to truckle to a God who is so far from rewarding thy services with 
 marks of his favour that he seems to take a pleasure in making thee 
 miserable, strips thee, and scourges thee, without any provocation 
 given? Is this a God to be still loved, and blessed, and served?"</P>

 <CENTER>
 <TABLE BORDER=0>
 <TR><TD>Dost thou not see that thy devotion's vain?
 <BR>What have thy prayers procured but woe and pain?
 <BR>Hast thou not yet thy int'rest understood?
 <BR>Perversely righteous, and absurdly good?

 <BR>How Heaven regards the foolish saint below.
 <BR>Incorrigibly pious! Can't thy God
 <BR>Reform thy stupid virtue with his rod?--Sir R. B<FONT SIZE=-1>LACKMORE</FONT>.
 </TD></TR>
 </TABLE>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Thus Satan still endeavours to draw men from God, as he did our first 
 parents, by suggesting hard thoughts of him, as one that envies the 
 happiness and delights in the misery of his creatures, than which 
 nothing is more false. Another artifice he uses is to drive men from 
 their religion by loading them with scoffs and reproaches for their 
 adherence to it. We have reason to expect it, but we are fools if we 
 heed it. Our Master himself has undergone it, we shall be abundantly 
 recompensed for it, and with much more reason may we retort it upon the 
 scoffers, "Are you such fools as still to retain your impiety, when you 
 might <I>bless God and live?</I>" 

 2. She urges him to renounce his religion, to blaspheme God, set him at 
 defiance, and dare him to do his worst: "<I>Curse God and die;</I> live 
 no longer in dependence upon God, wait not for relief from him, but be 
 thy own deliverer by being thy own executioner; end thy troubles by 
 ending thy life; better die once than be always dying thus; thou mayest 
 now despair of having any help from thy God, even curse him, and hang 
 thyself." These are two of the blackest and most horrid of all Satan's 
 temptations, and yet such as good men have sometimes been violently 
 assaulted with. Nothing is more contrary to natural conscience than 
 blaspheming God, nor to natural sense than self-murder; therefore the 
 suggestion of either of these may well be suspected to come immediately 
 from Satan. Lord, <I>lead us not into temptation,</I> not into such, 
 not into any temptation, but <I>deliver us from the evil one.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He bravely resists and overcomes the temptation, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>.

 He soon gave her an answer (for Satan spared him the use of his tongue,
 in hopes he would curse God with it), which showed his constant 
 resolution to cleave to God, to keep his good thoughts of him, and not 
 to let go his integrity. See,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. How he resented the temptation. He was very indignant at having such 
 a thing mentioned to him: "What! Curse God? I abhor the thought of it. 
 <I>Get thee behind me, Satan.</I>" In other cases Job reasoned with his 
 wife with a great deal of mildness, even when she was unkind to him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:17"><I>ch.</I> xix. 17</A>):

 <I>I entreated her for the children's sake of my own body.</I> But,
 when she persuaded him to curse God, he was much displeased: <I>Thou 
 speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh.</I> He does not call her 
 <I>a fool</I> and <I>an atheist,</I> nor does he break out into any 
 indecent expressions of his displeasure, as those who are sick and sore
 are apt to do, and think they may be excused; but he shows her the evil 
 of what she said, and she spoke the language of the infidels and 
 idolaters, who, when they are <I>hardly bestead, fret themselves, and 
 curse their king and their God,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+8:21">Isa. viii. 21</A>.

 We have reason to suppose that in such a pious household as Job had his
 wife was one that had been well affected to religion, but that now, 
 when all their estate and comfort were gone, she could not bear the 
 loss with that temper of mind that Job had; but that she should go 
 about to infect his mind with her wretched distemper was a great 
 provocation to him, and he could not forbear thus showing his 
 resentment. Note,

 (1.) Those are angry and sin not who are angry only at sin and take a 
 temptation as the greatest affront, who <I>cannot bear those that are 
 evil,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+2:2">Rev. ii. 2</A>.

 When Peter was a Satan to Christ he told him plainly, <I>Thou art an
 offence to me.</I>

 (2.) If those whom we think wise and good at any time speak that which 
 is foolish and bad, we ought to reprove them faithfully for it and show 
 them the evil of what they say, that we suffer not sin upon them. 

 (3.) Temptations to curse God ought to be rejected with the greatest 
 abhorrence, and not so much as to be parleyed with. Whoever persuades 
 us to that must be looked upon as our enemy, to whom if we yield it is 
 at our peril Job did not curse God and then think to come off with 
 Adam's excuse: "<I>The woman whom thou gavest to be with me</I> 
 persuaded me to do it" 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+3:12">Gen. iii. 12</A>),

 which had in it a tacit reflection on God, his ordinance and
 providence. No; if thou scornest, if thou cursest, thou alone shalt 
 bear it.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How he reasoned against the temptation: <I>Shall we receive good at 
 the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil also?</I> Those whom we 
 reprove we must endeavour to convince; and it is no hard matter to give 
 a reason why we should still hold fast our integrity even when we are 
 stripped of every thing else. He considers that, though good and evil 
 are contraries, yet they do not come from contrary causes, but both 
 from the hand of God 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+45:7,La+3:38">Isa. xlv. 7, Lam. iii. 38</A>),

 and therefore that in both we must have our eye up unto him, with
 thankfulness for the good he sends and without fretfulness at the evil. 
 Observe the force of his argument.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) What he argues for, not only the bearing, but the receiving of 
 evil: <I>Shall we not receive evil,</I> that is, 

 [1.] "Shall we not expect to receive it? If God give us so many good 
 things, shall we be surprised, or think it strange, if he sometimes 
 afflict us, when he has told us that prosperity and adversity are set 
 the one over against the other?"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Pe+4:12">1 Pet. iv. 12</A>.

 [2.] "Shall we not set ourselves to receive it aright?" The word
 signifies to receive as a gift, and denotes a pious affection and 
 disposition of soul under our afflictions, neither despising them nor 
 fainting under them, accounting them gifts 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+1:29">Phil. i. 29</A>),

 accepting them as punishments of our iniquity

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Le+26:41">Lev. xxvi. 41</A>),

 acquiescing in the will of God in them ("Let him do with me as seemeth
 him good"), and accommodating ourselves to them, as those that know how 
 to want as well as how to abound, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:12">Phil. iv. 12</A>.

 When the heart is humbled and weaned, by humbling weaning providence,
 then we <I>receive correction</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Zep+3:2">Zeph. iii. 2</A>)

 and take up our cross.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) What he argues from: "Shall we receive so much good as has come to 
 us from the hand of God during all those years of peace and prosperity 
 that we have lived, and shall we not now receive evil, when God thinks 
 fit to lay it on us?" Note, The consideration of the mercies we receive 
 from God, both past and present, should make us receive our afflictions 
 with a suitable disposition of spirit. If we receive our share of the 
 common good in the seven years of plenty, shall we not receive our 
 share of the common evil in the years of famine? <I>Qui sentit 
 commodum, sentire debet et onus--he who feels the privilege, should
 prepare for the privation.</I> If we have so much that pleases us, why 
 should we not be content with that which pleases God? If we receive so 
 many comforts, shall we not receive some afflictions, which will serve 
 as foils to our comforts, to make them the more valuable (we are taught 
 the worth of mercies by being made to want them sometimes), and as 
 allays to our comforts, to make them the less dangerous, to keep the 
 balance even, and to prevent our being <I>lifted up above measure?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+12:7">2 Cor. xii. 7</A>.

 If we receive so much good for the body, shall we not receive some good
 for the soul; that is, some afflictions, by which we partake of God's 
 holiness 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:10">Heb. xii. 10</A>),

 something which, by saddening the countenance, makes the heart better?
 Let murmuring therefore, as well as boasting, be for ever excluded.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. Thus, in a good measure, Job still held fast his integrity, and 
 Satan's design against him was defeated: <I>In all this did not Job sin 
 with his lips;</I> he not only said this well, but all he said at this 
 time was under the government of religion and right reason. In the 
 midst of all these grievances he did not speak a word amiss; and we 
 have no reason to think but that he also preserved a good temper of 
 mind, so that, though there might be some stirrings and risings of 
 corruption in his heart, yet grace got the upper hand and he took care 
 that the root of bitterness might not spring up to trouble him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:15">Heb. xii. 15</A>.

 The <I>abundance of his heart</I> was for God, produced good things,
 and suppressed the evil that was there, which was out-voted by the 
 better side. If he did think any evil, yet he <I>laid his hand upon his 
 mouth</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+30:32">Prov. xxx. 32</A>),

 stifled the evil thought and let it go no further, by which it
 appeared, not only that he had true grace, but that it was strong and 
 victorious: in short, that he had not forfeited the character of a 
 <I>perfect and upright man;</I> for so <I>he</I> appears to be who, in 
 the midst of such temptations, <I>offends not in word,</I>

 <FONT SIZE=+1>11  Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was
 come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz
 the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite:
 for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with
 him and to comfort him.
 &nbsp; 12  And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him
 not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every
 one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward
 heaven.
 &nbsp; 13  So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and
 seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that
 <I>his</I> grief was very great.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We have here an account of the kind visit which Job's three friends 
 paid him in his affliction. The news of his extraordinary troubles 
 spread into all parts, he being an eminent man both for greatness and 
 goodness, and the circumstances of his troubles being very uncommon. 
 Some, who were his enemies, triumphed in his calamities, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:10,19:18,30:1"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 10; xix. 18; xxx. 1</A>,

 &c. Perhaps they made ballads on him. But his friends
 concerned themselves for him, and endeavoured to comfort him. <I>A 
 friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.</I> 
 Three of them are here named 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>),

 Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. We shall afterwards meet with a fourth,
 who it should seem was present at the whole conference, namely, Elihu. 
 Whether he came as a friend of Job or only as an auditor does not 
 appear. These three are said to be his <I>friends,</I> his intimate 
 acquaintance, as David and Solomon had each of them one in their court 
 that was called <I>the king's friend.</I> These three were eminently 
 wise and good men, as appears by their discourses. They were old men, 
 very old, had a great reputation for knowledge, and much deference was 
 paid to their judgment,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+32:6"><I>ch.</I> xxxii. 6</A>.

 It is probable that they were men of figure in their country-princes,
 or heads of houses. Now observe,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That Job, in his prosperity, had contracted a friendship with them. 
 If they were his equals, yet he had not that jealousy of them--if his
 inferiors, yet he had not that disdain of them, which was any hindrance 
 to an intimate converse and correspondence with them. to have such 
 friends added more to his happiness in the day of his prosperity than 
 all the head of cattle he was master of. Much of the comfort of this 
 life lies in acquaintance and friendship with those that are prudent 
 and virtuous; and he that has a few such friends ought to value them 
 highly. Job's three friends are supposed to have been all of them of 
 the posterity of Abraham, which, for some descents, even in the 
 families that were shut out from the covenant of peculiarity, retained 
 some good fruits of that pious education which the father of the 
 faithful gave to those under his charge. Eliphaz descended from Teman, 
 the grandson of Esau 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+36:11">Gen. xxxvi. 11</A>),

 Bildad (it is probable) from Shuah, Abraham's son by Keturah, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+25:2">Gen. xxv. 2</A>.

 Zophar is thought by some to be the same with Zepho, a descendant from
 Esau,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+26:11">Gen. xxvi. 11</A>.

 The preserving of so much wisdom and piety among those that were
 strangers to the covenants of promise was a happy presage of God's 
 grace to the Gentiles, when the partition-wall should in the latter 
 days be taken down. Esau was rejected; yet many that came from him 
 inherited some of the best blessings.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That they continued their friendship with Job in his adversity, 
 when most of his friends had forsaken him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+19:14"><I>ch.</I> xix. 14</A>.

 In two ways they showed their friendship:--</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. By the kind visit they paid him in his affliction, to mourn with him 
 and to comfort him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Probably they had been wont to visit him in his prosperity, not to hunt
 or hawk with him, not to dance or play at cards with him, but to 
 entertain and edify themselves with his learned and pious converse; and 
 now that he was in adversity they come to share with him in his griefs, 
 as formerly they had come to share with him in his comforts. These were 
 wise men, whose <I>heart was in the house of mourning,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ec+7:4">Eccl. vii. 4</A>.
 
 Visiting the afflicted, sick or sore, fatherless or childless, in their
 sorrow, is made a branch of <I>pure religion and undefiled</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jam+1:27">Jam. i. 27</A>),

 and, if done from a good principle, will be abundantly recompensed
 shortly,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Mt+25:36">Matt. xxv. 36</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (1.) By visiting the sons and daughters of affliction we may contribute 
 to the improvement, 

 [1.] Of our own graces; for many a good lesson is to be learned from 
 the troubles of others; we may look upon them and receive instruction, 
 and be made wise and serious.

 [2.] Of their comforts. By putting a respect upon them we encourage 
 them, and some good word may be spoken to them which may help to make 
 them easy. Job's friends came, not to satisfy their curiosity with an 
 account of his troubles and the strangeness of the circumstances of 
 them, much less, as David's false friends, to make invidious remarks 
 upon him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+41:6-8">Ps. xli. 6-8</A>),

 but to mourn with him, to mingle their tears with his, and so to
 comfort him. It is much more pleasant to visit those in affliction to 
 whom comfort belongs than those to whom we must first speak 
 conviction.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 (2.) Concerning these visitants observe, 

 [1.] That they were not sent for, but came of their own accord

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+6:22"><I>ch.</I> vi. 22</A>),

 whence Mr. Caryl observes that <I>it is good manners to be an unbidden
 guest at the house of mourning,</I> and, in comforting our friends, to 
 anticipate their invitations. 

 [2.] That they made an appointment to come. Note, Good people should 
 make appointments among themselves for doing good, so exciting and 
 binding one another to it, and assisting and encouraging one another in 
 it. For the carrying on of any pious design let hand join in hand.

 [3.] That they came with a design (and we have reason to think it was a 
 sincere design) to comfort him, and yet proved miserable comforters, 
 through their unskilful management of his case. Many that aim well do, 
 by mistake, come short of their aim.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. By their tender sympathy with him and concern for him in his 
 affliction. When they saw him at some distance he was so disfigured and 
 deformed with his sores that <I>they knew him not,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+2:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>.

 His face was <I>foul with weeping</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+16:16"><I>ch.</I> xvi. 16</A>),

 like Jerusalem's Nazarites, which had been <I>ruddy as the rubies,</I>
 but were now <I>blacker than a coal,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=La+4:7,8">Lam. iv. 7, 8</A>.

 What a change will a sore disease, or, without that, oppressing care
 and grief, make in the countenance, in a little time! <I>Is this 
 Naomi?</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ru+1:19">Ruth i. 19</A>.

 So, <I>Is this Job?</I> How hast thou fallen! How is thy glory stained
 and sullied, and all thy honour laid in the dust! God fits us for such 
 changes! Observing him thus miserably altered, they did not leave him, 
 in a fright or loathing, but expressed so much the more tenderness 
 towards him.

 (1.) Coming to mourn with him, they vented their undissembled grief in
 all the then usual expressions of that passion. <I>They wept</I>
 aloud; the sight of them (as is usual) revived Job's grief, and set him 
 a weeping afresh, which fetched floods of tears from their eyes. 
 <I>They rent their clothes, and sprinkled dust upon their heads,</I> as 
 men that would strip themselves, and abase themselves, with their 
 friend that was stripped and abased.

 (2.) Coming to comfort him, <I>they sat down with him upon the 
 ground,</I> for so he received visits; and they, not in compliment to 
 him, but in true compassion, put themselves into the same humble and 
 uneasy place and posture. They had many a time, it is likely, sat with 
 him on his couches and at his table, in his prosperity, and were 
 therefore willing to share with him in his grief and poverty because 
 they had shared with him in his joy and plenty. It was not a modish 
 short visit that they made him, just to look upon him and be gone; but, 
 as those that could have had no enjoyment of themselves if they had 
 returned to their place while their friend was in so much misery, they 
 resolved to stay with him till they saw him mend or end, and therefore 
 took lodgings near him, though he was not now able to entertain them as 
 he had done, and they must therefore bear their own charges. Every day, 
 for seven days together, at the house in which he admitted company, 
 they came and sat with him, as his companions in tribulation, and 
 exceptions from that rule, <I>Nullus ad amissas ibit amicus opes--Those 
 who have lost their wealth are not to expect the visits of their 
 friends.</I> They sat with him, but <I>none spoke a word</I> to him, 
 only they all attended to the particular narratives he gave of his 
 troubles. They were silent, as men astonished and amazed. <I>Cur&aelig;
 leves loquuntur, ingentes stupent--Our lighter griefs have a voice; 
 those which are more oppressive are mute.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 They spoke not a word to him, whatever they said one to another, by way 
 of instruction, for the improvement of the present providence. They 
 said nothing to that purport to which afterwards they said much--nothing
 to grieve him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+4:2"><I>ch.</I> iv. 2</A>),

 because they saw his grief was very great already, and they were loth
 at first to add affliction to the afflicted. There is a <I>time to keep 
 silence,</I> when either <I>the wicked is before us,</I> and by 
 speaking we may harden them 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+39:1">Ps. xxxix. 1</A>),

 children,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+73:15">Ps. lxxiii. 15</A>.

 Their not entering upon the following solemn discourses till the
 seventh day may perhaps intimate that it was the sabbath day, which 
 doubtless was observed in the patriarchal age, and to that day they 
 adjourned the intended conference, because probably then company 
 resorted, as usual, to Job's house, to join with him in his devotions, 
 who might be edified by the discourse. Or, rather, by their silence so 
 long they would intimate that what they afterwards said was well 
 considered and digested and the result of many thoughts. <I>The heart
 of the wise studies to answer.</I> We should think twice before we 
 speak once, especially in such a case as this, think long, and we shall 
 be the better able to speak short and to the purpose.</P>
