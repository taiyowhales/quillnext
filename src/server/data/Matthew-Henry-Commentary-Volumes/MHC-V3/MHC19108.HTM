 <HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=50>
 </CENTER>

 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm begins with praise and concludes with prayer, and faith is
 at work in both. 

 I. David here gives thanks to God for mercies to himself, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:1-5">ver. 1-5</A>.

 II.  He prays to God for mercies for the land, pleading the promises of
 God and putting them in suit, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:6-13">ver. 6-13</A>.
 
 The former part is taken out of

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+57:7-11,108:1-5">Ps. lvii. 7</A>,

 &c., the latter out of 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:5-12,108:6-13">Ps. lx. 5</A>,

 &c., and both with very little variation, to teach us that we may in
 prayer use the same words that we have formerly used, provided it be 
 with new affections. It intimates likewise that it is not only 
 allowable, but sometimes convenient, to gather some verses out of one 
 psalm and some out of another, and to put them together, to be sung to 
 the glory of God. In singing this psalm we must give glory to God and 
 take comfort to ourselves.</P>

 <P>A song or psalm of David.</P>
 </CENTER>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  O God, my heart is fixed; I
 will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
 &nbsp; 2  Awake, psaltery and harp: I <I>myself</I> will awake early.
 &nbsp; 3  I will praise thee, O L<FONT SIZE=-1><B>ORD</B></FONT>, among the people: and I will sing
 praises unto thee among the nations.
 &nbsp; 4  For thy mercy <I>is</I> great above the heavens: and thy truth
 <I>reacheth</I> unto the clouds.
 &nbsp; 5  Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory
 above all the earth;
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may here learn how to praise God from the example of one who was 
 master of the art. 

 1. We must praise God with fixedness of heart. Our heart must be
 employed in the duty (else we make nothing of it) and engaged to the 
 duty

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 <I>O God! my heart is fixed,</I> and then <I>I will sing and give 
 praise.</I> Wandering straggling thoughts must be gathered in, and kept 
 close to the business; for they must be told that here is work enough 
 for them all. 

 2. We must praise God with freeness of expression: I will praise him 
 <I>with my glory,</I> that is, with my tongue. Our tongue is our glory, 
 and never more so than when it is employed in praising God.  When the 
 <I>heart is inditing</I> this <I>good matter</I> our <I>tongue</I> must 
 be as <I>the pen of a ready writer,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+45:1">Ps. xlv. 1</A>.

 David's skill in music was his glory, it made him famous, and this 
 should be consecrated to the praise of God; and therefore it follows, 
 <I>Awake</I> my <I>psaltery and harp.</I> Whatever gift we excel in we 
 must praise God with. 

 3. We must praise God with fervency of affection, and must stir up
 ourselves to do it, that it may be done in a lively manner and not 
 carelessly

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 <I>Awake, psaltery and harp;</I> let it not be done with a dull and 
 sleepy tune, but let the airs be all lively. <I>I myself will awake 
 early</I> to do it, with all that is within me, and all little enough.
 Warm devotions honour God. 

 4. We must praise God publicly, as those that are not ashamed to own 
 our obligations to him and our thankful sense of his favours, but 
 desire that others also may be in like manner affected with the divine 
 goodness

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 <I>I will praise thee among the people</I> of the Jews; nay, <I>I will
 sing to thee among the nations</I> of the earth. Whatever company we
 are in we must take all occasions to speak well of God; and we must not 
 be shy of singing psalms, though our neighbours hear us, for it looks 
 like being ashamed of our Master. 

 5. We must, in our praises, magnify the mercy and truth of God in a
 special manner

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>),

 mercy in promising, truth in performing. The heavens are vast, but the 
 mercy of God is more capacious; the skies are high and bright, but the 
 truth of God is more eminent, more illustrious. We cannot see further 
 than the heavens and clouds; whatever we see of God's mercy and truth 
 there is still more to be seen, more reserved to be seen, in the other 
 world. 

 6.  Since we find ourselves so, defective in glorifying God, we must 
 beg of him to glorify himself, to do all, to dispose all, to his own 
 glory, to get himself honour and make himself a name

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>):

 <I>Be thou exalted, O God! above the heavens,</I> higher than the 
 angels themselves can exalt thee with their praises, <I>and</I> let 
 <I>thy glory</I> be spread over <I>all the earth. Father, glorify thy 
 own name. Thou hast glorified it; glorify it again.</I> It is to be our 
 first petition, <I>Hallowed be thy name.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>6  That thy beloved may be delivered: save <I>with</I> thy right
 hand, and answer me.
 &nbsp; 7  God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will
 divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
 &nbsp; 8  Gilead <I>is</I> mine; Manasseh <I>is</I> mine; Ephraim also <I>is</I> the
 strength of mine head; Judah <I>is</I> my lawgiver;
 &nbsp; 9  Moab <I>is</I> my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over
 Philistia will I triumph.
 &nbsp; 10  Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me
 into Edom?
 &nbsp; 11  <I>Wilt</I> not <I>thou,</I> O God, <I>who</I> hast cast us off? and wilt
 not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
 &nbsp; 12  Give us help from trouble: for vain <I>is</I> the help of man.
 &nbsp; 13  Through God we shall do valiantly: for he <I>it is that</I> shall
 tread down our enemies.
 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 We may here learn how to pray as well as praise. 

 1. We must be public-spirited in prayer, and bear upon our hearts, at
 the throne of grace, the concerns of the church of God,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:6"><I>v.</I> 6</A>.

 It is God's <I>beloved,</I> and therefore must be ours; and therefore
 we must pray for its deliverance, and reckon that we are answered if 
 God grant what we ask for his church, though he delay to give us what 
 we ask for ourselves. "<I>Save</I> thy church, <I>and</I> thou 
 <I>answerest me;</I> I have what I would have." <I>Let the earth be 
 filled with God's glory, and the prayers of David are ended</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+72:19,20">Ps. lxxii. 19, 20</A>);

 he desires no more. 

 2. We must, in prayer, act faith upon the power and promise of 
 God--upon his power (<I>Save with thy right hand,</I> which is mighty 
 to save), and upon his promise: <I>God has spoken in his holiness,</I> 
 in his holy word, to which he has sworn by his holiness, and therefore 
 <I>I will rejoice,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:7"><I>v.</I> 7</A>.

 What he has promised he will perform, for it is the word both of his
 truth and of his power. An active faith can rejoice in what God has 
 said, though it be not yet done; for with him saying and doing are not 
 two things, whatever they are with us. 

 3. We must, in prayer, take the comfort of what God has secured to us
 and settled upon us, though we are not yet put in possession of it. God 
 had promised David to give him,

 (1.) The hearts of his subjects; and therefore he surveys the several 
 parts of the country as his own already: "<I>Shechem</I> and 
 <I>Succoth, Gilead</I> and <I>Manasseh, Ephraim</I> and <I>Judah,</I> 
 are all my own,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:8"><I>v.</I> 8</A>.
 
 With such assurance as this we may speak of the performance of what God
 has promised to the Son of David; he will, without fail, give him the 
 heathen for his <I>inheritance and the utmost parts of the earth for 
 his possession,</I> for so has he <I>spoken in his holiness;</I> nay, 
 of all the particular persons that were given him he will <I>lose 
 none;</I> he also, as David, shall have the hearts of his subjects, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+6:37">John vi. 37</A>.

 And, 

 (2.) The <I>necks of his enemies.</I> These are promised, and therefore 
 David looks upon <I>Moab,</I> and <I>Edom,</I> and <I>Philistia,</I> as 
 his own already

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:9"><I>v.</I> 9</A>):

 <I>Over Philistia will I triumph,</I> which explains 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+60:8">Ps. lx. 8</A>,

 <I>Philistia, triumph thou because of me,</I> which some think should
 be read, <I>O my soul! triumph thou over Philistia.</I> Thus the
 exalted Redeemer is set down at God's right hand, in a full assurance 
 that all his enemies shall in due time <I>be made his footstool, though 
 all things are not yet put under him,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+2:8">Heb. ii. 8</A>.

 4. We must take encouragement from the beginnings of mercy to pray and 
 hope for the perfecting of it 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:10,11"><I>v.</I> 10, 11</A>):

 "<I>Who will bring me into the strong cities</I> that are yet 
 unconquered? Who will make me master of the country of <I>Edom,</I> 
 which is yet unsubdued?" The question was probably to be debated in his 
 privy council, or a council of war, what methods they should take to 
 subdue the Edomites and to reduce that country; but he brings it into 
 his prayers, and leaves it in God's hands: <I>Wilt not thou, O God?</I> 
 Certainly thou wilt. It is probable that he spoke with the more 
 assurance concerning the conquest of Edom because of the ancient oracle 
 concerning Jacob and Esau, that <I>the elder should serve the 
 younger,</I> and the blessing of Jacob, by which he was made Esau's 
 lord, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+27:37">Gen. xxvii. 37</A>.

 5. We must not be discouraged in prayer, nor beaten off from our hold 
 of God, though Providence has in some instances frowned upon us: 
 "Though thou hast <I>cast us off,</I> yet thou wilt now <I>go forth 
 with our hosts,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>.

 Thou wilt <I>comfort us again</I> after the time that thou <I>hast
 afflicted us.</I>" Adverse events are sometimes intended for the trial 
 of the constancy of our faith and prayer, which we ought to persevere 
 in whatever difficulties we meet with, and not to <I>faint.</I> 

 6. We must seek help from God, renouncing all confidence in the 
 creature

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>Lord, give us help from trouble,</I> prosper our designs, and 
 defeat the designs of our enemies against us." It is not unseasonable 
 to talk of trouble at the same time that we talk of triumphs, 
 especially when it is to quicken prayer for help from heaven; and it is 
 a good plea, <I>Vain is the help of man.</I> "It is really so, and 
 therefore we are undone if thou do not help us; we apprehend it to be 
 so, and therefore depend upon thee for help and have the more reason to 
 expect it." 

 7. We must depend entirely upon the favour and grace of God, both for
 strength and success in our work and warfare,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+108:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.

 (1.) We must do our part, but we can do nothing of ourselves; it is
 only <I>through God that we shall do valiantly.</I> Blessed Paul will 
 own that even he can <I>do nothing,</I> nothing to purpose, <I>but 
 through Christ strengthening him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Php+4:13">Phil. iv. 13</A>.

 (2.) When we have acquitted ourselves ever so well, yet we cannot speed 
 by any merit or might of our own; it is God himself that <I>treads down 
 our enemies,</I> else we with all our valour cannot do it. Whatever we 
 do, whatever we gain, God must have all the glory.</P>
