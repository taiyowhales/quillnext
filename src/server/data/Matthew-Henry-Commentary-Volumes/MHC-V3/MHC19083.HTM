 <FONT SIZE=-1>
 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 This psalm is the last of those that go under the name of Asaph. It is 
 penned, as most of those, upon a public account, with reference to the 
 insults of the church's enemies, who sought its ruin. Some think it was 
 penned upon occasion of the threatening descent which was made upon the 
 land of Judah in Jehoshaphat's time by the Moabites and Ammonites, 
 those children of Lot here spoken of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:8">ver. 8</A>),

 who were at the head of the alliance and to whom all the other states
 here mentioned were auxiliaries. We have the story

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:1">2 Chron. xx. 1</A>,

 where it is said, The children of Moab and Ammon, and others besides
 them, invaded the land.  Others think it was penned with reference to 
 all the confederacies of the neighbouring nations against Israel, from 
 first to last. The psalmist here makes an appeal and application, 

 I. To God's knowledge, by a representation of their designs and
 endeavours to destroy Israel,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:1-8">ver. 1-8</A>.

 II. To God's justice and jealousy, both for his church and for his own
 honour, by an earnest prayer for the defeat of their attempt, that the
 church might be preserved, the enemies humbled, and God glorified,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:9-18">ver. 9-18</A>.

 This, in the singing of it, we may apply to the enemies of the
 gospel-church, all anti-christian powers and factions, representing to
 God their confederacies against Christ and his kingdom, and rejoicing
 in the hope that all their projects will be baffled and the gates of
 hell shall not prevail against the church.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Keep not thou silence, O God:
 hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
 &nbsp; 2  For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee
 have lifted up the head.
 &nbsp; 3  They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and
 consulted against thy hidden ones.
 &nbsp; 4  They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from <I>being</I> a
 nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
 &nbsp; 5  For they have consulted together with one consent: they are
 confederate against thee:
 &nbsp; 6  The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and
 the Hagarenes;
 &nbsp; 7  Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the
 inhabitants of Tyre;
 &nbsp; 8  Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children
 of Lot. Selah.

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Israel of God were now in danger, and fear, and great distress, and 
 yet their prayer is called, <I>A song or psalm;</I> for singing psalms 
 is not unseasonable, no, not when the harps are hung upon the 
 willow-trees.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. The psalmist here begs of God to appear on the behalf of his injured 
 threatened people 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>):

 "<I>Keep not thou silence, O God!</I> but give judgment for us against 
 those that do us an apparent wrong." Thus Jehoshaphat prayed upon 
 occasion of that invasion

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:11">2 Chron. xx. 11</A>),

 <I>Behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy
 possession.</I> Sometimes God seems to connive at the unjust treatment 
 which is given to his people; he keeps silence, as one that either did 
 not observe it or did not concern himself in it; he holds his peace, as 
 if he would observe an exact neutrality, and let them fight it out; he 
 is still, and gives not the enemies of his people any disturbance or 
 opposition, but seems to sit by <I>as a man astonished, or as a mighty 
 man that cannot save.</I> Then he gives us leave to call upon him, as 
 here, "<I>Keep not thou silence, O God!</I> Lord, speak to us by the 
 prophets for our encouragement against our fears" (as he did in 
 reference to that invasion,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Ch+20:14-17">2 Chron. xx. 14</A>,

 &c.); "Lord, speak for us by the providence and speak against our
 enemies; speak deliverance to us and disappointment to them." God's 
 speaking is his acting; for with him saying and doing are the same 
 thing.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He here gives an account of the grand alliance of the neighbouring 
 nations against Israel, which he begs of God to break, and blast the 
 projects of. Now observe here,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Against whom this confederacy is formed; it is against the Israel of 
 God, and so, in effect, against the God of Israel. Thus the psalmist 
 takes care to interest God in their cause, not doubting but that, if it 
 appeared that they were for God, God would make it to appear that he 
 was for them, and then they might set all their enemies at defiance; 
 for whom then could be against them? "Lord," says he, "they are thy 
 enemies, and they hate thee." All wicked people are God's enemies (the 
 <I>carnal mind is enmity against God</I>), but especially wicked 
 persecutors; they hated the religious worshippers of God, because they 
 hated God's holy religion and the worship of him. This was that which 
 made God's people so zealous against them--that they fought against God:
 <I>They are confederate against thee,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Were our interest only concerned, we could the better bear it; but,
 when God himself is struck at, it is time to cry, Help, Lord. <I>Keep 
 not thou silence, O God!</I> He proves that they are confederate 
 against God, for they are so against the people of God, who are near 
 and dear to him, his son, his first-born, his portion, and the lot of 
 his inheritance; he may truly be said to fight against me that 
 endeavours to destroy my children, to root out my family, and to ruin 
 my estate. "Lord," says the psalmist, "they are thy enemies, for they 
 consult against thy hidden ones." Note, God's people are his hidden 
 ones, hidden,

 (1.) In respect of secresy.  Their life is <I>hid with Christ in 
 God;</I> the <I>world knows them not;</I> if they knew them, they would 
 not hate them as they do. 

 (2.) In respect of safety. God takes them under his special protection, 
 hides them in the hollow of his hand; and yet, in defiance of God and 
 his power and promise to secure his people, they will consult to ruin 
 them and <I>cast them down from their excellency</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+62:4">Ps. lxii. 4</A>),

 and to make a prey of those whom the <I>Lord has set apart for
 himself,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+4:3">Ps. iv. 3</A>.

 They resolve to destroy those whom God resolves to preserve.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. How this confederacy is managed. The devil is at the bottom of it, 
 and therefore it is carried on, 

 (1.) With a great deal of heat and violence: <I>Thy enemies make a 
 tumult,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>.
 
 <I>The heathen rage,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:1">Ps. ii. 1</A>.
 
 <I>The nations are angry,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+11:18">Rev. xi. 18</A>.

 They are noisy in their clamours against the people whom they hope to
 run down with their loud calumnies. This comes in as a reason why God 
 should not keep silence: "The enemies talk big and talk much; Lord, let 
 them not talk all, but do thou <I>speak to them in thy wrath,</I>"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+2:5">Ps. ii. 5</A>.

 (2.) With a great deal of pride and insolence: <I>They have lifted up
 the head.</I> In confidence of their success, they are so elevated as
 if they could over-top the Most High and overpower the Almighty. 

 (3.) With a great deal of art and policy: They have <I>taken crafty 
 counsel,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>.

 The subtlety of the old serpent appears in their management, and they
 contrive by all possible means, though ever so base, ever so bad, to 
 gain their point. They are <I>profound to make slaughter</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ho+5:2">Hos.  v. 2</A>),

 as if they could outwit Infinite Wisdom.  

 (4.) With a great deal of unanimity. Whatever separate clashing 
 interest they have among themselves, against the people of God they 
 <I>consult with one consent</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>),

 nor is <I>Satan's kingdom divided against itself.</I> To push on this 
 unholy war, they lay their heads together, and their horns, and their 
 hearts too. <I>Fas est et ab hoste doceri--Even an enemy may 
 instruct.</I> Do the enemies of the church act with one consent to 
 destroy it? Are the kings of the earth of one mind to give their power 
 and honour to the beast? And shall not the church's friends be 
 unanimous in serving her interests? If Herod and Pilate are made 
 friends, that they may join in crucifying Christ, surely Paul and 
 Barnabas, Paul and Peter, will soon be made friends, that they may join 
 in preaching Christ.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 3. What it is that is aimed at in this confederacy. They consult not 
 like the Gibeonites to make a league with Israel, that they might 
 strengthen themselves by such a desirable alliance, which would have 
 been their wisdom. They consult, not only to clip the wings of Israel, 
 to recover their new conquests, and check the progress of their 
 victorious arms, not only to keep the balance even between them and 
 Israel, and to prevent their power from growing exorbitant; this will 
 not serve. It is no less than the utter ruin and extirpation of Israel 
 that they design 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 "<I>Come, let us cut them off from being a nation,</I> as they cut off 
 the seven nations of Canaan; let us leave them neither root nor branch, 
 but lay their country so perfectly waste <I>that the name of Israel may 
 be no more in remembrance,</I> no, not in history;" for with them they 
 would destroy their Bibles and burn all their records. Such is the 
 enmity of the serpent's seed against the seed of the woman. It is the 
 secret wish of many wicked men that the church of God might not have a 
 being in the world, that there might be no such thing as religion among 
 mankind. Having banished the sense of it out of their own hearts, they 
 would gladly see the whole earth as well rid of it, all its laws and 
 ordinances abolished, all its restraints and obligations shaken off, 
 and all that preach, profess, or practise it cut off. This they would 
 bring it to if it were in their power; but <I>he that sits in heaven 
 shall laugh at them.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 4. Who they are that are drawn into this confederacy. The nations that 
 entered into this alliance are here mentioned 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:6-8"><I>v.</I> 6-8</A>);

 the Edomites and Ishmaelites, both descendants from Abraham, lead the 
 van; for apostates from the church have been its most bitter and 
 spiteful enemies, witness Julian. These were allied to Israel in blood 
 and yet in alliance against Israel. There are no bonds of nature so 
 strong but the spirit of persecution has broken through them. <I>The 
 brother shall betray the brother to death.</I> Moab and Ammon were the 
 children of righteous Lot; but, as an incestuous, so a degenerate race. 
 The Philistines were long a thorn in Israel's side, and very vexatious. 
 How the inhabitants of Tyre, who in David's time were Israel's firm 
 allies, come in among their enemies, I know not; but that <I>Assur</I> 
 (that is, the Assyrian) <I>also is joined with them</I> is not strange, 
 or that (as the word is) they were <I>an arm to the children of 
 Lot.</I> See how numerous the enemies of God's church have always been. 
 <I>Lord, how are those increased that trouble it!</I> God's heritage 
 was as a speckled bird; all <I>the birds round about were against 
 her</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jer+12:9">Jer.  xii. 9</A>),

 which highly magnifies the power of God in preserving to himself a 
 church in the world, in spite of the combined force of earth and 
 hell.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The psalmist here, in the name of the church, prays for the destruction 
 of those confederate forces, and, in God's name, foretels it; for this 
 prayer that it might be so amounts to a prophecy that it shall be so, 
 and this prophecy reaches to all the enemies of the gospel-church; 
 whoever they be that oppose the kingdom of Christ, here they may read 
 their doom. The prayer is, in short, that these enemies, who were 
 confederate against Israel, might be defeated in all their attempts, 
 and that they might prove their own ruin, and so God's Israel might be 
 preserved and perpetuated. Now this is here illustrated,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. By some precedents. Let that be their punishment which has been the 
 fate of others who have formerly set themselves against God's Israel. 
 The defeat and discomfiture of former combinations may be pleaded in 
 prayer to God and improved for the encouragement of our own faith and 
 hope, because God is the same still that ever he was, the same to his 
 people and the same against his and their enemies; with him is no 
 variableness. 

 1. He prays that their armies might be destroyed as the armies of 
 former enemies had been

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:9,10"><I>v.</I> 9, 10</A>):

 <I>Do to them as to the Midianites;</I> let them be routed by their own 
 fears, for so the Midianites were, more than by Gideon's 300 men. Do to 
 them as to the army under the command of Sisera (who was general under 
 Jabin king of Canaan) which God discomfited

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+4:15">Judg. iv. 15</A>)

 at the brook Kishon, near to which was Endor. <I>They became as dung on
 the earth;</I> their dead bodies were thrown like dung laid in heaps, 
 or spread, to fatten the ground; they were trodden to dirt by Barak's 
 small but victorious army; and this was fitly made a precedent here, 
 because Deborah made it so to aftertimes when it was fresh.

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:31">Judg. v. 31</A>,

 <I>So let all thy enemies perish, O Lord!</I> that is, So they shall
 perish. 

 2. He prays that their leaders might be destroyed as they had been
 formerly. The common people would not have been so mischievous if their 
 princes had not set them on, and therefore they are particularly prayed 
 against, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:11,12"><I>v.</I> 11, 12</A>.
 
 Observe,

 (1.) What their malice was against the Israel of God.  They said,
 <I>Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:12"><I>v.</I>  12</A>),

 the <I>pleasant places</I> of God (so the word is), by which we may
 understand the land of Canaan, which was a pleasant land and was 
 Immanuel's land, or the temple, which was indeed God's pleasant place

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+64:11">Isa. lxiv. 11</A>),

 or (as Dr. Hammond suggests) the pleasant pastures, which these 
 Arabians, who traded in cattle, did in a particular manner seek after. 
 The princes and nobles aimed to enrich themselves by this war; and 
 their armies must be made as dung for the earth, to serve their 
 covetousness and their ambition. 

 (2.) What their lot should be. They shall be made <I>like Oreb and 
 Zeeb</I> (two princes of the Midianites, who, when their forces were 
 routed, were taken in their flight by the Ephraimites and slain,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+7:25">Judg. vii. 25</A>),

 and <I>like Zeba and Zalmunna,</I> whom Gideon himself slew,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+8:21">Judg. viii. 21</A>.

 "Let these enemies of ours be made as easy a prey to us as they were to
 the conquerors then." We may not prescribe to God, but we may pray to 
 God that he will deal with the enemies of his church in our days as he 
 did with those in the days of our fathers.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He illustrates it by some similitudes, and prays, 

 1. That God would <I>make them like a wheel</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>),

 that they might be in continual motion, unquiet, unsettled, and giddy 
 in all their counsels and resolves, that they might roll down easily 
 and speedily to their own ruin. Or, as some think, that they might be 
 broken by the judgments of God, as the corn is broken, or beaten out, 
 by the wheel which was then used in threshing. Thus, when a <I>wise 
 king scatters the wicked,</I> he is said to <I>bring the wheel over 
 them,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+20:26">Prov. xx. 26</A>.

 Those that trust in God have their hearts fixed; those that fight 
 against him are unfixed, like a wheel.

 2. That they might be chased as <I>stubble,</I> or chaff, <I>before
 the</I> fierce <I>wind.</I> "The wheel, though it continually turn 
 round, is fixed on its own axis; but let them have no more fixation 
 than the light stubble has, which the wind hurries away, and nobody 
 desires to save it, but is willing it should go,"

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+1:4">Ps. i. 4</A>.

 Thus shall <I>the wicked be driven away in his wickedness, and chased
 out of the world.</I> 

 3. That they might be consumed, as wood by the fire, or as briers and
 thorns, as fern or furze, upon the mountains, by the flames, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:14"><I>v.</I> 14</A>.
 
 When the stubble is driven by the wind it will rest, at last, under
 some hedge, in some ditch or other; but he prays that they might not 
 only be driven away as stubble, but burnt up as stubble.  And this will 
 be the end of wicked men

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+6:8">Heb. vi. 8</A>)

 and particularly of all the enemies of God's church. The application of
 these comparisons we have 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:15"><I>v.</I> 15</A>):

 <I>So persecute them with thy tempest,</I> persecute them to their 
 utter ruin, and make <I>them afraid with thy storm.</I> See how sinners 
 are made miserable; the storm of God's wrath raises terrors in their 
 own hearts, and so they are made completely miserable.  God can deal 
 with the proudest and most daring sinner that has bidden defiance to 
 his justice, and can make him afraid as a grasshopper. It is the 
 torment of devils that they tremble.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He illustrates it by the good consequences of their confusion, 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:16-18"><I>v.</I>  16-18</A>.

 He prays here that God, having filled their hearts with terror, would 
 thereby fill their faces with shame, that they might be ashamed of 
 their enmity to the people of God

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+26:11">Isa. xxvi. 11</A>),

 ashamed of their folly in acting both against Omnipotence itself and 
 their own true interest. They did what they could to put God's people 
 to shame, but the shame will at length return upon themselves. Now, 

 1.  The beginning of this shame might be a means of their conversion: 
 "Let them be broken and baffled in their attempts, <I>that they may 
 seek thy name, O Lord!</I> Let them be put to a stand, that they may 
 have both leisure and reason to pause a little, and consider who it is 
 that they are fighting against and what an unequal match they are for 
 him, and may therefore humble and submit themselves and desire 
 conditions of peace.  Let them be made to fear thy name, and perhaps 
 that will bring them to seek thy name." Note, That which we should 
 earnestly desire and beg of God for our enemies and persecutors is that 
 God would bring them to repentance, and we should desire their 
 abasement in order to this, no other confusion to them than what may be 
 a step towards their conversion. 

 2. If it did not prove a means of their conversion, the perfecting of 
 it would redound greatly to the honour of God. If they will not be 
 ashamed and repent, let them be put to shame and perish; if they will 
 not be troubled and turned, which would soon put an end to all their 
 trouble, a happy end, <I>let them be troubled for ever,</I> and never 
 have peace: this will be for God's glory

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+83:18"><I>v.</I> 18</A>),

 that other men may know and own, if they themselves will not, <I>that 
 thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH</I> (that incommunicable, though not 
 ineffable name) <I>art the Most High over all the earth.</I> God's 
 triumphs over his and his church's enemies will be incontestable 
 proofs, 

 (1.) That he is, according to his name JEHOVAH, a self-existent 
 self-sufficient Being, that has all power and perfection in himself.  
 
 (2.) That he is the most high God, sovereign Lord of all, above all 
 gods, above all kings, above all that exalt themselves and pretend to 
 be high. 

 (3.) That he is so, not only over the land of Israel, but <I>over all
 the earth,</I> even those nations of the earth that do not know him or 
 own him; for his kingdom rules over all. These are great and 
 unquestionable truths, but men will hardly be persuaded to know and 
 believe them; therefore the psalmist prays that the destruction of some
