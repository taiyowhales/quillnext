 In this chapter, 

 I. The daughters of Jerusalem, moved with the description which the
 church had given of Christ, enquire after him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:1">ver. 1</A>.

 II. The church directs them where they may meet with him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:2,3">ver. 2, 3</A>.

 III. Christ is now found of those that sought him, and very highly
 applauds the beauty of his spouse, as one extremely smitten with it

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:4-7">ver. 4-7</A>),

 preferring her before all others

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:8,9">ver. 8, 9</A>),

 recommending her to the love and esteem of all her neighbours 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:10">ver. 10</A>),

 and, lastly, acknowledging the impressions which her beauty had made
 upon him and the great delight he took in it,

 <FONT SIZE=+1>1  Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women?
 whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with
 thee.
 &nbsp; 2  My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of
 spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

 Here is,

 I. The enquiry which the daughters of Jerusalem made concerning Christ,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:1"><I>v.</I> 1</A>.

 They still continue their high thoughts of the church, and call her, as 
 before, the <I>fairest among women;</I> for true sanctity is true 
 beauty. And now they raise their thoughts higher concerning Christ: 
 <I>Whither has thy beloved gone, that we may seek him with thee?</I> 
 This would be but an indecent, unacceptable, compliment, if the song 
 were not to be understood spiritually; for love is jealous of a rival, 
 would monopolize the beloved, and cares not that others should join in 
 seeking him; but those that truly love Christ are desirous that others 
 should love him too, and be joined to him; nay, the greatest instance 
 of duty and respect that the church's children can show to their mother 
 is to join with her in seeking Christ. The <I>daughters of 
 Jerusalem,</I> who had asked

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:9"><I>ch.</I> v. 9</A>),

 <I>What is thy beloved more than another beloved?</I> wondering that
 the spouse should be so passionately in love with him, are now of 
 another mind, and are themselves in love with him; for, 

 1. The spouse had described him, and shown them his excellencies and
 perfections; and therefore, though they have not seen him, yet, 
 believing, they love him. Those that undervalue Christ do so because 
 they do not know him; when God, by his word and Spirit, discovers him 
 to the soul, with that ray of light the fire of love to him will be 
 kindled. 

 2. The spouse had expressed her own love to him, her rest in that love, 
 and triumphed in it: <I>This is my beloved;</I> and that flame in her 
 breast scattered sparks into theirs. As sinful lusts, when they break
 out, defile many, so the pious zeal of some may <I>provoke many,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+9:2">2 Cor. ix. 2</A>.
 
 3. The spouse had bespoken their help in seeking her beloved

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:8"><I>ch.</I> v. 8</A>);

 but now they beg hers, for they perceive that now the cloud she had
 been under began to scatter, and the sky to clear up, and, while she 
 was describing her beloved to them, she herself retrieved her comfort 
 in him. Drooping Christians would find benefit themselves by talking of 
 Christ, as well as do good to others. Now here, 

 (1.) They enquire concerning him, "<I>Wither has thy beloved gone?</I> 
 which may must we steer our course in pursuit of him?" Note, Those that 
 are made acquainted with the excellencies of Christ, and the comfort of 
 an interest in him, cannot but be inquisitive after him and desirous to 
 know where they may meet with him. 

 (2.) They offer their service to the spouse to accompany her in quest 
 of him: <I>We will seek him with thee.</I> Those that would find Christ 
 must seek him, seek him early, seek him diligently; and it is best 
 seeking Christ in concert, to join with those that are seeking him. We 
 must seek for communion with Christ in communion with saints. We know
 <I>whither our beloved has gone;</I> he has gone to heaven, <I>to his 
 Father, and our Father.</I> He took care to send us notice of it, that 
 we might know how to direct to him, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+20:17">John xx. 17</A>.

 We must by faith see him there, and by prayer seek him there, with
 boldness <I>enter into the holiest,</I> and herein must join with 
 <I>the generation of those that seek him</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+24:6">Ps. xxiv. 6</A>),

 even with <I>all that in every place call upon him,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+1:2">1 Cor. i. 2</A>.

 We must pray with and for others.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. The answer which the spouse gave to this enquiry, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:2,3"><I>v.</I> 2, 3</A>.

 Now she complains not any more, as she had done

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:6"><I>ch.</I> v. 6</A>),

 "He is gone, he is gone," that she knew not where to find him, or
 doubted she had lost him for ever; no,</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. Now she knows very well where he is 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:2"><I>v.</I> 2</A>):

 "<I>My beloved</I> is not to be found in the streets of the city, and 
 the crowd and noise that are there; there I have in vain looked for 
 him" (as his parents <I>sought him among their kindred and 
 acquaintance, and found him not</I>); "but he <I>has gone down to his 
 garden,</I> a place of privacy and retirement." The more we withdraw 
 from the hurry of the world the more likely we are to have acquaintance 
 with Christ, who took his disciples into a garden, there to be 
 witnesses of the agonies of his love. Christ's church is a garden 
 enclosed, and separated from the open common of the world; it is <I>his 
 garden,</I> which he has planted as he did the garden of Eden, which he 
 takes care of, and delights in. Though he had gone up to the paradise
 above, yet he comes down to his garden on earth; it lies low, but he 
 condescends to visit it, and wonderful condescension it is. <I>Will God 
 in very deed dwell with man upon the earth?</I> Those that would find 
 Christ may expect to meet with him <I>in his garden</I> the church, for 
 <I>there he records his name</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+20:24">Exod. xx. 24</A>);

 they must attend upon him in the ordinances which he has instituted,
 the word, sacraments, and prayer, wherein he will be with us <I>always, 
 even to the end of the world.</I> The spouse here refers to what Christ 
 had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+5:1"><I>ch.</I> v. 1</A>),

 <I>I have come into my garden.</I> It is as if she had said, "What a
 fool was I to fret and fatigue myself in seeking him where he was not, 
 when he himself had told me where he was!" Words of direction and 
 comfort are often out of the way when we have occasion to use them, 
 till the blessed Spirit brings them to our remembrance, and then we 
 wonder how we overlooked them. Christ has told us that he would <I>come 
 into his garden;</I> thither therefore we must go to seek him. <I>The 
 beds,</I> and smaller <I>gardens,</I> in this greater, are the 
 particular churches, the <I>synagogues of God in the land</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+84:8">Ps. lxxxiv. 8</A>);

 the <I>spices</I> and <I>lilies</I> are particular believers, the
 planting of the Lord, and pleasant in his eyes. When Christ comes down 
 to his church it is,

 (1.) <I>To feed</I> among <I>the gardens,</I> to feed his flock, which 
 he feeds not, as other shepherds, in the open fields, but in his 
 garden, so well are they provided for, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+23:2">Ps. xxiii. 2</A>.

 He comes to feed his friends, and entertain them; there you may not
 only find him, but find his table richly furnished, and a hearty 
 welcome to it. He comes to feed himself, that is, to please himself 
 with the products of his own grace in his people; <I>for the Lord takes 
 pleasure in those that fear him.</I> He has many gardens, many 
 particular churches of different sizes and shapes; but, while they are 
 his, he feeds in them all, manifests himself among them, and is well 
 pleased with them.

 (2.) <I>To gather lilies,</I> wherewith he is pleased to entertain and 
 adorn himself. He picks the lilies one by one, and gathers them to 
 himself; and there will be a general harvest of them at the great day, 
 when he will send forth his angels, to gather all his lilies, that he 
 may be for ever glorified and admired in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. She is very confident of her own interest in him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:3"><I>v.</I> 3</A>):

 "<I>I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine;</I> the relation is 
 mutual, and the knot is tied, which cannot be loosed; for <I>he feeds 
 among the lilies,</I> and my communion with him is a certain token of 
 my interest in him." She had said this before

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:16"><I>ch.</I> ii. 16</A>);

 but, 

 (1.) Here she repeats it as that which she resolved to abide by, and
 which she took an unspeakable pleasure and satisfaction in; she liked 
 her choice too well to change. Our communion with God is very much 
 maintained and kept up by the frequent renewing of our covenant with 
 him and rejoicing in it. 

 (2.) She had occasion to repeat it, for she had acted unkindly to her 
 beloved, and, for her so doing, he had justly withdrawn himself from 
 her, and therefore there was occasion to take fresh hold of the 
 covenant, which continues firm between Christ and believers,
 notwithstanding their failings and his frowns, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+89:30-35">Ps. lxxxix. 30-35</A>.

 "I have been careless and wanting in my duty, and yet <I>I am my
 beloved's;</I>" for every transgression in the covenant does not throw 
 us out of covenant. "He has justly hidden his face from me and denied 
 me his comforts, and yet <I>my beloved is mine;</I>" for rebukes and 
 chastenings are not only consistent with, but they flow from 
 covenant-love.

 (3.) When we have not a full assurance of Christ's love we must live by 
 a faithful adherence to him. "Though I have not the sensible 
 consolation I used to have, yet I will cleave to this, <I>Christ is 
 mine and I am his.</I>" 

 (4.) Though she had said the same before, yet now she inverts the
 order, and asserts her interest in her first: <I>I am my beloved's,</I> 
 entirely devoted and dedicated to him; and then her interest in him and 
 in his grace: "<I>My beloved is mine,</I> and I am happy, truly happy 
 in him." If our own hearts can but witness for us that we are his, 
 there is no room left to question his being ours; for the covenant 
 never breaks on his side. 

 (5.) It is now her comfort, as it was then, that <I>he feeds among the 
 lilies,</I> that he takes delight in his people and converses freely 
 with them, as we do with those with whom we feed; and therefore, though 
 at present he be withdrawn, "I shall meet with him again. <I>I shall 
 yet praise him who is the health of my countenance, and my 
 God.</I>"</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 <FONT SIZE=+1>4  Thou <I>art</I> beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as
 Jerusalem, terrible as <I>an army</I> with banners.
 &nbsp; 5  Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy
 hair <I>is</I> as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.
 &nbsp; 6  Thy teeth <I>are</I> as a flock of sheep which go up from the

 The daughters saw her, and blessed her; <I>yea,</I> the queens and the

 &nbsp; 10  Who <I>is</I> she <I>that</I> looketh forth as the morning, fair as
 the moon, clear as the sun, <I>and</I> terrible as <I>an army</I> with

 </FONT></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Now we must suppose Christ graciously returned to his spouse, from whom 
 he had withdrawn himself, returned to converse with her (for he speaks 
 to her and <I>makes her to hear joy and gladness</I>), returned to 
 favour her, having forgiven and forgotten all her unkindness, for he 
 speaks very tenderly and respectfully to her.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. He pronounces her truly amiable 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:4"><I>v.</I> 4</A>):

 <I>Thou art beautiful, O my love! as Tirzah,</I> a city in the tribe of 
 Manasseh, whose name signifies <I>pleasant,</I> or <I>acceptable,</I> 
 the situation, no doubt, being very happy and the building fine and 
 uniform. <I>Thou art comely as Jerusalem,</I> a city <I>compact 
 together</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+122:3">Ps. cxxii. 3</A>),

 and which Solomon had built and beautified, <I>the joy of the whole
 earth;</I> it was an honour to the world (whether they thought so or 
 no) that there was such a city in it. It was the holy city, and that 
 was the greatest beauty of it; and fitly is the church compared to it, 
 for it was figured and typified by it. The gospel-church is <I>the 
 Jerusalem that is above</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ga+4:26">Gal. iv. 26</A>),

 <I>the heavenly Jerusalem</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Heb+12:22">Heb. xii. 22</A>);

 in it God has <I>his sanctuary,</I> and is, in a special manner,
 present; thence he has the tribute of praise issuing; it is his rest 
 for ever, and therefore it is <I>comely as Jerusalem,</I> and, being 
 so, is <I>terrible as an army with banners.</I> Church-censures, duly 
 administered, strike an awe upon men's consciences; the word (the 
 weapons of her warfare) <I>casts down imaginations</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=2Co+10:5">2 Cor. x. 5</A>),

 and even an unbeliever is convinced and judged by the solemnity of holy
 ordinances, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Co+14:24,25">1 Cor. xiv. 24, 25</A>.

 The saints by faith <I>overcome the world</I>

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=1Jo+5:4">1 John v. 4</A>);

 nay, like Jacob, they have <I>power with God and prevail,</I> 

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:28">Gen. xxxii. 28</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. He owns himself in love with her, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:5"><I>v.</I> 5</A>.

 Though, for a small moment, and in a little wrath, he had hid his face
 from her, yet now he gathers her with very surprising instances of 
 <I>everlasting lovingkindness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+54:8">Isa. liv. 8</A>.

 <I>Turn thy eyes towards me</I> (so some read it), "turn the eyes of
 faith and love towards me, <I>for they have lifted me up;</I> look unto 
 me, and be comforted." When we are calling to God to turn the eye of 
 his favour towards us he is calling to us to turn the eye of our 
 obedience towards him. We read it as a strange expression of love, 
 "<I>Turn away thy eyes from me, for</I> I cannot bear the brightness of 
 them; <I>they have</I> quite <I>overcome me,</I> and I am prevailed 
 with to overlook all that is past;" as God said to Moses, when he 
 interceded for Israel, "<I>Let me alone,</I> or I must yield," 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+32:10">Exod. xxxii. 10</A>.

 Christ is pleased to borrow these expressions of a passionate lover
 only to express the tenderness of a compassionate Redeemer, and the 
 delight he takes in his redeemed and in the workings of his own grace 
 in them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. He repeats, almost word for word, part of the description he had 
 given of her beauty 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+4:1-3"><I>ch.</I> iv. 1-3</A>),

 her <I>hair,</I> her <I>teeth,</I> her <I>temples</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:5-7"><I>v.</I> 5-7</A>),

 not because he could not have described it in other words, and by other 
 similitudes, but to show that he had still the same esteem for her 
 since her unkindness to him, and his withdrawings from her, that he had 
 before. Lest she should think that, though he would not quite cast her 
 off, yet he would think the worse of her while he knew her, he says the 
 same of her now that he had done; for those <I>to whom much is forgiven 
 will love the more,</I> and, consequently, will be the more loved, for 
 Christ has said, <I>I love those that love me.</I> He is pleased with 
 his people, notwithstanding their weaknesses, when they sincerely 
 repent of them and return to their duty, and commends them as if they 
 had already arrived at perfection.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 IV. He prefers her before all competitors, and sees all the beauties 
 and perfections of others meeting and centering in her 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:8,9"><I>v.</I> 8, 9</A>):
 
 "<I>There are,</I> it may be, <I>threescore queens,</I> who, like 
 Esther, have by their beauty attained to the royal state and dignity, 
 <I>and fourscore concubines,</I> whom kings have preferred before their 
 own queens, as more charming, and these attended by their maids of 
 honour, <I>virgins without number,</I> who, when there is a ball at 
 court, appear in great splendour, with beauty that dazzles the eyes of 
 the spectators; but <I>my dove, my undefiled, is but one,</I> a holy 
 one." 

 1. She excels them all. Go through all the world, and view the
 societies of men that reckon themselves wise and happy, kingdoms, 
 courts, senates, councils, or whatever incorporations you may think 
 valuable, they are none of them to be compared with the church of 
 Christ; their honours and beauties are nothing to hers. <I>Who is like 
 unto thee, O Israel!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=De+33:29,De+4:6,7">Deut. xxxiii. 29; iv. 6, 7</A>.

 There are particular persons, as <I>virgins without number,</I> who are
 famed for their accomplishments, the beauties of their address, 
 language, and performances, but the beauty of holiness is beyond all 
 other beauty: "<I>My dove, my undefiled, is one,</I> has that one 
 beauty that she is a dove, an undefiled dove, and mine, and that makes 
 her excel the queens and virgins, though they were ever so many."

 2. She included them all. "Other kings have many queens, and 
 concubines, and virgins, with whose conversation they entertain 
 themselves, but <I>my dove, my undefiled,</I> is to me instead of all; 
 in that one I have more than they have in all theirs." Or, "Though 
 there are many particular churches, some of greater dignity, others of 
 less, some of longer, others of shorter, standing, and many particular 
 believers, of different gifts and attainments, some more eminent, 
 others less so, yet they all constitute but one catholic church, are 
 all but parts of that whole, and that is <I>my dove, my undefiled.</I>" 
 Christ is the centre of the church's unity; all the children of God 
 that are scattered abroad are gathered by him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Joh+11:52">John xi. 52</A>),

 and meet in him

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Eph+1:10">Eph. i. 10</A>),
 
 and are all his doves.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 V. He shows how much she was esteemed, not by him only, but by all that 
 had acquaintance with her and stood in relation to her. It would add to 
 her praise to say, 

 1. That she was her mother's darling; she had that in her, from a
 child, which recommended her to the particular affection of her 
 parents. As Solomon himself is said to have been <I>tender and an only 
 one in the sight of his mother</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Pr+4:3">Prov. iv. 3</A>),

 so was she <I>the only one of her mother,</I> as dear as if she had
 been an only one, and, if there were many more, yet she was <I>the 
 choice one of her that bore her,</I> more excellent than all the 
 societies of men this world ever produced. All the kingdoms of the 
 world, and the glory of them, are nothing, in Christ's account, 
 compared with the church, which is made up of <I>the excellent ones of 
 the earth,</I> the <I>precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine 
 gold,</I> and <I>more excellent than their neighbours.</I>

 2. That she was admired by all her acquaintance, not only <I>the 
 daughters,</I> who were her juniors, but even <I>the queens and the 
 concubines,</I> who might have reason to be jealous of her as a rival; 
 <I>they</I> all <I>blessed her,</I> and wished well to her, <I>praised 
 her,</I> and spoke well of her. <I>The daughters of Jerusalem</I> 
 called her the <I>fairest among women;</I> all agreed to give her the 
 pre-eminence for beauty, and every sheaf bowed to hers. Note,

 (1.) Those that have any correct sense of things cannot but be 
 convinced in their consciences (whatever they say) that godly people 
 are excellent people; many will give them their good word, and more 
 their good-will. 

 (2.) Jesus Christ takes notice what people think and speak of his 
 church, and is well pleased with those that honour such as fear the 
 Lord, and takes it ill of those that despise them, particularly when 
 they are under a cloud, that <I>offend any of his little ones.</I></P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 VI. He produces the encomium that was given of her, and makes it his 
 own 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:10"><I>v.</I> 10</A>):

 <I>Who is she that looks forth as the morning?</I> This is applicable 
 both to the church in the world and to grace in the heart.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 1. They are amiable as the light, the most beautiful of all visible 
 things. Christians are, or should be, the lights of the world. The 
 patriarchal church <I>looked forth as the morning</I> when the promise 
 of the Messiah was first made known, and <I>the day-spring from on high 
 visited</I> this dark world. The Jewish church was <I>fair as the 
 moon;</I> the ceremonial law was an imperfect light; it shone by 
 reflection; it was changing as the moon, did not make day, nor had 
 <I>the sun of righteousness yet risen.</I> But the Christian church is 
 clear <I>as the sun,</I> exhibits a great <I>light to those that sat in 
 darkness.</I> Or we may apply it to the kingdom of grace, the 
 gospel-kingdom. 

 (1.) In its rise, it <I>looks forth as the morning</I> after a dark 
 night; it is discovering 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+38:12,13">Job xxxviii. 12, 13</A>),

 and very acceptable, <I>looks forth</I> pleasantly as a clear morning;
 but it is small in its beginnings, and scarcely perceptible at first.

 (2.) It is, at the best, in this world, but <I>fair as the moon,</I> 
 which shines with a borrowed light, which has her changes and eclipses, 
 and her spots too, and, when at the full, does but rule by night. But, 
 
 (3.) When it is perfected in the kingdom of glory then it will be 
 <I>clear as the sun,</I> the church <I>clothed with the sun,</I> with 
 Christ <I>the sun of righteousness,</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Re+12:1">Rev. xii. 1</A>.

 Those that love God will then be <I>as the sun when he goes forth in
 his strength</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Jdg+5:31,Mt+13:43">Judges v. 31; Matt. xiii. 43</A>);

 they shall shine in inexpressible glory, and that which is perfect will
 then come; there shall be no darkness, no spots,

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+30:26">Isa. xxx. 26</A>.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 2. The beauty of the church and of believers is not only amiable, but 
 <I>awful as an army with banners.</I> The church, in this world, is 
 <I>as an army,</I> as the camp of Israel in the wilderness; its state 
 is militant; it is in the midst of enemies, and is engaged in a 
 constant conflict with them. Believers are soldiers in this army. It 
 has its <I>banners;</I> the gospel of Christ is an ensign 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Isa+11:12">Isa. xi. 12</A>),
 
 the love of Christ,
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+2:4"><I>ch.</I> ii. 4</A>.

 It is marshalled, and kept in order and under discipline. It is
 <I>terrible</I> to its enemies as Israel in the wilderness was, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ex+15:14">Exod. xv. 14</A>.

 When Balaam saw Israel encamped according to their tribes, by their
 standards, with colours displayed, he said, <I>How goodly are thy 
 tents, O Jacob!</I> 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Nu+24:5">Num. xxiv. 5</A>.

 When the church preserves her purity she secures her honour and
 victory; when she is <I>fair as the moon,</I> and <I>clear as the 
 sun,</I> she is truly great and formidable.</P>

 Christ having now returned to his spouse, and the breach being entirely 
 made up, and the falling out of these lovers being the renewing of 
 love, Christ here gives an account both of the distance and of the 
 reconciliation.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 I. That when he had withdrawn from his church as his spouse, and did 
 not comfort her, yet even then he had his eye upon it as his garden, 
 which he took care of 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:11"><I>v.</I> 11</A>):

 "<I>I went down into the garden of nuts,</I> or nutmegs, <I>to see the 
 fruits of the valley,</I> with complacency and concern, to see them as 
 my own." When he was out of sight he was no further off than the 
 garden, hid among the trees of the garden, in a low and dark valley; 
 but then he was observing <I>how the vine flourished,</I> that he might 
 do all that to it which was necessary to promote its flourishing, and 
 might delight himself in it as a man does in a fruitful garden. He went 
 to see whether <I>the pomegranates budded.</I> Christ observes the 
 first beginnings of the good work of grace in the soul and the early 
 buddings of devout affections and inclinations there, and is well 
 pleased with them, as we are with the blossoms of the spring.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 II. That yet he could not long content himself with this, but suddenly 
 felt a powerful, irresistible, inclination in his own bosom to return 
 to his church, as his spouse, being moved with her lamentations after 
 him, and her languishing desire towards him 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:12"><I>v.</I> 12</A>):

 "<I>Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of 
 Ammi-nadib;</I> I could not any longer keep at a distance; my 
 repentings were kindled together, and I presently resolved to fly back 
 to the arms of my love, my dove." Thus Joseph made himself strange to 
 his brethren, for a while, to chastise them for their former 
 unkindnesses, and make trial of their present temper, till he could no 
 longer refrain himself, but, <I>or ever he was aware,</I> burst out 
 into tears, and said, <I>I am Joseph,</I>

 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+45:1,3">Gen. xlv. 1, 3</A>.

 And now the spouse perceives, as David did 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ps+31:22">Ps. xxxi. 22</A>),

 that though she <I>said in her haste, I am cut off from before thy
 eyes,</I> yet, at the same time, he <I>heard the voice of her 
 supplications,</I> and became <I>like the chariots of Ammi-nadib,</I> 
 which were noted for their beauty and swiftness. <I>My soul put me into 
 the chariots of my willing people</I> (so some read it), "the chariots 
 of their faith, and hope, and love, their desires, and prayers, and 
 expectations, which they sent after me, to fetch me back, as chariots 
 of fire with horses of fire." Note,

 1. Christ's people are, and ought to be, a willing people. 

 2. If they continue seeking Christ and longing after him, even when he 
 seems to withdraw from them, he will graciously return to them in due 
 time, perhaps sooner than they think and with a pleasing surprise. No 
 chariots sent for Christ shall return empty. 

 3. All Christ's gracious returns to his people take rise from himself.
 It is not they, it is his own soul, that puts him into the chariots of 
 his people; for he is gracious because he will be gracious, and loves 
 his Israel because he would love them; not for their sakes, be it known 
 to them.</P>

 <P> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 III. That he, having returned to her, kindly courted her return to him, 
 notwithstanding the discouragements she laboured under. Let her not 
 despair of obtaining as much comfort as ever she had before this 
 distance happened, but take the comfort of the return of her beloved, 
 
 <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+6:13"><I>v.</I> 13</A>.
 
 Here,

 1. The church is called <I>Shulamite,</I> referring either to
 <I>Solomon,</I> the bridegroom in type, by whose name she is called, in 
 token of her relation to him and union with him (thus believers are 
 called <I>Christians</I> from <I>Christ</I>), or referring to 
 <I>Salem,</I> the place of her birth and residence, as the woman of 
 <I>Shunem</I> is called the <I>Shunamite.</I> Heaven is the Salem 
 whence the saints have their birth, and where they have their 
 citizenship; those that belong to Christ, and are bound for heaven, 
 shall be called <I>Shulamites.</I> 

 2. She is invited to return, and the invitation most earnestly pressed: 
 <I>Return, return;</I> and again, "<I>Return, return;</I> recover the 
 peace thou hast lost and forfeited; come back to thy former 
 composedness and cheerfulness of spirit." Note, Good Christians, after 
 they have had their comfort disturbed, are sometimes hard to be 
 pacified, and need to be earnestly persuaded to return again to their 
 rest. As revolting sinners have need to be called to again and again 
 (<I>Turn you, turn you, why will you die?</I>) so disquieted saints 
 have need to be called to again and again, <I>Turn you, turn you,</I> 
 why will you droop; <I>Why art thou cast down, O my soul?</I> 

 3. Having returned, she is desired to show her face: <I>That we may
 look upon thee.</I> Go no longer with they face covered like a mourner. 
 Let those that have made their peace with God <I>lift up their faces 
 without spot</I> 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Job+22:26">Job xxii. 26</A>);

 let them come boldly to his throne of grace. Christ is pleased with
 the cheerfulness and humble confidence of his people, and would have 
 them look pleasant. "Let us <I>look upon thee,</I> not I only, but the 
 holy angels, who rejoice in the consolation of saints as well as in the 
 conversion of sinners; not I only, but all the daughters." Christ and 
 believers are pleased with the beauty of the church.

 4. A short account is given of what is to be seen in her. The question
 is asked, <I>What will you see in the Shulamite?</I> And it is 
 answered, <I>As it were the company of two armies.</I> 

 (1.) Some think she gives this account of herself; she is shy of 
 appearing, unwilling to be looked upon, having, in her own account, no 
 form or comeliness. Alas! says she, <I>What will you see in the
 Shulamite?</I> nothing that is worth your looking upon, nothing but 
 <I>as it were the company of two armies</I> actually engaged, where 
 nothing is to be seen but blood and slaughter. The watchmen had smitten 
 her, and wounded her, and she carried in her face the marks of those 
 wounds, looked as if she had been fighting. She had said

 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=So+1:6"><I>ch.</I> i. 6</A>),
 
 <I>Look not upon me because I am black;</I> here she says, "Look not
 upon me because I am bloody." Or it may denote the constant struggle 
 that is between grace and corruption in the souls of believers; they 
 are in them <I>as two armies</I> continually skirmishing, which makes 
 her ashamed to show her face. 

 (2.) Others think her beloved gives the account of her. "I will tell 
 you what you shall <I>see in the Shulamite;</I> you shall see as noble 
 a sight as that of two armies, or two parts of the same army, drawn out 
 in rank and file; not only <I>as an army with banners,</I> but as 
 <I>two armies,</I> with a majesty double to what was before spoken; she 
 is as <I>Mahanaim,</I> as the two hosts which Jacob saw 
 
 (<A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=KJV&passage=Ge+32:1,2">Gen. xxxii. 1, 2</A>),
 
 a host of saints and a host of angels ministering to them; the church
 militant, the church triumphant." Behold <I>two armies;</I> in both the 
 church appears beautiful.</P>
